      "Microsoft Might Have Teased the Windows 12 UI\n",
      "By Adrianna Nine\n",
      "Oct 16, 2022\n",
      "It might feel as though Windows 11 just came out yesterday, but Microsoft is already hard at work on its operating system’s next iteration. At Friday’s Ignite 2022—Microsoft’s annual development and innovation conference—the tech giant briefly showed a never-before-seen Windows interface, and it’s thought to be Windows 12.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tease occurred during the Ignite Keynote, a kick-off address covering the conference’s central themes and priorities. During a cutaway involving Microsoft Teams, viewers got a brief glimpse of an unfamiliar desktop with a floating taskbar and system icons in the top right corner. Screenshots show a floating search bar at the top center of the screen and weather in the top left corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The design is a far cry from Windows 11, which maintains Microsoft’s static taskbar (where system icons are also tucked away) and leaves the top of the screen totally bare. Keynote viewers immediately caught the discrepancy and took to Twitter, where they pondered whether the interface had anything to do with Windows 12, which is expected to roll out sometime in 2024. Some even pointed out(Opens in a new window) that the interface echoes some core elements of the recurring macOS design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Windows Central senior editor Zac Bowden has seen a few of Microsoft’s experimental designs for Windows 12, and the interface spotted during the Ignite Conference looked a bit familiar. Microsoft is still figuring out what it wants to do with Windows 12 (which Bowden says is referred to as Next Valley internally), but there could be some confluence between the leaked design and those being tested behind closed doors. Better yet, according(Opens in a new window) to Bowden’s sources, the interface is “representative of the design goals that Microsoft is hoping to achieve with the next version of Windows.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Windows 11 keeps the taskbar anchored to the edge of the screen, with system icons and the time displayed in the bottom right. (Image: Microsoft)\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, it’s safe to assume the interface displayed at Ignite could have something to do with Windows 12, even if the final OS looks a bit different. But did Microsoft mean to offer fans such an early peek? Some “leaks” are intentional, as is widely suspected to be the case with the Xbox streaming device revealed last week. (After all, Microsoft gaming CEO Phil Spencer did the same thing(Opens in a new window) in 2020 with the Xbox Series S.) This could easily be the case with Windows 12. Ignite has been going on in some form since the 90s, garnering hundreds of thousands of views globally in recent years. It’s unlikely that the teams responsible for preparing Ignite materials would be so sloppy as to accidentally display a top-secret OS. Plus, Microsoft has some experience with controlled leaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intentional or otherwise, the teased interface gives viewers an idea of what they can expect from Microsoft in the coming years. Bowden’s sources say Microsoft is hoping to develop an OS more conducive to touch without sacrificing any part of the mouse-and-keyboard experience—a balance the company has struggled to find in the past. Not only does this have OS implications, but it might say something about Microsoft’s hardware goals too, especially as it continues to iterate on its two-in-one Surface device.\n",

      "Microsoft Surface Pro 9 vs Apple iPad Pro: which is better?\n",
      "By Chrystien Guyton\n",
      "Oct 16, 2022\n",
      "In the wake of Microsoft's 2022 Surface hardware reveal event, we now know what the next tablet in the tech titan's Surface product line will be: the Surface Pro 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got to enjoy some hands-on time with the new tablet and liked what we saw. The Surface Pro 9 will no doubt be securing a spot in our best Windows tablets rankings, and could even break into the overall best tablets list - something Microsoft has struggled to do in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there's some seriously stiff competition in the form of the iPad Pro, Apple's flagship tablet for professionals. It's sitting at the top of our best tablets guide, and it's going to take some serious work from Microsoft to unseat it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could the new Surface Pro 9 be the better tablet, though? Microsoft certainly seems confident, but with Black Friday swiftly approaching we could see some serious deals on the iPad Pro. The Surface Pro 9 launches on October 25 (or November 8 if you're in the UK), meaning that it's unlikely to see any significant price cut for this year's sales events.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we like to say, new tech is always exciting, but it's not always better. Is the Surface Pro 9 truly superior to the current iPad Pro, a device that is now more than a year old? Let's take a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surface Pro 9 vs iPad Pro: Price\n",
      "\n",
      "(Image credit: Future)\n",
      "\n",
      "Surface Pro 9 starts at $1,000 / £1,099 / AU$1,649\n",
      "\n",
      "iPad Pro starts at $799 / £749 / AU$1,199\n",
      "\n",
      "Keyboard and stylus for both sold separately\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us start by saying that neither of these are going to make it onto our best cheap tablets list. While on paper the starting price of the Apple iPad Pro makes it a clear winner in this category, it's worth noting that you're literally getting a whole lot less device for that $799 / £749 / AU$1,199 starting price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the Surface Pro 9, the iPad Pro is available in two sizes; the full-size 12.9-inch model and the cheaper 11-inch model. The larger version starts at $1,099 / £999 / AU$1,649, which actually makes it more expensive than the Surface Pro 9 in some markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally, the pricing fluctuates a lot once you start customizing the components, but the upper-tier models of these two tablets also sit close together in price at $2,399 / £2,149 / AU$3,549 for the top-spec iPad Pro and $2,599 / £2,599 / AU$4,149 for the most powerful Surface Pro 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Surface Pro 9 has a wider variety of models available; while every iPad Pro can be purchased with 5G support thanks to the Apple M1 chip that powers them, you'll need to buy a non-Intel version of the Surface Pro 9 that uses the new Microsoft SQ3 CPU if you want your Windows tablet to have 5G connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPad Pro has a greater variety of SSD sizes (ranging from 128GB to 2TB), while the Surface Pro 9 can be purchased with more RAM (up to 32GB against the iPad Pro's 16GB maximum).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, both the Surface Pro 9 and iPad Pro are best used with their accompanying keyboard cover and stylus; that's the Type Cover and Surface Slim Pen 2 from Microsoft, and the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil from - you guessed it - Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'd just like to take a moment to say that this sucks tremendously, especially since both manufacturers are keen to tout the laptop-aping capabilities of their respective tablets. There are no winners here, but there is a loser: the consumer.\n",

      "Surface Pro 9 has powerful 12th-gen Intel chips\n",
      "\n",
      "Pro 9 5G will feature the new Microsoft SQ3 processor\n",
      "\n",
      "iPad Pro rocks the excellent M1 chip, but less RAM in higher-spec models\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a somewhat difficult category to judge, since the iPad Pro and Surface Pro 9 use totally different operating systems. This means that we don't really have accurate performance figures for comparison purposes, but we'll work with what we do have.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, Windows 11 is almost indisputably a more versatile and powerful platform than iPadOS. That's not to rag on Apple's tablet OS, but it's just a fact: Windows allows for greater flexibility and a massively wider range of installable software.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of raw performance, the waters are a bit murkier. Most Surface Pro 9 models have been Evo-approved by Intel, meaning that they have a super-fast wake time and generally great performance in productivity workloads. There will be a lot more variation in performance between models, though - with three different potential chips (i5, i7, and SQ3) as well as a variety of RAM options, two Surface Pro 9s could give you very different results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPad Pro, on the other hand, has been using Apple's M1 chip since 2021, and it's a good 'un. The M1 means that both sizes of the iPad Pro should perform near-identically, with only a small amount of variation based on whether you opt for an 8GB or 16GB memory configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The closest we could get to realistic comparative numbers was some Geekbench 5 results, but even those are shaky. The M1 iPad Pro scores 1704 in the single-core test and 7207 in the multi-core test. Meanwhile, there aren't proper figures available from Geekbench on the chips found in the Surface Pro 9 on the Geekbench website, but the Core i7-12700K scored massively higher than the M1.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the i7-1255U chip found in the Surface Pro 9 is a mobile CPU that obviously won't perform on this level, and we have absolutely no clue how well the new Qualcomm-developed Microsoft SQ3 chip will perform either. We're still going to give the win here to the Surface, but only because it rocks a better OS - and the battery life is superior, too.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chassis design comes down to personal preference\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, which of these two products is 'better designed' is a subjective question; some will prefer the lightweight, compact design of the 11-inch iPad Pro, while others will favor the narrow screen bezels and variety of color schemes offered by the Surface Pro 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the interest of fairness, we'll primarily compare the 12.9-inch version of the iPad Pro to the exclusively 13-inch Surface tablet. Even with matching screen sizes, the iPad Pro is significantly thinner and lighter than its Microsoft rival; likely since the Surface still requires more internal cooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "We prefer the productivity-focused 3:2 aspect ratio of the Surface Pro 9 to the iPad Pro's 4:3; it makes the screen feel bigger, cramming in more text in a Google Doc or more pictures on a webpage. We recognize that this won't be the same for all users, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "The display panel itself is superior on the iPad Pro, however, with a massively higher contrast ratio and better maximum brightness. A lot of users won't notice or care, but digital artists and photo editors are better served by Apple's tablet screen. The iPad Pro also boasts better cameras, with a 12MP main lens compared to the Surface's 10MP - though both are capable of recording 4K video.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of physical ports, it's much the same; since the death of the Lightning connector, the iPad Pro uses the same USB-C port as the Surface Pro 9, though the latter does also have Thunderbolt 4 support and the Surface Connect slot if you want to charge the device while using the USB-C port.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, we do have to discuss the accessories. Microsoft's Type Cover keyboard for the Surface tablet line is generally pretty great, with its soft Alcantara fabric and magnetic charge slot for the Surface Slim Pen 2. However, that stylus just doesn't compare to the fantastic Apple Pencil - and with that deciding factor, this round goes to the iPad Pro.\n",

      "\n",
      "When deciding between these two tablets aspiring to be laptops, it's important to consider what your personal needs are. If you want a super-lightweight device that you can easily throw in a small bag and take everywhere with you, the 11-inch iPad Pro is the better choice. If you like the idea of a tablet that can double up as a laptop for work, the Surface Pro 9 is the one for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also comes down to familiarity. We fear what we don't understand, after all; if you own an iPhone, you shouldn't have any difficulty navigating the iPad Pro's software. If you're used to working on a Windows desktop PC, leaping into iPadOS could feel unbearably chaotic - the clean, familiar feel of Windows 11 on the Surface Pro 9 might be more your speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We love both of these devices, and it feels almost unfair to compare them when they both excel in completely different areas. We're certain you'll love them too - just be sure to choose the one that fits what you want from a tablet.\n",

      "Microsoft CEO: 'Software is ultimately the biggest deflationary force' for businesses\n",
      "By Daniel Howley\n",
      "Oct 16, 2022\n",
      "Runaway inflation and rising interest rates are driving economic turmoil worldwide. In this tough environment, Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella contends cloud technology can help companies \"do more\" with fewer resources than they once had.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Overall, we definitely see constraints in the macro environment that are leading to customers, and everyone essentially, asking the question of ‘How do we drive productivity?’” Nadella said during an interview for Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit, which will air on Monday, Oct. 17 from 9 a.m. EST to 5 p.m. EST. “When we think about software and technology, this is, in some sense, showtime for enabling any company to do more with less.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud computing, which gives companies remote access to hardware and services through the internet, has been on the rise for years. Microsoft controls 21% of the global cloud market, putting it behind only Amazon's (AMZN) 39% market share, but ahead of Google and its 7% market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business generated $38.9 billion of the company’s $125.8 billion in total revenue — or about 30%. The global pandemic supercharged the need for companies to deploy cloud platforms so they could operate without interruption. As a result, in 2021, Microsoft’s cloud revenue made up $60.1 billion of the company’s $168.1 billion in total revenue — nearly 36%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella speaks to Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cloud Migrations were super critical during the pandemic, even for resilience,” Nadella said. “And now, if you’re not on the cost frontier of the cloud, then you’re falling behind on productivity. If you’re not on the efficiency frontier of cloud native applications, you’re falling behind on productivity. If you’re not able to use the hybrid work infrastructure to bring everybody to be able to participate collaboratively in the organization, you’re falling behind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "'Software is ultimately the biggest deflationary force businesses can use'\n",
      "\n",
      "As companies look for ways to cut back, Nadella says the cloud could help them save cash. That would also help Microsoft’s bottom line if they turn to Nadella's company for those services.\n",
      "\n",
      "By signing up for cloud versions of software like Office, companies can save on spending large sums on individual software licenses for each employee. And by using Microsoft’s infrastructure-as-a-service offerings, companies can eliminate the need for their own on-premise hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All of the macroeconomic headwinds that all of us face — none of us are immune — the tailwind we at least as a company have is our ability to deliver these solutions. Software is ultimately the biggest deflationary force businesses can use,” he explained.\n",

      "Europe in particular stands to gain from the cloud, Nadella said. European countries are looking for ways to save on infrastructure as they contend with an energy crisis driven by the war in Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you move to the cloud, by definition, you have the most efficient use of the scarce energy resource,” he explained. “Second, let's take a manufacturing plant. If you create a digital twin of a manufacturing plant, one of the benefits is you can make it more power efficient, because you can do the simulation to do the power draw that's most efficient. In fact, you can reduce waste as well. So overall, things of that nature, I think are going to drive up productivity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft isn’t immune to the economic forces hitting its clients, which include chemical company Dow Inc. and Twitter. Nadella says the company is using its own products to improve overall efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are applying it ourselves inside. How can we be more efficient in whether it's in our people operations or in our R&D, or whether it's in our finance or our supply chain?\" Nadella said. \"So I think you will see us…take our own solutions and deploy them as efficiently as possible to drive productivity and leveraging operating expense and capital efficiency, capital efficiencies.”\n",
