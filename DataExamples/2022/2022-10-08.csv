Runners take on Abbott Chicago 5k ahead of Chicago Marathon

CHICAGO (CBS) -- It's marathon weekend in Chicago! And Saturday morning runners hit the streets for a little warmup taking part in the Abbott Chicago 5K in Grant Park.

About 8000 runners took part in the chilly race and for each runner who finished $2 will be donated to the American Diabetes Association.

The main event -- the Chicago Marathon -- takes place Sunday morning starting at 7:20. Then 40000 runners will participate.

Some of them got ready for the big race at McCormick Place Saturday even getting some last minute tips from fitness professionals.

The runners are coming from all over the country and the world. Around 100 countries will be represented at this year's marathon.

One of those runners is Lindsay Nathan. After getting injured around seven years ago she was told by doctors she would never be able to run again.

""It was really devastating but I actually had hamstring surgery. I spent eight months in physical therapy and all I was thinking about was getting to this moment"" she said. ""I am so excited. I am overwhelmed.""

Like many others Nathan is running to raise funds for a good cause. She is running for domestic violence awareness.

The marathon is expected to impact 29 neighborhoods with street closures and parking restrictions especially in the downtown area. This year also includes some course changes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raG91LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvZ292LWdyZWctYWJib3R0LWJldG8tb3JvdXJrZS1ob3VzdG9uLXRleGFzLWNhbXBhaWduLzI4NS1iZjY0NThmMC1hZDI2LTQ4OTAtYTlhYS04MmYzOGU1NTI4NzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov.

While corporate programmes that target working with diverse suppliers have faced a number of challenges this year the award is another example of the positive momentum behind efforts to foster a more diverse legal industry.

Presented by the UPS Legal Diversity Committee and its legal leadership team UPS’s scheme recognises law firms for their commitment to increasing diversity within the profession and for meeting UPS’s outside counsel diversity goals.

“At UPS we view our law firms as an extension of us and in that respect it is important that the firms we choose to partner with walk and talk the same values that we think are important” said Norman M Brothers Jr chief legal and compliance officer at the organisation. “Squire Patton Boggs has exemplified a steadfast commitment to maintaining a strong culture of diversity equity and inclusion which has led to material results. We commend everyone at the firm for its leadership in this important area.”

UPS is not the first company to create such a scheme. More and more corporates are accompanying their own internal diversity drives with high-profile programmes that encourage their suppliers and commercial partners to focus on hiring talent from a more diverse pool.

In 2019 Intel outlined its plans to work only with law firms that are “above average in terms of diversity”. That same year Facebook selected Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton as the inaugural recipient of its Law Firm Diversity Champion Award. The company’s selection process involved gathering diversity data from 40 of its largest spend law firms and then ranking them based on the results. Facebook and Kilpatrick have since continued to work together in a bid to facilitate faster change towards diversity and inclusion in the legal sector.

Last year Accenture also launched a scheme to honour its legal service providers for their efforts to create a culture of equality in their workplaces and communities. These efforts are “a key aspect of how Accenture chooses its legal partners” the company said. Earlier this year it announced the 2022 winners of its Outside Counsel Diversity Award. Five firms were recognised: Baker McKenzie Allen & Overy McDermott Will & Emery Osler Hoskin & Harcourt and Lewis Silkin. Julie Sweet chair and CEO of Accenture explained: “We work with legal partners that share our belief in the power of diversity – it is critical for innovation attracts the best people and makes us smarter. We are honored to recognize these five outstanding firms whose strong commitment to inclusion diversity and equity makes their work – and ours – the best it can be.”

However efforts to foster increased diversity through such programmes have not been without challenges. A number of organisations have come under fire for their law firm diversity requirements over the past two years.

In February 2021 Coca-Cola publicly detailed the diversity inclusion and belonging commitments that it would demand of law firms in its external network. Two months later those plans were paused before being shelved in April 2022.

One challenge that the policy faced came in the form of a missive from the American Civil Rights (ACR) Project on behalf of Coca-Cola investors. The letter demanded a retraction of the policy on the basis that it allegedly constituted illegal race discrimination barred by Section 1981 Title 42 of the US Code and other anti-discrimination laws. The ACR also sent similar messages around affirmative action schemes to McDonald’s Novartis and Starbucks.

The dispute with Starbucks has since continued. In July the company stated that it had “determined that it is not in the best interest of Starbucks to accept the demand [from the ACR] and retract the policies”. The ACR has subsequently initiated legal action to challenge a number of Starbucks policies including what it regards as those that “discriminate in its contracting” with suppliers.

The US multinational has not commented on the lawsuit. but was clearly keen to push ahead.

While McDonald’s also caught the ire of ACR it too has pushed on with programmes it previously announced. In 2020 for example the McDonald’s global legal department announced the inaugural winners of its EMPOWER Award . The award is designed to recognise McDonald’s legal service suppliers that actively demonstrate the role that diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) play in their organisations. The selection criteria includes the staffing of McDonald’s matters with diverse attorneys and a demonstration “of an innovative and genuine commitment to the recruitment hiring retention succession planning and promotion of diverse talent”.

In August 2022 the company announced this year’s winners in its inaugural Diversity Equity and Inclusion Report . (Riley Safer Holmes & Cancila and Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner were both celebrated for their commitment to DEI.

While some companies are facing resistance there is clear momentum behind the creation of corporate programmes that seek to encourage diverse workplaces outside the business’s own four walls. And that momentum will only build creating a ‘win-win’ for law firms and clients alike. Challenges to diversity programmes often grab headlines but light must also be shed on success stories and best practice.

At the time he was a 34-year-old Harvard graduate who quit a high-paying job to try building Sam Adams — a craft beer startup in an industry dominated by huge mostly foreign conglomerates — from his family's Boston kitchen. Today Koch is considered a pioneer of America's thriving craft beer scene. He's the founder and chairman of Sam Adams' parent Boston Beer Company which employs more than 2500 people and pulls in more than $2 billion in annual revenue. The company has far outpaced his initial vision of being a small regional craft brewer with just a handful of employees and around $1.2 million in annual revenue he says. Yet even now he's cautious to acknowledge success. ""Sam Adams is less than 1% of the U.S. beer business"" Koch 73 tells CNBC Make It. ""So the reality is after 38 years of being pretty successful we've basically gone from infinitesimal to tiny.""

Koch even says he might have been happier in the long run if Sam Adams had stayed small. In his current role he sometimes takes four flights per week — an exhausting amount of travel especially at age 73. ""It's a flip of the coin"" he told CNBC Make It last month saying each scenario would come with ""different blessings different curses."" Here Koch discusses the process of becoming a role model for the modern American craft brewing industry how he overcomes his shortcomings as a manager and the daily morning routine that helps him focus on what's ""important"" rather than what's ""urgent.""

On becoming the role model the craft beer movement needed to thrive: It 'felt like fate almost'

The blessing I've been able to have because of the success of Sam Adams is this feeling of having accomplished something meaningful and important. Steve Jobs put a ding in the universe. I put a tiny inverse concave pimple. Small as it is it's something. I got to help pioneer the craft beer revolution that changed the face of American brewing. I come from six generations of brewmasters. American brewing was utterly transformed by the craft beer revolution that Sam Adams helped start and has helped lead for 38 years. And to me that's just personally really cool. But the original business plan did not contemplate selling any meaningful volume outside of the Boston area. I thought it would be a little local brewery. There were no successful craft brewers in the United States. They were all very local scraping by and not getting traction. There was no role model at that point and there needed to be one. I was the only sixth-generation brewer in the United States. And to have this brewing background and the education to see and run with the opportunity felt like fate almost. So it was like: 'I have to take this ride to the end of the line. I gotta see where this goes.' And it was fun!

On learning to overcome shortcomings: 'I don't try to be a good manager'

I learned early on that I was not a good manager. I'm OK with that. There are people who are good managers. I am not one of them. I'm not really great at follow-up not that great at details. I'm not that organized. And I'm not a real respecter of ""process."" I don't try to be a good manager. I try to make sure that I've got a good manager as CEO. You could draw a two-by-two matrix. One axis is: ""How much value does this activity add to the company?"" And No. 2: ""How much can I contribute to it?"" I try to stay in the upper right box of things that add a lot of value to the company where I can make a meaningful difference. Luckily I can find enough of those at any given time to fully occupy as much time as I can devote. I still work 60-hour weeks. I spend a lot of time out of the office working in either the breweries or the markets. To me that's where the action is. That kind of direct contact with the retailers drinkers distributors and our own team is invaluable in making good fundamental decisions. Essentially that's my job — to make good decisions for the company — and I learned I can't do that sitting in an office. It's a lot easier to hire good managers than good leaders. My job is to be leading the company and you've got to lead from the front.

On his daily morning routine: 'The day is not over until I've done them and done them well'"

The 1949 adobe at 3139 Cliff Drive ($10.995 million) just past Hendry’s Beach is a very Santa Barbara house in a very Santa Barbara location. It was built much closer to the bluff’s edge than you would ever be allowed to now—as a result the water feels like it’s right outside the back door. And in a sense it is because a private shared path leads down to the beach. The interiors want to be updated although exhibitionists will delight in the window between the primary shower and the main back terrace.

················

Here’s something you don’t see every day: 6790 Rincon Road ($6.5 million) a 7.17-acre agricultural property in eastern Carpinteria with a striking one-bedroom one-bath house and a pair of 250-square-foot outbuildings all built in 2013. I wish the photos were scratch-and-sniff so we could really get a sense of the situation.

················

I hoped 4675 Via Huerto ($7.75 million) in Hope Ranch would be open for brokers yesterday because the property is hard to get one’s head around. There’s the 1948 main house; a “pool house with interesting wooden curved walls”; “a curious building both inside and out […] built in reminiscence of a Japanese tea room”; and a little building both interesting and curious that goes unmentioned in the listing. Without seeing the place in person I couldn’t say for sure but I suspect the price is mainly for the 4.23 acres of land.

················

If you’re the kind of person who counts your steps especially the amount you climb you’ll be right at home at 713 Via Airosa ($4.95 million) also in Hope Ranch. Stairs are everywhere: from the driveway down to the front door down into the bathtubs down to the guest rooms. And ladders too to reach the high shelves and racks in the library and primary closet. For all that the architecture has a sexy dignity and the 80s stylings could be updated to feel current—and the views offer a substantial payoff for all that legwork.

················

There’s a swaggy glamour in the midcentury lines of 1527 Crestline Drive ($2.395 million) but I think it wants a total redo despite it having been “extensively re-imagined” according to the listing. (The kitchen dining nook and laundry are dying to be merged.) The lot is bigger than it looks: beyond the pool a set of stairs leads down the hill to a flat area ripe for something—vegetable garden bocce court whatever. N.B. The seller paid $2.1 million in June.

················

And a few others worth checking out:

••• 981 Coyote Road ($795000): One-acre lot with conceptual design by Jeff Shelton (above).

••• 1396 Danielson Road ($2.5 million): Mostly renovated three-bedroom on the freeway; likely to end up as a vacation rental.

••• If you were curious about 491 Pimiento Lane ($10.75 million) which I wrote about two weeks ago there are now a lot more photos including interiors.

••• 819 Ashley Road ($14 million): The 1.92-acre vacant lot has languished on the market for years at $4 million to $5 million. Now you can pay $14 million and fund the construction of the house (below) which was designed by William Hefner.

Only a handful of companies have reached the trillion dollars in value mark but that number will likely grow in coming years. As I set out to find companies that could reach a trillion-dollar valuation I had a few requirements. The companies must have an extremely large addressable market must have an identifiable moat to build on and be growing and profitable today.

The three stocks that stood out to me are Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 4.86%) Disney (DIS -0.19%) and Adobe (ADBE 0.18%).

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing

There's one chip manufacturer that's more important than any other in the world today and that's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The company is a third-party manufacturer for chip leaders like Apple (AAPL -1.04%) Nvidia (NVDA 1.15%) and dozens of other companies designing their own chips.

Designing a great chip is great but someone has to make the chip and that's where Taiwan Semiconductor comes in.

You can see in the chart below that the company is now trading at just 13.2 times earnings and has grown revenue and net income 91.5% and 140.4% respectively in the last three years.

What's fascinating about the company's place in chip manufacturing is that there's no clear competitor at the bleeding edge of manufacturing. Intel (INTC 0.52%) is years behind GlobalFoundries (GFS -0.95%) is much smaller and AMD (AMD -0.34%) has a more integrated business model. For chip companies that don't own fabrication facilities Taiwan Semiconductor is still the go-to manufacturer if you're designing at the cutting edge.

Given the company's strong strategic position technology growth and profitability I think this could be the first of these companies to reach $1 trillion in value.

Disney

The last five years haven't been quite as smooth sailing at Disney. The company has seen cable connections decline streaming has been an enormous investment and the pandemic had a huge effect on both theaters and theme parks. But Disney is positioned for a decade of growth.

Disney now technically has more subscribers than Netflix (NFLX -0.70%) when you add together Disney+ ESPN+ and Hulu. So it's a leader in next-generation media distribution.

Investors haven't liked the money being spent on streaming but the payoff may be getting better very soon. Disney announced an advertising tier but instead of offering a lower-cost version of Disney+ with ads it is keeping the same $8 per month price but adding advertising increasing the price to $11 per month if you want no ads.

Disney's ability to create compelling content and then monetize it through what I call a waterfall of businesses -- from the theater to streaming to merchandise to theme parks -- is unmatched in media. The company needs to do well to reach a $1 trillion valuation by 2030 but I think it can get there.

Adobe

Adobe has long made valuable software for designers but it's now poised to become the operating system of the design and programming community if it can complete the acquisition of Figma.

You can see below that Adobe's business of licensing software to creators has been a growth machine over the last decade. But it's creating tools that people use to create assets not a platform they're using to collaborate on. That's why the acquisition of Figma is a big deal.

You can see above that Adobe currently trades for 28.5 times trailing earnings and Figma should help with future growth. But for Adobe to become a $1 trillion company it needs to lean into Figma's multi-user platform to become a real juggernaut. I think it can do that pulling not only graphic designers but programmers project managers and many more into the Figma ecosystem. Don't be surprised if products like Photoshop and Illustrator become add-ons to Figma not the other way around.

Now that Adobe has a potential platform solution the sky is the limit for the company's value. That's why I think this could be a $1 trillion company by the end of the decade.

Thinking big

There's no guarantee any of these companies will reach the heights of a $1 trillion company but they all have the foundation needed to get there. If management thinks big these stocks could be trading near the most valuable companies in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3Jjb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb25wcm9zLmNvbS9pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS9hcnRpY2xlLzIyNDU4NTQzL2RhbmRlbGlvbi1lbmVyZ3ktMy1yZWFzb25zLXRvLWNvbnNpZGVyLWdlb3RoZXJtYWwtaW4tY29uc3RydWN0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Reasons to Consider Geothermal in Construction,"The U.S. is experiencing a significant housing shortage. It’s estimated that the current housing stock shortfall approaches 4 million homes a 1.3 million increase since 2018.

Zillow’s most recent housing market report found that inventory is down 40 percent from pre-COVID levels. The online real estate marketplace expects new listings to move quickly many above the asking price. For builders buyers and the environment the repercussions of this moment will be widespread and far-reaching.

While price considerations and general availability are often top of mind this moment also presents an opportunity to rethink how we build homes. By outfitting millions of people with more efficient and effective energy sources than existing homes powered by natural gas heating fuel or other sources we can improve climate change outcomes while producing more valuable and efficient homes.

More specifically geothermal is the most efficient heating and cooling option for new construction and now is the best time ever for it to be specified. Here’s why.

Traditional Energy Use Has Climate Implications

When new home builders install natural gas infrastructure they are outfitting homes with greenhouse gas emitting appliances and temperature control systems with lifespans lasting two decades or more.

This has climate implications that builders can’t ignore. While more than a dozen U.S. cities have banned natural gas installations in new homes it remains the default energy source for many builders and buyers.

However when we equip homes with electric-powered appliances and heating and cooling solutions we are advancing sustainable climate change initiatives that are good for builders buyers and the environment. It’s a rare win-win-win in an industry often marked by compromise.

Notably many home buyers are placing a premium on more eco-friendly and cost-effective building methodologies recognizing that the climate change and long-term cost repercussions are in their favor.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy use and emissions by 30%-60% control humidity are sturdy and reliable and fit in a wide variety of homes.” As Ian Bogost wrote in The Atlantic “Getting a heat pump is one of the easiest ways for homeowners to fight climate change.”

Retrofitting existing homes with geothermal heat pumps can improve climate outcomes but new construction poses an unprecedented opportunity to rethink building norms in light of climate change realities.

Tax Credits Enhance Profitability & Future Planning

Federal tax incentives make geothermal a profitable home heating and cooling solution for new builds. We’ve seen this work before. Federal tax incentives made solar panels more affordable. The U.S. residential solar market is soaring where growing demand meets financial incentives that make a green transition feasible.

Today the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and federal residential solar energy credit allow homeowners to claim a 26 percent tax credit for systems installed in 2022 and a 22 percent dedication for systems installed in 2023.

What’s more with more companies coming online with design-build expertise it’s more feasible to determine the best ground loop placement with vertically integrated system designs. As more companies emerge production scale and product accessibility will further drive down costs.

At the same time developing localized integrations that optimize system sizes to account for local geology and other factors will further enhance future planning making geothermal more economical and impactful than ever.

When coupled with local tax incentives geothermal can enhance profitability while helping homeowners future-proof their homes with more sustainable energy solutions.

Geothermal Makes Homes Healthier

Geothermal heating and cooling improves indoor air quality creating healthier more sustainable homes. Notably burning natural gas produces pollutants that can contribute to or exacerbate respiratory illnesses.

As Josiah Kephart an environmental epidemiologist at Drexel University told NPR “When you have a gas stove that combustion is actually occurring right in your kitchen — you can see the blue flame down there. There is no smoke-free combustion.” This is true for furnace appliances as well which more frequently and ferociously pollute in-home air quality.

In contrast heat pumps are quiet and they don’t produce flames fumes or odors. For a generation of living environment and eco-conscious buyers this can be a differentiating upsell that reduces overall construction costs but enhances the buyer experience and builder profitability.

Simply put geothermal presents an opportunity to make new homes healthier for decades improving lives without compromising functionality.

A Change Worth Making

As construction professionals make decisions today about the materials and processes that will impact new home construction methodologies their choices have implications that will reverberate for years to come.

Geothermal heating and cooling is just one way that builders can improve outcomes for their bottom-line and potential buyers but it’s a meaningful change worth considering today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXd5b3JrbGF0aW5jdWx0dXJlLmNvbS9uZXcteW9yay1waGlsaGFybW9uaWMtb3lhLXJlb3BlbnMtZGF2aWQtZ2VmZmVuLWhhbGwtd2l0aC1icmF6aWxpYW4tY29tcG9zZXItbWFyY29zLWJhbHRlcnMtd29yay1vbi10aGUteW9ydWJhLW9yaXNoYS1vZi1yZWJpcnRoL9IBqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXd5b3JrbGF0aW5jdWx0dXJlLmNvbS9uZXcteW9yay1waGlsaGFybW9uaWMtb3lhLXJlb3BlbnMtZGF2aWQtZ2VmZmVuLWhhbGwtd2l0aC1icmF6aWxpYW4tY29tcG9zZXItbWFyY29zLWJhbHRlcnMtd29yay1vbi10aGUteW9ydWJhLW9yaXNoYS1vZi1yZWJpcnRoLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Philharmonic “Oyá” Reopens David Geffen Hall with Brazilian Composer Marcos Balter’s Work on the Yoruba Orisha of Rebirth,"The New York Philharmonic opens the new David Geffen Hall with New York Brazilian composer Marcos Balter’s sound and light composition “Oyá” about the Yoruba orisha of Rebirth.

Marcos Balter

Marcos Balter is a Brazilian composer so Oyá comes to him through the beautiful Afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé. That’s the root of Brazilian Samba Brazilian Carnival and Uruguayan Milonga which later became Argentine Tango.

He’s the Fritz Reiner Professor of Musical Composition at Columbia University. For the last twenty years he’s been working on compositions about the Yoruba Orishas the helpers of the one God Olodumare (just like many other religions).

He told Eve Glasberg of the “Colombia News” that he wanted Orisha Oyá “to baptize and claim this new concert hall to radically wash it clean from its history and to inundate it with forward-looking energy.”

We can’t think of anyone better for this purpose than her. Maferefún Oyá (God Bless). ¡Ashe! (good spiritual energy like Amen)."

AMD Nvidia Corp Intel Corp Qualcomm Inc and Micron Technology Inc were down between 1.2 per cent and 6.0 per cent weighing on smaller peers such as Marvell Technology Inc and Applied Materials Inc.

Samsung the world’s top maker of memory chips smartphones and televisions is a bellwether for global consumer demand and its disappointing preliminary results add to a flurry of earnings downgrades and gloomy forecasts.

The chip sector has been grappling with weak demand spurred by decades-high inflation and rising interest rates hitting the PC and smartphone market as businesses and consumers rein in expenses.

Nearly a dozen analysts cut their price targets on AMD’s shares by as much as USD50 after the United States (US)-based chipmaker slashed its third-quarter revenue outlook by about a billion dollars.

“We believe AMD’s warning will have the most negative read-across for PC peer Intel but also somewhat for Nvidia and related memory and data centre peers” BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said.

Memory chip buyers such as smartphone and PC makers are holding off on new purchases and using up existing inventory leading to lower shipments and ushering in an industry downcycle.

“We still think the industry is heading for its deepest downcycle in a decade thanks to high supply chain inventories and falling end demand” Jefferies analysts said.

Global chip sales grew just 0.1 per cent in August making it the 15th month of a downcycle since June 2021 when sales rose more than 30 per cent according to Jefferies.

By Stephen Nellis Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper

(Reuters) -The Biden administration published a sweeping set of export controls on Friday including a measure to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment vastly expanding its reach in its bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances.

The rules some of which take immediate effect build on restrictions sent in letters this year to top toolmakers KLA Corp Lam Research Corp and Applied Materials Inc effectively requiring them to halt shipments of equipment to wholly Chinese-owned factories producing advanced logic chips.

The raft of measures could amount to the biggest shift in U.S. policy toward shipping technology to China since the 1990s. If effective they could hobble China's chip manufacturing industry by forcing American and foreign companies that use U.S. technology to cut off support for some of China's leading factories and chip designers.

""This will set the Chinese back years"" said Jim Lewis a technology and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) a Washington D.C.-based think tank who said the policies harken back to the tough regulations of the height of the Cold War.

""China isn't going to give up on chipmaking ... but this will really slow them (down).""

In a briefing with reporters on Thursday previewing the rules senior government officials said many of the measures were aimed at preventing foreign firms from selling advanced chips to China or supplying Chinese firms with tools to make their own advanced chips. They conceded however that they had not secured any promises that allied nations would implement similar measures and that discussions with those nations are ongoing.

""We recognize that the unilateral controls we're putting into place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don't join us"" one official said. ""And we risk harming U.S. technology leadership if foreign competitors are not subject to similar controls.""

The expansion of U.S. powers to control exports to China of chips made with U.S. tools is based on a broadening of the so-called foreign direct product rule. It was previously expanded to give the U.S. government authority to control exports of chips made overseas to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and later to stop the flow of semiconductors to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday the Biden administration applied the expanded restrictions to China's IFLYTEK Dahua Technology and Megvii Technology companies added to the entity list in 2019 over allegations they aided Beijing in the suppression of its Uyghur minority group.

The rules published on Friday also block shipments of a broad array of chips for use in Chinese supercomputing systems. The rules define a supercomputer as any system with more than 100 petaflops of computing power within a floor space of 6400 square feet a definition that two industry sources said could also hit some commercial data centers at Chinese tech giants.

Eric Sayers a defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute said the move reflects a new bid by the Biden administration to contain China's advances instead of simply seeking to level the playing field.

""The scope of the rule and potential impacts are quite stunning but the devil will of course be in the details of implementation"" he added.

Companies around the world began to wrestle with the latest U.S. action with shares of semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers falling.

The Semiconductor Industry Association which represents chipmakers said it was studying the regulations and urged the United States to ""implement the rules in a targeted way - and in collaboration with international partners - to help level the playing field.""

Earlier on Friday the United States added China's top memory chipmaker YMTC and 30 other Chinese entities to a list of companies that U.S. officials cannot inspect ratcheting up tensions with Beijing and starting a 60 day-clock that could trigger much tougher penalties.

Companies are added to the unverified list when U.S. authorities cannot complete on-site visits to determine if they can be trusted to receive sensitive U.S. technology forcing U.S. suppliers to take greater care when shipping to them.

Under a new policy announced on Friday if a government prevents U.S. officials from conducting site checks at companies placed on the unverified list U.S. authorities will start the process for adding them to the entity list after 60 days.

Entity listing YMTC would escalate already-rising tensions with Beijing and force its U.S. suppliers to seek difficult-to-obtain licenses from the U.S. government before shipping them even the most low-tech items.

The new regulations will also severely restrict export of U.S. equipment to Chinese memory chip makers and formalize letters sent to Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) restricting shipments to China of chips used in supercomputing systems that nations around the world rely on to develop nuclear weapons and other military technologies.

Reuters was first to report key details of the new curbs on memory chip makers including a reprieve for foreign companies operating in China and the moves to broaden restrictions on shipments to China of technologies from KLA Lam Applied Materials Nvidia and AMD.

South Korea's industry ministry said in a statement on Saturday there would be no significant disruption to equipment supply for Samsung and SK Hynix's existing chip production in China.

However it was necessary to minimise uncertainty through consultation with U.S. export control authorities it added.

On Saturday China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called the move an abuse of trade measures designed to reinforce the United States' ""technological hegemony"".

Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Owns These 31 Dividend Aristocrats,"Buffett has positions in more Dividend Aristocrats than Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings reveal.

Warren Buffett loves dividends. His beloved Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.51%) (BRK.B 0.48%) owns quite a few dividend stocks. Three of them have track records of at least 25 years of dividend increases.

But you might be surprised about how many members of dividend royalty the legendary investor really owns. Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds 31 Dividend Aristocrats.

Like Baskin-Robbins

Just what is Buffett's ""secret portfolio""? In 1995 investment firm New England Asset Management (NEAM) was acquired by General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re). Three years later Berkshire bought Gen Re. NEAM doesn't hide its equity holdings; it reports them on a regular basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However these stocks are often overlooked by Buffett's followers even though they are owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

When it comes to Dividend Aristocrats these ""secret"" Buffett stocks are like Baskin-Robbins ice cream: They come in 31 flavors. Below are all 31 of the Dividend Aristocrats in NEAM's portfolio:

Company Sector Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 3M Industrials 64 Abbott Laboratories Healthcare 50 AbbVie Healthcare 50 Air Products & Chemicals Materials 40 Automatic Data Processing Information Technology 47 Becton Dickinson Healthcare 50 Chevron CVX 0.05% ) Energy 35 Church & Dwight Consumer Staples 26 Coca-Cola Consumer Staples 60 Emerson Electric Industrials 65 ExxonMobil Energy 39 General Dynamics Industrials 25 Illinois Tool Works Industrials 58 International Business Machines Information Technology 28 Johnson & Johnson Healthcare 60 Kimberly-Clark Consumer Staples 50 Linde Materials 29 Lowe's Consumer Discretionary 48 McCormick Consumer Staples 36 McDonald's Consumer Discretionary 45 Medtronic Healthcare 45 NextEra Energy Utilities 28 PepsiCo Consumer Staples 50 PPG Industries Materials 50 Procter & Gamble Consumer Staples 66 Realty Income Real Estate 28 S&P Global Financials 49 Sysco Consumer Staples 53 Target Consumer Discretionary 50 VF Corp. Consumer Discretionary 48 Walmart Consumer Staples 49

Several of the stocks on the list belong to an even more exclusive club than the Dividend Aristocrats -- the Dividend Kings. These stocks have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.

Biggest bets

Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds relatively small positions in most of these 31 Dividend Aristocrats. Chevron though stands out as a notable exception. As of the end of the second quarter of 2022 NEAM owned more than 2.15 million shares of the oil and gas giant.

Chevron also ranks as one of Berkshire's biggest bets. It's now the third-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and has performed well so far this year.

NEAM doesn't have huge stakes in any of the other Dividend Aristocrats. The next two after Chevron are AbbVie and Procter & Gamble. At the end of Q2 NEAM owned 75345 and 71551 shares of these two stocks respectively.

Best of the bunch

It isn't easy to pick the best of these Dividend Aristocrats. I think that Chevron is one of the stocks directly owned by Berkshire Hathaway that is also in NEAM's portfolio that's most likely to soar in the fourth quarter. My reasoning is that oil prices will move higher and provide a catalyst for the top energy stocks.

There are also some unstoppable trends that could benefit a few stocks on this list. For example an aging population should drive increased demand for products developed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The shift to clean energy should work to Air Products' advantage as it produces blue and green hydrogen.

Many of these stocks will probably be big winners over the next decade and beyond though. The power of growing dividends to boost total returns is no secret at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9taWNyb2JlLWZlcnRpbGl6ZXItc3RhcnR1cHMtbG9vay10by1leHBhbmQtaW93YS1mYXJtcy84MDg2MDE2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hot microbe fertilizer startups look to expand but does product work?,"Investors have flocked to companies selling microbes as an alternative to traditional fertilizer putting in $1 billion last year

Pivot Bio with an office in Ames reported that it tripled its acres covered from 2021 to 2022

The products could be good for the environment. They're also appealing amid high synthetic fertilizer prices

Independent research is limited troubling some soil scientists

AMES – In a cornfield at the Iowa State University Research Park white placards stand every couple of yards.

“Pivot Bio” the first one reads. “Applied Nitrogen Rate 200 Lbs/Acre.”

""160 lbs"" reads the next sign.

""0 Lbs"" reads a third.

The numbers represent the amount of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applied to each part of the field according to researchers at Pivot Bio a deep-pocketed startup that aims to upend the crop nutrient business.

The company which started in California and opened an Ames office last summer offers farmers a new source for nitrogen a key nutrient for corn. Nitrogen use has exploded over the last 60 years as farmers have supplied more synthetic fertilizer. The practice drives Iowa's expanding production of food animal feed ethanol starch and other commodity derivatives.

Excess nitrogen fertilizer however creates hazards in the air and water. Prices have also skyrocketed over the last two years squeezing farm profit margins.

Pivot Bio has offered a solution: billions of miniscule gene-edited microbes that cling to a plant's roots pull nitrogen from the air and convert the nutrient to a form the crop can absorb. The company's executives say the product allows farmers to cut back on the amount of synthetic fertilizer they apply to a field without losing yield.

When the product launched in 2018 Pivot Bio told customers they could cut back synthetic nitrogen by 25 pounds an acre. This year company leaders said they had improved gene editing of the microbes enough that farmers could cut back 40 pounds an acre. Eventually the company hopes that farmers won't have to apply nitrogen fertilizer at all.

The pitch has appealed to many farmers because of rising fertilizer costs. Natural gas is the main ingredient in ammonia and urea fertilizers. Driven in part by a drop in the European supply of natural gas the nitrogen fertilizer diammonium phosphate cost $954 a metric ton this April more than triple the $282 two years ago according to Bloomberg News. Other nitrogen fertilizers have followed the same trend.

Spread over a 360-acre farm the price swing since 2020 could cost a farmer an extra $18000. Pivot Bio promises to cut into that pain.

“It’s simple math” spokesperson Tracy Willits said at the company's field outside the research park on a warm September afternoon.

Funding surge marketing blitz for microbe maker

Pivot Bio and other microbial fertilizer companies have won investors’ attention raising $1 billion last year according to the venture capital research firm AgFunder. Established fertilizer players like Nutrien Ltd. and Bayer AG are researching microbial options as well.

Among the startups Pivot Bio is the vanguard perhaps the hottest product in ag innovation next to automated tractors. Since starting in 2011 the company has raised $617 million including a $420 million round last summer with backing from Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures Bunge Ltd.’s venture capital arm and Temasek Holdings Ltd. Singapore’s state investment firm.

Pivot Bio has engaged in a marketing blitz in recent years. The company posts frequent Facebook and Twitter ads. It's a sponsor of agriculture podcasts and web shows and the athletics programs at Iowa State University and the University of Iowa. U.S. Rep Randy Feenstra and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley both Iowa Republicans promoted Pivot Bio in August during the annual Farm Progress Show in Boone.

Willits said Pivot Bio received $50 million in revenue this year and was planted on 3 million acres triple its reported footprint in 2021. The company sold out of product “well before planting season"" this year Willits said.

At the beginning of September Pivot Bio promoted a new iteration that farmers can apply directly to seed instead of spraying it into furrows. Willits declined to say how much the company expects its sales to grow this season. But Pivot Bio executives want to increase the number of independent dealers selling their products to 1800 from 1000.

“The farmer demand is intense” Willits said. “And the curiosity about what we’re doing and the value we can deliver to them is quite high. What that says to us is farmers are ready and want more options.”

Yet some outside experts say microbial fertilizers aren’t backed by much independent research. They say Pivot Bio has recently taken to requiring professors to sign nondisclosure agreements that give the company oversight of any published data.

Willits said the nondisclosure agreements are necessary to ""ensure that our product is managed consistently and stewarded according to label directions resulting in high quality data."" She said the company has partnered with 15 universities since 2019 with new study results on the way ""in the coming months.""

“The most critical thing is that we develop relationships with growers and that we prove our ability to perform on their farm” said Pat Yockey a Pivot Bio commercial agronomist. “If we do well we’ll continue to see demand.”

Synthetic fertilizer costly not just in price but also to the environment

Any crop whether it’s corn or tobacco or pears reflects the nutrients it absorbs.

In the 19th century European researchers realized that nitrogen played a particularly important role. But while they could find plenty of nitrogen in the air natural nitrogen in a form that plants could consume was relatively rare spread through animal waste human waste and crop residue.

German scientist Fritz Haber discovered a solution while doing research for the chemical company BASF in 1909. He applied extreme heat and pressure to natural gas and air breaking up tightly bound atoms and joining together hydrogen and nitrogen. The process created ammonium a form of nitrogen that plants could absorb.

German scientist Carl Bosch a BASF employee figured out how to expand Haber's method to an industrial scale. The method became known as the Haber-Bosch process and both men went on to win Nobel Prizes in chemistry.

The process created synthetic nitrogen fertilizer which boosted crop yields. Also U.S. and European militaries used the process to make bombs.

In the years after World War II according to “Enriching the Earth” by Vaclav Smil companies turned U.S. munitions plants into synthetic fertilizer factories. The product helped usher in the “Green Revolution” of the 1960s when food production accelerated.

The popularity of synthetic fertilizer however also came with a steep environmental cost. The manufacturing process emits carbon dioxide. When farmers spread too much synthetic nitrogen — as they often do to assure a strong yield — the crops can’t absorb all the nutrients. Excess nitrogen remains in the soil. Some microbes consume the nitrogen and emit nitrous oxide into the air.

Nitrous oxide has 265 times as much global warming potential as carbon dioxide based on how long the compound remains in the atmosphere and its ability to reflect heat. Researchers at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy Greenpeace and GRAIN concluded last year that the synthetic fertilizer industry warms the planet about 38% more than the commercial aviation business.

Kristie Boering an earth sciences professor at the University of California Berkeley estimates that the amount of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere increased 5% from 1900 to 1960. From then until 2021 the amount increased 13% ― more than double over the same period. Boering said the rise of synthetic fertilizer explains the difference.

In addition to polluting the air excess nitrogen in the soil is picked up by water that leaches into wells and rivers. The runoff has reached the Gulf of Mexico and created a “dead zone” an area surrounding the mouth of the Mississippi River where algae blooms fueled by excess nutrients suck the oxygen from the water.

“Something’s got to give” said Bill Brady CEO of Boston-based Kula Bio another microbe startup that closed a $50 million funding round in January. “We need the food. But there’s no way we can continue to pollute like that.”

Can microbes transform the fertilizer market?

Companies like Pivot Bio and Kula Bio claim their products can solve the problem. Pivot's microbes “fixate” nitrogen meaning they pull the nutrient from the air and convert it into a form that plants can use. Essentially the tiny bugs are clean fertilizer factories.

The company's scientists edit the microbes' genes to behave the way some already do around legumes like soybeans. Microbes will bind to the roots of those plants. The plants feed the microbes. The microbes in turn give the plants nitrogen.

The microbes don't naturally provide nitrogen to the roots of cereals like rice corn and wheat. Pivot Bio says genetic information tells the microbes not to convert air into nitrogen when they are already surrounded by the nutrient in the soil. Pivot Bio's scientists have changed that gene.

David Kanter vice chair of the International Nitrogen Initiative said decreasing the nutrient's use is as important to staving off the effects of global warming as curtailing car and aircraft emissions. But unlike in Europe he said U.S. regulations around agriculture rarely involve mandates. Policymakers instead rely on incentives to make eco-friendly practices more profitable.

If Pivot Bio can provide a cheaper alternative to nitrogen fertilizers it will have the same incentive effect.

“If (Pivot Bio is) successful it would essentially transform the nitrogen input market” said Kanter who is on the company's advisory board. “Nitrogen in the end would essentially be a supplement instead of being a baseload on the plant.”

Farmers weigh whether data justifies switching products

On his Audubon farm James Nelson was tempted to try Pivot Bio the last three years. But his planter isn't equipped to spray the liquid product into furrows.

With the company now offering a version that puts the microbes directly on seeds Nelson said he will buy the product before next year’s planting season. He plans to try Pivot on a small portion of his farm and cut back his nitrogen fertilizer application to 130 pounds an acre from his usual 170 pounds.

He said Pivot Bio’s advertisements about saving on fertilizer have appealed to him. He is paying about 73 cents a pound for nitrogen this year up from 32 cents two years ago.

More:Gov. Kim Reynolds has controlled $2.7 billion in federal COVID-19 aid. Here's how she's spending it.

His dealer offered to sell him Pivot Bio’s product for $24 an acre about $5.30 an acre less than what he pays for fertilizer. With corn selling for $6.75 a bushel the deal would work for Nelson only if the product doesn’t cost him any yield.

He is skeptical.

“The more I look at it the more I think ‘Why bother?’” he said over the phone in early October taking a break from running his combine in a soybean field. “But I’m still curious.”

According to Pivot Bio company researchers examined the effect of its product on 2400 fields this year. The company said it compared the weight of the biomass and the chlorophyl concentration in the leaves of Pivot Bio-treated corn to those of similar untreated corn. The company said that despite using less nitrogen fertilizer the Pivot Bio-treated corn had 14% more nitrogen in it ― a sign that the plants were healthier.

Aaron Erb a farmer and seed dealer in Wellman said his yields with Pivot are consistent even though he's cut his use of nitrogen. He said Pivot Bio’s research has swayed many of his customers.

“The data is finally enough I suppose to trust it and change their farms over” he said.

Willits the company spokesperson said Pivot Bio has research projects in the pipeline with the University of Georgia Iowa State University and Purdue University. Ecology professor Steven Hall who is conducting the Iowa State research declined to say what he's found so far telling the Des Moines Register that his study is still pending.

University researcher: 'My God. What are you people thinking about?'

Other researchers are dubious. Dave Franzen a North Dakota State University Extension soil specialist said he tried to study Pivot Bio this year after receiving a grant in April. At that point he said dealers told him they were sold out of the product.

He said the company offered to give him the product if he signed a nondisclosure agreement which he declined to do. He is studying two other company's products instead. He said he is “troubled” by Pivot Bio’s popularity among farmers.

“My God” he said. “What are you people thinking about? I’m a scientist. I look at data. I’m not wowed by marketing. But a lot of people are.”

University of Minnesota nutrient management professor Daniel Kaiser meanwhile said he managed to conduct independent research on Pivot Bio in six studies from 2019 to 2021. He said he studied the product without a nondisclosure agreement.

Kaiser criticized the framing around much of Pivot Bio’s advertising. He said he doesn’t believe the product necessarily works even if the crop yield remains stable while farmers decrease their nitrogen fertilizer use. Farmers often overapply fertilizer he said. They may cut back and still see stable yields without Pivot Bio.

To measure the product's performance Kaiser compared fields with much less fertilizer per acre than what a farmer would normally use. In control fields he used only nitrogen fertilizer. In other fields he used Pivot's product and a reduced amount of fertilizer.

In his six studies he concluded that yield increased with Pivot just one time.

“Getting consistency out of it is the main issue” Kaiser said. “It’s kind of in stark contrast to what the company will claim.”

He didn’t study Pivot in 2022 though he wants to return to the product. At the same time he said his contact at Pivot told him this year that the company was changing some practices and that it was no longer engaging with outside research.

“I’d like to be able to see if I can replicate (the positive results) and figure it out” Kaiser said. “There might be specific circumstances where it works. … I don’t know where this is going to go.”

Part of the solution: '23andMe for soil'

In a southeast Ames laboratory white-coated employees pull cups of soil from sacks and drop them into pinky-sized tubes. The tubes are also filled with tiny beaters. The employees place a tray of tubes into a machine.

The machine shakes the trays. Inside each tube the beaters go to work cracking open the cells of the billions of microbes embedded in the soil.

Employees move the tubes to a centrifuge which whirls the tubes in loops like a stomach-churning carnival ride. The dirt sinks to the bottom of the tube. The delicate strands of the microbial DNA float to the top.

Employees clean the DNA and place it in a sequencer a machine that looks like a printer and provides genetic information about the billions of microbes in the samples.

The process unfolds at Trace Genomics a startup that aims to be an important cog in the microbe fertilizer business. The company which started in 2016 describes itself as “23andMe for Soil” a resource for farmers who want to know the genetic profiles of the microbes in their fields.

Not all microbes behave the same said Pat Dumstorff the product lead for Trace Genomics. Knowing what kinds are in different parts of a field will help farmers better understand how much fertilizer to apply.

The company works with agronomists and offers detailed prescriptions. Trace Genomics currently analyzes the DNA of microbes that deliver phosphorous to plants. Dumstorff said the feedback helps farmers decide how much phosphorous fertilizer to buy.

He said the company hopes to offer a similar analysis for nitrogen but the microbes that provide it are more complicated. The company needs more time to learn how to deliver accurate feedback.

“Phosphorous is like checkers” he said. “Nitrogen is like chess.”

The company has managed to capitalize on the recent wave of microbial fertilizers though. Trace Genomics began consulting with businesses researching microbial products last fall.

The company operates a greenhouse at its Ames site where Trace Genomics researchers plant crops with different proposed products. The researchers check the level of nutrients reaching the crops over time.

With efficacy difficult to discern will bad actors emerge?

Verdesian Life Sciences a North Carolina company receives feedback from Trace Genomics about its pending phosphorous product.

Before farmers apply fertilizer plenty of phosphorous already exists in the soil said Kuide Qin Verdesian’s chief science officer. But most of the phosphorous isn’t in a form that plants can consume. The company is experimenting with microbes that are supposed to transform the phosphorous making it consumable by the plants.

The theory is good Qin said. Execution is difficult.

A former scientist for Dow Chemical and Bayer Qin said he is used to researching chemicals like pesticides. Those products generally work in all conditions. If they failed Qin knew within a couple days.

But microbes work more slowly he said. Farmers often don’t know if a product has lived up to a company’s claims until they see the yield at harvest. Microbes don’t work in all conditions either.

They perform their tasks for different lengths of time. They work best at specific stages. They thrive in different environments.

“It’s hard to figure out the efficacy of the product” Qin said.

Prasanna Kankanala the soil science manager at Trace Genomics said the hype surrounding microbial fertilizers concerns her.

Successful products could forever clean up farming. But their appeal ― and optimistic investors' deep pockets ― have the potential to attract bad actors.

She said government agencies don't regulate product purity enough meaning different microbial fertilizers can perform differently with similar advertised ingredients. Businesses can mislead farmers she said. (Pivot Bio follows labeling guidance from the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials and receives authorization from state agencies before selling commercially in a jurisdiction Willits said.)

Researchers say the field is fertile for ""snake oil."" Kankanala worries the excitement around microbes will fade if early commercial versions don't work.

""The grower will never trust the product"" she said. ""And the word of mouth is going to spread like wildfire.”

""I went home and told my parents we were no longer allowed to eat at fast food restaurants"" said Young.

It was 1989 just two years after an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol was signed and there was growing awareness of the dangers some products posed to the ozone layer compromising its ability to shield us from cancer-causing UV radiation.

Aerosols in hairspray and deodorant along with chemicals in refrigerators and air conditioners were some other culprits.

Thirty-five years later the Montreal Protocol has started to heal the ozone layer although experts say it will take decades longer to restore it.

Today Young uses it as an example with her own students as an associate professor of atmospheric chemistry at York University in Toronto.

For her students ""it tends to make them I think more optimistic that we could do better for other environmental issues going forward the fact that we've been so successful in the past.""

WATCH | International agreement on ozone reached in 1987: Ozone agreement reached in 1987 Montreal Protocol Duration 2:20 Science correspondent Eve Savory reports from Montreal on Sept. 16 1987 the day the groundbreaking international agreement to regulate ozone-depleting chemicals was signed.

The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted on September 16 1987 and would eventually set the course for the world to stop manufacturing and using chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

It included the ability to adjust the agreement according to new evidence and science and has averted greenhouse gas emissions offering lessons for international climate action today.

Getting to international agreement required more than just firm scientific consensus to prompt industry and governments to act.

First the science

In 1974 two scientists Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina published a paper arguing that chemicals from aerosols were reaching the stratosphere and eating away at ozone. While their work eventually won them the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1995  it was not enough to catalyze governments around the world into action.

That happened when the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic was discovered in the mid-1980s.

A group of countries met in Vienna in 1985 to discuss the issue but established they needed more conclusive evidence.

While Rowland and Molina had identified chemicals damaging the ozone layer how that was happening was not entirely clear. Scientist Susan Solomon would help solidify the picture of what was happening.

She hypothesized that CFCs were reacting on icy polar stratospheric clouds which formed at very cold temperatures creating the ozone hole above the Antarctic.

Susan Solomon photographed at a research station in the Antarctic in the mid-1980s. (Submitted by Susan Solomon)

Addressing her theory in a scientific meeting ""people laughed"" she said.

""I didn't let it worry me because I just was pretty confident that we had the right answer and [it] turned out we did.""

She moved ahead and in 1986 working for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration led a team of researchers to the Antarctic to conduct field experiments and successfully verified her theory.

Making things personal

As member countries of the United Nations met in Montreal in September 1987 chemist Bob Watson then with NASA's jet propulsion laboratory was in Chile leading an experiment to see if he would get the same results as Solomon and her team.

After about a half dozen flights it was clear to Watson that Solomon was correct. Without a doubt ""we humans were destroying the ozone layer"" he said.

He knew that science alone was not enough in itself to effect change.

""There's no point having all this good science information if you can't explain it to the public and if you can't explain it to politicians and equally important convince the private sector they've got a problem"" said Watson who has co-chaired international committees on ozone and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The striking satellite images shown on the evening news combined with increased risk of getting skin cancer if ozone depletion continued made it easy for people to care.

Even before the Montreal Protocol individuals were taking action following campaigns to swap out deodorant from aerosol spray cans to roll-on styles for example.

""I can remember get on the stick to save the ozone layer"" said Solomon.

She describes a few factors that encourage people to act on environmental problems – what she calls the ""three Ps.""

""It needs to be personal perceptible and you need to have practical solutions"" she said.

When it comes to climate change co-ordinated international action has been harder to achieve despite scientific consensus but Solomon thinks those ""three Ps"" are coming into focus.

The impacts of global warming might have seemed far off to people in North America for many years but increased intensity of heat waves forest fires and floods have made it both personal and perceptible she said.

""When those conditions are met then you'll have citizen engagement.""

Now the solutions – renewable energy to replace fossil fuels – are getting cheaper and therefore more ""practical"" she said.

According to the International Energy Agency in most cases it's cheaper to invest in onshore wind or solar panels than it is to make a new fossil fuel power plant.

What On Earth 25:51 What working together to save the ozone layer tells us about climate action today What On Earth producer Molly Segal takes a look back in time when the world agreed to phase out chemicals that were eating away at the Earth's protective ozone layer.

Getting industry to switch

When the Montreal Protocol was signed it set up a system for CFCs to be gradually phased out and replaced by other chemicals.

""That sent what I like to call a policy-forcing signal to the industry that was huge"" said Solomon.

Setting clear rules about reducing the production of CFCs the protocol nudged companies to start making replacement chemicals.

While there was some resistance ultimately it was clear to companies they would need to adjust. What made that easier said Solomon was the same companies that had to stop manufacturing CFCs for say coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners could still profit by making the alternatives.

""To be honest the private sector was probably more on board on the ozone issue than the climate issue"" said Watson.

Bob Watson conducted experiments on ozone depletion in Chile in 1987 as international discussions were underway in Montreal. (Submitted by Bob Watson)

He said with entire sectors dedicated to extraction of fossil fuels power generation from fossil fuels and their use in transportation and agriculture it's more challenging to get industry on board compared to regulating a segment of the chemical industry.

What's at stake financially for fossil fuel companies is much greater than it was for the chemical industry when the Montreal Protocol was signed said Solomon.

""The companies that produce fossil fuels have massive reasons to stand pat. They own mineral resources that are worth trillions of dollars"" she said.

Paris vs. Montreal

Although experts estimate the ozone layer's recovery is slow continuing at least into the middle of the century ""the Montreal Protocol is widely regarded as one of the most successful international agreements ever"" said Young.

According to the United Nations Environment Program the protocol is the only UN treaty to date that's been ratified in all UN member states .

As a legally binding agreement it has ""very explicit goals"" of reducing certain chemicals and by what amount over what period of time said Bob Watson.

Internationally governments have struggled when it comes to climate change.

The 1997 Kyoto Protocol on climate change was only signed by industrialized countries and while it did have ""explicit reductions of greenhouse gases on the industrialized world"" said Watson many countries ""ignored it.""

After years with no new agreements getting countries to sign on to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change was a relative success. However it leaves that power of setting emissions reductions goals – called nationally determined contributions – up to individual countries.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signs the Paris Agreement on climate change on April 22 2016 at United Nations headquarters in New York. (Mary Altaffer The Associated Press)

If Watson had his way the Paris Agreement would have also placed binding targets on every country with more obligations on industrialized countries.

But he laments: ""There was zero chance and I mean zero chance it could ever have been negotiated.""

The Montreal Protocol focused on equity to get other countries on board — making wealthier countries with a bigger CFC contribution responsible for supporting less wealthy countries by paying the difference for substitute chemicals.

Montreal Protocol today

A peer-reviewed paper estimates the protocol might prevent between 1.2 and 2.7 C of extra warming by 2100 . The paper's author Paul Young said in an email this warming would have been caused by more UV light damaging plants' ability to store carbon and continued pollution from CFCs left in production

Part of the success of the Montreal Protocol has been its ability to adapt to new science. As countries reduced the use of CFCs a new family of chemicals called hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs) were subbed in. It turned out both CFCs and HFCs were contributing to another growing environmental problem: climate change.

The 2016 Kigali Amendment phased out HFCs and the efforts to lower the impacts of air conditioning refrigeration insulation and other products is not over said Pam Chasek executive editor of the International Institute for Sustainable Development.

When member countries meet again in Montreal on Oct. 31 they will discuss how the protocol can evolve to promote energy efficiency and alternatives like heat pumps for cooling while also phasing out HFCs ""especially in developing countries"" wrote Chasek in an email.

This would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in two ways: using less energy and phasing out HFCs altogether.

For atmospheric chemist Cora Young who researches the environmental impacts of replacement chemicals the protocol has made ""huge strides in terms of climate protection.""

""That effect will continue and continue on into the future ultimately preventing multiple degrees of warming of our planet.""",,,,,,

Some of the top travel destinations like Amsterdam London New York and Los Angeles gets the brunt of much of the criticism for the sheer size of their operations. In fact New York reportedly now has more Airbnb locations than actual apartments for rent! That’s insane.

The theory is that Airbnb — and other short-term rental companies like VRBO and HomeAway — are converting long-term rentals that would have housed local residents and families and putting them up on the short-term rental market for visitors thus further decreasing an already short supply of housing.

Some data suggests that this change in the renter’s market can potentially be costing renters thousands of dollars as a result of price pressure. Essentially there are less rentals available therefore the ones that do become available have inflated prices. Supply and demand that is drastically hurting the local residents’ pockets.

It’s a tricky knot to untangle though because there are a lot of factors at play in the market. Outside of New York and its insane imbalance of rentals the rise in local prices as a direct cause of Airbnb seems to hover around only one percentage point. It is known though that converting long-term rentals to short-term rentals shrinks a housing market already experiencing historic shortages. But how much companies like Airbnb directly cause a rise in housing prices is hard to measure.

What is clear is that as discontent grows and cities start to take action we may see a shift in the short-term rental landscape over the next few years. Many cities have already passed restrictions against the short-term rental market ranging from near-total-bans to limits on how long a property can be rented to limits on how many people can get licenses to open an Airbnb. I would expect these kinds of restrictions to continue to get even tighter in the coming years.

User Casper (@_spookytooth) uploaded the clip where she gives a quick glimpse to her 238000 followers about her experience with an Airbnb listing.

“When Airbnb tells you to check out immediately and don’t tell the host” the overlay text on the video reads. In the clip Casper is seen stuffing her clothes in a suitcase before racing down the stairs with a man. The camera then cuts to her putting the luggage in the backseat of a car and waving “goodbye” to the castle-like building.

The video racked up 4 million views since it was posted on Oct. 7 with many users bashing Airbnb as a homestay option.

“You know where this never happens to me? Hilton. Holiday Inn. Hell even Motel 6 has never run me out” one viewer stated.

“This why i just stay at hotels. and they make the bed for u” a second said.

“Hmmm if only if there were safe places you could stay while on vacation. Maybe like a hotel? And not a sketchy place” another wrote.

In the comments section other people shared their experiences with Airbnbs.

“I got canceled on last minute by the homeowner bc she was going through divorce and her husband won the house lol” one person shared.

“I had a Airbnb that was so cute. I was so excited for and then our trip was canceled last minute bc the host was kicked off the platform for violating privacy and community guidelines and other inappropriate stuff the described vaguely” a second user shared. “A real one was looking out for us.”

“Stayed somewhere similar (old style castle) and had the same experience we were outta there in 10 min flat” another recounted.

“I had an issues with false advertising with an Airbnb we stayed at. We rushed out when it hit 11am (cancellation). It was hectic” a user wrote.

The user still has not provided an update at the time of publishing despite hundreds of users requesting one but one top comment gave a possible reason as to why Airbnb would ask the guests to leave the premises on such short notice.

‘It was probably a airbnb they were running without approval or something” they wrote.

That’ll be £17600 a night,"Hundreds of Liverpool hotels have sold out after the city was announced as the host of Eurovision 2023 with remaining accommodation being advertised for thousands of pounds a night.

On Saturday morning less than 12 hours after the decision was revealed the UK’s biggest hotel-booking websites were almost entirely out of places to stay.

Booking.com said that 99% of hotels were fully booked on 13 May the night of the final but presented three results in the city centre for those seeking accommodation for two adults: the Aachen Hotel for £695 Eleanor Rigby apartments on Stanley Street for £4500 or Sgt Peppers Mathew Street Apartments for £4700.

Fans willing to stay slightly further out have the choice of paying £2750 for a “budget triple room” at the Kensington Guest House Liverpool. To stay in a comparable room this weekend would cost £35 according to Booking.com.

On Airbnb meanwhile one optimistic local is offering his home for £15000 on the night of the final – or £17600 including cleaning and service fees. The listing says it sleeps up to 10 people and offers amenities including a hairdryer shampoo shower gel bed sheets toilet paper and extra pillows.

Another property described as a “Modern and Stylish 3 Bedroom House in Anfield” was yesterday being advertised on Airbnb for £11733 including free parking.

All of the sites had accommodation available on the night of the final for under £100 in Manchester and Southport both of which are around an hour away from Liverpool on public transport.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2023 will be held at the Liverpool Arena on Saturday 13 May with the semi-finals and other events taking place at the same venue earlier in the week.

The news that Liverpool had beaten Glasgow to host the competition was broken on the BBC’s One Show on Friday night by Graham Norton. Twenty UK cities had originally put themselves forward as hosts before the entrants were whittled down to the final two by the BBC and the European Broadcasting Union which organises the contest.

Eurovision is usually hosted in the country of the previous year’s winner but the 2022 winner Ukraine was unable to accept the offer due to the ongoing war.

The UK was chosen instead because Sam Ryder was runner up with his song Space Man.

The event is expected to give a significant boost to Liverpool’s economy with director of culture Claire McColgan saying that a predicted impact of £30m was an underestimate for the city where tourism makes up 47% of the economy. She said things had been “quite bleak” for many small businesses but that the knowledge that Liverpool will be “packed out probably for a month either side of Eurovision” was a “light at the end of the tunnel”.

Bill Addy chief executive of Liverpool Business Improvement District company told the PA News Agency that many in the city were waking up with hangovers on Saturday after celebrating the news. “This is such a significant boost not just the city centre but the whole region” he said.

The contest will be paid for by a combination of local and national government funding as well as by broadcasters. More than 160 million people are expected to watch it on TV."

Or follow us on Google News

A recent headline regarding Toyota and a clever response to it caught my attention. The headline: “Toyota president calls meeting California zero-emissions requirements ‘difficult’.” The response from our friend Nikhil Chaudhary: “‘difficult for Toyota’.” It was a clever way to correct the headline and it highlights the key point superbly: Meeting California’s zero-emissions requirements isn’t difficult for all automakers or even for most automakers. It’s difficult for Toyota because Toyota has become a top laggard in the transition to electric vehicles.

'difficult for Toyota' — Nikhil Chaudhary (@NCBirbhan) September 30 2022

California recently passed legislation that commits the state which is by itself one of the biggest economies in the world and one of the biggest auto markets in the world to 100% electric vehicle sales by 2035.

Regarding this commitment Toyota President Akio Toyoda said to reporters last week as translated “Realistically speaking it seems rather difficult to really achieve [it].” We’re talking about 2035. That’s 13 years away.

In August 22% of new vehicle sales in China the largest car market in the world were fully electric (30% had a plug). That’s August 2022 not August 2035. China notably modeled its EV policies in large part on California’s. (A few years ago I talked with a Chinese-American professor at a California university who was a top advisor to the Chinese government on this.)

In the same month August 2022 13% of new vehicle sales in Europe were fully electric (21% had a plug). The UK is up to 17% of new vehicle sales being fully electric (22% having a plug). Norway is up to 77.7% of new vehicle sales being fully electric (89.1% having a plug).

Looking globally 11% of new vehicle sales are fully electric vehicles sales and 15% have a plug. In August 2022.

If Toyoda truly thinks Toyota can’t go fully electric in California by 2035 then he’s lost. Whether he truly believes that or not though his recent statement indicates that Toyota just can’t keep up. It has been failing in regards to the EV transition and Toyoda thus wants to slow the whole industry down.

I’m wrapping up our 3rd quarter U.S. EV sales report. More than 200000 fully electric vehicles were sold in the United States in the 3rd quarter. Guess how many fully electric Toyotas were sold here. Zero.

Yup zero.

I’m also working on our quarterly U.S. auto industry sales report (see the previous one here). Toyota’s U.S. auto sales were down by 26419 vehicles (5%) in the 3rd quarter of 2022 versus the 3rd quarter of 2021. Compared to the 3rd quarter of pre-pandemic 2019 Toyota’s sales were down by 94885 units (17%). In those same periods of time fully electric Tesla saw its sales grow by 32000 (32%) and 82367 (169%).

Toyota became the top selling automaker in the United States in 2021 dethroning GM for the first time since 1931 (the first time any other company was #1 — Toyota of course was never #1 in the USA before 2021). “I actually did a little ‘happy dance’ in my office” Toyoda said. “Thankfully nobody saw it!” Toyoda may be celebrating that it shrunk less than GM lately but Toyota’s party time may not last long if it’s going to stick to this stubborn path of EV resistance. (Notably GM now plans to go fully electric by 2035.)

Toyota still has plenty of influence. It reportedly was a key entity blocking the Build Back Better bill and watering down some portions of the EV tax credits made available through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. But its commitment to fighting EV progress is not going to fare it well in the long run.

Naturally these statements from Akio Toyoda are not entirely surprising. Toyota has been vocal about its desire to slow down the EV transition for years and it has marketed misleading “self-charging electric cars” (hybrids) while discouraging people from buying true electric cars. The company or at least its leadership don’t believe in a battery-electric vehicle future. While much of the industry had pivoted and was starting to seriously pursue a battery-electric vehicle future Toyota was hyping and introducing the Toyota Mirai a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle that is the epitome of impracticality inefficiency and a non-bright future. (Toyota sold 7 units of the Mirai in the United States in September and 1437 in the first 9 months of the year as a whole.)

There’s no doubt about it: Toyota is a giant automaker. In fact it was the top selling automaker in the world in 2021 not just in the USA. It has influence and it’s not losing customers so quickly that panic can seem logical right now — even as it is a massive laggard in the EV transition that’s well underway globally. Akio Toyoda can convince himself that all of the talk of 100% electric vehicle sales by 2030 or 2035 or even 2040 is fanciful and will never come to pass. That talk has been going on for a decade and look at where Toyota stands today. However the trends seem clear to me the benefits of electric vehicles are clear and the decision by several automakers to be fully electric by 2030 or 2035 are out in the open. A company could get away with dragging its feet for the past decade — there are no auto company bankruptcies that have ensued from slow development of EVs. But for the next decade? Can you be a laggard in the EV industry in the next decade and grow? Can you be a laggard in the EV industry in the next decade and survive? It seems that Toyota is intent on finding out and Toyoda seems convinced that his company will do well to slow-walk this transition and bet on much more reliance on fossil fueled vehicles in the years to come.

All of this is not to say Toyota is doing nothing. The company recently increased its planned investment in a US EV battery factory from $1.3 billion to $3.8 billion. Furthermore the company plans to sell 3.5 million fully electric vehicles a year by 2030. That’s a lot. It’s just that it’s not quite 35% of Toyota’s 2021 sales. That’s far away from the 100% requirement California has for 2035. Also heck it’s barely more than the percentages we’re seeing in China and Europe. Good luck Toyota.

Cats and kittens chattered in their carriers as the dogs bounded out pausing for a quick bathroom break and a photo session upon their Thursday afternoon arrival.

Two dogs and three kittens rescued from Hurricane Ian arrived in the morning from Florida. It was an unusually large intake for CASPCA which usually brings in around 10 animals at a time. Most of those rescues are local.

Rescue manager Tori Cunningham started work at 7:30 a.m. to bring the pets from Richmond where they’d been flown to from Puerto Rico to Charlottesville.

Cunningham spent an hour and a half on the Richmond International Airport tarmac sorting through the animals to get the pets that had been assigned to Charlottesville. She and other shelter staff then drove another hour and a half back to town.

“I’ll be here until it all gets done” Cunningham said. “It” requires getting all of the rescues through their intake exams and hopefully on to foster homes.

Cunningham has helped coordinate rescues for the shelter for two years but this rescue stood out to her.

“They desperately needed to move animals so it’s special in the sense that we were able to step up and take some” she said.

She isn’t alone in her commitment to the dogs and cats.

“It’s really important that we are there to support shelters nationwide when they find themselves in this type of crisis. I hope that if we’re ever in that situation we’ll be able to rely on others to support us” said CASPCA CEO Angie Gunter.

Bringing animals in however means needing to let some animals out. The shelter needs foster homes and families for some current residents in order to accommodate the animals it already has plus the hurricane refugee pets.

“We couldn’t say no to helping these animals in need but we desperately need help from the community in order to make space for them” Gunter said. “Fostering even for a very short amount of time can be extremely beneficial to the animal and rewarding for the foster parent as well.”

Living in a foster home gives a pet a break from a sometimes-stressful shelter environment. It’s a way to get a cat or a dog to show off their personality when they’ve already experienced trauma.

What the SPCA especially needs Gunter said are foster families and forever families for its adult dogs and pups that weigh more than 30 pounds.

“We usually have a waitlist for smaller adult dogs and puppies” she said. “We’re really having a hard time lining people up for large adult dogs.”

The hurricane rescues are likely to be adopted out quickly once they become available in a few weeks Gunter said.

That’s what happened with the dozens of Envigo beagles CASPCA rescued over the summer. Large adult dogs that have been at the shelter longer may have a little more trouble.

To help CASPCA accommodate its animals potential fosters need to live within a 90-minute drive of the shelter.

CASPCA provides all necessary supplies and food at no cost to foster families maintains an emergency call line that connects fosters with a staff member at any hour of the day and has an on-site clinic for veterinary needs.

First-time fosters can sign up online at the Charlottesville-Albemarle SPCA website.

The shelter is also open for walk-in foster appointments from noon to 6 p.m. daily.

The reason? Willams is a Jehovah's Witness.

""We're Jehovah's Witnesses so we don't do that"" the tennis superstar told reporters at the U.S. Open press conference.

According to the official website for Jehovah's Witnesses followers of the church don't believe in celebrating birthdays ""because we believe that such celebrations displease God.""

""Although the Bible does not explicitly forbid celebrating birthdays it does help us to reason on key features of these events and understand God's view of them"" the website said. One of the reasons for Jehovah's Witnesses to avoid birthdays is they believe the celebrations have pagan roots.

Though Williams doesn't often speak about her faith she has opened up about it on rare occasions.

According to the Jehovah's Witnesses website the religion is a form of Christianity that follows both the Old and New Testament of the Bible. Jehovah's Witnesses see Jesus as the son of God and savior but they do not believe he's the ""Almighty God.""

Further members of the faith do not believe that a soul survives death and subsequently do not adhere to the Christian idea of Hell as mentioned on the site.

Other practices include not voting and remaining politically neutral. Additionally Jehovah's Witnesses believe blood is sacred and thus do not get blood transfusions.

Much like birthdays it's also advised that Jehovah's Witnesses refrain from religious holidays and U.S. holiday celebrations — including Christmas Easter Valentine's Day and Halloween.

It is also recommended that Jehovah's Witnesses do not attend the weddings of those of other religions (though Williams and husband Alexis Ohanian were present at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's nuptials at St. George's Chapel in Windsor in May 2018).

Williams and her siblings — including fellow tennis star Venus Williams — converted in the early '80s according to The Washington Post after their mother Oracene Price.

In 2015 the outlet reported that Williams previously said she attends church and has participated in the required evangelizing door-to-door as part of her faith.

As The Washington Post noted Williams has often thanked the Jehovah God after her matches.

There have been times though where her faith has both faltered and bolstered her.

According to The New York Times after a profanity-laden outburst against a U.S. Open line judge in 2009 — during which the woman claimed the athlete threatened her — Williams had to face elder witnesses.

""They had to have a talk with me"" Williams told the outlet in 2012. ""And I knew it was coming. I just felt really bad though because it's like that's not who I am.""

She continued ""They just talk to you. They show you Scriptures. Not ministers; they call them elders. It's almost like a reprimand but it's not bad because in the Bible it says God loves you and if someone reprimands you they love you.""

Years prior — when her sister Yetunde Price was murdered in 2003 — Williams also leaned on scripture attending three Jehovah's Witnesses meetings a week she told the Times in 2007. ""I tried to develop a better relationship with God"" she said.

As her career ramped up over the years — and she married Alexis Ohanian and welcomed their daughter in 2017 — Williams alluded to taking a step back and returning to her faith.

The anticipation of her 2022 tour comes as no surprise with the incredible success she has had thus far.

I had the opportunity to be in the building at her Atlanta GA tour stop this was by far the best concerts I have ever attended truly an unforgettable experience from start to finish! From the incredible light show and choreography to the floating Moon/Ferrari and stage design that allowed her fans an up-close experience of her show. Celebrity stylist Kris Shelby was in attendance with me not too familiar with Karol G’s music (with his primary language being English) became an instant fan! She performed her biggest hits like Provenza Bichota Tusa Culpables Ahora Me Llama Gatubela and many others. This show takes you on a journey through love heartbreak and empowerment with an incredibly raw and honest approach. Karol G opens up to her fans about her journey throughout the show the ups and downs the creative inspiration behind some of her biggest hits and holds a dance-off for two lucky fans where the winner takes home $1000 in cash. The “Strip Love Tour” is a must-see!

Is It a Buy?,"Here's why investors should consider adding C3.ai to their portfolios.

What do Amazon Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet have in common? They all have market valuations of more than $1 trillion.

But there's another thing. They all have a partnership with a small artificial intelligence (AI) company called C3.ai (AI -1.81%).

C3.ai is a leader in enterprise AI an industry it helped to create. The company develops ready-made and customizable AI solutions for hundreds of companies across different industries which can materially accelerate their adoption of advanced technology. The stock is trading at a very attractive price right now after declining 93% from its all-time high. Here's why investors should consider buying in.

C3.ai has world-class partners and customers

Cloud-computing technology is key to businesses that operate online in any capacity and the three leading providers of cloud services happen to be Amazon Web Services (AWS) Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. These platforms offer hundreds of tools to their customers that can speed up business operations and the ability to build artificial intelligence models is one of them.

AI is capable of completing mundane tasks in a fraction of the time humans can especially when they involve large volumes of data so it makes sense businesses are clamoring to integrate the technology. That's where C3.ai comes in. Integrating its platform with AWS for example can allow an AWS customer to build an AI application 26 times faster than just building it on AWS alone. C3.ai can reduce the need to write code by about 99% which is where much of the time savings comes from.

Recognizing the value this creates cloud providers are partnering with C3.ai to accelerate the adoption of AI in their customers' businesses. Both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are using C3.ai technology to improve their cloud services. The partnership with Azure in particular has netted at least $200 million in joint deals so far including the acquisition of 16 new customers in the fiscal 2023 first quarter (ended July 31).

In total C3.ai now has 228 customers across multiple industries from technology to manufacturing to oil and gas. The fossil fuel industry may not be one investors associate with advanced tech like AI but oil giant Shell is using C3.ai to monitor over 13000 pieces of equipment to improve safety reduce emissions and predict failures that could otherwise lead to significant environmental disasters.

C3.ai is growing steadily with plenty of potential

In fiscal 2022 (ended April 30) C3.ai generated $252.8 million in revenue up 38% year over year. The company anticipates a much smaller increase of 1% to 7% during fiscal 2023 because of the unfavorable economic climate which is pushing businesses to cut costs.

But in the fiscal first quarter C3.ai grew its remaining performance obligations (RPOs) 58% to $458.2 million. Since RPOs are generally expected to convert into revenue in the future it's a sign that any slowdown in sales might only be temporary. Plus the company anticipates its addressable market opportunity could be as high as $596 billion by 2025 so it has a long runway for growth ahead.

C3.ai isn't profitable just yet having lost $71.9 million during the quarter. That's a key reason its stock has suffered as investors have shunned loss-making companies this year. But it has a strong balance sheet with over $900 million in cash equivalents and short-term investments which means it has plenty of dry powder to invest in growth and innovation.

C3.ai stock is cheap right now

After falling 93% from its all-time high C3.ai's market valuation sits at just $1.37 billion right now. Keep in mind the company's cash balance of over $900 million because it means investors are only valuing the actual business in the neighborhood of $500 million.

Considering the company's outstanding RPOs alone and without factoring in its mammoth future potential or its partnerships with industry giants that's a rock-bottom valuation. Plus according to a report by McKinsey & Company artificial intelligence could add $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030 as up to 70% of organizations deploy the technology in one way or another.

C3.ai is a first mover in the enterprise-AI space so it deserves far more credit and the steep discount in its stock price is a fantastic opportunity to buy for the long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2xldHRlcnMvMjAyMi0xMC0wOS93aWxsLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtMTUtZ2V0LXVzYi1jLXBvcnQtd2lsbC1hcHBsZS1hYXBsLXJlbGVhc2UtYS13aXJlbGVzcy1pcGhvbmUtbDkxZWR0eHTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the iPhone 15 Get USB-C Port?

Or follow us on Google News

In a lengthy interview with Bloomberg News republished by Autoblog George Hotz the serial entrepreneur who founded self-driving startup Comma.ai has this to say about autonomous cars: “It’s a scam. These companies have squandered tens of billions of dollars.” In 2018 analysts put the market value of Waymo LLC then a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. at $175 billion. Its most recent funding round gave the company an estimated valuation of $30 billion.

The definitive book on the effort to bring autonomous cars to market is Autonomy written by Lawrence Burns who headed the early efforts by Google to develop the technology. It’s a fascinating tale filled with multiple twists and turns as the team struggled to find the answer to cars that drive themselves.

But despite all the money thrown at the problem by Google Uber Tesla Zoox Cruise and countless others autonomous cars are no closer to reality today than they were 5 years ago and many of those companies are running for the exits looking to cut their losses if they can.

Anthony Levandowski was part of the team at Google headed by Lawrence Burns. For a decade he was one of the brightest stars in the field of autonomous driving before he disgraced himself by suddenly quitting his job at Waymo and jumping to Uber. What followed was a giant lawsuit between Waymo and Uber and several convictions for stealing trade secrets for Levandowski. Ultimately he was pardoned by Donald Trump at the urging of Peter Thiel. Now he’s running a startup that is developing autonomous trucks for industrial sites. Levandowski says for the foreseeable future that’s about as much complexity as any driverless vehicle will be able to handle. “You’d be hard pressed to find another industry that’s invested so many dollars in R&D and that has delivered so little. Forget about profits — what’s the combined revenue of all the robo-taxi robo-truck robo-whatever companies? Is it a million dollars? Maybe. I think it’s more like zero.”

Tesla of course has played a big role in the self-driving world first with its Autopilot technology and later with something it bills as “Full Self Driving” a now $15000 add-on that our own Fritz Hasler says is not worth the money even in its latest iteration that was just released by Tesla. The company has done a number of zigs and zags of its own over the years publicly breaking with Mobileye and its camera-based system to embrace radar. Now it has transitioned away from radar and gone back to emphasizing cameras again. The only thing it won’t do is use lidar because CEO Musk sees it as unnecessary and costly. He probably also doesn’t want his car crapped up with ugly bumps and bubbles and who can blame him? Teslas are blessed with timeless designs thanks to Franz Von Holzhausen. Adding lidar would ruin their appearance.

A favorite industry myth is that humans are terrible drivers but it’s not even close to true says Bloomberg. Throw a top-of-the-line robot at any difficult driving task and you’ll be lucky if the robot lasts a few seconds before crapping out. “Humans are really really good drivers — absurdly good” George Hotz says.

Fatal accidents are largely caused by reckless behavior — speeding drunks texters and people who fall asleep at the wheel. Although most of the accidents reported by self-driving cars have been minor the data suggests that autonomous cars have been involved in accidents more frequently than cars driven by humans with rear-end collisions being especially common. “The problem is that there isn’t any test to know if a driverless car is safe to operate” says Ramsey an analyst at Gartner a market research firm. “It’s mostly just anecdotal.”

Connected Cars May Be The Answer

Much of the hype and hoopla about autonomous cars is focused on how they will make driving safer. There’s no question that people kill themselves and others at an alarming rate while driving. The World Health Organization says about 1.3 million people die from traffic-related injuries each year. And yet if you study that last paragraph the primary causes of road deaths are factors that impair the ability of drivers to do what they usually do quite well — excessive speed intoxication texting or falling asleep at the wheel.

According to the New York Times there is a new technology coming available that could address many of those human failings. It is called C-V2X which stands for cellular vehicle–to–everything technology. It allows vehicles to communicate with each other and with the surrounding environment which could reduce collisions considerably.

With V2X technology a car whose sensors or cameras detect a pothole in the roadway will be able to notify their drivers giving them time to take evasive maneuvers. Highway workers will be alerted to an oncoming vehicle that’s traveling too close to them. School bus drivers will be warned against letting children off if a vehicle fails to stop. Bicyclists and drivers will be made aware of each other before possible collisions.

“While passive safety such as seat belts and active safety from such things as lane departure warning has improved occupant safety fatalities outside the vehicle are growing” said Anupam Malhotra senior director of connected services for Audi of America. “We’re now working to provide cooperative safety sharing safety-related information with others.”

Audi is working with bicycle and equipment manufacturers to offer V2X transponders for cyclists and expects to begin offering V2X in its 2025 model year vehicles. “We’re currently including V2X in the development of our vehicle architecture as we can’t wait and we need to be ready” said Mark Dahncke Audi of America’s director of product communications. Ford is working on something similar.

Connected cars will use LTE cellular technology to communicate with each other directly. Eventually the system will switch to 5G standards allowing for faster communication. Pedestrians bicyclists highway workers and emergency vehicles will all be able to be part of the communication network. Best of all the technology is expected to be inexpensive costing manufacturers much less than lidar sensors and mobile supercomputers that autonomous cars rely on.

The Takeaway

V2X systems hold great promise but the focus needs to be on getting drunks texters and speeders off the road. The ability to detect someone who is inebriated or drug-impaired exists today but is not used. Manufacturers insist it is hard to make it work accurately and yet they expect us to believe they can make a car that will drive from LA to New York City and park itself without human intervention? Come on. Stop taking us for idiots and get it done.

Same with texting. iPhones now know when we are driving and disable themselves until they can be used safely. Speeding is something that all modern cars can control. Some may whine that they don’t want nanny cars but driving on public roads is a privilege not a right. If you want to speed join a motorsports facility that offers track days. Otherwise understand that when you use a public street public safety takes precedence over your dream of being a NASCAR driver.

How simple would it be to have a system that immobilizes a car unless a licensed driver is at the wheel? People without a license or a suspended license have no business driving. Period. Freedom does not imply the ability to maim or kill other human beings. Do whatever you wish on your own personal private property but if you expect society to build public roads public safety is more important than personal liberty.

There are so many ways driving can be made safer and it doesn’t require massive investments or hugely expensive options to make safe driving a reality. The dream of autonomous cars is an illusion at least for the foreseeable future. It works in limited cases on known routes that don’t involve left turns against traffic. Let’s deal with the possible not the fanciful.

Highway deaths are a clear and present danger but those who want to fix the problem with autonomous driving systems are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. The solutions are right under our noses. Let’s use them to end the carnage on our streets and highways.

After looking at the best cheap micro-cap and mid-cap stocks out there let’s turn our attention to cheap blue-chip stocks.

Typically blue chips or shares in venerable well-established companies aren’t cheap. That’s not to say they are usually overvalued or that investing in blue-chips results in subpar returns if you do not buy them at a discount.

As the famous Warren Buffett quote goes “it’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But what if you can buy a “wonderful company” at a more-than-fair price? There may be the opportunity for even more substantial long-term returns. First market conditions normalize resulting in discounted blue chips returning to fair prices. Then steady gains from price appreciation and dividends over a longer timeframe.

So what are the best cheap blue-chip stocks out there today? Consider these seven each a high-quality business currently trading at a low valuation.

BTI British American Tobacco PLC $36.81 GOOG GOOGL Alphabet $99.57 $98.68 IBM IBM $118.82 JPM JPMorgan Chase & Co. $105.98 PFE Pfizer $42.32 VZ Verizon Communications $36.85 XOM ExonnMobil $101.03

British American Tobacco PLC (BTI)

Blue-chip tobacco stocks like British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE:BTI) trade at low valuations even in a bull market. This of course is due to the industry’s cash cow product cigarettes being in secular decline. There is high uncertainty as to whether “big tobacco” can still thrive in a post-cigarette future.

Yet recently BTI stock has fallen to a meager price. Today you can buy this global tobacco giant (whose brands include Camel and Newport) for only 8.1x forward earnings. Besides being cheaper than the overall market BTI is also cheaper than peer Altria Group (NYSE:MO) which trades for around 8.6x forward earnings.

Not only that unlike Altria which lost billions on its Juul Labs investment British American Tobacco has demonstrated success in diversifying its product mix beyond cigarettes. This may leave it well-positioned to maintain (and grow) its high-yield dividend of 7.99%.

Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL)

It may be a relatively young company and may not pay a dividend but it’s apt to say Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a blue-chip stock. This is due to several factors including a deep economic moat high operating margins and a strong balance sheet.

Story continues

You may agree that GOOG stock is a blue-chip yet disagree that it’s one of the cheap blue-chip stocks. I’ll agree with you that this stock is not “undervalued” on an absolute basis as it trades for 18.8x earnings in-line with major indices like the S&P 500

However Alphabet’s current earnings multiple may overestimate how long its main digital ads business remains in a slump and underestimate the company’s potential to re-accelerate earnings growth. Shares have strong rebound potential once the digital ad market recovers and Alphabet’s other growth catalysts start to play out.

IBM (IBM)

While Alphabet is an ascending tech blue-chip IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a blue-chip tech “dinosaur.” At least that’s still the market’s perception of this more than century-old technology company.

Trading for 19.3x earnings and with a forward dividend yield of 5.44% critics of this stock will warn you that it’s a value trap and possibly a yield trap. Yet despite the poor performance of “Big Blue” over the past decade (down nearly 38.5%) the next ten years could be much more stellar for IBM stock investors.

Why? Chalk it up to its in-progress transformation into primarily a hybrid cloud computing company. Through bolt-on acquisitions IBM continues to bulk up its presence in the hybrid cloud space. Steadily helping it become a faster-growing company this could result in a move to substantially higher prices for IBM stock in the coming years.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)

As InvestorPlace’s Joel Baglole recently discussed JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been hammered by the market’s worries about a recession. These worries have outweighed the tailwind for this banking giant which is the sharp rise in interest rates which points to increased profitability.

However one can argue that these recession worries are already fully-factored into the valuation of JPM stock. Shares in the money center bank currently trade for 9.7x the estimated 2022 earnings. However this valuation doesn’t look at first glance as a big discount towards the low end of its valuation over the past five years.

If JPMorgan Chase can weather today’s economic storms and capitalize on the current rising rate environment future operating results could be stronger-than-expected. One bank stock analyst (Citi’s Keith Horowitz) anticipates this. A series of earnings beats could enable JPM to rise on a re-rating.

Pfizer (PFE)

If searching for cheap blue-chip stocks on a screener chances are one of the first ones you’ll find is Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The pharmaceutical giant trades at a super-low valuation (only 8.28x earnings) although there is a caveat.

You can say earnings in 2021 and 2022 were “boosted” by the rollout of its Covid-19 vaccine which the company co-developed with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX). With the vaccination wave long since passed Pfizer’s earnings are set to drop.

However even with an expected drop in earnings per share (or EPS) from $6.49 to $5.09 next year PFE stock is still cheap. Based on next year’s estimates Pfizer trades for 8.5x earnings. There may be room for shares to move higher towards a valuation on par with other pharma stocks. Pfizer’s peers trade at a valuation closer to ten times earnings.

Verizon Communications (VZ)

Rising interest rates have put pressure on telecom stocks which investors buy mainly for their high dividends. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) may not be as popular as AT&T (NYSE:T) among dividend investors yet this factor has pushed this “Baby Bell” nearly 28% lower year-to-date.

If rates keep rising VZ stock will likely slide lower. However if you’re bullish rates aren’t going much higher from here and are looking to scoop up dividend stocks at attractive valuations now may be the time to buy.

Verizon’s forward dividend yield currently comes in at around 7.08%. That’s only slightly less than AT&T’s current forward yield around 7.43%. Not only that as I’ve argued previously VZ beats T stock in areas like dividend coverage and dividend growth. Trading for only 7.4x earnings while higher than AT&T’s current multiple of 5.6x VZ is cheap even among cheap blue-chip stocks.

ExxonMobil (XOM)

Up until the start of this month ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) like other oil stocks was pulling back. This was in tandem with the slide in crude oil prices due to concerns that a recession-driven drop in demand would outweigh the impact to supply caused by Russia’s Ukraine invasion and subsequent sanctions.

However so far in October oil (and XOM stock) have started to bounce back. Hopes of oil prices “returning to normal” have been dashed as OPEC and its allies have agreed to production cuts. This could counter any impact on demand from a recession enabling prices to stay high.

In turn enabling ExxonMobil’s current level of profitability to continue. Currently trading at a discounted valuation of 11x earnings in anticipation of a drop in oil prices XOM could move higher due to multiple expansions. The company’s capital allocation plan may also help move the needle over a longer timeframe.

The fossil fuel industry may not be one investors associate with advanced tech like AI but oil giant Shell is using C3.ai to monitor over 13000 pieces of equipment to improve safety reduce emissions and predict failures that could otherwise lead to significant environmental disasters.

C3.ai is growing steadily with plenty of potential

In fiscal 2022 (ended April 30) C3.ai generated $252.8 million in revenue up 38% year over year. The company anticipates a much smaller increase of 1% to 7% during fiscal 2023 because of the unfavorable economic climate which is pushing businesses to cut costs.

But in the fiscal first quarter C3.ai grew its remaining performance obligations (RPOs) 58% to $458.2 million. Since RPOs are generally expected to convert into revenue in the future it's a sign that any slowdown in sales might only be temporary. Plus the company anticipates its addressable market opportunity could be as high as $596 billion by 2025 so it has a long runway for growth ahead.

C3.ai isn't profitable just yet having lost $71.9 million during the quarter. That's a key reason its stock has suffered as investors have shunned loss-making companies this year. But it has a strong balance sheet with over $900 million in cash equivalents and short-term investments which means it has plenty of dry powder to invest in growth and innovation.

C3.ai stock is cheap right now

After falling 93% from its all-time high C3.ai's market valuation sits at just $1.37 billion right now. Keep in mind the company's cash balance of over $900 million because it means investors are only valuing the actual business in the neighborhood of $500 million.

Considering the company's outstanding RPOs alone and without factoring in its mammoth future potential or its partnerships with industry giants that's a rock-bottom valuation. Plus according to a report by McKinsey & Company artificial intelligence could add $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030 as up to 70% of organizations deploy the technology in one way or another.

C3.ai is a first mover in the enterprise-AI space so it deserves far more credit and the steep discount in its stock price is a fantastic opportunity to buy for the long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2xldHRlcnMvMjAyMi0xMC0wOS93aWxsLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtMTUtZ2V0LXVzYi1jLXBvcnQtd2lsbC1hcHBsZS1hYXBsLXJlbGVhc2UtYS13aXJlbGVzcy1pcGhvbmUtbDkxZWR0eHTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the iPhone 15 Get USB-C Port?

Google parent Alphabet has a longevity company and Jeff Bezos is investing heavily in longevity startups.

But this trend is no longer only a Bay-area thing.

Alexandra Bause cofounder of longevity-focused VC and company builder Apollo Health first heard about the biology of ageing during a lunchtime talk in 2008 at the cancer research institute where she then worked. It was a wake-up call.

“Instead of just targeting cancer you could target the ageing process and delay all age-related diseases — cardiovascular disease metabolic disease neurodegenerative disease as well as cancer” Bause says.

Longevity research has often focused on combatting one specific aspect of ageing like regenerating the liver or the brain. But recently there's been a shift towards looking for the silver bullet for all age-related diseases.

“The real potential of longevity startups and longevity therapeutics is that you can take a drug that could rejuvenate your entire body and prevent all kinds of age-related diseases” says Bause.

From crypto to longevity

The UK and Switzerland are the two most advanced countries in Europe in terms of longevity startups. According to Bause who's based in Munich both countries have a cluster of innovation ecosystems around universities with a lot of pharma and biotech talent.

Switzerland is also helped by having an experienced crypto ecosystem.

“I see a lot of commonalities between the crypto and the longevity worlds. Both take a little bit of visionary thinking combined with a risk appetite” she says.

Marc Bernegger a former crypto entrepreneur cofounded the longevity company builder Maximon in 2021. He and his partners ran a two-day longevity investor conference last month in Gstaad in the Swiss Alps. The agenda included both investments opportunities and an overview of scientific research with speakers including the investor Christian Angermayer and Eric Verdin CEO of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging.

Marc P. Bernegger cofounder of longevity company builder Maximon

“We had quite a few billionaires flying in from all over the world. That is a good indication that there's now serious money coming into this field. And having some well-known guests coming to an event like this makes it more tangible for investors” Bernegger says.

The enthusiasm and the capital for the field is there — the longevity market is projected to reach $44bn by 2030 — but time is ironically not on this industry’s side.

Of mice and men

Many of the scientific breakthroughs that happen in this space are found by experimenting on mice — and in some cases pet dogs. But it will take decades (or whole lifetimes) of clinical studies to show that the same drugs that can extend the lifespan of a small animal could do the same in humans — without causing damage.

So instead of waiting around for that scientists are focusing on the smaller pieces of the puzzle with the hope of hitting on the same results — most often individual cells.

One science in particular that’s been of growing interest in the last two years in the Bay area is cellular reprogramming. As cells age they often lose their ability to function or they begin to function abnormally. Reprogramming enables scientists to restore a youthful epigenetic signature to ageing cells so they don’t act like old cells anymore. But reversing the epigenetic clock isn't easy and there’s a lot of fine-tuning that needs to happen in labs before we see it in humans.

“There is some work that needs to be done to kind of dissect the actual change of cell identity [what the cell’s function is] from the age of the cell. [When a cell loses its identity it can stop working properly and can lead to a range of illnesses.] And that's what a lot of companies are also trying to do. We [Apollo Health] just started a company that's really focusing on just changing cellular health rather than reprogramming the cell identity” Bause says.

The low-hanging fruit

Apollo Health is focused on novel treatments for ageing. It’s helped set up companies like UK-based Samsara Therapeutics which is developing a method of restoring autophagy in diseased cells German startup Booster Therapeutics which is working on the self-regulating process in cells and Dutch startup Cleara Bio which is developing therapeutics to eliminate senescent cells.

Maximon’s strategy is to look for more low-hanging fruits says Bernegger. So far the company builder has invested in Swiss supplement startup Avea and Biolytica another Swiss startup which is combining health data analytics and personalised longevity programmes.

Bernegger believes that although a lot of longevity supplements such as NMN and NAD+ boosters already exist on the global market the “made in Switzerland” selling point will be beneficial to lure customers away from other brands as well as attract new customers.

“I'm a little bit surprised how strong this ‘European made’ [branding] is and in this specific case Switzerland. I could imagine people [who are currently] using Amazon to buy supplements from China or the United States will be looking more into what's happening here in Europe” Bernegger says.

Low-hanging fruit or not both Maximon and Apollo Health are looking for ways to bring longevity technology to the masses. One way to do this — as both organisations are already about to — is by building longevity clinics where people can go and find out what supplements and treatments would be beneficial to them on a personal level.

Longevity clinics are not something the European healthcare systems are anywhere close to supporting yet. However last month it was revealed that a publicly funded longevity clinic is opening in Singapore — possibly the first in the world.

“You'll see so much happening in that space” says Bause. “Of course initially it will be the more wealthy people who can afford it but we need to start somewhere. We just need to demonstrate that it's actually valuable and has a benefit on health. And if we can demonstrate that then this will become more supported by the overall health insurance systems and then be more broadly beneficial.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9nZW9yZ2UtaG90ei1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLWNhcnMtYXJlLWEtc2NhbS1jb25uZWN0ZWQtY2Fycy1tYXktYmUtdGhlLW5ldy10aGluZy_SAXRodHRwczovL2NsZWFudGVjaG5pY2EuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvZ2VvcmdlLWhvdHotYXV0b25vbW91cy1jYXJzLWFyZS1hLXNjYW0tY29ubmVjdGVkLWNhcnMtbWF5LWJlLXRoZS1uZXctdGhpbmcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George Hotz: Self-Driving Cars Are A Scam,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9nZW9yZ2UtaG90ei1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLWNhcnMtYXJlLWEtc2NhbS1jb25uZWN0ZWQtY2Fycy1tYXktYmUtdGhlLW5ldy10aGluZy_SAXRodHRwczovL2NsZWFudGVjaG5pY2EuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvZ2VvcmdlLWhvdHotYXV0b25vbW91cy1jYXJzLWFyZS1hLXNjYW0tY29ubmVjdGVkLWNhcnMtbWF5LWJlLXRoZS1uZXctdGhpbmcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8C85960>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9nZW9yZ2UtaG90ei1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLWNhcnMtYXJlLWEtc2NhbS1jb25uZWN0ZWQtY2Fycy1tYXktYmUtdGhlLW5ldy10aGluZy_SAXRodHRwczovL2NsZWFudGVjaG5pY2EuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvZ2VvcmdlLWhvdHotYXV0b25vbW91cy1jYXJzLWFyZS1hLXNjYW0tY29ubmVjdGVkLWNhcnMtbWF5LWJlLXRoZS1uZXctdGhpbmcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Bricks & Minifigs is an aftermarket Lego-licensed retailer that will buy sell and trade sets with collectors and Lego fans.

The brand is one of the few after-market Lego-licensed resellers in the country. Customers will be able to sell their old sets while finding new or refurbished ones at the store. Bricks & Minifigs will have individual pieces like specific mini figures or blocks for collectors. The store has also bought Legos in bulk from tub sized- to storage unit-sized stashes.

About 85% of its products will be Lego-specific with the remaining 15% being Lego accessories and third-party products like backpacks lunchboxes and Room Copenhagen an offshoot of large blocks for room décor.

The Henrico location will be one of Virginia’s first two franchises. The Bricks & Minifigs brand opened its original store in 2010 as the first Lego reseller in the country. It has since expanded to include 51 stores across the U.S. and Canada.

Husband-and-wife team Paul and Carrie Indelicato are bringing the store to the area. They have over a decade of experience in retail between them. Paul Indelicato has over seven years of supply chain operations and analytics experience with the past three years in data analytics. The couple always wanted to own their own business but were looking for the right type of store. Their love for Lego items combined with finding the Bricks & Minifigs brand cemented their decision to open the store.

The Indelicatos said they can’t yet comment on the official address but said it’s planned to be near West Broad Street and Cox Road.

The store will have 2500 total square feet of showroom with 350 square feet dedicated to an event room for parties training and classes. There will also be multiple cases and tables for community displays. The couple said they want the store to be more than just a retailer but a place for people to come and express themselves.

“Fans of the store can come and display their Legos and show off their creations” Paul Indelicato said. “You can be so creative and do whatever you want. So having a place where you can display and show off your things that’s a really big part of the community.”

The store is projected to open in the first two weeks of December. The Indelicatos said their contracts and permits have been finalized and they’re waiting to nail down the official starting date.

***

The Bricks & Minifigs store is unrelated to Lego’s plans to invest at least $1 billion to construct its only U.S.-based manufacturing plant in Chesterfield County. Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced the plans for the Lego facility in June.

The Virginia factory will be Lego’s seventh manufacturing facility in the world. It is projected to be 1.7 million square feet and is estimated to create more than 1700 jobs over 10 years. The plant is projected to open for production by mid-2025. Construction along with hiring begins later this year but an exact month has yet to be set.

The investment is also intended to drive innovation across the industry and encourage more public charging infrastructure which will help enable the broader transportation industry to more quickly reduce emissions.

The company is already using thousands of zero-emission vehicles across its European operations and this investment will add thousands more accelerating Amazon’s progress toward becoming net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.

“Our transportation network is one of the most challenging areas of our business to decarbonize and to achieve net-zero carbon will require a substantial and sustained investment” said Andy Jassy Amazon CEO. “Deploying thousands of electric vans long-haul trucks and bikes will help us shift further away from traditional fossil fuels—and hopefully further encourage transportation and automotive industries in Europe and around the world to continue scaling and innovating as we will have to work together to reach our climate goals.”

Investment brings more electric delivery vans e-cargo bikes and on-foot deliveries to cities across Europe

Amazon has more than 3000 electric vans delivering packages to customers across Europe and with the investment announced today expects to grow its fleet to more than 10000 by 2025.

Amazon has launched micro-mobility hubs in more than 20 cities across Europe including London Munich and Paris and expects to double that figure by the end of 2025. Micro-mobility hubs are smaller centrally-located delivery stations. In Europe’s traditionally dense cities the hubs enable Amazon to operate new delivery methods such as e-cargo bikes and on-foot deliveries to bring packages to customers more sustainably. Micro-mobility hubs take traditional delivery vans off the road which alleviates traffic congestion in city centres and improves air quality.

In addition to these new vans and micro-mobility hubs and vehicles Amazon will also invest in thousands of chargers across its European facilities. The investment will allow the company and its partners to improve fleet charging hardware.

Amazon scales up fleet of electric heavy goods vehicles and expands critical infrastructure to decarbonize long haul trucking

Long haul transportation is a hard-to-decarbonize sector due to the size and weight of the trucks and trailers and the long distances they need to travel. Electric heavy goods vehicles (eHGVs) are a promising technology but eHGV production and charging infrastructure availability are limited. Amazon today has five eHGVs on the road in the UK and will have 20 on the road in Germany by the end of this year.

Amazon is using its size and scale to help spark the scaling of eHGV production so Amazon and others can more quickly transition away from diesel trucks. With the investment announced today Amazon expects to purchase and roll out more than 1500 eHGVs in its European fleet in the coming years.

To power its eHGVs Amazon will build hundreds of specialized fast chargers across its European facilities allowing the company to charge the vehicles in approximately two hours.

Amazon surpasses 100 renewable energy projects in Europe

Amazon is on a path to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and in 2021 the company reached 85%. This applies to all Amazon operations such as data centres logistics facilities physical stores and corporate offices including on-site charging points.

The company currently has around 3000 zero-emission last-mile delivery vans in Europe. Amazon doesn’t say what percentage of its vans are electric but does say that these zero-emission vans delivered 100 million packages last year.

This investment will allow the company to expand that number to 10000 vans across Europe by 2025. These “last-mile” vans are used on local delivery routes bringing packages to individual homes. Amazon also has “micro-mobility” delivery hubs in 20 European cities that enable delivery by cargo bike and on foot and it plans to double this network of hubs.

Amazon will also buy larger heavy-duty electric trucks for “middle-mile” shipments. These are vehicles like the Tesla Semi Freightliner eCascadia and Volvo VNR electric that move large amounts of goods from ports to distribution centers.

Finally the investment will also cover installation of thousands of chargers at the company’s facilities around the continent.

Amazon did not specify which brands of vehicles it would buy but it currently has an order for 100000 Rivian Electric Delivery Vans. Those have been spotted making some deliveries though it will take some time for the company to build them all. Amazon invested $700 million in Rivian in 2019 and the company is reportedly planning to build electric vans with Mercedes in Europe.

But Amazon isn’t only ordering vehicles from Rivian. They’ve also made orders from Mercedes-Benz themselves Lion Electric and just last week Volvo. So we don’t know who exactly will provide these vans and trucks but when companies get around to making them it looks like there’s another billion on the table ready to buy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi90di9uZXdzL3RoZS1wZXJpcGhlcmFsLXRyYWlsZXItY2hsb2UtZ3JhY2UtbW9yZXR6LXdlc3R3b3JsZC1jcmVhdG9ycy0xMjM1Mzk2ODEyL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi90di9uZXdzL3RoZS1wZXJpcGhlcmFsLXRyYWlsZXItY2hsb2UtZ3JhY2UtbW9yZXR6LXdlc3R3b3JsZC1jcmVhdG9ycy0xMjM1Mzk2ODEyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘The Peripheral’ Trailer: Chloë Grace Moretz Stars in Sci-Fi Series From ‘Westworld’ Creators,"Chloë Grace Moretz discovers a dangerous virtual reality in the official trailer for Amazon Prime Video series “The Peripheral” from “Westworld” creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy.

In the sci-fi thriller series based on William Gibson’s novel Moretz plays Flynne Fisher a young woman living in the Blue Ridge Mountains in 2032 with her Marine veteran brother Burton (Jack Reynor) and ailing mother. As their mother grows sicker Flynne and Burton make ends meet by playing paid simulations (aka sims).

According to the show’s official description “The two siblings share Burton’s avatar ‘jockeying’ for high-paying customers to beat challenging game levels. When Burton is offered a chance to beta test a new Sim it’s Flynne who ends up playing pretending to be her brother. The Sim takes place in London and it tasks Flynne with breaking into a corporation known as the Research Institute—to steal a valuable secret. When the assignment goes wrong Flynne begins to realize the Sim is more real than she ever could have imagined. The London she’s exploring exists in the future… the year 2099. And what Flynne has uncovered in the Research Institute has put her and her family in grave peril. There are people from the future who want to use Flynne for the information she’s stolen… and there are others who want Flynne dead. Flynne encounters Wilf (Gary Carr) in Future London a man who may be the key to unlocking the mystery at hand. But first in her present Flynne and Burton along with his former elite military unit must rally to save themselves from forces intent on killing them—forces sent from the future to reclaim the vital secret Flynne stole.”

“The Peripheral” also stars Gary Carr Eli Goree Louis Herthum JJ Feild T’Nia Miller Charlotte Riley Alexandra Billings Adelind Horan Alex Hernandez Katie Leung Julian Moore-Cook Melinda Page Hamilton Chris Coy Amber Rose Revah and Austin Rising. The show is produced by Amazon Studios and Warner Bros. Television in association with Kilter Films. In addition to Nolan and Joy executive producers include Scott B.

On Sept. 28 Judge Kathryn Davis sided with landowners along the trail who sought to counter the seizure and transfer of land between the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and Missouri Central Railroad a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameren Missouri which donated the property at no cost to the state.

Meghan Largent whose law firm Lewis Rice has represented the landowners since 2015 said the order on the almost 200 parcels of land won’t impact the trail’s development. But she said landowners will now be able to initiate appraisals of their land in order to obtain appropriate compensation.

Largent’s clients have waited seven years for the decision.

“This is definitely long overdue” said Rodney Luebbering a plaintiff in the case. The Rock Island Railroad corridor runs through Luebbering’s land near Meta in Osage County.

“I’d still prefer to have that land back and my understanding is that this is how most of the other landowners here feel. It’s nice that we’ll be compensated but it’s been dragged out so long it’s hard to really be excited about it.”

In Luebbering’s case it’s not as much an emotional connection to the land that fuels his ambivalence. Instead Luebbering is concerned about the corridor’s proximity to landowners’ livestock and crops.

Luebbering must cross portions of the corridor to reach various parts of his land and knows other landowners who drive their cattle across the corridor. Luebbering said he’s worried about the trail being adjacenct to the areas where he frequently hunts and fishes.

Some of his neighbors take great care in preventing diseases from affecting their livestock which he said would be more difficult with people passing nearby.

Luebbering also occaisionally runs a spray rig for insecticides on his crops.

“I have no control if I’m running a spray rig and 50 feet away someone walks over from the trail and exposes themself to the chemicals” he said.

Luebbering also said his ambivalence stems from disillusionment with the way the land transfer was handled.

“It’s been seven years and I still haven’t made peace with it. I don’t think I’ll ever make peace with it just because of how it all went down. It hits deep” Luebbering said.

If there’s federal law allowing these land transfers he said there needs to be federal law for helping landowners get compensated without a lengthy lawsuit.

“It baffles how all these trails have been developed while knowing it should be paid for without any plan of compensating owners” he said.

In 2015 the state of Missouri seized the 144-mile railroad corridor of the Rock Island Railroad to convert it into a hiking and biking trail the Rock Island Trail. The corridor runs through Cass Pettis Benton Morgan Miller Cole Osage Maries Gasconade and Franklin counties.

Largent filed a lawsuit that same year on behalf of the hundreds of landowners who own property along the corridor asking the court to award them compensation a classic case of eminent domain said Largent who has worked on similar cases across the country for almost 15 years.

Under Missouri law she argued the land should revert back to the landowners once the railroad abandoned its right away to the land in the 1970s.

But that didn’t happen. Amendments made to the National Trails System Act in 1983 make it possible for the state to take the land by eminent domain for use as a trail.

When the Missouri Central Railroad sold the land to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources for the trail in 2015 the federal government authorized the purchase.

Largent’s lawsuit cited a 1983 Supreme Court decision that made it constitutional for the government to take private property for public use as long as the landowners are paid just compensation.

Davis’s order cited Missouri law which states that Missouri Central Railroad’s easement existed solely for railroad purposes which don’t include the sale of land for the trail meaning the original property owners were owed compensation.

The federal claims court order usurps alternate decisions from lower courts where judges ruled either the Missouri Central Railway owned the land or easement permitted the sale.

“The most striking part of the opinion was the judge’s willingness to take a fresh look at the laws and not simply repeat what other judges in this court have previously ruled” Largent said.

The lawsuit wasn’t against Missouri Central Railroad the Department of Natural Resources or any other entity in the state. Instead it’s purely against the federal government meaning the money the landowners will receive will come from a federal pool of money called the Judgement Fund a bucket of money set aside by Congress to pay the debts and liabilities of the United States. Largent said none of the money will come from the state or the trail project.

Each landowner’s compensation case will be handled individually she said.

Neither Luebbering nor any of the other landowners know how much they’ll be compensated yet or when that process will begin.

“We’re still at the mercy of the court and our attorney no doubt” he said.

Where is the Rock Island Trail project?

The proposed development of the Rock Island Corridor into a state park had been eagerly anticipated by trailgoers but opposed by some landowners.

Representatives from the Missouri Farm Bureau (MOFB) had consistently shared their opposition for trail development without compensation for landowners who would be affected.

“Missouri Farm Bureau opposes the decision to move forward with the proposed Rock Island Trail as a state park and believes it is an affront to private property rights” said Garrett Hawkins MOFB president. “Landowners’ easements have only granted use of the corridor for a railroad which has been dormant for several decades.”

Greg Harris former executive director and current board member for the Missouri Rock Island Trail project said he sees this development as a positive.

“The main goal of the project is to preserve the land so we’ve never been against these landowners getting compensated for it” he said.

Director of Missouri State Parks David Kelly said development of the trail will occur in sections over several years as each section of the corridor has different features and challenges.

Kelly said his team is currently determining operational uses for the trail including trailheads and sections available for equestrian use. They’re also working with landowners adjacent to the trail interested in obtaining a fencing barrier.

This was a topic that frequently arose across a series of public meetings which started in January in towns along the corridor to gather input on the trail’s development said Kelly. At these meetings participants also discussed trail operations public safety landowner and real estate topics grant opportunities and future partnership opportunities.

It was easy. What's the big deal?,"Recently I drove a Tesla Model 3 on an electric roadtrip from Southern California to Portland and back. The total distance was around 2200 miles with the bulk of the driving happening over the course of five days (three up two down) and I only “spent” about 25 minutes waiting for the car to charge total over the whole trip.

There are many travelogues and YouTube channels that go into deep analyses of efficiency and charging speed with lots of detail on how exactly to plan an electric roadtrip. Though I typically do enjoy those sorts of details I didn’t actually think to keep track of any of them during this trip since they’re all sort of unnecessary at this point because electric roadtrips are easy.

The roadtrip included a mixture of heavy driving days on interstates and lighter days on state routes with side routes and sightseeing. We had two drivers in the car along with luggage for three and didn’t bother to plan the route ahead of time except for the goal of getting a little time on the Northern California/Oregon coast and seeing some coastal redwoods along the way. Both of us have plenty of experience driving and charging electric cars though this is the longest electric roadtrip I personally have been on.

And that 25 minute number – that counts the amount of time spent waiting for charging and doing nothing else productive. If we were getting a meal that was “free” charging time since we need to eat anyway. In other words time spent charging that would have otherwise been spent driving if we weren’t charging.

Side routes? Detours? No problem

It has been said many times that electric roadtrips are doable as long as you stick to the plan and don’t deviate at all. Most chargers are along main routes which see the most traffic – smaller routes have fewer chargers or slower ones or don’t have any at all.

Well… we didn’t have a plan. We didn’t plan our route ahead around charger availability merely left in the morning and charged where we wanted to once we got hungry or needed to take a driving break. In the car’s navigation system it’s easy to pull up a list of chargers see what services exist at each stop and search the map nearby for restaurants hotels bathrooms and so on. And if you’re new to this whole thing you can ask the car to route you to your destination and it will tell you where to charge and for how long (you can modify the plan if you’d like and we usually did).

Restaurants near the Tejon Ranch charger Say “take me to Portland”and the car shows you this

Everything was straightforward until the second morning of the trip where right before setting out towards the coast from Williams CA I sustained an injury which needed urgent care (I won’t bore you with the details of how badly my insurance company Oscar dealt with the situation but they deserve mention for being unhelpful). Turns out there’s no urgent care in Williams CA so off we went on twisty roads towards the coast. After a couple hours through mountains and trees we got to Fort Bragg which along with urgent care facilities also had a supercharger despite being quite far from anything that might be considered a main road.

The car’s ultrasonic sensors were not happy with me for this

We continued on and drove through the Avenue of the Giants an area of coastal redwoods the tallest trees in the world which were breathtaking to behold and only made better by the silence of driving with electric propulsion. At one stop a man in a truck remarked “You’re the first Tesla I’ve seen in four days” presumably suggesting that Teslas mostly stick to the main roads and don’t get out to the more empty regions. We thought that was odd since at no point on the trip did we feel restricted by charging concerns (and we did see other EVs but maybe not as many as we saw on the main roads or near the cities).

Unfortunately we had to end our side-route adventure the next day turning in through the mountains towards Grant’s Pass due to the time loss associated with our medical misadventure. The coastal route would have added about two hours (of driving not charging) along with sightseeing time and we had a dinner to get to – though charging in Bandon and Lincoln City on the coast would have been just about as easy as our charges in Grant’s Pass and Harrisburg were.

Charging is available fast and pleasant

Charging was never a problem during our electric roadtrip. We chose hotels with chargers (by checking PlugShare) but these hotels were in the towns we wanted to stop in so we didn’t have to go out of our way to find these overnight charges.

Each overnight charge was “free” insofar as it was included with the hotel and it was nice to leave in the morning with a 100% charge (rather than ~80% which is the usual state of charge to leave a supercharger at). This provided more flexibility on where to charge during the day and saved some money on supercharging fees.

Every charge save one or two was associated with a meal or bathroom break which meant we spent little actual time charging during the trip. Every stop by the time we were done with what we needed to do on the stop the car was already ready to go with 200+ added miles of range.

Whether it be walking to and eating fast food waiting to be seen at urgent care (whoops) devouring the haul from a local fruit stand or having free wine samples (only the passenger of course) there was plenty to do at each stop and only ever a few minutes if at all spent “waiting” for the car to charge enough to continue on.

On that wine tasting point a special mention goes to the Olsen Run Winery at the Harrisburg OR supercharger which exists poetically on the property of an old gas station (though for some reason isn’t listed in the in-car search for nearby restaurants – don’t be fooled stop there anyway).

Instead of serving up stinky cancer-causing dino juice it now pushes electrons and delicious burgers (with veggie option) fries shakes and free wine tastings and even serves as an event space (in… the middle of nowhere). It was such a pleasant stop that even though we didn’t need a charge we stopped again on the way back South from Portland just for the burgers and conversation. We hope to see more entrepreneurial innovation with properties like this converting stinky old gas stations into something much more pleasant.

And we didn’t even take advantage of every charge opportunity – one of which was actually easier for non-Teslas. We stopped at a rest stop right after the CA border just to look around and by chance happened to find a free CCS/CHAdeMO DC fast charger there. We didn’t have the necessary CHAdeMO or CCS adapter but didn’t need a charge anyway though we still got an emotional charge standing by a pleasant river breathing clean air unsullied by gas station fumes and seeing some unnervingly bold deer crawling all over the place on the rest stop lawn which was clearly marked “no pets.”

All told we probably only spent a total of about 25 minutes across the whole trip doing nothing but charging. This was primarily at the last charge on the last day where we stopped at an outlet mall (Tejon Ranch East supercharger) after business hours and spent about 15 minutes watching a couple play with their dog in the parking lot while charging. The point is: The amount of extra time spent actively charging across the whole trip was no more than the amount of active time it takes to fill up at gas stations – and perhaps even less.

650 miles in one day

Typically on roadtrips I don’t like to do more than around 300 miles in a day. After that point you start feeling like you’ve been in the car forever like you haven’t gotten to see or do anything outside of the car you feel cooped up and tired and stressed and so on.

But sometimes you just want to get home and rest your broken toe and you don’t have any particular sights you want to see along the boring I-5 in California. So you spend the morning tooling around Mount Shasta after an overnight charge then set out to drive almost the entire length of California in one day.

And when driving in a car with one driver with a broken toe and the other with a bum knee autopilot is nice to have. While the promise of full self-driving is not here (…yet?) autopilot does work well on highways and helps reduce fatigue on a long drive like this.

On this 650 mile day we stopped for three charges – Woodland to get a pizza Firebaugh for a taco and Tejon Ranch. Again we didn’t have to wait for the car until the very last charge where we weren’t hungry and didn’t need a break so waited about 15 minutes.

Even if people recognize that electric roadtrips are doable they will often carve out an exception for these long driving days suggesting that they would be hindered by charging when they really need to make a lot of ground quickly. Well given that we only “spent” 15 minutes charging during this 650 mile day (again not counting the two fast food meals and bathroom breaks which we needed anyway) that doesn’t really sound like much of a hindrance given that at least one 10-minute gas stop would be necessary if the roadtrip were done on gas (and don’t forget the ~5-7 other gas stops that would have been needed over the 2200-mile trip and can’t be done overnight at a hotel).

Reminders why electric roadtrips are important

We did make a brief stop during our longest driving day to look at Shasta Lake which put a bit of a point on why we spent five days doing an electric roadtrip instead of the more convenient option of burning fuel in a plane to get to where we were going:

California like many parts of the world is experiencing historic drought. Shasta Lake the largest reservoir in the state is at critically low levels. The lake feeds the Bay Area and the Central Valley the most agriculturally productive land in the nation which provides more than half of the fruits vegetables and nuts for the entire US.

This drought is exacerbated by climate change causing dry weather and high temperatures in the area and climate change is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel emissions from transportation are the largest contributor to climate change in the US (another major factor is animal agriculture which not only produces methane emissions but uses large amounts of water).

The rest of the final day was spent driving through that valley which also happens to be one of the more polluted places in the country. Air pollution from trucks and machinery gets trapped by the mountains causing constant smog conditions. Despite being in a valley you wouldn’t really know it because much of the time you can’t see the mountains all around you due to the smog.

There’s supposed to be mountains in the background but that thing in the foreground seems to obscure them…

So not only was an EV the right choice for the practical side of the roadtrip but also for the greater picture – trying to avoid the environmental disasters caused by fossil fuel usage.

Your mileage may vary?

We encountered no charging reliability problems on the trip. There were a few supercharger connectors that weren’t working at some of the stops but the car informed us ahead of time which ones were inactive and it never affected charge speed or the locations we chose to charge at.

Of course this trip was on the West Coast of the US mostly in California the state with the most EVs. I have been assured that the trip would be more difficult elsewhere or on a network other than Tesla’s superchargers (though other cars will gain access to Tesla’s system soon™). Other networks probably wouldn’t be as easy and other cars don’t have as elegant a routing and “nearby search” system as the Tesla system or as simple of a “plug-and-charge” payment system like superchargers have.

But I have also been assured that this trip would be difficult with so many people talking about how hard it is to take roadtrips in an electric car.

But it wasn’t hard it was easy. So this suggests to me that those other trips while perhaps not as easy as mine may well be more possible than people think they are.

(*The comments below say the same – many say this trip would be more difficult elsewhere alongside several stories of readers who have done similar trips elsewhere and with other cars and it wasn’t a problem including one reader who emailed us about a similar drive from Portland to Santa Cruz and back in a Leaf in five days with one 450-mile day.)

I will reiterate again that we did not plan a route ahead. We didn’t plug our trip into ABRP or other route planners. We didn’t stick to a specific speed so we could make our charging plan. We changed routes frequently on a whim we charged when or where we felt like doing so or where there was a restaurant we were interested in. None of this was an issue. It was just a regular roadtrip but less polluting more pleasant and cheaper.

And yet there is a persistent myth that since EVs are supposedly incapable (they are not as displayed above) of doing this one thing that most cars will never do they are therefore not an acceptable source of transportation. Nevermind that they are superior in normal driving tasks – and as displayed above not even inferior in this one – somehow this myth still persists.

It should also be noted that trips like this are not a common occurrence. As a practical matter most cars will rarely if ever do a roadtrip like this. But particularly in America cars are not sold for what they’ll be used for but for every conceivable purpose the buyer could ever imagine using them for. You’re not being sold a tool you’re being sold a dream – the dream of freedom in the form of a $1000/mo car payment.

This is the reason the “electric roadtrips are impossible!” myth has gained so much traction – Americans are buying the dream of the Great American roadtrip and think that an EV makes that dream impossible.

Well I’m here to tell you that it’s not impossible. In fact it’s more than possible – it’s even better than the alternative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDgvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L21vcmdlbnRoYXUtYW5kcmV3LW1laWVyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Book Review: ‘Morgenthau’ by Andrew Meier,"MORGENTHAU: Power Privilege and the Rise of an American Dynasty by Andrew Meier

What makes a family dynasty? It starts with multigenerational success of course but it usually takes something more — a sense of common mission. The Kennedys and Bushes haven’t just reached great heights; they’ve stood for something or at least they’ve created the expectation that they do. In “Morgenthau” Andrew Meier makes a 1046-page case for a different kind of dynasty one where the protagonists have little in common except their inherited privilege.

The Morgenthau spin on this American archetype goes riches-to-rags-to-riches. Lazarus Morgenthau made a fortune in mid-19th-century Bavaria when he built something more lucrative than a better mousetrap — a really durable cigar box. At one point Lazarus had a thousand employees but his business busted as quickly as it boomed and he set sail for New York just after the Civil War. The Morgenthaus have long been associated with the “Our Crowd” crowd of German Jewish aristocrats but Meier points out that the leading members of that tribe — the Lehmans Wertheims and such — arrived before the war. Lazarus was late. And his American business ideas unlike theirs were a series of get-rich-never schemes. Wine restaurants a pine-needle syrup marketed as a universal elixir a wackadoodle object called The Golden Book of Life — Lazarus failed at everything.

Fortunately his son Heinrich later known as Henry had the smarts and discipline that his father lacked. A good student who graduated from Columbia Law School Henry soon recognized that his future lay in real estate. He began buying property along the subway line that was being built uptown through Manhattan’s West Side. As his fortune grew Henry turned his attention to Midtown where he secured the land and financing for the new home of his friend Adolph Ochs’s newspaper. Thus Times Square was born. By the turn of the 20th century Henry was a rich man and a little later what now would be called a “bundler” of contributions for Woodrow Wilson’s campaign for president. As a reward Wilson named Morgenthau ambassador to the Ottoman Empire a post then known as “the Jewish seat” because the theory went a Jew could mediate between the empire’s Muslims and Christians. Though he served for only two years Henry won an honorable place in the history of the region by being one of the few outsiders to document the Turks’ genocide against the Armenian people during the early days of World War I. With his superiors in Washington preoccupied with staying out of the war Henry could only despair for the Armenians.

Back home in the States Henry faced a different kind of despair the failure of his son Henry Jr. to find his footing as an adult. Sickly and academically hopeless he didn’t graduate from high school or college; he decided that he wanted to become a gentleman farmer. Lacking better ideas Henry Sr. helped Henry Jr. buy 1700 acres in Dutchess County N.Y. Fatefully though Henry Jr. soon met a neighbor and fellow gentleman farmer Franklin D. Roosevelt. Thus began what Meier calls a “cloudless friendship” though their relationship looks more like patron and sycophant. They differed in temperament — the ebullient Roosevelt nicknamed his friend “Henry the Morgue” — but they were close for decades.

But if you arrived at Zilker Park on Friday afternoon and stayed primarily on the east end of the grounds you might have felt like you'd time-warped back to 2004.

One the American Express stage the festival's largest country-rock upstart Zach Bryan's 4 p.m. set was followed by Denver's Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats one of America's best rock & soul bands of the past decade. Across the way Grammy-winning bluegrasser Billy Strings played at 7 p.m. on the T-Mobile stage bridging the gap to big-time country/Americana headliner The Chicks.

Rateliff might have the best band of that bunch. His seven-piece Night Sweats are a supremely tight ensemble highlighted by a three-piece horn section that punched up most of the songs in an hourlong set. They lead with a good-time R&B party vibe on songs such as ""I'm on Your Side"" (from last year's album ""The Future"") and the 2015 breakthrough single ""Son of a Bitch"" but they also vary their sound enough to come across as a well-rounded band that can roam the broad range of the Americana landscape.

Rateliff didn't speak to the crowd much but that was fine. He let the music do the talking as the band squeezed 15 songs into joyful set that got much of the crowd clapping and dancing along. Accentuating the music's throwback vibe the big screens on either side of the stage displayed the onstage action in black and white a nice artistic touch.

There's nothing flashy about the way the Night Sweats dress; they were decked out mostly in black though Rateliff gave a salute to fellow fest artist Kevin Morby (who played earlier in the afternoon on the Honda stage) by wearing his T-shirt beneath a cape-like overshirt. Rateliff proved a versatile musician switching from electric guitar to acoustic guitar to keyboards when he wasn't pacing the stage and singing out loud and proud behind his bandmates' solid grooves.

The band taped an episode of the ""Austin City Limits"" TV show on Thursday night at ACL Live. They'll return to the festival next weekend same slot and same stage. That gives them one more Austin sunset to watch from the American Express stage: After cloud-cover ruled the day at Zilker Park even the sun couldn't resist popping out for the last couple songs of the Night Sweats' set. Come to think of it perhaps that song was called ""SUN of a Bitch.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9oYXdhaWlhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1iYWdnYWdlLWZlZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaiian Airlines baggage fees and how to avoid paying them,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9oYXdhaWlhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1iYWdnYWdlLWZlZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC930F0D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9oYXdhaWlhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1iYWdnYWdlLWZlZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The First United Methodist Church of Lake Charles has plenty to celebrate. This month the church turns 150. In contrast to some congregations with lower attendance after the pandemic and in spite of two hurricanes and last year’s flood FUMC is growing.

The sesquicentennial will be marked with a special service today Oct. 9 and the public is invited to attend. A contemporary service begins at 9 a.m. The traditional service is at 11 a.m. Displays of church archives and historical memorabilia will be on display from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. in Paxton Hall. Enjoy “food truck fellowship” and the Zydecane Band from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.

Membership is at 1300 and the church continues to grow according to Rev. Weldon Bares. He’s been pastor for the last 13 years the longest tenure of any pastor at the church. He said it takes a generation of faithful believers to keep any church strong and growing.

“Studies have shown that church attendance is down across the country. That is not the case here or at many other churches that I am familiar with” Bares said. “Adversity can bring us back to God and to our faith.”

The hurricane caused $3 million in damages and the church is still in the rebuilding process. Founded in Downtown Lake Charles at the corner of Broad and Bilbo in 1871 it’s not the first time the church has been damaged by high winds.

“The church had some structural damage in the 1918 hurricane” Bares said. “The bell tower was destroyed and the bell was given to Millsaps College. It’s still there today.”

Rev. Thomas Mullet was the first pastor of the church. Forty-six clergy have served in that role since. In 1928 the church built a new sanctuary at the corner of Broad and Kirkman an ideal location on major city roads.

“It is such a privilege to serve as the senior pastor of this historic church. I think back to all of the previous pastors and to the faithful laity who have gone before and pray that we will always be faithful to their hard work and to the call of Christ upon our lives” Bares said.

FUMC emphasizes mission work and service to the community. Members are involved in Abraham’s Tent Food Pantry and partnerships with a local elementary school including Lunch Buddies.

The church prepares food buckets for those recovering from storms engages in hurricane relief efforts ministers to the homeless and to the incarcerated and supports the Red Bird Mission in Beverly Kentucky.

FUMC also offers several Sunday School classes weekly Bible studies and small group opportunities and activities for children and youth.

“It is reassuring to me in so many ways that the same Gospel that was preached by Rev. Mullett the first pastor of this church is still being proclaimed today. Our culture desperately needs to hear a word of peace and grace and mercy “Bares said. “We will continue to proclaim the good news of Christ.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL21vb2R5LXMtZG93bmdyYWRlcy1wYWtpc3Rhbi13aXRoLWMtcmF0aW5nLWNpdGluZy1pbmNyZWFzZWQtZ292dC1saXF1aWRpdHktMTIyMTAwODAwMDg2XzEuaHRtbNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9tb29keS1zLWRvd25ncmFkZXMtcGFraXN0YW4td2l0aC1jLXJhdGluZy1jaXRpbmctaW5jcmVhc2VkLWdvdnQtbGlxdWlkaXR5LTEyMjEwMDgwMDA4Nl8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moody's downgrades Pakistan with 'C rating' citing increased govt liquidity,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.business-standard.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/international/moody-s-downgrades-pakistan-with-c-rating-citing-increased-govt-liquidity-122100800086_1.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC9DBC2E0>, 'Connection to www.business-standard.com timed out.

Recently in September the EU Chamber of Commerce released a report that China had become less predictable less reliable and less efficient resulting in several multinational firms considering shifting their operations out of China to other markets Financial Post reported.

According to a European Chamber of Commerce survey 50 per cent of western firms reported that business in China had become more politicised in 2021 than it was in earlier years.

""Increasing number of European businesses are putting China investments on hold and re-evaluating their positions in the market as they wait to see how long this uncertainty will continue and many are looking towards other destinations for future projects"" Vice President of the European Chamber Bettina Schoen-Behanzin was quoted by Financial Times as saying.

In 2022 the shift of multinational companies from China shows that there is a decline in trust according to Financial Post.

On October 3 American tech giant Google (local time) announced that it was shutting down the Google Translate service in mainland China citing low usage in the country as per reports.

""We are discontinuing Google Translate in mainland China due to low usage"" Google said in a statement cited by The Hill.

Earlier several media reports said that the Hong Kong version of the translation service is not accessible in the area without a virtual private network.

With this Google's announcement the American tech giant was also added to the list of other companies that left China. Amazon LinkedIn Yahoo and Microsoft are some of the companies that pulled out their operation in China.

Amazon launched Kindle an e-readers app with much fanfare in China in 2013. Stacked with millions of e-books of all interests Kindle soon became a fad among Chinese nationals reported Financial Post.

By 2019 it occupied 65 per cent of China's booming e-book market. According to ABCNews over 506 million Chinese users were reported to have accessed Kindle in 2021. Despite this in June 2022 Amazon announced shutting down its e-bookstore in China next year.

Similarly LinkedIn a social network of America's multinational technology company Microsoft announced shutting down its social network in October 2021 stating that complying with the Chinese state was becoming more challenging for it.

All the listed companies have left China with no promise of coming back to the country in the foreseeable future according to the Financial Post.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9mYXJtaW5nL2F0Yy1sZWFkcy10cmVlLXBsYW50aW5nLWluLW5ha2FzZWtlLTM5Nzc5MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ATC leads tree planting in Nakaseke | Monitor,"Last week more than 1000 trees were planted at Kiteredde village in Ssakabusolo Nakaseke District in an ambitious plan to halt deforestation in the area facing pressure for more agricultural land and charcoal fuel.

Technology company American Tower Corporation (ATC) Uganda who have embarked on the project of using available resources to avert the negative effects of climatic change say they will stop at nothing in investing in the greening campaign.

“We have invested significantly in reducing the carbon emissions We are adding our voice to many entities who care and are concerned about this threat for which we are all accountable to the future generations” says Dorothy Ssemanda the CEO ATC Uganda.

Ssemanda was leading about 30 members of staff to plant trees in a move aimed at environmental sustainability.

Ssemanda says they collaborated with the Private Sector under the Running Out of Trees (Roots) campaign spearheaded by the Ministry of Water and Environment in partnership with Tree Adoption Uganda. The campaign aims at engaging local stakeholders in attaining National Restoration Goals of restoring more than 2.5 million hectares of degraded forest landscape by 2030.

Tree Adoption Uganda chooses where trees will be planted after signing a memorandum with land owners to keep the trees for at least 15 years.

Since 2021 ATC Uganda has participated in the Roots campaign by planting trees and donating towards the purchase of tree seedlings. The target will be reviewed in 2024.

“So far we have planted 7000 trees where quarterly we come out with all our staff and put these trees in the ground” Ssemanda says. Other trees were earlier planted at Bethany Land Institute in Nandere Parish Luweero District.

Using technology the trees are mapped to make sure they are growing.

The application which is available on Google Play is used to monitor sixty tree species on the platform from planting partners partly as a form of accountability.

Currently the platform is used to monitor about 300000 trees most of them across 15 districts in northern Uganda.

Important

“Planting trees is the best thing we could ever do” says Angella Kansemire the Project Officer Tree Adoption Uganda.

Kansemire says Uganda is grappling with climate change so tree planting endeavours aimed at combating deforestation are welcome.

Tree Adoption Uganda partners companies and civil society organisations to contribute to the cause by buying tree seedlings.

Kansemire says they want to achieve the agro-forestry model.

“The trees we chose are able to make the soil better and help the crops grow” Kansemire said.

They have planted Grevillea Robusta musizi and Terminalia elliptica.

“We are trying to re-green Uganda because the rate of forest loss cover is alarming. Pertinent to our organisation we are trying to plant indigenous trees” she said.

According to National Forestry Authority (NFA) about 90 percent of Ugandans use firewood and charcoal for cooking resulting in intensified deforestation. The high demand for timber and charcoal has drastically reduced Uganda’s forest cover leading to calamities such as climate change soil degradation and loss of biodiversity.

Nakaseke is an important area for tree replanting because part of the area is for farming while the other is for cattle herders. All these activities have led to significant forest clearing.

Tree Adoption has since 2017 used smallholder farmers with more than five acres to give their land for tree planting. They have so far recruited 89 farmers in Nakaseke.

Her concern is survival rates which she says are as low as 40 percent. She attributes this to some farmers who do not care enough while some trees are funsuitable for the area.

Payments worth around £18billion are being denied to these pensioners according to Aon a firm of actuaries.

Around ten million people in the UK are members of final salary – also known as defined benefit – schemes. These are the most generous type as they pay out a guaranteed income for life based on your earnings.

Squeezed out: Hundreds of thousands of retirees with final salary pensions may be losing out on boosts to their monthly payments

However the amount of protection they offer against inflation varies wildly. Most rise with inflation every year but only up to a cap. Some schemes also offer discretionary cost-of-living top-ups when inflation exceeds the cap.

Pension scheme trustees can choose to offer these top-ups where they feel it is in the interests of scheme members and the finances of the scheme are in good enough health that they can afford to make an extra payout.

However the problem arises when UK companies have offloaded their pension schemes to giant insurance companies in so-called buyout deals. During these deals behind closed doors pensioners' discretionary rights are often signed away.

Once a pension scheme is in the hands of an insurer it is no longer looked after by a group of pension trustees with a legal responsibility to act in the interest of its members.

Instead the insurance company is simply responsible for maintaining the monthly pension income payments and has no obligation to provide extra help to members in tough financial times.

Richard Williams is director of strategy and communications at Clara a start-up pension fund consolidator where discretionary payments are still possible. He says of buyouts: 'Broadly insurers have to codify all discretions when they take on a scheme and they'll usually disappear.'

Henry Tapper chair of AgeWage and a pensions expert adds: 'Once insurers have taken on a pension scheme's liabilities via a buyout they are under no obligation to pay a penny of any excess profit generated by the scheme's assets to members.' Rising numbers of companies are offloading their pension schemes to insurers through buyouts. The deals are huge business for insurance giants such as Legal & General Rothesay Life PIC Aviva and Scottish Widows.

Actuaries Hymans Robertson estimates that the value of these buyouts could reach a staggering trillion pounds by 2031.

Which pension members will get a pay rise?

Most private sector defined benefit schemes link their annual pension increases to the Retail Prices Index of inflation but capped at five per cent or just 2.5 per cent.

Schemes that have not been subject to a buyout can then top it up. For example members of one of British Airways' schemes the APS have recently enjoyed a discretionary payment of 1.8 per cent which brought their total pension increase this year to 4.9 per cent.

Some of the stingiest schemes do not offer any inflation protection at all and rely solely on discretionary top-ups. Many trustee boards consider discretionary increases each year as part of their governance process. This year around six in ten boards have actively considered them but only a minority have awarded them.

Your pension questions Has Steve Webb answered YOUR retirement question yet? Former Pensions Minister Steve is This is Money's Agony Uncle. Here's where you can check out all his previous columns to see if any involve issues affecting you. <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/mx/money/moneypensions/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->

Bina Mistry head of UK Corporate Pensions Consulting at Willis Towers Watson says: 'Of 139 defined benefit schemes 89 scheme trustees have actively considered discretionary increases in 2022 with just 15 granting an increase.'

The value of discretionary top-ups has not been seen for nearly 30 years as inflation has remained subdued. But as RPI inflation hit 12.3 per cent in August pensioners unable to enjoy top-ups will quickly see the value of their incomes eroded. Tom Selby head of retirement policy at investment platform AJ Bell says: 'If we had five per cent inflation for five years a £10000 pension income without inflation protection would be worth £7738. If we had five per cent inflation for ten years it would be worth just £5987.'

Among those denied top-ups are the 277000 pensioners whose retirement fund has been taken over by the Pension Protection Fund. This organisation acts as a lifeboat and takes over pension schemes of companies that go bust and cannot meet their pension liabilities.

It has no power to award discretionary top-ups which means that retirees in the schemes that it controls receive a maximum increase of 2.5 per cent every year – even if inflation far exceeds that level.

The PPF says: 'We were set up by government to pay members of eligible defined benefit pension schemes compensation for their lost pensions if their employer failed. Our compensation levels – including levels of indexation – are set out in legislation.'

How do I get a top-up for my pension?

It is often up to scheme members and unions to press the case for discretionary pension increases. William McGrath chief executive of C-Suite Pension Strategies encourages them to 'be more active in raising questions about what is in their best interests'.

He adds: 'Where a pension scheme is well funded they can ask trustees for more.'

Hilary Salt a partner at First Actuarial LLP advises that members can look at whether their pension scheme has offered significant increases in the past – and then use this as a bargaining tool.",,,

That was clear on Tuesday when the county’s just-released annual crop report showed last year’s apple crop dropped in cash value almost 24% to $2.69 million as a result of the drought and bad weather during the bloom season.

That figure represents a small slice of the overall $811 million in value for agricultural crops and livestock in 2021 within Sonoma County. It’s a vital industry in which wine grapes represented two thirds of the overall value and milk another 15%.

Local growers have adapted in recent years by selling at farmers markets and local shops as well as to producers of hard cider where they can get better prices.

But there also is another valuable resource for them at the Manzana Products Co. plant in rural Sebastopol which uses organic apples to make juice cider vinegar and applesauce at the facility founded 100 years ago.

How important is the facility to local growers?

Eric Marshall whose family has farmed apples locally since the 1940s put it bluntly: “If Manzana wasn’t there I wouldn’t be doing it.”

Manzana was bought a decade ago by Agrial a French-based food company with global operations and it is committed to a long-term investment with the plant which employs 130 full-time workers said Andy Kay. He’s a British native who serves as CEO . It adds up to another 50 employees during the peak harvest time.

“I think we've invested a lot to grow the capacity since Agrial came here 10 years ago” Kay said. “Now is the time to do the renewal and make this a viable operation for the next 100 years. That's the kind of the process we're going through right now.”

That support is critical because Manzana is a key food processor that keeps local agriculture viable said Dayna Ghirardelli executive director of the Sonoma County Farm Bureau.

“They play a huge role. With every processor that goes out of business or leaves the area it creates a major strain on production and the end product” Ghirardelli said.

While local grape growers have an array of nearby wineries to crush their fruit others are not so lucky. Dairy farmers still have a few key local plants that process milk. That list includes Clover Sonoma and Straus Family Creamery in Petaluma to make it more affordable especially in transportation costs as dairy farmers have struggled amid the drought and inflation for their supplies.

Some local ranchers were blindsided when Marin Sun Farms in 2020 stopped accepting animals at its slaughterhouse for ranchers that had their own private labels. They were forced to band together and form their own cooperative to purchase a $1.2 million mobile processing plant that they put into use earlier this year.

“Every time a processor leaves the area it just makes it that much harder” Ghirardelli said.

Manzana has adjusted with changes as a result of the pandemic where it saw increased demand while also trying to keep its employees safe Kay said. Some of the workers have had decades at the plant which is one of the largest private employers in west county.

“They are extremely dedicated” he said.

The organic apple product category experienced around 5% annual growth before COVID but that jumped to 20% at the onset of the pandemic as consumers were looking for more healthy products Kay said.

For example the apple cider vinegar market went up about 40% very quickly he added. Customers use apple cider vinegar in various ways such as diluted in water or as part of a salad dressing. Others use it for cleaning and even washing their hair.

“Apple cider vinegar in the prior three years was declining” said Alissa Trinei marketing specialist for Manzana. “Once COVID hit it just immediately skyrocketed.”

The increased demand came as sourcing for apples has become more difficult.

The plant processes approximately 50000 tons of organic apples annually with about 80% trucked in from Washington State and most of the rest coming from Sonoma County growers. The Washington State yield is down 11% for the current harvest year that followed a 20% decrease from the previous year Kay said.

“We are basically in a pretty tough situation. It’s mainly climate related” he said of the Washington State crop.

Washington State is the dominant force in the market because it produces more than half of the nation’s apple crop and California is much farther behind in fifth place according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMi8xMC8wOS9hcHBsZXMtcmVjb3JkLWluY29tZS1tYWtlcy1pdC1yaWNoZXItdGhhbi1tb3N0LWNvdW50cmllc9IBaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMi8xMC8wOS9hcHBsZXMtcmVjb3JkLWluY29tZS1tYWtlcy1pdC1yaWNoZXItdGhhbi1tb3N0LWNvdW50cmllcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple's record income makes it richer than most countries,"If you buy through our links we may get a commission.

An iPhone and money.

Apple's billions upon billions in revenue is large enough to make it more valuable than most countries. Here's how Apple compares to the entire world's financial stage.

By nearly any financial measure Apple is a big deal. In January it became the world's first company to reach a market cap of $3 trillion but while it has slipped down to $2.25 trillion as of October 9 that's still an extremely impressive figure.

Arguably just as impressive is Apple's revenue during its quarterly reports with it repeatedly setting new records for revenue. Analysts may have mixed results about Apple narrowly missing expectations at times but normal people are still impressed that the revenue is reported in billions and not millions.

With Apple a goliath of the marketplace and continuing to see success it's worth remembering that those billions Apple brings in can be more than what some countries can generate.

Apple's financials put some nations to shame. And we're not even including debt for Apple or nations in question — which would move Apple even further up the list.

Why Q3?

The figures being used are based on Apple's most recent quarterly results namely the third quarter of 2022 announced in July. We'll be using the quarterly figures in our analysis rather than other higher quarters for a few good reasons.

For a start they really are the latest figures to work from. Apple does have results inbound at the end of October but these are what's available at this time.

Secondly the Q3 results are not Apple's best in the year. With high seasonality of sales the Q3 results are usually the lowest-performing of the financial year or a very close second place.

It would be a lot more impressive to use Q1 results since they are typically considerably higher than Q3. For example Q1 2022 saw Apple report $123.9 billion in revenue roughly 50% more than either Q3 2021 and Q3 2022's figures.

Using Q3's figures demonstrates how Apple can perform in its ""off-season"" results. If those figures are impressive one can only imagine how sky-high Q1 results measure up under the same analysis.

In some cases we will use a full year of data for the comparison which we will count as Q4 2021 to Q3 2022.

Country-level Revenue

To determine how big Apple's revenue is we will be using the International Monetary Fund's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures covering the year of 2021. The GDP measures the size of a country's economy including the market value of goods and services produced and sold.

The IMF's figures are based on an annual GDP measured in billions of U.S. dollars and are downloadable from its Datamapper service.

In Q3 2022 Apple reported revenue of $82.959 billion in the period. If counted as a country Apple's quarterly figure would be in 70th place behind the $83.6 billion of Oman and ahead of Sri Lanka's $82.5 billion.

Of course this is a quarter-to-annual comparison so a full-year comparison is also needed.

Apple's quarterly revenue and net profit.

Apple's last four quarters reported revenue of $387.5 billion. On the IMF GDP list Apple would qualify in at position 39 beating Malaysia ($372.7B) and just behind the Philippines ($393.6B) and Denmark ($395.7B).

In theory Apple's not far away from toppling a few big names on the list including Egypt (35th $402.8B) and the UAE (34th $409.9B). However it is miles away from worrying the biggest economies.

The lowest trillion-dollar GDP on the list is the Netherlands (18th $1018.7B) while you have to beat Korea's $1798.5B to take its tenth-place spot.

Continuing the country-level theme Apple's Q3 gross margin of $35.9B would put it in 99th place ahead of Sudan ($35.151B) and behind Estionia (98th $36.3B). The annual gross margin of $167.9B slots in between Algeria (58th 164.6B) and Qatar (57th $179.6B).

The quarter's net profit of $19.4B would be ahead of 117th Mali ($19.2B) and behind 116th Brunei ($19.9B). Annually the $99.6B would beat Ethiopia (65th $99.3B) and rest behind Ecuador (64th $106.2B).

Apple's quarterly R&D costs.

Apple's research and development spending has gradually swelled and in Q2 2022 reached $6.8 billion. Thats enough to beat 152nd place Montenegro ($5.8B).

Over the last four quarters Apple spent $25.2 billion on R&D which is more than the GDP of Bosnia and Herzegovina (111nd $22.4B) and not far off 110th place Iceland ($25.5B).

iPhone alone is bigger than Bolivia

On a product-by-product basis the iPhone continues to be the biggest contributor to Apple's bottom line but others are still seeing considerable growth. There are often comments made during results that each arm can be a massive-level company in its own right.

In Q3 Apple reported $40.665B in iPhone revenue which would put it between Bolivia (94th $39.8B) and Uganda (93rd $42.5B). The four-quarter sales total of $201.7B puts iPhone in the same region as Iraq (53rd $209.5B) and 2021 Ukraine (54th $198.3B).

The Services arm's steady growth reached $19.6B in Q3 which again is between Brunei and Mali. The four-quarter total of $77.2B is between Bulgaria (71th $80.3B) and Ghana (72nd $76.4B)

Apple's unit revenue per quarter.

Wearables Home and Accessories hauled $8.08B in Q3 sandwiching between Togo (150th $8.4B) and Guyana (151st $7.6B). Over the four quarters earning $40.4B equates to more than Bolivia and just behind Uganda again.

Both iPad and Mac managed similar Q3 revenues of $7.22B and $7.38B which is just behind Somalia (151st $7.39B). For four quarters the iPad's $30.4B beats Macao SAR (103rd $29.9B) and the Mac's $37.8B beats Estonia (98th $36.3B) but not quite Paraguay (97th $38.3B).

Apple as a person

While Apple can take on countries with its finances it can also claim quite a few scalps when put against billionaires. Apple CEO Tim Cook managed to get to 1513 place in Forbes' Richest people in the World list with $2 billion but Apple itself can go a lot further.

At $82.96 billion Apple's Q3 would be just outside the top 10 beating 12th-place Michael Bloomberg ($82 billion). The last four quarters combined at $387.5 billion would outpace Elon Musk's $219B top position and it almost beats the combined $390B fortunes of Musk and second-place Jeff Bezos ($171B).

The Q3 gross margin slots Apple in at 37th place behind Giovanni Ferrero at $36.2B with the four-quarter total bumping Apple up to third between Bezos and Bernard Arnault & Family ($158B) and above both Bill Gates (4th $129B) and Apple-favoring investment sage Warren Buffet (5th $118B).

Apple's Q3 net profit would be 84th beating the $19 billion of Reinhold Wuerth and family. The four-quarter version would slot Apple in between Larry Ellison (8th $106B) and Steve Ballmer (9th $91.4B).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FwcGxlLWluYy1yb2xscy1vdXQtbmV3LWJldGEtZmlybXdhcmUtdXBkYXRlLWZvci1pdHMtYWlycG9kcy1saW5ldXAtMTIyMTAwOTAwODY2XzEuaHRtbNIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcHBsZS1pbmMtcm9sbHMtb3V0LW5ldy1iZXRhLWZpcm13YXJlLXVwZGF0ZS1mb3ItaXRzLWFpcnBvZHMtbGluZXVwLTEyMjEwMDkwMDg2Nl8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Inc rolls out new beta firmware update for its AirPods lineup,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.business-standard.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/technology/apple-inc-rolls-out-new-beta-firmware-update-for-its-airpods-lineup-122100900866_1.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7E47E20>, 'Connection to www.business-standard.com timed out.

By Stephen Nellis Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper

(Reuters) -The Biden administration published a sweeping set of export controls on Friday including a measure to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment vastly expanding its reach in its bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances.

The rules some of which take immediate effect build on restrictions sent in letters this year to top toolmakers KLA Corp Lam Research Corp and Applied Materials Inc effectively requiring them to halt shipments of equipment to wholly Chinese-owned factories producing advanced logic chips.

The raft of measures could amount to the biggest shift in U.S. policy toward shipping technology to China since the 1990s. If effective they could hobble China's chip manufacturing industry by forcing American and foreign companies that use U.S. technology to cut off support for some of China's leading factories and chip designers.

""This will set the Chinese back years"" said Jim Lewis a technology and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) a Washington D.C.-based think tank who said the policies harken back to the tough regulations of the height of the Cold War.

""China isn't going to give up on chipmaking ... but this will really slow them (down).""

In a briefing with reporters on Thursday previewing the rules senior government officials said many of the measures were aimed at preventing foreign firms from selling advanced chips to China or supplying Chinese firms with tools to make their own advanced chips. They conceded however that they had not secured any promises that allied nations would implement similar measures and that discussions with those nations are ongoing.

""We recognize that the unilateral controls we're putting into place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don't join us"" one official said. ""And we risk harming U.S. technology leadership if foreign competitors are not subject to similar controls.""

The expansion of U.S. powers to control exports to China of chips made with U.S. tools is based on a broadening of the so-called foreign direct product rule. It was previously expanded to give the U.S. government authority to control exports of chips made overseas to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and later to stop the flow of semiconductors to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday the Biden administration applied the expanded restrictions to China's IFLYTEK Dahua Technology and Megvii Technology companies added to the entity list in 2019 over allegations they aided Beijing in the suppression of its Uyghur minority group.

The rules published on Friday also block shipments of a broad array of chips for use in Chinese supercomputing systems. The rules define a supercomputer as any system with more than 100 petaflops of computing power within a floor space of 6400 square feet a definition that two industry sources said could also hit some commercial data centers at Chinese tech giants.

Eric Sayers a defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute said the move reflects a new bid by the Biden administration to contain China's advances instead of simply seeking to level the playing field.

""The scope of the rule and potential impacts are quite stunning but the devil will of course be in the details of implementation"" he added.

Companies around the world began to wrestle with the latest U.S. action with shares of semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers falling.

The Semiconductor Industry Association which represents chipmakers said it was studying the regulations and urged the United States to ""implement the rules in a targeted way - and in collaboration with international partners - to help level the playing field.""

Earlier on Friday the United States added China's top memory chipmaker YMTC and 30 other Chinese entities to a list of companies that U.S. officials cannot inspect ratcheting up tensions with Beijing and starting a 60 day-clock that could trigger much tougher penalties.

Companies are added to the unverified list when U.S. authorities cannot complete on-site visits to determine if they can be trusted to receive sensitive U.S. technology forcing U.S. suppliers to take greater care when shipping to them.

Under a new policy announced on Friday if a government prevents U.S. officials from conducting site checks at companies placed on the unverified list U.S. authorities will start the process for adding them to the entity list after 60 days.

Entity listing YMTC would escalate already-rising tensions with Beijing and force its U.S. suppliers to seek difficult-to-obtain licenses from the U.S. government before shipping them even the most low-tech items.

The new regulations will also severely restrict export of U.S. equipment to Chinese memory chip makers and formalize letters sent to Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) restricting shipments to China of chips used in supercomputing systems that nations around the world rely on to develop nuclear weapons and other military technologies.

Reuters was first to report key details of the new curbs on memory chip makers including a reprieve for foreign companies operating in China and the moves to broaden restrictions on shipments to China of technologies from KLA Lam Applied Materials Nvidia and AMD.

South Korea's industry ministry said in a statement on Saturday there would be no significant disruption to equipment supply for Samsung and SK Hynix's existing chip production in China.

However it was necessary to minimise uncertainty through consultation with U.S. export control authorities it added.

On Saturday China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called the move an abuse of trade measures designed to reinforce the United States' ""technological hegemony"".

(1:02)

Open Extended Reactions

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were front and center Sunday in what appeared to be a happy reunion during the live roast of Tom Brady.

But according to two former players who attended the roast the former New England Patriots coach and the longtime team owner also shared some awkward moments offstage.

Julian Edelman and Drew Bledsoe discussed the three-hour roast during the latest episode of Edelman's ""Games with Names"" podcast and described the scene in the green room before the event.

""Preshow we're in the green room -- remember that? Were you in there?"" Edelman asked Bledsoe. ""Bill's opening up. He's having fun he's talking war stories talking rookie skits talking fun s--- doing s--- we know what Bill's all about but it was like amplified because he was excited to see you guys because he doesn't have a job anymore.""

Edelman and Bledsoe said they were both in the green room with Belichick along with former Patriots stars Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss when Kraft arrived.

""Then Kraft walks in ... Belichick's kind of holding court"" Bledsoe recalled. ""As he's in the middle of the story Kraft walks in and so you guys all go over to say hi to Kraft.""

""The tension in that room though could cut f---ing glass"" Edelman said.

Edelman said he tried to give Belichick a ""head's up"" when he saw Kraft walk into the green room but that Belichick did not pick up on the cue.

""[Kraft] came in and I was like 'Oh s--- there's gonna be some fireworks'"" Edelman said. ""I just walked away. I didn't want to get in there.""

Bledsoe added that Belichick and Kraft did at one point ""break it down and got together for I don't know 10 minutes at least."" But the former Patriots quarterback agreed with Edelman's assessment about the tension in the room saying ""it was very real it was very real.""

Belichick and Kraft drank a shot together on stage at one point with some coaxing from comedian Kevin Hart during Sunday's made-for-streaming live comedy show on Netflix titled ""The Greatest Roast of All Time.""

Belichick left the Patriots in January after 24 seasons with the team and there has been reported friction between the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach and Kraft over the past couple of years.

As part of an ESPN report published last month that detailed Belichick's departure from the Patriots and his inability to land the Atlanta Falcons' head-coaching job a source said Kraft called Falcons owner Arthur Blank ""to warn him not to trust Bill.""

The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice this offseason for their vacant head-coaching position before ultimately hiring Raheem Morris for the job.

After joking about the event being like a reunion and that ""unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid"" Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.

""I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me"" Kraft said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZ3Jvd2luZy10cmVuZC13b21lbi1zaW5nbGUtcGFyZW50cy1ieS1jaG9pY2Uv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvZ3Jvd2luZy10cmVuZC13b21lbi1zaW5nbGUtcGFyZW50cy1ieS1jaG9pY2Uv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A look at the growing trend of women becoming single parents by choice,"A look at the growing trend of women becoming single parents by choice

More women becoming single parents by choice

New York City — Up against her biological clock Traci Kodeck faced a tough decision at age 39.

She says she remembered the moment she decided to have a baby on her own.

""I was with my best friend and I said 'I don't have a partner I need to be a mom'"" Kodeck told CBS News.

She emptied her savings to cover fertility treatments ultimately using sperm donated by a friend. After three years of trying she had Zola.

""Then it was 'Oh my gosh I'm taking home a human.' And she was perfect"" Kodeck said.

Kodeck belongs to the organization Single Mothers by Choice. Its 30000 members are part of a growing trend of women having babies alone because they're tired of waiting for ""the one"" or they simply want to parent solo like Emma Ramos mother to 2-year-old Michael.

She describes her life as a single mother by choice as ""beautiful chaos.""

As a teenager Ramos dreamed of having a child not a partner. Modern attitudes have helped make that possible. According to a Pew Research Center survey from last year 78% of Americans find single parenting acceptable. Although more 93% support a two-parent household.

""That speaks to the misconception...that we have somehow purposefully handicapped our children by…only bringing them into the world with one parent"" Ramos said.

Ramos admits that the responsibility of shouldering the decision-making for her family does come with challenges.

""Decision-making I would say is a blessing"" Ramos said. ""But then I suppose if I make the wrong decision I'm the only one…to blame I guess.""

Zola Kodeck recently turned 11 just in time for Mother's Day.

""Having a single mom by choice can be hard like when you're first growing up but then my mom just wanted me nobody else"" Zola said. ""…Every day to me is like a Mother's Day.""

""Everything I do I do for her"" Traci said of her daughter. ""This house is for her. My job it's all for her.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWJhbmtlcnMtZGVhdGgtaWduaXRlcy1hbmdlci1hdC1sb25nLXdvcmt3ZWVrcy1jb3VsZC1wcm9tcHQtd2Fsa291dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street banker's death at 35 ignites firestorm over alleged grueling 100-hour work weeks,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWJhbmtlcnMtZGVhdGgtaWduaXRlcy1hbmdlci1hdC1sb25nLXdvcmt3ZWVrcy1jb3VsZC1wcm9tcHQtd2Fsa291dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7E04FA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWJhbmtlcnMtZGVhdGgtaWduaXRlcy1hbmdlci1hdC1sb25nLXdvcmt3ZWVrcy1jb3VsZC1wcm9tcHQtd2Fsa291dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2JpbGwtYWNrbWFuLXNjb2xkZWQtYnktd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtZXhlY3V0aXZlcy1hdC1taWxrZW4tb3Zlci1hbnRpLWRlaS1wdXNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bill Ackman Scolded By Wall Street Executives At Milken Over Anti-DEI Push,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bloomberg.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/articles/2024-05-09/bill-ackman-scolded-by-wall-street-executives-at-milken-over-anti-dei-push (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8CF7520>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2JpbGwtYWNrbWFuLXNjb2xkZWQtYnktd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtZXhlY3V0aXZlcy1hdC1taWxrZW4tb3Zlci1hbnRpLWRlaS1wdXNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2F0bGFudGEvZGVsdGEtZmxpZ2h0LW1ha2VzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1sYW5kaW5nLWF0bGFudGEtYWlycG9ydC9KNEtJQkhTSzRCQkxaSU5KNTU1SkhQSUVJVS_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NidHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYXRsYW50YS9kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQtbWFrZXMtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctYXRsYW50YS1haXJwb3J0L0o0S0lCSFNLNEJCTFpJTko1NTVKSFBJRUlVLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta flight makes emergency landing at Atlanta airport,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2F0bGFudGEvZGVsdGEtZmxpZ2h0LW1ha2VzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1sYW5kaW5nLWF0bGFudGEtYWlycG9ydC9KNEtJQkhTSzRCQkxaSU5KNTU1SkhQSUVJVS_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NidHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYXRsYW50YS9kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQtbWFrZXMtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctYXRsYW50YS1haXJwb3J0L0o0S0lCSFNLNEJCTFpJTko1NTVKSFBJRUlVLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7E068C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2F0bGFudGEvZGVsdGEtZmxpZ2h0LW1ha2VzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1sYW5kaW5nLWF0bGFudGEtYWlycG9ydC9KNEtJQkhTSzRCQkxaSU5KNTU1SkhQSUVJVS_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NidHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYXRsYW50YS9kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQtbWFrZXMtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctYXRsYW50YS1haXJwb3J0L0o0S0lCSFNLNEJCTFpJTko1NTVKSFBJRUlVLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Owns These 31 Dividend Aristocrats,"Buffett has positions in more Dividend Aristocrats than Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings reveal.

Warren Buffett loves dividends. His beloved Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.73%) (BRK.B 0.58%) owns quite a few dividend stocks. Three of them have track records of at least 25 years of dividend increases.

But you might be surprised about how many members of dividend royalty the legendary investor really owns. Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds 31 Dividend Aristocrats.

Like Baskin-Robbins

Just what is Buffett's ""secret portfolio""? In 1995 investment firm New England Asset Management (NEAM) was acquired by General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re). Three years later Berkshire bought Gen Re. NEAM doesn't hide its equity holdings; it reports them on a regular basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However these stocks are often overlooked by Buffett's followers even though they are owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

When it comes to Dividend Aristocrats these ""secret"" Buffett stocks are like Baskin-Robbins ice cream: They come in 31 flavors. Below are all 31 of the Dividend Aristocrats in NEAM's portfolio:

Company Sector Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 3M Industrials 64 Abbott Laboratories Healthcare 50 AbbVie Healthcare 50 Air Products & Chemicals Materials 40 Automatic Data Processing Information Technology 47 Becton Dickinson Healthcare 50 Chevron CVX -0.15% ) Energy 35 Church & Dwight Consumer Staples 26 Coca-Cola Consumer Staples 60 Emerson Electric Industrials 65 ExxonMobil Energy 39 General Dynamics Industrials 25 Illinois Tool Works Industrials 58 International Business Machines Information Technology 28 Johnson & Johnson Healthcare 60 Kimberly-Clark Consumer Staples 50 Linde Materials 29 Lowe's Consumer Discretionary 48 McCormick Consumer Staples 36 McDonald's Consumer Discretionary 45 Medtronic Healthcare 45 NextEra Energy Utilities 28 PepsiCo Consumer Staples 50 PPG Industries Materials 50 Procter & Gamble Consumer Staples 66 Realty Income Real Estate 28 S&P Global Financials 49 Sysco Consumer Staples 53 Target Consumer Discretionary 50 VF Corp. Consumer Discretionary 48 Walmart Consumer Staples 49

Several of the stocks on the list belong to an even more exclusive club than the Dividend Aristocrats -- the Dividend Kings. These stocks have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.

Biggest bets

Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds relatively small positions in most of these 31 Dividend Aristocrats. Chevron though stands out as a notable exception. As of the end of the second quarter of 2022 NEAM owned more than 2.15 million shares of the oil and gas giant.

Chevron also ranks as one of Berkshire's biggest bets. It's now the third-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and has performed well so far this year.

NEAM doesn't have huge stakes in any of the other Dividend Aristocrats. The next two after Chevron are AbbVie and Procter & Gamble. At the end of Q2 NEAM owned 75345 and 71551 shares of these two stocks respectively.

Best of the bunch

It isn't easy to pick the best of these Dividend Aristocrats. I think that Chevron is one of the stocks directly owned by Berkshire Hathaway that is also in NEAM's portfolio that's most likely to soar in the fourth quarter. My reasoning is that oil prices will move higher and provide a catalyst for the top energy stocks.

There are also some unstoppable trends that could benefit a few stocks on this list. For example an aging population should drive increased demand for products developed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The shift to clean energy should work to Air Products' advantage as it produces blue and green hydrogen.

Many of these stocks will probably be big winners over the next decade and beyond though. The power of growing dividends to boost total returns is no secret at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZTNtYWcuY29tL2VuL2F1dG9tYXRlZC1zdG9yYWdlLXByb2Nlc3Nlcy13aXRoLWV3bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Automated warehouse processes with EWM,"Suitable automation solution with smart system architecture and SAP Extended Warehouse Management

Transparent inventories and real-time capable processes in the supply chain as well as scalable automated solutions in the warehouse increase agility. As a holistic ERP solution S/4 Hana offers seamless access to various current and historical data. This allows suppliers and procurement processes to be analyzed and evaluated in order to develop optimal procurement strategies from these findings and reduce risks in the supply chain. For warehouse management S/4 offers SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) a scalable solution for warehouse management and control.

Supply Chain and Warehouse

In the Gartner Magic Quadrant for WMS 2022 EWM is among the leading solutions for efficiently managing inventories and fully supporting all types of warehouses and warehouse movements. SAP EWM is particularly suitable when modern highly flexible warehouse planning and work organization as well as far-reaching options for automating processes in the warehouse are required. All customer-specific requirements for warehouse processes - from goods receipt and warehousing to picking and shipping - can be covered and optimized with the modular EWM system. By seamlessly linking intralogistics processes with upstream and downstream transport and yard management processes integrated in S/4 users can control their supply chain holistically and flexibly.

Good IT rule: from as-is analysis to target concept and realization to go-live.

Against a backdrop of limited resources rising labor and workplace costs and scarce logistics space more and more companies are implementing automation solutions in their warehouses. The market for intralogistics offers a wide range of automation solutions for internal material transport storage and order picking as well as packaging and loading. But technology alone will not bring the desired success if it is not coordinated and interlocked with people processes and master data management.

In order to select the right automation solution in conjunction with the WMS the processes and the users all building blocks should therefore be taken into account as early as the planning and conception phase and the appropriate project partners selected. Supply chain architects such as LogiPlus can help with this. The EWM consulting firm has been supporting companies for around 25 years with custom-fit concepts and solutions for supply chain optimization and digitalization. Like a general planner or architect LogiPlus draws on other service providers with the relevant expertise from its network as needed. As EWM pioneers LogiPlus consultants have extensive project experience in intralogistics as well as in the integration of automated trades and processes in the warehouse. In doing so they always have a holistic view of the automation project and show various options for integrating SAP EWM with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) stacker cranes or other automation solutions such as AutoStore or warehouse lifts.

The training and enablement of the project staff and users who will later operate the system are crucial to the success of any project. Without stable and integrated processes and without involving the affected employees in the change process the desired potential of the automation solution such as increased productivity or shorter throughput times will only be partially realized. Therefore there should be differentiated training concepts and the planned organizational and process-related adjustments should be clearly communicated for example by mapping the process flows as well as the integration and decision points.

In this context the application of the technology must be appropriately trained in good time before and during commissioning so that the promised performance can also be achieved in ongoing operation. Here partners such as LogiPlus can also provide personnel support especially in the critical transition phase when changing from a manual warehouse to an automated warehouse until the processes run smoothly. This shows how important it is to also pay attention to the provider's supply chain and logistics expertise when selecting the right software implementation partner. Experienced consultants know the challenges and pain points during commissioning and bring their know-how to bear when designing the processes and workplaces.

Looking at AutoStore as a possible warehouse automation solution: Many of the companies that are looking at AutoStore in the course of automating their small parts warehouses have SAP EWM as their Warehouse Management System (WMS) in use. When selecting the appropriate warehouse automation solution it is equally important to consider the system's software integration capabilities and its technical interfaces and coupling at an early stage in addition to the physical criteria when selecting a system and vendor. AutoStore for example offers various standard interfaces (APIs) for direct connection of the system with the user company's WMS. In addition the AutoStore-live simulator can be used to test the processes around the AutoStore system before the hardware is installed. Other intralogistics vendors provide a Warehouse Control System (WCS) as middleware to enable self-contained IT integration.

Warehouse Control System

With the task and bin interface on the other hand AutoStore provides flexible integration interfaces to meet many company-specific challenges. In contrast to predefined solutions all parameters can be freely defined via a WCS. This means that the processes can be adapted to the customer's requirements and wishes. As described above the following areas must be considered during integration: Processes (onboarding migration and offboarding); Employees (organization and enablement); Master Data Management; and Technology (IT infrastructure and interfaces). This holistic approach also came into play in a project with DAW.

SCM and the associated IT architecture are an SAP software module including organization knowledge algorithms data structures.

Europe's largest private manufacturer of building paints and thermal insulation introduced AutoStore at its headquarters in Ober-Ramstadt to optimize material flow and increase efficiency. However it was only through direct integration into the existing SAP EWM system that AutoStore unfolded its full potential. One of the guarantees of success was the upstream analysis of the current situation at DAW. This guaranteed a customized connection via task interface with SAP EWM as the leading system. DAW thus benefits among other things from complete transparency in SAP EWM from consistent system-guided work and from UI5 workplace dialogs.

Due to the direct connection of Auto-Store to SAP EWM with the known interfaces no separate interface for the master data is necessary. This enables complete transparency of the inventories. The fact that no master data is transferred reduces the organizational effort in ongoing operations. This also eliminates the need for synchronization. This enables end-to-end transparency without additional effort for master data maintenance and the maintenance of an additional subordinate system. In addition the user can use the standard EWM monitoring tools and all integrated automatic trades to monitor and if necessary control them.

Resource management integrated in SAP EWM can be used for resource planning and work organization through seamless integration analogous to the other trades in the warehouse. For example the control or assignment of different ""worklists"" to personnel resources can be controlled via standard tools. The storage and retrieval strategy defined in EWM can also be viewed transparently at any time.

In addition a direct integration of the AutoStore enables the use of the so-called slotting function of the EWM system across all trades. This is a strategy for placing stock in different locations in the warehouse in order to optimize the productivity of processes such as goods receiving replenishment or picking. In this way the warehouse space can be optimally utilized and based on the physical parameters of the products it can be determined for which products it is worthwhile for them to be stored in the AutoStore. For this purpose in addition to the product parameters and the per se fast picking the effort required for storage in the AutoStore must also be taken into account. The total effort decides on the optimal place in the warehouse.

The WMS optimum with SAP EWM

Which automation solution is ultimately the right one always depends on the individual requirements of the company its products the processes required and the space available as well as other factors. In order to exploit the full potential of an automation solution all the pieces of the puzzle should be included in the consideration at an early stage in the sense of a holistic supply chain architecture. The solution must therefore also take into account the processes people and workstations as well as the existing IT infrastructure and master data. In any case with SAP EWM users have a future-proof WMS that can be expanded at any time even for complex automated processes. The software implementation partner should have appropriate supply chain and logistics experience to integrate the automated trades as efficiently as possible. Smart system architectures and standard interfaces save licensing and maintenance costs here."

Here is what Kerrisdale Capital had to say about Paycom Software Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) in its July 2022 investor letter:

“We are short shares of Paycom Software Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) a $19 billion SaaS-based payroll services company that has been one of the best performing large capitalization software stocks since it went public in 2014. Even after the market turmoil of this year Paycom trades at more than 70x the consensus estimate for this year’s free cash flow a testament to the fact that while unprofitable tech companies and temporary pandemic winners have been justly punished in the markets there’s still plenty of froth left in allegedly higher quality fare. Paycom’s valuation in particular doesn’t come close to reflecting the near term headwinds of slowing employment growth meaningful TAM saturation and increasing competitive intensity. Paycom’s steady and robust growth over the past decade has come by way of taking market share from payroll industry behemoths ADP and Paychex. Paycom has been accompanied in this quest by high-tech peers Paylocity (PCTY) and closely held BambooHR and has been buttressed by secular job growth trends in the US small and medium business sector. But Paycom is no longer a $100 million annual revenue upstart and neither are its peers. At $1.4 billion of run-rate recurring revenue the company is a scaled business and combined with Paylocity Bamboo and other dynamic tech companies in the sector the group’s share of the SME payroll market is north of 40%. That’s a lot more than the blue-sky implications of Paycom’s 5% market share claim and it means that further market share gains will be a lot more difficult going forward. At the same time ADP is fighting back increasing its customer retention rate and growing its employee rolls. Rippling and Gusto two rapidly growing startups in the space have also recently raised capital at $10-billion-plus valuations and are actively fighting for market share. All this means that the competition faced by Paycom is about to get a lot tougher. If that weren’t enough US employment growth looks to be decelerating at a fairly significant clip which means that all the payroll players will be fighting in a smaller field. For a SaaS company with an astronomical valuation like Paycom’s price cutting is probably not something investors are accustomed to thinking about but they might soon have to…” (Click here to read the full text)

“Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a leading provider of innovative customizable team-collaboration software tools for over 200000 customers. Despite positive fundamental momentum—the company recently reported 30% revenue growth and 28% trailing twelve months FCF margins—shares traded lower during Q2 as investors rotated out of high-growth stocks with elevated multiples. The company’s highly efficient sales and marketing capability combined with substantial R&D investment points to sustained long-term revenue and FCF growth. Meanwhile we recognize a recession would likely have an impact on Atlassian via slowing growth metrics. However we believe its low priced mission critical cloud tools would prove relatively resilient in this scenario. For these reasons and shares trading at a very attractive valuation for a business with highly recurring revenues strong revenue growth prospects and attractive margins we added to our position.”

Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Axon Enterprise Inc. (NYSE:AXON) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“Axon Enterprise Inc. (NYSE:AXON) is a public safety-oriented company that sells its products to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Its mission is to “…make the bullet obsolete” using non-lethal TASER® devices combined with digital cameras cloud-based software and virtual reality training. This array of technology aims to provide better relationships between law enforcement and its constituent communities and to reduce fatal outcomes dramatically when stressful confrontations occur. Axon takes its mission seriously and has an extensive ethics committee that includes members of law enforcement and activist communities. Axon claims that with usage of body cameras complaints against police departments are down 88% and use of force is down 58%. We believe the company is a premier part of the solution to prevent bad actors in law enforcement and the mistrust that has resulted from those bad actors. The company has three major product lines: first high-definition cameras (sensor division) worn on the body or mounted on vehicles (newer products incorporate live streaming and automated license plate readers); second subscription-based digital evidence software (evidence.com) that stores body camera and third-party video allowing for evidentiary chain of custody search and report writing (officer court time reduced by 70%); and third non-lethal TASER devices (that can temporarily incapacitate dangerous and violent actors using an electrical shock) that save lives by avoiding discharging firearms (the company claims 258000 lives have been saved so far). When used in combination its cameras provide GPS officer location and live streaming while its software can provide real-time operations mapping of active situations. In the future Axon seeks to add consumer safety products (launching in 2022) that will automatically notify 911 if deployed drone-based camera products more VR training and additional cloud-based software including evidence software usable by prosecutors and defense attorneys which could be a $1 billion market on its own. From a financial perspective the company is really built upon recurring revenue – it is not a one-time device sales company. Software made up 28.5% of 2021 revenues. And while hardware made up 43% of 2021 sales about two-thirds of that is now bundled under long-term deals so really only about 15% of the company’s total revenue is one time in nature. The remaining 27% of sales is warranty and cartridge consumables which are largely recurring as well. As software grows as a proportion of revenue (to what we believe will be over 40% by 2026) margins should expand. We believe that EBITDA margins can expand from 20% in 2021 to nearly 30% by 2026. Revenue growth which was nearly 27% in 2021 should continue at over 20% given that the company is less than 2% penetrated into its $52 billion addressable market. Finally the company has over $400 million of cash and no debt on its balance sheet. When combined with its significant free cash flow (about 75% of EBITDA converts to free cash flow) Axon has significant capital to grow its business complete accretive acquisitions and potentially return capital to shareholders.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped about 4% to a five-week high on Friday lifted again by an OPEC+ decision this week to make its largest supply cut since 2020 despite concern about a possible recession and rising interest rates.

Oil rallied for the fifth day in a row even as the dollar moved higher after data showing the U.S. economy was creating jobs at a strong pace gave the Federal Reserve a reason to continue hefty interest rate hikes.

A strong greenback can pressure oil demand making dollar-denominated crude more expensive for other currency holders.

Brent futures rose $3.50 or 3.7% to settle at $97.92 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $4.19 or 4.7% to end at $92.64.

That was the highest close for Brent and WTI since Aug. 30. The price jump pushed both benchmarks into technically overbought territory for the first time since August for Brent and June for WTI.

Both contracts posted their second straight weekly gains and their biggest weekly percentage gains since March this week with Brent was up about 11% and WTI 17% higher.

U.S. heating oil futures jumped 19% this week to their highest close since June boosting the heating oil crack spread - a measure of refining profit margins - to its highest close on record according to Refinitiv data going back to December 2009.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia known as OPEC+ agreed this week to lower their output target by 2 million barrels per day.

""Among the key ramifications of OPEC's latest cut is a likely return of $100 oil"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.

UBS Global Wealth Management also projected Brent would ""move above the $100 bbl mark over the coming quarters.""

The OPEC+ cut comes ahead of a European Union embargo on Russian oil and will squeeze supply in an already tight market.

OPEC Secretary General Haitham al-Ghais said the output target cuts will leave OPEC+ with more supply to tap in the event of any crises.

On Thursday U.S. President Joe Biden expressed disappointment over the OPEC+ plans. He and U.S. officials said Washington was looking at all possible alternatives to keep prices from rising.

However the U.S. oil rig count an early indicator of future production fell by two this week to 602 according to energy services firm Baker Hughes Co as high inflation forces producers to spend more money to secure workers and equipment. [RIG/U]

""Oil futures prices are managing to gain upside traction even though widespread inflation across the U.S. and Europe is threatening the potential for a global recession where demand will likely take a sizeable hit"" analysts at energy consulting firm Gelber & Associates said.

In Europe divisions between EU leaders over capping gas prices and national rescue packages resurfaced with Poland accusing Germany of ""selfishness"" in its response to a winter energy crunch caused by Russia's war in Ukraine.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"After a shower you probably throw your bath towel over a wall hook to dry. It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

BATH Maine — To address a growing need for diverse housing options a new affordable apartment complex was built in Bath and on Wednesday locals got to take a look during a grand opening.



Made possible through several tax credits and the guidance of MaineHousing the new 60-unit complex was developed by The Szanton Company and sits on the corner of Front and Summer streets.



Forty-two units will be reserved for those 55 and older and cost between $800 and $1500 a month to rent according to the developers.

""The mission of The Szanton Company is to create rental apartments that are moderate- to low-income which our tenants are proud to call home"" company President Nathan Szanton said at the grand opening.



The building also features several community spaces a rooftop deck and some mixed-use retail spaces some of which have already been renting before renovations and changes. Bookstore owner Jim Rice said as a retail and housing tenant seeing more affordable housing come to the downtown area is much-needed.

""Bath is in demand. It's really popular now and it's gotten more expensive"" Rice said. ""For me being right by the bookstore is ideal.""



With employers drawing folks to the midcoast area in recent years Bath Housing Authority Executive Director Deborah Keller said she is hopeful the development will address a need for diverse housing options in the greater Bath area."

Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Owns These 31 Dividend Aristocrats,"Buffett has positions in more Dividend Aristocrats than Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings reveal.

Warren Buffett loves dividends. His beloved Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.73%) (BRK.B 0.58%) owns quite a few dividend stocks. Three of them have track records of at least 25 years of dividend increases.

But you might be surprised about how many members of dividend royalty the legendary investor really owns. Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds 31 Dividend Aristocrats.

Like Baskin-Robbins

Just what is Buffett's ""secret portfolio""? In 1995 investment firm New England Asset Management (NEAM) was acquired by General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re). Three years later Berkshire bought Gen Re. NEAM doesn't hide its equity holdings; it reports them on a regular basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However these stocks are often overlooked by Buffett's followers even though they are owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

When it comes to Dividend Aristocrats these ""secret"" Buffett stocks are like Baskin-Robbins ice cream: They come in 31 flavors. Below are all 31 of the Dividend Aristocrats in NEAM's portfolio:

Company Sector Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 3M Industrials 64 Abbott Laboratories Healthcare 50 AbbVie Healthcare 50 Air Products & Chemicals Materials 40 Automatic Data Processing Information Technology 47 Becton Dickinson Healthcare 50 Chevron CVX -0.15% ) Energy 35 Church & Dwight Consumer Staples 26 Coca-Cola Consumer Staples 60 Emerson Electric Industrials 65 ExxonMobil Energy 39 General Dynamics Industrials 25 Illinois Tool Works Industrials 58 International Business Machines Information Technology 28 Johnson & Johnson Healthcare 60 Kimberly-Clark Consumer Staples 50 Linde Materials 29 Lowe's Consumer Discretionary 48 McCormick Consumer Staples 36 McDonald's Consumer Discretionary 45 Medtronic Healthcare 45 NextEra Energy Utilities 28 PepsiCo Consumer Staples 50 PPG Industries Materials 50 Procter & Gamble Consumer Staples 66 Realty Income Real Estate 28 S&P Global Financials 49 Sysco Consumer Staples 53 Target Consumer Discretionary 50 VF Corp. Consumer Discretionary 48 Walmart Consumer Staples 49

Several of the stocks on the list belong to an even more exclusive club than the Dividend Aristocrats -- the Dividend Kings. These stocks have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.

Biggest bets

Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds relatively small positions in most of these 31 Dividend Aristocrats. Chevron though stands out as a notable exception. As of the end of the second quarter of 2022 NEAM owned more than 2.15 million shares of the oil and gas giant.

Chevron also ranks as one of Berkshire's biggest bets. It's now the third-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and has performed well so far this year.

NEAM doesn't have huge stakes in any of the other Dividend Aristocrats. The next two after Chevron are AbbVie and Procter & Gamble. At the end of Q2 NEAM owned 75345 and 71551 shares of these two stocks respectively.

Best of the bunch

It isn't easy to pick the best of these Dividend Aristocrats. I think that Chevron is one of the stocks directly owned by Berkshire Hathaway that is also in NEAM's portfolio that's most likely to soar in the fourth quarter. My reasoning is that oil prices will move higher and provide a catalyst for the top energy stocks.

There are also some unstoppable trends that could benefit a few stocks on this list. For example an aging population should drive increased demand for products developed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The shift to clean energy should work to Air Products' advantage as it produces blue and green hydrogen.

Many of these stocks will probably be big winners over the next decade and beyond though. The power of growing dividends to boost total returns is no secret at all.",,,,,,,,,

Munger earned $2 for ten hours of labor in the 1930’s before he went off to college.

He’s originally from Omaha and left to attend the University of Michigan to become a meteorologist in the army during World War II. He later ended up earning a degree from Harvard Law School the funny thing is that Harvard Business School rejected Buffett’s application.

Warren Buffett was rejected by the Harvard Business School in 1950. “I spent 10 minutes with the Harvard alumnus who was doing the interview and he assessed my capabilities and turned me down” Buffett recalled. The lesson? Choose yourself.

Munger reconnected with Buffett at a dinner party in 1959. This shows the real power of networking in the right circles as that dinner party made Munger billions through their business partnership.

Munger ended up back with Buffett as vice chairman of the corporate insurance holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Charlie Munger is Warren Buffett’s business partner and most trusted friend and advisor.

Munger is the chairman of the publisher Daily Journal Corp. and sits on the board of one of his top holding the retailer Costco.

Munger is a very pragmatic investor that looks for real business value at a great price with the potential for future cash flows and growth very similar to Buffett.

What is in Charlie Munger’s portfolio?

Munger believes in holding a concentrated portfolio of his top picks that he is an expert on. He is currently very heavily weighted in the finance sector with the top U.S. banks. He is also bullish on online retailing in China however he did recently reduce his Alibaba position by 50% this year.

Long Bets launched in 2002 as a project of the nonprofit Long Now Foundation.

The project on which people can place bets on the future was funded by two grants from tech billionaire Jeff Bezos.

In 2018 Warren Buffett won a $2 million wager he placed in 2008.

From who'll win the World Series in a few years to theories on the vastness of the universe for years the Long Bets website has allowed many to place pricey long-term bets on the future of humanity.

Notable businessman Warren Buffett won a bet in 2017 that he'd placed on the website nearly 10 years prior. In 2008 Buffett asserted that the ""S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds when performance is measured on a basis net of fees costs and expenses.""

Then his prediction was challenged by Protégé Partners and both parties wagered a $320000 investment according to a report from Long Now. Buffett invested in the Vanguard index fund while Protégé chose five unnamed hedge funds of funds.

The exact terms of their bet were confidential but Buffett won $2.2 million in winnings which then was dedicated to a charity of his choice.

Although the Long Bets site has been open to anyone for several years to make scientific or societal predictions Gen Z TikTokers are just now finding out about it.

Buffett was challenged by Protege Partners LLC at over $2 million stakes. Buffett won in 2017. Long Bets

The buzz started with a viral video about a 10000-year clock being built by Jeff Bezos and the Long Now Foundation of which Long Bets is a part. Commenters were fascinated by the creator's mention of Long Bets.

""I wanna hear about these long bets"" one comment read and hundreds echoed the sentiment.

On the creator's follow-up video explaining the site the concept was met with mixed reactions.

""They should make a movie about this"" one comment read.

""This sounds like money laundering or tax evasion haha"" another one read.

Whether skeptical or enthusiastic comments from TikTokers showed they wanted to know more about the long-term wagers.







""This is so fascinating. What do they 'win' if their bets come to fruition"" one user asked.

Buffett's proceeds went to Girls Inc. of Omaha in his hometown. The organization has helped underserved girls in the area since 1975. ""I just told (Executive Director Roberta Wilhelm) to use it where it's going to do the most good"" Buffett said in 2018.

Like Buffett gamblers must choose a charity to which their winnings will be donated once the duration of the bet ends. That way if you're betting on an event happening 100 years from now the money can still be used as the winner intended.

The minimum period of prediction time starts at two years and there's no maximum amount of time. So yes betters can make a prediction about something hundreds of years in the future and some have.

This prediction remains unchallenged and we won't know if it's correct for nearly 1000 years. Long Bets

In order to publish a prediction you must present an argument and pay a $50 fee. If the prediction is challenged by another user the minimum stakes for a long bet on the site from either side is $200 according to Long Bets' rules.

Long Bets was launched nearly two decades ago thanks to two grants from billionaire Bezos. It's a project of the Long Now Foundation – a nonprofit organization established in 1996 ""to foster long-term thinking"" according to its official website. Bezos is arguably the foundation's most notable member.

The Long Now Foundation adjudicates bets and sees that the proceeds are donated to the correct charity.

Co-founder Kevin Kelly said a 1995 bet about the fate of the world in 2020 inspired the launch of the site.

""The bet forced both of us to refine strongly held beliefs and because our predictions were now public our reputations were on the line"" Kelly wrote. ""This is what public wagers can do: sharpen logic filter out the halfhearted. Sometimes they can even alter collective views and shape society.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jdXJyZW5jeS1wcm9ibGVtLWRvbGxhcnMtc3VyZ2UtMjAtMDkwMDAwNjkwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Our currency your problem': The dollar's surge to 20-year highs is causing headaches around the world a Goldman ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jdXJyZW5jeS1wcm9ibGVtLWRvbGxhcnMtc3VyZ2UtMjAtMDkwMDAwNjkwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7BCA260>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jdXJyZW5jeS1wcm9ibGVtLWRvbGxhcnMtc3VyZ2UtMjAtMDkwMDAwNjkwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Here is what Kerrisdale Capital had to say about Paycom Software Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) in its July 2022 investor letter:

“We are short shares of Paycom Software Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) a $19 billion SaaS-based payroll services company that has been one of the best performing large capitalization software stocks since it went public in 2014. Even after the market turmoil of this year Paycom trades at more than 70x the consensus estimate for this year’s free cash flow a testament to the fact that while unprofitable tech companies and temporary pandemic winners have been justly punished in the markets there’s still plenty of froth left in allegedly higher quality fare. Paycom’s valuation in particular doesn’t come close to reflecting the near term headwinds of slowing employment growth meaningful TAM saturation and increasing competitive intensity. Paycom’s steady and robust growth over the past decade has come by way of taking market share from payroll industry behemoths ADP and Paychex. Paycom has been accompanied in this quest by high-tech peers Paylocity (PCTY) and closely held BambooHR and has been buttressed by secular job growth trends in the US small and medium business sector. But Paycom is no longer a $100 million annual revenue upstart and neither are its peers. At $1.4 billion of run-rate recurring revenue the company is a scaled business and combined with Paylocity Bamboo and other dynamic tech companies in the sector the group’s share of the SME payroll market is north of 40%. That’s a lot more than the blue-sky implications of Paycom’s 5% market share claim and it means that further market share gains will be a lot more difficult going forward. At the same time ADP is fighting back increasing its customer retention rate and growing its employee rolls. Rippling and Gusto two rapidly growing startups in the space have also recently raised capital at $10-billion-plus valuations and are actively fighting for market share. All this means that the competition faced by Paycom is about to get a lot tougher. If that weren’t enough US employment growth looks to be decelerating at a fairly significant clip which means that all the payroll players will be fighting in a smaller field. For a SaaS company with an astronomical valuation like Paycom’s price cutting is probably not something investors are accustomed to thinking about but they might soon have to…” (Click here to read the full text)

“Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a leading provider of innovative customizable team-collaboration software tools for over 200000 customers. Despite positive fundamental momentum—the company recently reported 30% revenue growth and 28% trailing twelve months FCF margins—shares traded lower during Q2 as investors rotated out of high-growth stocks with elevated multiples. The company’s highly efficient sales and marketing capability combined with substantial R&D investment points to sustained long-term revenue and FCF growth. Meanwhile we recognize a recession would likely have an impact on Atlassian via slowing growth metrics. However we believe its low priced mission critical cloud tools would prove relatively resilient in this scenario. For these reasons and shares trading at a very attractive valuation for a business with highly recurring revenues strong revenue growth prospects and attractive margins we added to our position.”

Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Axon Enterprise Inc. (NYSE:AXON) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“Axon Enterprise Inc. (NYSE:AXON) is a public safety-oriented company that sells its products to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Its mission is to “…make the bullet obsolete” using non-lethal TASER® devices combined with digital cameras cloud-based software and virtual reality training. This array of technology aims to provide better relationships between law enforcement and its constituent communities and to reduce fatal outcomes dramatically when stressful confrontations occur. Axon takes its mission seriously and has an extensive ethics committee that includes members of law enforcement and activist communities. Axon claims that with usage of body cameras complaints against police departments are down 88% and use of force is down 58%. We believe the company is a premier part of the solution to prevent bad actors in law enforcement and the mistrust that has resulted from those bad actors. The company has three major product lines: first high-definition cameras (sensor division) worn on the body or mounted on vehicles (newer products incorporate live streaming and automated license plate readers); second subscription-based digital evidence software (evidence.com) that stores body camera and third-party video allowing for evidentiary chain of custody search and report writing (officer court time reduced by 70%); and third non-lethal TASER devices (that can temporarily incapacitate dangerous and violent actors using an electrical shock) that save lives by avoiding discharging firearms (the company claims 258000 lives have been saved so far). When used in combination its cameras provide GPS officer location and live streaming while its software can provide real-time operations mapping of active situations. In the future Axon seeks to add consumer safety products (launching in 2022) that will automatically notify 911 if deployed drone-based camera products more VR training and additional cloud-based software including evidence software usable by prosecutors and defense attorneys which could be a $1 billion market on its own. From a financial perspective the company is really built upon recurring revenue – it is not a one-time device sales company. Software made up 28.5% of 2021 revenues. And while hardware made up 43% of 2021 sales about two-thirds of that is now bundled under long-term deals so really only about 15% of the company’s total revenue is one time in nature. The remaining 27% of sales is warranty and cartridge consumables which are largely recurring as well. As software grows as a proportion of revenue (to what we believe will be over 40% by 2026) margins should expand. We believe that EBITDA margins can expand from 20% in 2021 to nearly 30% by 2026. Revenue growth which was nearly 27% in 2021 should continue at over 20% given that the company is less than 2% penetrated into its $52 billion addressable market. Finally the company has over $400 million of cash and no debt on its balance sheet. When combined with its significant free cash flow (about 75% of EBITDA converts to free cash flow) Axon has significant capital to grow its business complete accretive acquisitions and potentially return capital to shareholders.”

(NYSE:BLK) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 80% of the company,"Every investor in BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 80% stake institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about BlackRock.

See our latest analysis for BlackRock

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About BlackRock?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

BlackRock already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at BlackRock's earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. BlackRock is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group Inc. is currently the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. With 5.3% and 4.6% of the shares outstanding respectively Kuwait and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of BlackRock

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Story continues

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in BlackRock Inc.. Insiders own US$853m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

General Public Ownership

With a 14% ownership the general public mostly comprising of individual investors have some degree of sway over BlackRock. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for BlackRock you should be aware of.

There was a time when sustainability was considered the preserve of the truly offbeat by those of us still asleep at the wheel when it came to environmental matters.

Regarding the progress of the songwriting and recording sessions for the follow-up to 2020's ""The Human Condition"" album he said: ""We started working on the new record this summer. And we've got about… I think there's about eight songs right now that we had done and we're gonna go back in in December and finish up the rest. So [it's] a really really cool situation.

""We've got our own theater back in Glasgow Kentucky where Ben [Wells guitar] lives. We do our home shows there; we do it every two years at Christmas. So we recorded the drums in this big beautiful theater. And they just sound incredible; even with me playing they sound incredible. And we're going to my house to do vocals and guitars. So [it's] really cool man. I think people will really love the songs and the playing.

""We recorded 'The Human Condition' in 2020 and when we were doing that everything with COVID it was really starting to rise up"" John added. ""And we got done with that record two days before our state locked us down. So we were lucky to get that done. It's wild because we're just now playing that record here in Paris and throughout Europe. But I think probably next year early next year we'll have a new record out.""

As for the musical and lyrical direction of the new BLACK STONE CHERRY material John said: ""The first seven or eight [songs] we had done are really… The lyrics on them are very heartfelt and great. The music is really heavy but also there's the BLACK STONE CHERRY ballad or two so… I can't give away too much [laughs] 'cause I don't even know what the other ones sound like yet 'cause we haven't really finished those.""

This past August BLACK STONE CHERRY vocalist Chris Robertson told ""Rock Of Nations With Dave Kinchen & Shane McEachern"" about the band's upcoming LP: ""We've got nine songs completely written and about seven more that we've gotta write lyrics and stuff to. But we've been at it man. And it's good. It's heavy. It's melodic. I think it's gonna be a great record.""

Regarding the lyrical inspiration for BLACK STONE CHERRY's new songs Chris said: ""It's crazy because the songs we write… Obviously we write songs that are fun — like 'Blame It On The Boom Boom' and 'White Trash Millionaire' — a lot of fun stuff but we also write some more serious songs.

""It's different man"" he continued. ""We've been writing and stuff. And it's crazy. For me right now the stuff that's kind of coming out is a lot related to my dad passing a lot of understanding how to deal with this loss and grief and just learning to live through it.

""The serious songs we write are stuff that we've either witnessed or we've lived or whatever"" Chris explained. ""Other than a song like 'Rain Wizard' or some of the stuff we wrote that was more folklory everything we've written is something we've lived. So there's a hell of a lot in the well now. I went a really long way of saying that but the well is very deep now of things to write about.""

BLACK STONE CHERRY's seventh studio album ""The Human Condition"" was made available in October 2020 via Mascot Records/Mascot Label Group.

In June 2021 BLACK STONE CHERRY announced the departure of bassist Jon Lawhon. He has since been replaced on the road by Steve Jewell Jr. the guitarist from the Glasgow Kentucky band OTIS.

The digital-only release of an expanded edition of ""The Human Condition"" was made available in August 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHl3YXRjaGxhLmNvbS92b2ljZXMvMjU2ODMtc3RlcGhlbi1zY2h3YXJ6bWFuLWtpbGxlci1vZi1jYS1yZW50LWNvbnRyb2wtbWVhc3VyZXMtYnV5cy04OS0yLW1pbGxpb24tbWFuc2lvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stephen Schwarzman Killer of CA Rent Control Measures Buys $89.2 Million Mansion,"CORPORATE LANDLORD - While millions of renters struggle to make ends meet corporate landlord Stephen Schwarzman whose company spent mountains of cash to successfully kill rent control ballot measures in California has bought another multi-million-dollar mansion according to a news report.

Schwarzman already owns posh homes in New York Palm Beach Saint-Tropez and Jamaica. One of the richest people on earth Schwarzman made his fortune by carrying out predatory business practices that fueled the global housing affordability crisis United Nations housing experts have said.

Schwarzman a staunch foe of rent control is the co-founder of Blackstone Group one of the world’s largest corporate landlords. CEOWorld recently estimated Schwarzman’s net worth to be $29 billion. In 2018 and 2020 Blackstone shelled out millions in campaign contributions to defeat California ballot measures that would have repealed or reformed statewide rent control restrictions. For the 2020 campaign Housing Is A Human Right caught Schwarzman and Blackstone trying to dodge public scrutiny by using a shell committee to funnel millions to No on Prop 21.

In 2019 United Nations housing experts Leilani Farha and Surya Deva wrote a letter to Schwarzman criticizing Blackstone for using “its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate housing consistent with international human rights law.” Farha and Deva also wrote that Blackstone is one of the leading companies that fuels the global housing affordability crisis.

In 2020 Housing Is A Human Right published a widely read special report about the controversial billionaire titled “Modern-Day Robber Baron: The Sins of Stephen Schwarzman.”It detailed his rise as a cutthroat executive; his political and financial connections to former President Donald Trump; and his charitable giving to major institutions so he could whitewash his predatory business practices among other sins.

Last month City A.M. a news site based in England reported Schwarzman had bought a sprawling 2000-acre estate in the English countryside for $89.2 million (or 80 million pounds) – a staggering sum of cash. While renters in the United States and around the globe can barely afford one small apartment Schwarzman is reportedly “excited” to spend even more big bucks on restoring his new mansion.

That lavish spending has been funded by Blackstone’s massive real estate holdings which include apartment buildings and single-family homes around the globe. Farha and Deva found that “Blackstone’s and its subsidiaries’ business model is pushing low-income and increasingly middle-income people from their homes. Blackstone’s practices… have abruptly increased the rental payments of single-family rentals making them unaffordable for millions of existing residents decreased the availability and affordability of social housing and has undertook aggressive evictions to protect rental income streams to satisfy investors.”

Then after all that human wreckage Schwarzman goes out and buys an $89.2 million estate called Conholt Park in South West England.

To protect his enormous revenue streams and penchant for buying opulent homes Stephen Schwarzman and Blackstone are expected to oppose any kind of major rent control legislation or ballot measure in the United States. But the billionaire will have his hands full: a national rent control movement spearheaded by a coalition of tenants housing justice groups labor unions and social justice organizations continues to gain momentum in the U.S. Schwarzman will need to explain his need to own five extravagant mansions when millions of tenants can’t even afford one studio apartment.

At the tail end of last year that’s exactly what happened – and anyone involved in software development should take note.

The event was a memorandum decision from the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware which framed its response to a matter relating to software vulnerability. This decision which caused Boeing to settle for an eye-watering $237.5 million (approximately £210 million) will change the commercial landscape for good.

Up to this point there have been numerous instances where vulnerabilities in IT systems have been left unaddressed yet directors have managed a lucky escape. Times however are changing. There are two key learnings for anyone involved with software development. First shareholders investors and lawyers are now equipped with a better understanding of exploits and the steps that should be taken to address known significant threats. Second they’re no longer prepared to stomach losses when directors and management fail to exercise reasonable care skill and diligence.

This better understanding coupled with investors no longer prepared to weather poor decision-making means the days of escaping legal liability due to poorly configured code failing to address reasonably foreseeable flaws or overlooking known threats are gone. Shareholders are awake and class actions will follow. Management's luck has run out.

Revisiting a lucky escape for Sony

In November 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) fell foul of a destructive cyber attack launched by a nation-state actor. Shortly after the attack began SPE ground to a standstill. Half of its personnel couldn’t access their PCs while half of its servers had been wiped.

Sensitive information relating to contracts was soon released into the wild and unflattering comments contained in emails found their way into headlines. Five films that were set to be released were uploaded to the internet. The business disruption coupled with the financial losses and the reputational damage were difficult to assess but likely astronomical.

The prevailing theory is that North Korea used a phishing email to gain entry although some suggest it would have been as easy to have someone to launch the attack in-person. The physical security according to experts brought in to assist was woefully inadequate. Once they’d gained access poor security and the absence of basic cyber security hygiene allowed the bad actors to run amok in Sony’s systems.

It wasn’t all bad luck though as its corporate structure meant investors were a degree of separation away from the targeted entity. SPE is part of Sony Group and it is Sony Group that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Whether investors would have been more active if they had felt losses directly is difficult to say. SPE also benefited from the timing. In 2014 investors were easier to hoodwink. Attributing the attack to a nation state gave the whole sorry debacle an air of inevitability.

What could you possibly do? Well for one you could do the minimum and start by taking reasonable care such as implementing a physical security policy and making sure you address threats like phishing right? This is where the rubber meets the runway.

Boeing shareholder class action

The facts surrounding this matter are desperately sad. For the purposes of corporate law and shareholder class action nearly 400 people were killed in two separate incidents. Although that fact doesn’t form part of the submission or reasoning it seems callous to overlook the human cost of this corporate error. The opinion itself runs to over 100 pages. This is intended as a snapshot of what happened why the claimant shareholders succeeded in their claim and finally what directors should do to avoid liability.

So what happened? Boeing’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was designed as a workaround to solve an engineering problem. The engineering problem had been baked in when Boeing in its haste to try to keep pace with a competitor rushed the technical drawing phase. Boeing’s new plane the 737 Max would have a larger engine. But that shifted the plane’s centre of gravity causing the plane to send its nose skywards.

Rather than return to the drawing board MCAS was born. This software would lift the tail and push its nose down. The software was triggered by a single sensor. Boeing knew that this sensor was highly vulnerable to false readings. That sensor was a single point of failure and it was known to not work properly. On both occasions minutes after take-off after experiencing difficulty the pilots searched the handbook followed best practice but could not regain control of the plane. Nobody had explained this problem to pilots or regulators.

As a result of these air disasters Boeing suffered significant disruption. The entire 737 Max fleet was grounded which resulted in financial losses a $200 million (roughly £178 million) fine and reputational harm. The court in reaching its decision reasoned the directors demonstrated a complete failure by neglecting to establish a reporting system or addressing known significant problems.

The consequences in turn can adversely affect a company firm and its share value which fast-tracks its way to shareholder class actions. With respect to bad coding unaddressed software vulnerabilities or cyber security threats this is the matter that lawyers will look to.

What can we learn from the Boeing debacle?

Protecting your business from myriad threats may seem daunting but there are good general rules to follow. To reference a report from the 1989 Marchioness Disaster risk assessments try to assess relevant risks so appropriate steps can be taken to eliminate or minimise them. Whether it’s a widget policy protocols or even code it’s elementary risk management to address any and all known threats.

What sources might IT directors engineers or consultants rely on to provide to assist them in avoiding liability? Building in defensibility is about taking reasonable care. That means any information revealed by a reasonable search ought to be addressed – or there must be extensive contemporaneous notes justifying the decision not to implement with details provided by the decision maker(s).

For example IT directors and consultants would do well to implement a well-regarded framework such as that provided by the National Institute of Standards in Technology (NIST). Moreover each sector should ensure they read reports directed at their sector. For example Interpol wrote a report for healthcare agencies across Europe warning about ransomware 12 months before the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) was targeted in the Conti attack. Similarly the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) published a report into threats targeting the legal sector.

Ultimately it’s not the unknown or unknowable events that could represent an existential threat to your business but what you do know – but don’t act on – that could be the most painful. This decision will usher in a new sense of urgency for businesses to adopt global industry standards as a minimum to address the reasonably foreseeable exploits. From now on you must avoid the avoidable or face the consequences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mbHlib25kaS1yZWNlaXZlcy04dGgtYm9laW5nLTczNy04MDBuZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Argentina's Flybondi Receives 8th Boeing 737-800NG,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='simpleflying.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /flybondi-receives-8th-boeing-737-800ng/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA49F310>, 'Connection to simpleflying.com timed out.

Every official signal points to a bumpy last leg of certification for the 737 Max 7 and Max 10 which are now both sliding later into 2023 according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

Related: Inside the convoluted politics of certifying the last 737 Max models

The Air Current reported in July that Boeing and the FAA were already planning Max 10 flight tests for the first quarter of next year. Now Reuters reports that the FAA’s expectation is a certification of the 737 Max 10 no earlier than summer 2023. Key milestones for the Max 10 remain outstanding including its FAA Type Inspection Authorization which formally initiates the FAA’s participation in flight trials and an ongoing crew alerting study by the FAA and European regulators.

With the aircraft certification reform bill passed in 2020 mandating a comprehensive cockpit alerting system on any transport aircraft cleared by the FAA after December 2022 Boeing is on the hook for a potentially major revamp for the Max 10 — unless it gets relief from the U.S. Congress.

Wisk’s autonomy strategy doesn’t have to be viable to be disruptive

When Boeing-backed Wisk unveiled the design of its “Gen 6” autonomous electric air taxi on Monday it strove to convey the impression that it is close on the heels of its piloted rivals in the race to certification. While coyly declining to provide a target date for entry into service — that will be up to the regulators said CEO Gary Gysin — the company has implied that uncrewed urban air mobility operations will be well established in the U.S. by the end of the decade.

Gysin emphasized that Wisk has “submitted” its G-1 certification basis to the Federal Aviation Administration and is “actively engaged on the G-2” means of compliance thus seeming to put it within striking distance of leading electric vertical take-off and landing developers like Joby Aviation. However he would not confirm whether “submitted” means that Wisk is still on the first of four stages in the G-1 process which can take years from start to finish and is yet only the beginning of certification.

This selective appeal to arcane certification documents has come up before in the eVTOL industry which has come to view the FAA’s G-1 and G-2 issue papers as critical yardsticks of progress. However the fuzziness around Wisk’s G-1 is especially significant because it obscures just how close — or more likely how far — the FAA is from moving forward with autonomous passenger-carrying operations.

Wisk with wings to glide picks skids not wheels

Thanks to Wisk’s patent infringement lawsuit against Archer Aviation (which is still grinding its way through the courts) close industry watchers had a pretty good idea of what the company’s sixth-generation eVTOL would look like before it was revealed to the world on Oct. 3. Indeed the aircraft features the “12-tilt-6” design that is at the heart of the dispute with 12 propellers arranged around a fixed wing the front six of which tilt forward for cruise flight.

Related: FAA changes course on eVTOL certification

Gen 6 is chunkier than the aircraft depicted in the confidential patent design that Wisk claims Archer stole. It embodies some other changes too including a shift to four blades for both front and rear props and a conventional rather than a V tail. But one perplexing design feature persists: the choice of skids over wheeled landing gear (which featured on Wisk’s earlier public prototypes).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuMTAwa25vdHMuY29tL2JvZWluZy1wbGFuZXMtaGF2ZS15b2tlcy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lcy1oYXZlLXNpZGUtc3RpY2tzLXdoeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing Planes Have Yokes and Airbus Have Side Sticks.

Styled by Leonardo Fioravanti and bodied by Turinese coachbuilder Pininfarina the 365 GT4 2+2 rolled out in 1972 as the replacement for the 365 GTC/4.

365 is an estimate of each cylinder’s displacement in cubic centimeters GT4 actually refers to four camshafts and 2+2 is pretty much self-explanatory. The Prancing Horse of Maranello updated this fellow in 1976 with minor styling changes and a slightly larger engine (4.9 rather than 4.8 liters).The 400 is the Italian automaker’s first production vehicle to be offered with a torque-converter automatic transmission. The subsequent 400i we’ve covered only recently on autoevolution features the “i” suffix to designate its mechanical fuel-injection system also a first for Ferrari.Replaced by the superb-looking 456 in 1992 the 412 is the ultimate incarnation of the F101 series. Produced between 1985 (the year that saw the debut of Calvin and Hobbes) and 1989 (the year of the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre) the Four-Twelve features an even larger engine than its predecessor. Bored 1 millimeter for an increase in displacement from 4823 to 4942 cubic centimeters the F101 E is the final evolution of the Colombo V12 named after Gioachino Colombo the guy who developed the automaker’s first homegrown powerplant. Its first application was the 1.5-liter mill in the 125 S sports racer from 1947.An all-alloy setup with two valves per cylinder the 4.9-liter engine is rocking wet-sump lubrication a 9.6:1 compression ratio Marelli Microplex electronic ignition and two transmission choices. Manual-equipped lumps are codenamed F101 E 010 whereas F101 E 70 is used for the BorgWarner-supplied yet General Motors-designed automatic. More specifically the two-pedal option is the long-running TH400 introduced back in 1964.As for suck-squeeze-bang-blow shenanigans Ferrari quoted 340 metric ponies (335 horsepower) at 6000 revolutions per minute and 451 Nm (333 pound-foot) of torque at 4200 revolutions per minute. Not bad for that era more so when compared to the 315 ps (311 hp) and 412 Nm (304 lb-ft) of torque produced by the preceding model. Lighter by 20 to 25 kilograms (44 to 55 pounds) compared to its predecessor the 412 could reach 245 kph (152 mph) with the auto or 250 kph (155 mph) with the manual box.Ferrari also promised 8.3 or 6.7 seconds to 100 kph (62 mph). The 400-meter run (a quarter mile has 402 meters) was dealt with in 15.2 and 14.6 seconds respectively. As mentioned beforehand not bad for the mid-1980s especially when you remember how old the car’s underpinnings were.Presented at the 1985 Geneva Motor Show the 412 can be perfectly summed up as a discretely elegant cruiser with seating for four souls. Based on a tubular steel chassis with a wheelbase that stretches 2700 millimeters (106.3 inches) between the front and rear axles the three-box Fezza we’re covering today is equipped with unequal-length wishbones all around.Coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers from Koni are fitted at either end along with anti-roll bars for good measure. The rear axle is a self-leveling unit and customary of a high-end gran turismo from the ‘80s power steering was standard. The first-ever production Ferrari to be fitted with anti-lock brakes originally sported Michelin TRX rubber boots wrapped around five-spoke alloy wheels. Although it looks extremely similar to the 400i before it the 412 features a slightly wider front track.The naturally-aspirated V12 up front is fed by a couple of fuel tanks with a combined capacity of 120 liters (31.7 U.S. gallons or 26.4 imperial gallons). Pininfarina’s facility in Turin produced the steel body shell which was then joined with the aluminum trunk lid and hood at the Maranello factory.Body-color bumpers were standard and clear rather than amber indicator lenses were fitted. Satin-black touches here and there also need to be mentioned along with a quad exhaust larger side mirrors black window trim instead of chrome and two Pininfarina badges on the front fenders.Dual pop-up headlights and dual taillights all of them round bring the point home. A car that you might recognize from Daft Punk’s Electroma the 412 flaunts a Momo steering wheel and a steering column housing cover that reads Ferrari 412 and vehicle identification number. Black gauges with orange numbers and letters air conditioning leather upholstery electric windows electric front seats and central locking are featured as well.Pretty spacious for a 2+2 grand tourer the 412 can swallow up to 500 liters (17.6 cubic feet) of whatnots in the trunk. The Mercedes-Benz V177 A-Class Sedan which is a compact with a similar wheelbase to this Ferrari has 405 liters (14.3 cubic feet) with the seats in their normal position.Optional extras included the automatic we’ve touched upon earlier fitted luggage from Schedoni dual-zone air conditioning and the oh-so-important sunroof. A grand total of 576 units were completed by late 1989 split between 270 manuals and 306 automatics. Of those 24 manuals and 61 automatics were finished in wrong-hand drive a.k.a. right-hand drive in the UK the Oz and other regions where driving on the left is the norm.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Leinster LGFA President Trina Murray presented the Cup and Shield to the winners to cap a memorable day in Abbotstown as the LGFA Interfirms returned for the first time since 2019.

PWC Ireland (white) lost out to AIB in 2019 and Kelly reflected: “It was a great day some event and great fun. Nice to get a cup at the end of it – makes it all worthwhile.

“I played in 2019 with PWC and we got to the Final. It’s nice to come back and win it this year.

“It’s a great way of meeting girls and you’d recognise girls from seeing them in the office. “Because of Covid we wouldn’t have seen each other much. Most of us didn’t even know each other’s names beforehand so it was great.”

The mural is done by Chicago’s Emmy Star Brown who said it’s the biggest mural she’s painted so far. And she’s painted a lot of murals. She finished this one in December 2022.

“We wanted to create a bright spot for the community that felt joyful and reflective” Brown says.

Murals and Mosaics Newsletter

“I wanted to create a really inspiring impactful piece that served as a visual landmark a statement piece something you can see from the bike path above as well as from Touhy driving by” she says. The mural rises with the pedestrian bridge to 36 feet tall at its highest point.

“It’s a piece that encourages you to pause and take a moment ... to reflect on and hopefully connect with a piece of your younger self.”

The mural is part of a rebirth on the plot at the northwest corner of Touhy and Lincoln avenues — or an “ exorcism ” as Sun-Times reporter David Roeder described it.

When it closed in 2007 and was torn down in 2013 the Purple Hotel had a reputation for drug-fueled parties and was remembered as the site of a mob hit back when it was a Hyatt. The desolate property sat vacant strewn with debris until construction on the mixed-use project known as District 1860 began in 2021. Now apartments are up for lease and restaurants are seating tables. When completed the 8.7-acre project from Tucker Development will include residential units retail and restaurant space and an Amazon Fresh anchor store .

Inspiring connection with one’s inner child is a common theme not just in the Lincolnwood mural but in much of Brown’s recent work. It grew as she taught calligraphy classes in the mid-2010s and realized that she wanted her students to “find their creative imaginative playful selves again.” This realization also led to her to begin painting murals.

“What if I had the opportunity to do a large-scale mural in my calligraphy writing style writing a positive quote?” she wondered. “Something that could really inspire someone or change the course of their day.”

She convinced a gallery in Logan Square to let her paint her mural on the wall for one month. She painted in white script on a black wall: “in a world where you can be anything be kind.”

The mural went viral. Couples traveled to take their wedding photos in front of it. Members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers saw it and asked her to paint her second mural for their shows.

Now Brown said she’s painted dozens of murals with about 13 of them in Fulton Market alone. Her murals and artwork can be found on both interior and exterior walls of coffee shops restaurants and retail stores all over Chicago as well as in private collections. She painted a ceiling mural for a private condo building and licensed her art to a hotel for key cards and other features. She has partnered with brands like Field Notes and Yeti where her patterns grace their book covers and tumbler walls.

Earlier in her career Brown worked primarily in black and white and painted solid glass windows that she found in Chicago dumpsters. Her career exploded after she signed a year-long contract with Sharpie which ran a documentary-style commercial of her on MTV featured her on a billboard in Times Square and showed her in ads in major magazines.

“That changed my life” she says.

Brown grew up in Glen Ellyn and attended college at Illinois Institute for the Arts. Now she works out of Kimball Arts Center in Logan Square where she painted a mural on an outside wall. She’s traveling the world to paint commissioned murals and returned most recently from painting in the British Virgin Islands. She has other murals underway that she can’t talk about yet.

Looking ahead Brown says she hopes to continue with a balance between the murals she loves her licensed work and her studio practice. An exhibition of her work titled “Familiar Form” opened May 3 at Vertical Gallery in Ukranian Village. The exhibit runs to May 25.

“It was a packed house the whole night” Brown says of the opening. Family members collectors who follow the gallery fans who follow her on Instagram and friends from high school college and beyond all showed up.

For a woman who grew up and built her career in and around Chicago “It feels like all my worlds colliding in one place.”

Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

View image in fullscreen Sugar production has an ugly past with roots in slavery and abhorrent working conditions into the present. Photograph: Ethan Frisch

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation."

The Bronx-based business began in 2014 after it donated Serrano pepper seeds to seven community gardens in the Bronx. As of October 2022 it now donates seeds and then purchases back the locally grown-peppers from more than 122 community gardens across the nation adding up to 15 tons of peppers.

Despite its local roots Small Axe Peppers CEO says it's not immune to the major headwinds impacting some of its biggest competitors like Conagra (CAG) Kraft Heinz (KHC) and the Campbell Soup Company (CPB).

""Like many businesses in this era transportation costs have gone up and we're in the process of adjusting some of that [cost]. We've had some upward price adjustment to our distribution partners to make sure that our costs are keeping in line with the cost that we've had to absorb in this new environment"" CEO John Crotty told Yahoo Finance (video above).

At the end of each harvesting season the company then buys the peppers back for a price tag of roughly $83000 but that number will likely increase this year as commodities shipping and labor costs rise.

The cost of fresh vegetables are at an all-time high according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)'s latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for August 2022.

""The gardens are still getting a way bigger premium than they had been getting before and we've had more gardens come on this year than we've had in years past"" Crotty explained.

The trek to transport all the peppers back to their production facility just north of the Bronx to create the hot sauce can be costly. In August the cost of gas dropped 10.6% month-over-month but was still up 25.6% year-over-year. Now gas prices are on the rise once again according to AAA following Wednesday's OPEC+ meeting where it announced plans to cut crude production by 2 million barrels of oil per a day this fall. Currently the national average sits at $3.89 per a gallon.

Despite the impact Small Axe Peppers is determined to bring this model to more community gardens or as Crotty calls it ""green oasis spaces"" in urban cities. The peppers are now grown more than 42 cities including Chicago Detroit Atlanta Los Angeles Phoenix among others. There is also an expanding list of regional product offerings among other items including Serrano pepper seeds for customers to grow themselves.

According to Crotty the word about its mission is spreading fast. ""It's amazing how many gardeners around the country knew people in the Bronx so as the model expanded word of mouth expanded.""

What credit score do you need to qualify?

The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is one of several travel rewards credit cards offered by the issuer. For this particular card the application page says you'll need to have an excellent credit score — according to Capital One that means applicants must meet the following requirements: You have never declared bankruptcy or defaulted on a loan

You have not been 60 days late on any credit card medical bill or loan within the last year

You have maintained a loan or credit card with with a credit limit above $5000 for at least three years If you're wondering what specific credit score you'll need to qualify for this card Capital One won't officially disclose that information. Additional reporting by personal finance sites such as The Points Guy and NerdWallet suggests however that applicants may still qualify with a good or very good credit score. Since FICO counts scores between 670 and 739 as being good credit scores this likely means applicants will need to have a credit score of at least 670 to qualify. FICO Score ranges: Very poor: 300 to 579

300 to 579 Fair: 580 to 669

580 to 669 Good: 670 to 739

670 to 739 Very good: 740 to 799

740 to 799 Excellent: 800 to 850 Of course that doesn't mean all applicants with a score above 670 will qualify or that those with a score below it will be rejected just that in general this is the score you'll want to aim for to be considered eligible. If you're not sure where you stand Capital One does offer consumers a pre-qualification tool so you can see which Capital One credit cards you might be eligible for. Credit card issuers also look at other factors such as your annual income the length of your credit history and how many credit cards you've applied for recently. FICO score factors: Payment history (35%) — If you've made your previous payments on time

— If you've made your previous payments on time Amounts owed (30%) — Your credit utilization ratio or the ratio of the amount of credit you're using to the amount that's been extended and owed on your accounts

— Your credit utilization ratio or the ratio of the amount of credit you're using to the amount that's been extended and owed on your accounts Length of credit history (15%) — The amount of time you've had credit

— The amount of time you've had credit New credit (10%) — How often you open new accounts

— How often you open new accounts Credit mix (10%) — Whether you have different types of credit such as installment loans or revolving lines of credit To help your chances you should also limit the number of credit card applications you submit in recent months. While there's nothing specific mentioned on Capital One's website a number of personal finance sites including Forbes Advisor have reported that applicants won't be approved for more than one Capital Credit Card every six months. Furthermore Capital One limits the number of personal credit cards consumers can have open to two. In other words if you already have two Capital One branded credit cards you likely wont be able qualify for the Venture Rewards Credit Card regardless of how good your credit score is. In case of rejection cardholders can call Capital One's customer service department and try to negotiate your case for approval though you may not be successful. Mentioning important details such as extenuating circumstances that caused you to be late on your past payments or pointing to your previous loyalty to Capital One likely wouldn't hurt.

Bottom line

To qualify for the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card you'll likely need to have a good credit score of at least 670 although having a higher credit score would only improve your chances of approval. Additional reporting by various personal finance blogs and websites also suggests that Capital One has strict rules regarding how many Capital One personal credit cards an individual can have — and how many credit card applications you're allowed to submit within a six-month timeframe.

WHERE: Spectrum Center (Charlotte NC)

WHEN: 7 p.m. ET

TV: NBC Sports Washington

RADIO: 980 AM & The Wizards App

Here are three things to watch for in the preseason showdown between the Wizards and the Hornets.

BEAL ENTERS HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS

The Wizards will be without All-NBA guard Bradley Beal for Monday night's exhibition matchup with the Hornets. The team announced on Sunday afternoon that Beal entered the NBA's health and safety protocols would miss Monday's game and ""will return to the team upon receiving clearance under the current NBA guidelines.""

The Wizards will also be without Corey Kispert (left ankle sprain) and Deni Avdija (left groin strain) vs. the Hornets.

OFFENSIVE EFFICIENCY

Washington has struggled offensively to start the preseason. In their two-game trip to Japan they shot 36 percent from the field and 21 percent from deep. For the Wizards to win games those numbers will have to improve but there's no need to worry this early in the preseason. With all that goes into refining and executing an NBA offense two preseason games on the other side of the world don't necessarily reflect where the team is at on that end of the court.

Who knows why the shots weren't going down in Japan? Jet lag shaking off the rust of the offseason the unfamiliar feel of the bigger arena or even just simply a couple of cold games.

""If you're looking just by the numbers [the 3-point shooting's] not good"" Wizards head coach Wes Unseld Jr. said after practice last week. ""But we played almost a full game an intrasquad scrimmage [during practice] and we shot the ball exceptionally well...I like where we are today but if you factor in the first two games we've got a lot to improve upon.""

TEAM CHEMISTRY

The most important aspect of preseason every year is team chemistry. After a full offseason there are always new additions to the team. Over the summer guys were traded signed in free agency drafted and returned from injury. Now is the time they get to take the court together and work on their hoops chemistry before the games start counting toward the season standings.

The Wizards made a lot of roster changes this offseason and it will take time for them to develop as a unit. That's what makes these preseason games so important.

Six qualifying quarterfinal teams will compete for four slots in the College Bowl semifinal round. In the episode that airs Friday Oct. 21 the Penn State team is scheduled to face off against the team from Brigham Young University for a place in the semifinals.

According to an Onward State article Zhang and his two teammates did not know each other until the day before the qualifying episode was filmed.

Capital One College Bowl airs Friday nights at 8 p.m. on NBC. It's hosted by former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning and his brother Cooper Manning. Each episode features back-to-back competitions featuring four schools. Each contest has three rounds — The Kickoff the One-on-One and the Two-Minute Drill — made up of questions drawn from general trivia categories.

Eleven years later he remembers the telephone pole that stopped his car the seatbelt that saved his life and the doctor who tried to manage his pain. Bellanger says his first prescription was a cocktail of four drugs including 20 milligrams of OxyContin.

Bellanger’s need for the drug grew. His doctor escalated his dosage of the powerful opioid in kind. From 20 milligrams Bellanger climbed to 40 then 60 then 80 — a rise up the rungs of dependency by now familiar to millions of American families.

What began in a hospital room rapidly spiraled into a battle with addiction that still defines Bellanger’s life to this day. After a turnaround in 2019 Bellanger founded Starfish Recovery in Richmond. He’s also a plaintiff in several class action lawsuits that accuse OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and other nationwide distributors of misleading doctors and catalyzing America’s nationwide opioid epidemic.

Those suits have yielded more than half a billion dollars for the commonwealth of Virginia a sum to be divided up by the Virginia attorney general among cities and counties with the purpose of “abating the opioid crisis.” Localities where opioid death rates rank highest including Richmond will see sums in the millions sparking concerns that the money will be ensnared by bureaucratic middlemen rather than going to victims of an epidemic that has killed nearly 8000 Virginians in the past five years.

All told Virginia is expected to receive an estimated $610 million from the settlements including at least $80 million from Purdue. All settlements are being distributed according to a memorandum passed in 2021 by the Virginia General Assembly and coordinated by the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares.

Distribution documents shared by Miyares’ office show that the state will receive at least $74 million. Virginia counties and cities will receive at least $95 million to be divided up among them according to a harm-impact formula.

The remainder will go to a statewide body called the Opioid Abatement Authority which will get the lion’s share of the funds — at least $232 million over 16 years the AG documents show. The abatement authority is a newly formed body with a mandate to distribute those funds through grants to state local and regional abatement efforts although that process has yet to be established. It can also audit the money’s eventual uses.

All parties stand to receive millions more when settlements from Purdue and Johnson & Johnson are finalized.

A significant slice of the money is not strictly required to go directly to opioid abatement. For example almost $32 million of subdivisions’ money is eligible to go to their lawyers if fees are not covered by a separate fund created as part of the national settlement.

Frustration over distribution plans

Meanwhile the commonwealth’s portion — a minimum of $74 million — is “unrestricted” which allows broad spending flexibility. These unrestricted funds are subject only to settlement terms set by defendants of the lawsuit which include companies like AmerisourceBergen McKesson and Cardinal Health.

Also unrestricted is an $81 million side pot within the abatement authority’s money which can be spent on staffing and administrative costs.

In January Del. Nick Freitas R-Culpeper proposed redirecting money away from the abatement authority’s unrestricted fund and investing it directly into accredited recovery programs. Freitas called the bill an act of good government and a commonsense measure to keep the money from going to waste.

“At the end of the day one of the biggest things that we’re trying to do with our legislation is reduce the amount of overhead costs that would be associated with distributing the funds” Freitas said. “The more people it has to go through in order to get to the end user the more people you have to pay.”

The bill which also added four members of the recovery community to the board of the Opioid Abatement Authority failed to reach the floor this legislative session. Freitas said that’s not because the bill was opposed but because it could complicate the settlement process with distributors some of which is still in flux. He said he plans to reintroduce the bill next session.

The distribution plans have also frustrated Virginians who live with addiction. Advocates like Bellanger worry that no portion of the money has been formally earmarked for peer-to-peer recovery groups.

At a meeting of the abatement authority in September Bellanger was one of three former opioid addicts to voice his fears. Bellanger said he had “grave concern about the authority’s current allocation plans.”

“We have a unique opportunity as a whole to really allow that money to touch the people in the community” Bellanger said. “That’s my biggest qualm. There should be no money funneling to create bureaucracies and government entities.”

Officials receiving the money have fewer concerns. The new director of the abatement authority Tony McDowell says he’s establishing a rigorous system to vet access to funds. Those details have yet to be clarified.

McDowell a former firefighter and paramedic comes from Henrico County government where he served as county manager for public safety and was a member of the Henrico Addiction Task Force.

“I’d like to see that every penny every dollar gets to the people that need it” McDowell said. “That there’s no fraud there’s no waste there’s no abuse. That we don’t see money getting related to unrelated priorities. I think you have to be concerned about that to be a good steward of the dollars.”

McDowell thinks the guidelines designed by Virginia lawmakers are rigorous and that legislators have learned from the national tobacco settlement signed in 1998. At that time states were awarded hundreds of millions in annual payouts intended for tobacco prevention.

Virginia was one of them and until recently still continued to receive payouts from the $246 billion settlement. In 2019 the commonwealth received $130 million in tobacco settlement money according to data collected by the Kaiser Family Fund.

But the state spent just $10.8 million on tobacco prevention according to a nationwide review of state programs.

This time around McDowell believes that clauses in distribution agreements will prevent that kind of waste. Applicants for his funds will need to back up their applications with “evidence-based” harm reduction strategies he said. They will also have to submit performance measures and allow for on-site inspections by his team.

And McDowell says his new mandate is personal. In Henrico he said he’s watched Virginia lose the fight against opioids for years.

“Everyone who’s been involved knows that we’ve been losing the battle” McDowell said. “The truth is every year you’re seeing more people die of overdoses more communities being harmed more families suffering. It’s a huge problem and I’m personally invested in seeing it through.”

Richmond could see 300 deaths this year

Opioid deaths in Virginia more than quadrupled from 2012 to 2021 according to data from the state’s forensic epidemiologist with a major spike since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Richmond where more Virginians die of overdoses than anywhere in the state is on pace for 300 opioid overdose deaths this year.

Anthony Grimes executive director of the Virginia Association of Recovery Residences expressed faith in McDowell. VARR accredits recovery houses most of which are in the Richmond area where addicts in recovery can live in sober housing.

Recovery residence stays which can extend for several months are increasingly viewed as an evidence-based strategy for preventing relapse. His group just recently opened up a recovery residence in Russell County in Southwest Virginia a region with an inordinately high rate of overdose deaths.

But like Bellanger Grimes feels that former addicts are already being locked out of the settlement money. He said his organization has been told that it will not have direct access to abatement authority grant funds.

Though the abatement authority has yet to distribute a dollar Grimes thinks it’s likely that most of the settlement money will go where it always has: to hospitals clinics and acute care facilities that don’t focus on sustained sobriety.

“To my mind ... we should be making an investment in long-term recovery. That’s how we curb the recidivism rate that’s how we lower relapse and it’s certainly how we lower our public health care costs” Grimes said. “I feel like we’re not acknowledging how important that piece of the puzzle is.”

Bellanger was more direct.

“Who benefited the most? States counties agencies and attorneys” Bellanger said. “We’re the first responders and yet we’re the last to get funded. And that’s the truth.”",,,,,,,,,

With changed menu offerings and new a la carte charges not all guests are pleased with the changes.

Room Service Menu Changes

Many cruise travelers enjoy taking advantage of room service to enjoy a leisurely breakfast light snack or easy meal in the comfort and convenience of their staterooms and many cruise lines offer delicious room service menu options.

In recent years however cruise lines have begun to add fees service charges and gratuities to room service orders whereas the service used to be entirely complimentary.

Now Carnival Cruise Line has followed the trend eliminating all complimentary room service options except the continental breakfast menu offered only from 6-10 a.m. Free choices include fresh fruit a selection of cold cereals toast pastries yogurt and assorted breakfast beverages including milk juices coffee and hot tea.

Also on the breakfast menu are some delicious breakfast sandwiches but those come with a $5-6 charge as well as an automatic 18% gratuity per room service order.

For the rest of the day every option on the “Leisure Dining” room service menu now has a charge ranging from $3-8 per item. These charges are $1-2 higher per item than the previous room service menu where some options were still complimentary.

Now the least expensive items are a side of French fries or a “giant” chocolate chunk or oatmeal raisin cookie for $3 each while the priciest snacks are the spicy fried firecracker shrimp which come with a chili ginger dip and curly fries at $8 (gratuity extra).

Carnival Cruise Line brand ambassador John Heald has explained the reasoning for the new charges as a means to help lessen food waste.

“One of the reasons we are implementing these nominal fees is because of food waste” Heald said. “Many cruisers would order multiple sandwiches and food items and end up leaving 70% or more uneaten.”

Heald goes on to say that “we have all seen those plates outside of the cabin doors” referring to many cruisers’ practice of moving dirty plates and uneaten food outside in the hallway which can clutter the halls and create a safety hazard.

Heald does admit that there are other reasons behind the change. While he does not specify those other reasons costs are undoubtedly one factor not only to save the expense of wasted food but also to collect the additional charges at a time when the cruise industry continues to struggle to recover from losses during the pandemic shutdown and current economic condition.

Another reason behind the change may be to alleviate extra work on employees. If less food is left in hallways there will be less need for crew members to patrol every stateroom deck to collect dirty dishes.

Upgraded (and Still Free) Deli Menu

Not all Carnival guests are willing to pay additional charges for room service which can quickly add up if ordering a meal for a family with diverse tastes.

Every Carnival cruise ship however does offer a range of complimentary dining options though guests will need to leave their staterooms to take advantage of different delicious dishes.

Of special interest is the Carnival Deli which has also upgraded its options in conjunction with the room service change.

New Carnival Deli Menu

The new Carnival Deli menu offers 14 sandwich options – 8 hot and 6 cold – with either cole slaw or French fries as a side. New to the menu are veggie burgers a hot steak and cheese sandwich on a hoagie roll and a classic chicken salad sandwich.

The remaining deli menu items are largely the same as previous deli offerings including hot dogs grilled ham and cheese meatball sandwiches reubens and tuna salad sandwiches.

Some options have been removed from the menu however most notably two of the previous wraps as well as the salted chocolate chip cookies. It is likely that these items may not have been exceedingly popular and trimming menu items can help improve service efficiency and speed.

More Complimentary Options

Other complimentary casual dining venues on Carnival ships include Guy’s Burger Joint Shaq’s Big Chicken BlueIguana Cantina Pizza Pirate Swirls Mongolian Wok Guy’s Pig & Anchor Bar-B-Que and more.

Operating hours and venues vary by ship but every ship in the Carnival fleet has at least 2-3 extra complimentary dining options.

Also free of charge are the Lido Deck restaurants and each ship’s main dining rooms during meal service hours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL25vcndlZ2lhbi1kcm9wcy1kcmluay1wYWNrYWdlLWVkZ2UtaXQtaGVsZC1vdmVyLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jYXJuaXZhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norwegian Drops Drink Package Edge it Held Over Royal Caribbean Carnival,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/norwegian-drops-drink-package-edge-it-held-over-royal-caribbean-carnival on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL25vcndlZ2lhbi1kcm9wcy1kcmluay1wYWNrYWdlLWVkZ2UtaXQtaGVsZC1vdmVyLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jYXJuaXZhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYWduaWFwcGVtb2JpbGUuY29tL25ld3MvYm9uLXZveWFnZS1jYXJuaXZhbC1lY3N0YXN5LWxlYXZpbmctbW9iaWxlLWFmdGVyLWN1cnJlbnQtY3J1aXNlL2FydGljbGVfNDY0ZjIyNDItNDhkZC0xMWVkLTkyMzQtMTM1NTJiM2IwYTE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bon voyage — Carnival Ecstasy leaving Mobile after current cruise,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The carrier business group was the company’s top earner last year generating more than 281.4 billion yuan (US$39.5 billion) – roughly 44 per cent of the total revenue.

Ding born in 1969 and holding a master’s degree from Southeast University in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing joined Huawei in 1996 rising through the ranks to become president at various departments including global solution sales and global marketing.

Ryan Ding Yun a Huawei Technologies Co veteran who was at the helm of the Chinese company’s most profitable business died at age 53 in the wee hours of Friday from a sudden illness the Shenzhen-based firm announced.

Ding also served as deputy chairman of Huawei’s supervisory board.

In an obituary Huawei credited Ding for having “worked diligently at Huawei for 26 years and made significant contributions to the company’s growth and development”. It asked its employees to focus on work and “turn grief into strength”.

While Huawei did not divulge the cause of Ding’s death local media reports said he died of heart arrest after taking part in a 28km marathon. Ding was an enthusiastic long-distance runner who spent almost all of his free time running according to anonymous sources cited by one report.

Ding led Huawei’s enterprise and carrier business groups at a time when US sanctions have effectively crippled the company’s consumer business pushing the once-leading smartphone seller to boost other revenue sources.

Ding’s last public appearance was in September at Huawei Connect 2022 an annual event in which the company announces new products and solutions. There he delivered a live-streamed speech demonstrating Huawei’s role in driving innovation and showcasing bespoke client solutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMjEwLzEyNzY3NDIuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China launches 1st comprehensive solar probe to share data with world's scientists,"China sends the Kuafu-1 satellite into a preset orbit via a Long March 2D carrier rocket on October 9 2022 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China's Gansu Province.

China sent the country's Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) - a satellite specially designed to carry out a comprehensive probe of the Sun - into preset orbit via a Long March 2D carrier rocket on Sunday morning from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China's Gansu Province.The satellite also known as Kuafu-1 which is named after Kuafu a giant in Chinese mythology who indefatigably chased the sun was jointly developed by the Innovation Academy for Microsatellites of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) CAS National Astronomical Observatory the CAS Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics and the CAS Purple Mountain Observatory. Nanjing-based CAS Purple Mountain Observatory will operate the spacecraft the Global Times learned from mission insiders.Dubbed China's first comprehensive solar probe Kuafu-1 will conduct continuous solar observations for at least four years and its main scientific goals include the formation of the solar magnetic field solar flares and titanic blasts known as coronal mass ejections as well as their relationship in a simultaneous fashion Gan Weiqun the program leader and a research fellow with the Purple Mountain Observatory told the Global Times on Sunday.Chinese scientists will also use the satellite to support space disaster weather forecasts that might affect high-tech activities such as human spaceflights communication and navigation the Global Times learned from a statement the developers provided on Sunday.To achieve these goals the Kuafu-1 carries three payloads - the Lyman-alpha telescope (LST) Hard X-ray telescope (HXT) and Full-disk solar vector MagnetoGraph (FMG) according to Gan.

It marks a world's first to observe the solar magnetic field solar flares and titanic blasts and deploy a corresponding payload combination onboard all at once. It is also a world's first in deploying a near-Earth satellite platform to detect the all-solar vector magnetic field and the non-thermal radiation of solar flares as well as to simultaneously observe images heliostat formation and coronal propagation of coronal mass ejections.Also marking a world's first the Kuafu-1 will realize simultaneous imaging of the full heliosphere and the corona via the LST Gan added.With a designed service life of four years Kuafu-1 will work in the Earth's polar orbit some 720 kilometers above ground so that it will be capable of conducting 24-hour continuous observation directly of the Sun with a rather short communication delay according to Gan.Naming the satellite after Kuafu also represents the heroic and tenacious spirits of ancient Chinese ancestors in exploring nature and the Chinese people's unremitting quest to uncover the mystery of the Sun developers revealed.Gan said that the satellite would enter formal service after a testing period of four to six months.Li Hui another research fellow with the Purple Mountain Observatory and chief designer of the scientific application system of the satellite told the Global Times that after testing data collected by the spacecraft will be open to scientists and researchers all over the world in a timely fashion free of charge.Li added that such a sharing policy is also in line with international norms which Chinese solar physicists have enjoyed and benefited from. ""Therefore we shall fully open data collected by our comprehensive solar probe"" said Li.According to developers the three sets of payloads on the Kuafu-1 will collect around 500 gigabytes of data every day and that will be open to global researchers.NASA launched the Parker Solar Probe in 2018 which adopted a rather bold method of being the first to fly directly through the Sun's corona - the hazardous region of intense heat and solar radiation in the Sun's atmosphere that is visible during an eclipse.But the US probe admittedly revolutionary cannot yet look into the Sun directly all the time as the telescope instruments cannot withstand heat of over 5000 C so its observations will not be as continuous as those of the ASO-S Gan said.Gan explained that Xihe China's first solar probing satellite that attained state approval in June 2019 and was launched in October 2021 carries an H-alpha telescope that can be also deployed on Earth's ground but could overcome challenges including the atmospheric agitation when sent into space. It is dedicated to execute spectral imaging observations of the H-alpha band of the Sun and to mainly experiment with such technology.Kuafu-1 has different yet more specific solar probing tasks and it is designed to yield major scientific breakthroughs. So the deployment of the ASO-S marks a great leap in the domain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS91bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtaW5jcmVhc2UtdG9reW8tY2FwYWNpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines To Increase Tokyo Capacity By 13%,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS91bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtaW5jcmVhc2UtdG9reW8tY2FwYWNpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF2aWF0b3JtZS5jb20vbmV3cy9mbHluYXMtbmV3LXJvdXRlLXRvLW1hcnNlaWxsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flynas Launches New Route To Marseille Starting 9 November,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.theaviatorme.com/news/flynas-new-route-to-marseille on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF2aWF0b3JtZS5jb20vbmV3cy9mbHluYXMtbmV3LXJvdXRlLXRvLW1hcnNlaWxsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

But for every trend there is a backlash and now celebrities are increasingly making their brows disappear bleaching them ‘nude’ – or in the case of Madonna shaving them off altogether.

At the recent Paris Fashion Week Maisie Williams from Game Of Thrones model Bella Hadid and Brooklyn Beckham’s wife Nicola Peltz all unveiled barely-there brows. And while it might seem perverse for an actress to do away with eyebrows that can do so much to express emotion – as well as protecting the eyes from dust and sweat – Downton Abbey’s Lily James 33 bleached out her brows for her new Versace ad campaign.

Vanishing eyebrows may be high fashion but is the high street ready? I decided to put it to the test and see whether at 37 I could pull off the ‘no-brows’ look.

But for every trend there is a backlash and now celebrities are increasingly making their brows disappear bleaching them ‘nude’ – or in the case of Madonna shaving them off altogether

I’m no stranger to messing with my eyebrows. As a child of the 1990s I spent my formative years plucking them to mimic the ‘skinny brow’ style made fashionable by my idol Ginger Spice. But this would be a new challenge.

Fortunately TikTok is full of tutorials offering eyebrow know-how (do you dye them use a razor or apply Veet?) and it even has a filter that shows how you’ll look if you go through with this most drastic of DIY makeovers.

My beautician warned against reaching for the bleach – and not just for the obvious safety reasons. She told me that bleached brows sometimes turn orange. They can also fall out at the slightest touch before growing back in uneven clumps.

Duly warned I went for a half-and-half method applying a semi-permanent brow dye to lighten my natural colour before a dose of white face paint and a thick application of concealer.

The result gave me an unearthly almost alien appearance – I wouldn’t have looked out of place in a David Bowie video – and it was sure to be unsettling to passers-by.

The first people I bumped into was a pair of kindly nuns. What luck! ‘You look lovely dear’ said the first convincingly. The other chimed in: ‘I have spent years trying to stop my hair and eyebrows from going white. How funny that you should be doing it on purpose.’ She had a point.

Next the achingly cool Maisie from Cardiff exclaimed: ‘Love them! I would say make them even whiter next time.’

And Maria Crisford a Londoner about my age added: ‘I spend a lot of time filling in gaps in my brows so I’m not sure I could pull it off. But I prefer the bleached trend to the dark single-eyebrow thing.’

It was clear to me that this no-brow trend belongs firmly to the TikTok generation. Instead I’m with Nicola Peltz who concluded after her no-brow experiment: ‘I look like a hard-boiled egg.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc2FuYW50b25pb3JlcG9ydC5vcmcvbW9uYXJjaC1idXR0ZXJmbHktYW5kLXBvbGxpbmF0b3ItZmVzdGl2YWwtMjAyMi1icmFja2VucmlkZ2UtcGFyay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brackenridge Park welcomes Monarch Butterfly and Pollinator Festival,"In the shade of the pecan and cypress trees that grow tall along the river at Brackenridge Park brightly hued monarch butterflies blended with the falling leaves Saturday morning during the Monarch Butterfly and Pollinator Festival.

The seventh annual event hosted by the Texas Butterfly Ranch and the Brackenridge Park Conservancy offered all ages the opportunity to interact with the endangered monarch butterflies as they pass through San Antonio on their journey to Mexico.

Butterﬂies and other pollinators including bees moths birds and bats pollinate over 75% of the world’s ﬂowering plants according to the National Park Service. The event seeks to raise awareness of their importance to the ecosystem.

The festival got its start in 2016 the year after San Antonio became the first Monarch Champion City committing to all 24 National Wildlife Federation action items.

Previously held at the Pearl and Confluence Park this year’s festival marked its first appearance at Brackenridge Park. After reading an official proclamation Mayor Ron Nirenberg and other officials boarded the San Antonio Zoo Train converted into a chugging caterpillar giant antennae and all.

As in the past festivalgoers also got the chance to tag a butterfly with the help of a master naturalist. Tagging helps determine the pathways taken by migrating monarchs and their survival rate.

Children are especially captivated by the experience said Monika Maeckle festival organizer and founder of Texas Butterfly Ranch.

“When they do this it changes everything” Maeckle said. “And if that butterfly gets recovered [in Mexico] it’s a super incredible engagement tool to get people to look at things differently.”

Cousins Chiara and Daisy Pride spotted a butterfly resting on a display of seeds and watched for several minutes before the insect’s deep orange wings lifted it into the trees. Daisy noticed that the monarch had been tagged on one wing and said it was her second sighting of the day.

The family-friendly festival also included plant giveaways and tutorials children’s activities and crafts and butterfly bike rides. New to this year’s festival was a Tree of Life altar created by San Antonio artist Terry Ybañez.

Inspired by a visit last spring to Valle de Bravo in the state of Mexico Ybañez used paper-mache and recycled cardboard to recreate the many monarch butterflies she saw there emerging from clusters and blanketing the “tree of life” clay sculptures so common in the area.

At the center of the art installation sunlight pours through the transparent wings of dozens of artificial butterflies atop a colorful 7-foot altar bearing the Virgen de Guadalupe. The altar honors the victims of the mass shooting in Uvalde in May with the names of each written along the trunk.

Two smaller altars represent other pollinators — hummingbirds and bees.

Amid the bright orange marigolds the traditional bowls of salt water and copal Ybañez also displayed photos of the deceased including her grandparents a longtime friend and her dog Chiquita who she said had just died the day before.

It took the artist almost three months to create the Tree of Life that was stood under a giant cypress in a serene area of the park.

After the event the altar will be on display at Mission Library until the end of October. It will then migrate to Mission Marquee Plaza for Celebrando las Misiones one event among many planned for Dia de los Muertos the Day of the Dead festival Oct. 28-30."

And executives at UnitedHealth Group the country’s largest insurer told their workers to mine old medical records for more illnesses — and when they couldn’t find enough sent them back to try again.

HOUSTON — At this point travelers are used to construction at Bush Intercontinental Airport.

“There no time to nibble at the edges. We’re really transforming"" Houston Airports spokesperson Augusto Bernal said.

And starting Monday CenterPoint will be doing work to support the airport's new international terminal. The work is expected to last four weeks.

“This closure is necessary to allow CenterPoint Energy to install crucial electrical infrastructure under the roadway"" Bernal said.

Temporary lane closures along North Terminal Road could impact Terminals C D and E.

“We’ve done traffic modeling we’ve done traffic simulations and we’ve also tested. When we did all that testing we saw about a 15- to 20-minute delay during those peak travel times leading to those terminals"" Bernal said.

Those peak travel times are between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. but he said with a little planning the potential inconvenience can be lessened.

“The more time you give yourself the easier it will be to find your parking spot get through those traffic congestions and reach your flight"" Bernal said.

Arthur Lee Cofield Jr. a 31-year-old gang member serving 14 years for armed robbery is accused of using contraband cell phones from inside the Georgia Department of Corrections’ Special Management Unit to impersonate California billionaire Sidney Kimmel and open a fraudulent bank account in his name.

Cofield allegedly arranged for $11 million to be wired from Kimmel’s Charles Schwab account to a company in Idaho for the purchase of 6106 American Eagle one-ounce gold coins.

Federal prosecutors believe Cofield then allegedly arranged for a private plane to transport the coins to Atlanta where some funds were used to purchase a $4.4 million house in Buckhead.

The scheme is believed to amount to one of the largest heists pulled off from inside an American prison.

Kimmel chairman and CEO of Sidney Kimmel Entertainment the Los Angeles-based company behind films such as ""Hell or High Water"" ""Crazy Rich Asians"" and ""Moneyball"" has since been reimbursed in full by the bank but the case shines a light on the corrections’ department’s failures to curb illegal activity even from inside its own maximum-security facility meant to house Georgia’s hardened criminals.

Cofield reportedly had been transferred to the Special Management Unit after allegedly ordering from inside a Georgia state prison for gang members to gun down one of his romantic rivals in Atlanta.

A limited amount of information has been publicly reported about the conspiracy case since the Justice Department first announced in December 2020 that Cofield and two co-conspirators on the outside Eldridge Bennett and his daughter Eliayah Bennett had been indicted for stealing $11 million.

All three have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and money laundering

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in reviewing court filings and other documents first publicly identified Kimmel as the alleged victim in a report published on Friday suggesting there may be others.

By John W. Spink Ph.D. Michigan State University and Food Fraud Prevention Think Tank

Supply Chain Management Background

My formal expansion into supply chain management from focusing mainly on food fraud prevention started in September 2019 when I moved to the Michigan State University (MSU) Department of Supply Chain Management within the University's Business College. I revamped the Introduction to Supply Chain Management undergraduate course required for all business school students. My 15 years of developing and teaching applied business in graduate courses at MSU combined with my broad supply chain-related work experience at Chevron Corporation was an excellent fit for this task. I brought a holistic approach to the introductory concepts that used hot topics to expand the student experience.

When we consider hot topics in supply chain management we start with the impacts of COVID-19 then the Ukraine–Russia conflict and now inflation. Additionally we were already tracking the trends of artificial intelligence data analytics autonomous vehicles (in a warehouse and on the highway) electric cars and the massive increase of information flow from 5G networks. These events have led some experts to consider that we are now experiencing more supply chain disruption and innovation than we have experienced in the last 50 years.

While the deeper and more formal dive into supply chain management concepts was new for me from early on it was included in the ""sciences of food fraud prevention.""

The Challenge for Supply Chain Management

The disruptions are so extreme and so varied that it has become necessary to reset our expectations and the scope of our management systems.

Just as food safety is a specific area of science supply chain management is a scholarly discipline. Supply chain management which is focused on operations management logistics and distribution—or sourcing and procurement—is a common undergraduate business degree. Beyond master's degree programs over 100 universities offer Ph.D. programs in supply chain management. A number of academic journals publish only on these topics. That said a lack of awareness of the rigorous processes and procedures often characterizes this discipline. Supply chain management is often considered to be valuable only for manufacturing plant management procurement or transportation personnel. A vast and complex operations and communication network can be more efficiently engaged by a business' food safety business function.

To step back to the basics supply chain management oversees the movement of everything from everywhere to everywhere else. At any time anything can go wrong that will shut down an entire company. This the starting point—the challenge and everyday intensity of supply chain management.

Take a moment to consider some recent supply chain disruptions:

The Suez Canal became blocked by a large vessel in 2021 causing a backlog of ships waiting to get through for a seemingly indeterminate amount of time (in total it was 106 days)

A Texas ice storm in February 2021 disrupted travel across the U.S. much longer than during a typical freeze/thaw cycle

A computer chips shortage for vehicles has been seen since the start of COVID-19 supply chain disruptions

COVID-19 is changing almost everything from a massive shift in consumer shopping to an almost instant shift to curbside pickup and delivery as well as radical shifts in the type of products that are in demand (think Peloton bikes and baking yeast)

COVID-19 impacts the logistics and transportation networks from ports and facilities shutting down as well as production and manufacturing stopping then starting and then stopping again

Companies are having to quickly add supply and suppliers to keep running while balancing the risks of unknowns

Companies are still having trouble keeping up with manufacturing getting enough raw materials and efficiently transporting their products to customers.

What has fundamentally changed is that our old way of responding is no longer possible. Basically all the usual buffers were—or are still—gone such as having safety stock using backup suppliers being able to expedite a few shipments to get caught up being able to scale up from optimal utilization to maximum or the option to increase lead times on deliveries. Think about these assumptions that are shattered:

No automatic assurance of supply: In the past if a product shortage arose a company would usually just contact another supplier. Assurance of supply was available even if it cost more to buy and transport the alternative product.

In the past if a product shortage arose a company would usually just contact another supplier. Assurance of supply was available even if it cost more to buy and transport the alternative product. No automatic alternate shipping routes: If a problem with one shipping route arose other ways to get the product existed. If a port shutdown occurred then the product could be moved through another port or more costly rail or truck transportation could be hired. At worst if land and sea borders were blocked air cargo transportation could be utilized. Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit air cargo was booked solid and could not be obtained at any cost.

At worst if land and sea borders were blocked air cargo transportation could be utilized. Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit air cargo was booked solid and could not be obtained at any cost. No more ""operating out of inventory"": Everyone whittled down their inventory at the start of the pandemic. Everyone then tried to restock three months of safety stock instantly. The excess manufacturing capacity to ramp up did not exist. It became impossible for companies to operate solely on their own inventories their suppliers' inventories or to ask their customers to shorten their days-of-supply inventory.

It became impossible for companies to operate solely on their own inventories their suppliers' inventories or to ask their customers to shorten their days-of-supply inventory. No more ""just expediting shipments"": This restraint has two challenges. The first challenge is never being able to catch up. It is impossible to get caught up when a company is two weeks behind expediting orders and only producing for the customer orders. The company will be stuck in paying or expedited shipping for everything. The second challenge is the transportation shortage caused by a combination of unprecedented demand in the truck and rail industry and a commercial driver shortage.

The company will be stuck in paying or expedited shipping for everything. The second challenge is the transportation shortage caused by a combination of unprecedented demand in the truck and rail industry and a commercial driver shortage. Consumer delivery has shifted from days to hours: It is amazing how frequently consumers order products online that are delivered later that day. Suppliers are placing more products closer to consumers to meet the increased competition in the marketplace. This also creates a massive spike in the amount of inventory that is held in the warehouses. These factors are fundamentally changing warehousing and logistics.

Suppliers are placing more products closer to consumers to meet the increased competition in the marketplace. This also creates a massive spike in the amount of inventory that is held in the warehouses. These factors are fundamentally changing warehousing and logistics. No equilibrium no patterns no ""normal"": On top of these assumptions the consumer demand operations and logistics have not been able to reach equilibrium. The supply and demand have continued to fluctuate so the supply chain cannot catch up. Before the pandemic disruptions and shutdowns due to a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) did not usually occur but COVID-19 created that problem. Then the Ukraine–Russia conflict added another unprecedented supply chain disruption. All together these many ""events"" and ""effects"" have led to a new and different type of inflation pressure. There is no equilibrium.

There is no equilibrium. The multiplication of all the assumptions: With some system equilibrium the system could catch up even in the face of one of these factors. If one of these factors could be solved then it would pressure the other factors.

The crux of the last year of supply chain management is that our problems have been initially shifted from ""known knowns"" (i.e. ""simple"" problems such as a delayed truck delivery) to ""unknowables"" (i.e. ""chaotic"" unforeseen problems such as at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine–Russia conflict). Over time we might expect some consistency and shift to ""unknown unknowns"" (i.e. ""complex"" problems where we expect delays of some kind) or with more information a shift to ""known unknowns"" (i.e. ""complicated"" problems such as when we know suppliers may have trouble delivering on time but we do not know what product). For further clarification see the sidebar below.

Known Knowns? Unknown Unknowns? Know Your Problem Type to Frame Your Response If you do not understand the type of question you are answering you may use the wrong tool. For example detecting species swapping is very different than preventing country-of-origin labeling fraud. Known known? Known unknown? Unknown unknown? The classification makes a difference. So often we—as humans consumers food scientists criminal investigators etc.—apply the same tool when responding to every problem.1 The ""type of problem"" classification system is helpful at the beginning of a food fraud investigation because it can provide the foundation for a more standardized response. When you realize the type of problem then you can understand how the most efficient first step could be choosing an immediate cause-and-effect response (e.g. peanut allergen adulterant substance in cumin requires an immediate test for peanut allergen). In other cases it may be best to start with a more complex active scenario development (e.g. trying to understand the evolving fraud opportunity seven days after Russia entered Ukraine). Types of problems include: Simple (known known—e.g. water on the floor): For example the risk of someone falling if there is water on the floor. These were the traditional supply chain management problems such as a supplier being unavailable or a truck getting delayed.

Complicated (known unknowns—e.g. hurricane season): For example the risk of supply chain disruptions from hurricanes over a year. It is known that hurricanes hit the U.S. Gulf Coast over a certain span of months but precisely when they will arrive or their intensity are not known.

Complex (unknown unknowns—e.g. most food fraud events): For example most new food fraud events seem to fall into the complex/unknown unknowns category. (If the same type of food fraud keeps occurring however then the problem may become either a ""simple"" or ""complicated"" problem.)

Chaotic (unknowables—e.g. Ukraine–Russia): The September 11 terrorist attack falls into this category especially while that event was occurring. The Ukraine–Russia event probably falls into this category regarding food fraud and the food supply chain.1

Looking at these events from the last few years what has become apparent is that the supply chain disruptions stemming from them are here to stay for a while. Also there is a growing awareness that it is not wise to wait for things to ""go back to normal"" or to even try to predict the ""new"" normal.

The Foundation of Supply Chain Risk Management

We need a more methodical way to classify and understand to supply chain disruptions.

While supply chain management seems to be common sense it is important to review the foundation and fundamentals before creating new methods or processes. Fortunately the field of supply chain management has a long and rigorous body of work to draw upon. Specifically the discipline focuses on supply chain risk risk management and classifying supply chain disruptions.

From the supply chain management literature come several important definitions:

Supply chain risk: The likelihood and impact of unexpected macro- and/or micro-level events or conditions that adversely influence any part of a supply chain leading to operational tactical or strategic level failures or irregularities. 2

The likelihood and impact of unexpected macro- and/or micro-level events or conditions that adversely influence any part of a supply chain leading to operational tactical or strategic level failures or irregularities. Supply chain disruption: Unplanned and unanticipated (event) that disrupts the normal flow of goods and materials within a supply chain. 3

Unplanned and unanticipated (event) that disrupts the normal flow of goods and materials within a supply chain. Supply chain risk management (SCRM): The process of identifying assessing and mitigating the risks to the integrity trustworthiness and authenticity of products and services within the supply chain. 4

The process of identifying assessing and mitigating the risks to the integrity trustworthiness and authenticity of products and services within the supply chain. Supply chain disruptions: Unplanned and unanticipated events that disrupt the normal flow of goods and materials within a supply chain and as a consequence expose firms within the supply chain to operational and financial risks.5678

Supply chain disruptions may be viewed as events risks or vulnerabilities. The disruption can be classified by events causes effects and underlying factors. The application of vulnerability is aligned with the food fraud prevention application.

This SCRM and supply chain disruption classification system is implemented in a formal and integrated plan that supports formal business activities such as advanced planning and scheduling (APS) sales and operations planning (S&OP) manufacturing scheduling logistics scheduling and into the corporate finance and accounting systems. The takeaway point for food safety management and food fraud prevention is that implemented systems already exist that can contribute to efficient control of risks and vulnerabilities.

The first step in addressing and preventing supply chain disruptions is understanding what kind of problem is being addressed. Not all supply chain disruptions are the same. When I started researching supply chain disruptions I did not find a formal list or classification system. Also pandemics were not a type of event. It was a challenge to figure out where a pandemic should be categorized. A pandemic is a root cause of other types of events. The ""natural/hazard"" category of a fire assumes a fire at your facility or a supplier's facility not a forest fire in the region.

TABLE 1. Types of Supply Chain Disruptions

For food safety management and food fraud prevention we now have a way to explain our problems in supply chain management terms. This supply chain disruption classification system helps define the full impact of the problem and the root causes. By using this classification we can more efficiently utilize the supply chain risk management system.

Broader Scenario Planning

New broader scenario planning is needed.

There is an efficiency in narrowing our focus to the most common and worst problems. We can refine our focus when we have stable problems and a lot of data. The current problem is that we are experiencing new problems and we have very little if any useful historical data. Now what? What is normal? What is the ""new"" normal? How long will the new normal last?

Fortunately we have a way to address this uncertainty. We have the perspective that food safety problems have evolved from ""simple"" or ""complicated"" to ""complex"" or ""chaotic."" When the future is uncertain picking one way to respond might be simple but it is more effective to utilize scenario planning.

Scenario Planning

The supply chain disruption is total and completely uncertain so the traditional resources and responses to food fraud prevention may be outdated. The entire landscape must be reviewed. Usually we need to assess only simple scenarios such as how a shipment of product could impact our business (the result is a simple scenario and one action so we do not even think about this as scenario planning). While a corporate strategy and board of directors-level risk committee would consider geopolitical scenarios it has rarely been included at our front-line level. The result of scenario planning is to consider all the variables and then the full range of all possible future developments. Most probable scenarios will emerge. Also based on the type of problem (simple complicated complex or chaotic) a widening range of what could occur will be seen (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1. Hierarchy of Scenarios for Supply Chain Disruptions

Vulnerability Assessment Update

After identifying the scenarios that could occur—including the most probable and the range of higher potential—the vulnerability assessment can be updated. At this point new incidents probably have not occurred and are not yet supply chain disruptions; however some system weaknesses may exist that could cause them to appear. Also there may be some pretty simple and low-cost countermeasures or control plans that can be put in place to reduce vulnerability.

Enterprise Risk Management Update

These scenarios and updated vulnerability assessment results should be fed into the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM/COSO) systems. This updated information will help inform the corporation of the shifting enterprise-wide risks. Also this will calibrate which vulnerabilities have shifted above the risk tolerance.

Implement in a Real Management System

As defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and others a formal management system is a set of policies and procedures that comprise the way in which an organization manages the interrelated parts of its business to achieve its objectives. For addressing food safety management food fraud prevention or supply chain disruptions this is as simple as assigning team members conducting regular meetings that are documented conducting regular activities such as scenario development or updating vulnerability assessments and then reporting the compliance progress to company management. More complex businesses operations may require more extensive documentation and controls to fulfill legal obligations and meet organizational objectives.

As an application consider the Ukraine–Russia conflict. For example Ukraine is a significant producer of sunflower seeds and oil. On the day that Russia entered Ukraine the scenario planning would predict supply and demand problems for sunflower and related products as it is known that stressed supply creates a food fraud vulnerability. The food fraud acts that occur during supply shortages are substitution dilution or short-weighting. Simple first steps could be to ensure that authenticity tests are being conducted that the concentration is being monitored and that the weights or volumes are being confirmed. Those steps probably reinforce existing work processes and would vastly reduce the food fraud vulnerability.

Takeaway Points

More rigorous work processes are also needed so that we are not just chasing from one fire to the next.

New activities should be coordinated under a real management system. Often the activities are a series of one-off ad hoc responses to a problem or a project. If there were no real food fraud prevention management system in place then there would have been no proactive review of the impact of the Ukraine–Russia conflict. It may have been surprising when sunflower product pricing spiked or when availability became constrained. It will definitely be surprising if the food fraud vulnerabilities become supply chain disruption events. If a real food fraud prevention management system had been in place then these problems could have been prevented or at least mitigated.

Takeaway points include:

Supply chain management concepts can be applied to food safety management

Current food safety and food fraud risk assessment methods can be adapted to fit into supply chain management and corporate risk assessments

For an efficient discussion of risks—specifically a new risk explained in relation to all other enterprise-wide risks—the assessment should be calibrated with the overall company-wide financial risks.

Action items include:

Identify the team or accountable person (Is that you? Your supervisor?)

Review your current documentation methodologies and procedures

Review your audits and food safety management system (FSMS) standard to understand the scope and application of hazard identification

Conduct a gap analysis of your food safety management and food fraud prevention to identify where early warning and proactive responses to disruptions could be improved

Re-educate yourself and others before you start creating or implementing plans (see sidebar)

And then propose get approval and implement a management system.

Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Owns These 31 Dividend Aristocrats,"Buffett has positions in more Dividend Aristocrats than Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings reveal.

Warren Buffett loves dividends. His beloved Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.79%) (BRK.B 0.60%) owns quite a few dividend stocks. Three of them have track records of at least 25 years of dividend increases.

But you might be surprised about how many members of dividend royalty the legendary investor really owns. Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds 31 Dividend Aristocrats.

Like Baskin-Robbins

Just what is Buffett's ""secret portfolio""? In 1995 investment firm New England Asset Management (NEAM) was acquired by General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re). Three years later Berkshire bought Gen Re. NEAM doesn't hide its equity holdings; it reports them on a regular basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However these stocks are often overlooked by Buffett's followers even though they are owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

When it comes to Dividend Aristocrats these ""secret"" Buffett stocks are like Baskin-Robbins ice cream: They come in 31 flavors. Below are all 31 of the Dividend Aristocrats in NEAM's portfolio:

Company Sector Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 3M Industrials 64 Abbott Laboratories Healthcare 50 AbbVie Healthcare 50 Air Products & Chemicals Materials 40 Automatic Data Processing Information Technology 47 Becton Dickinson Healthcare 50 Chevron CVX -0.09% ) Energy 35 Church & Dwight Consumer Staples 26 Coca-Cola Consumer Staples 60 Emerson Electric Industrials 65 ExxonMobil Energy 39 General Dynamics Industrials 25 Illinois Tool Works Industrials 58 International Business Machines Information Technology 28 Johnson & Johnson Healthcare 60 Kimberly-Clark Consumer Staples 50 Linde Materials 29 Lowe's Consumer Discretionary 48 McCormick Consumer Staples 36 McDonald's Consumer Discretionary 45 Medtronic Healthcare 45 NextEra Energy Utilities 28 PepsiCo Consumer Staples 50 PPG Industries Materials 50 Procter & Gamble Consumer Staples 66 Realty Income Real Estate 28 S&P Global Financials 49 Sysco Consumer Staples 53 Target Consumer Discretionary 50 VF Corp. Consumer Discretionary 48 Walmart Consumer Staples 49

Several of the stocks on the list belong to an even more exclusive club than the Dividend Aristocrats -- the Dividend Kings. These stocks have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.

Biggest bets

Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds relatively small positions in most of these 31 Dividend Aristocrats. Chevron though stands out as a notable exception. As of the end of the second quarter of 2022 NEAM owned more than 2.15 million shares of the oil and gas giant.

Chevron also ranks as one of Berkshire's biggest bets. It's now the third-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and has performed well so far this year.

NEAM doesn't have huge stakes in any of the other Dividend Aristocrats. The next two after Chevron are AbbVie and Procter & Gamble. At the end of Q2 NEAM owned 75345 and 71551 shares of these two stocks respectively.

Best of the bunch

It isn't easy to pick the best of these Dividend Aristocrats. I think that Chevron is one of the stocks directly owned by Berkshire Hathaway that is also in NEAM's portfolio that's most likely to soar in the fourth quarter. My reasoning is that oil prices will move higher and provide a catalyst for the top energy stocks.

There are also some unstoppable trends that could benefit a few stocks on this list. For example an aging population should drive increased demand for products developed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The shift to clean energy should work to Air Products' advantage as it produces blue and green hydrogen.

Many of these stocks will probably be big winners over the next decade and beyond though. The power of growing dividends to boost total returns is no secret at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2VuZXJneS90b2t5by1nYXMtc2VsbHMtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1sbmctc3Rha2VzLWluLTMtNGItZGVhbC0yMDIyMTAwOC1wNWJvN2rSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woodside may pre-empt Tokyo Gas' $3.4b LNG sale,"Woodside Energy has signalled it will consider using its pre-emption rights against a shock move by Japan’s Tokyo Gas to transfer its interest in the Pluto LNG project in Western Australia – part of a broader $US2.15 billion ($3.37 billion) deal announced late Friday – to US private equity firm EIG.

Tokyo Gas’ 5 per cent stake in Pluto is one of four minority interests held by the giant Japanese LNG buyer in Australian LNG projects that are set to pass to EIG’s new MidOcean Energy subsidiary in what is the first significant sign of a Japanese firm exiting gas ventures driven partly by the need to cut emissions.",,,

When it comes to investing no investment strategy fits everyone. Some are comfortable with taking risks and investing solely in individual stocks. Others might not have the time desire or risk appetite to do so instead swaying toward exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

No matter your strategy many investors crave the stability and reliability of having their core holdings in an ETF. This is my strategy and the bedrock portion of my portfolio has been built on one ETF in particular: the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 0.01%). This fund is suited for my portfolio -- 54% of it to be exact -- and here's why it might be right for you too.

Buying the entire U.S stock market

Many experts warn against excess concentration in any single stock and 54% of one's portfolio in just one security is undoubtedly concentrated. That said this situation is different. The Vanguard S&P 500 invests in the 500 or so largest U.S. companies mirroring the traditional S&P 500. This includes a wide range of stocks everything from Apple to Johnson & Johnson. Therefore while I might have a heavy concentration in this one ETF it still contributes to a diversified portfolio.

What's great about this ETF is you barely have to pay anything to own it. The expense ratio -- the percent of your investment a fund charges each year to manage your money -- is just 0.03%. In other words if you invest $1000 into this ETF they will only charge 30 cents annually. Comparatively similar index funds can have expense ratios closer to 0.80% a far higher fee that can eat into your returns long term.

A tried and true solution to deliver stable returns over the long haul

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has done a stellar job at replicating the performance of the overall S&P 500. Since the ETF's inception in 2010 it has returned an average annual return of 12.54% not far from its benchmark's performance of 12.56% over the same period. That's the beauty of this ETF: It's not trying to beat the broad market but rather mirror it to achieve solid returns for the long haul.

Investors have a bright future assuming this performance can continue over the long term considering the S&P 500 hasn't seen a negative return on a rolling 20-year basis over the past century according to Crestmont Research. In other words if you owned the S&P 500 for any 20-year period dating back to 1919 you would have seen positive returns. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results the chances of this continuing are high as long as the United States remains a global economic leader.

For an investor with multiple decades in front of them they should aim to own a fund that can consistently match the market and provide those steady returns. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has proven it can do that. And as my core investment this portion of my portfolio serves as my ""safe"" money -- money I can count on by the time I retire.

With time on my side I'm letting compounding build the returns for me. If the past is any indicator that's all that's needed too. Since 1871 the S&P 500 has returned a compound annual growth rate of 9.37%. If that continues for the next 40 years just $10000 today could become worth nearly $360000.

Why 54%?

No strategy fits all but some investors want to leave some dry powder to invest in individual stocks myself included. That's why only 54% of my portfolio is in this ETF. The rest is in individual stocks like MercadoLibre Chipotle Mexican Grill and many more.

Why? Because I enjoy researching new companies finding innovative ideas and businesses and learning more about the world around me. While the goal is to generate solid returns for my retirement I also have the potential to beat the market with this strategy.

This might be a perfect balance for me but it might not be for you. No two investors are precisely alike so finding what works best for you is critical. However if you're looking for a stable ETF to build your portfolio around the Vanguard S&P 500 could be the one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL2tlbm9zaGFuZXdzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2RpbmluZy91bmlvbi1ncm92ZS1mYXN0LWZvb2QtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1zZXRzLW5ldy1tYXJrLWZvci1nb29kLWthcm1hLTIzLWN1c3RvbWVycy1pbi1hL2FydGljbGVfNzcyOWQ4NGEtYjJmYS01MjNmLTgzNzgtZWJhNDYyZDQ1OTliLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Union Grove fast-food restaurant sets new mark for good karma: 23 customers in a row 'pay it forward',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL2tlbm9zaGFuZXdzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2RpbmluZy91bmlvbi1ncm92ZS1mYXN0LWZvb2QtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1zZXRzLW5ldy1tYXJrLWZvci1nb29kLWthcm1hLTIzLWN1c3RvbWVycy1pbi1hL2FydGljbGVfNzcyOWQ4NGEtYjJmYS01MjNmLTgzNzgtZWJhNDYyZDQ1OTliLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7E45000>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL2tlbm9zaGFuZXdzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2RpbmluZy91bmlvbi1ncm92ZS1mYXN0LWZvb2QtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1zZXRzLW5ldy1tYXJrLWZvci1nb29kLWthcm1hLTIzLWN1c3RvbWVycy1pbi1hL2FydGljbGVfNzcyOWQ4NGEtYjJmYS01MjNmLTgzNzgtZWJhNDYyZDQ1OTliLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvZmFsbC1icmFuY2gtY2h1cmNoLXZhbmRhbGl6ZWQtc2hlcmlmZi1yZXBvcnRzL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvZmFsbC1icmFuY2gtY2h1cmNoLXZhbmRhbGl6ZWQtc2hlcmlmZi1yZXBvcnRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fall Branch church vandalized sheriff reports,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wjhl.com/news/crime/fall-branch-church-vandalized-sheriff-reports/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvZmFsbC1icmFuY2gtY2h1cmNoLXZhbmRhbGl6ZWQtc2hlcmlmZi1yZXBvcnRzL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvZmFsbC1icmFuY2gtY2h1cmNoLXZhbmRhbGl6ZWQtc2hlcmlmZi1yZXBvcnRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

STA. ROSA LAGUNA – Cignal overcame a slow start to give Akari a harsh welcome 20-25 25-23 25-18 25-16 in the 2022 Premier Volleyball League Reinforced Conference at the Sta. Rosa Sports Complex on Saturday Oct. 8.



American import Tai Bierria top scored with 20 points on 17 attacks two kill blocks and an ace to go along with nine excellent digs for an HD Spikers side that missed the services of Ria Meneses and Jerrili Malabanan.

Malabanan was in street clothes while Meneses is still recovering from knee issues which also bothered her in the previous conference. On the other hand Ces Molina only played the first two sets of the match as she is still recovering from a right ankle sprain.

“Of course I’m so happy sa performance niya” Cignal head coach Shaq Delos Santos said when asked about Bierria’s PVL debut. “Sabi ko nga sa kanya marami pa kaming kailangan i-improve marami pa kaming kailangan trabahuhin. Malayo pa malayo pa yung performance ng team namin talagang kailangan pumukpok pa kami and trabahuhin pa namin talaga ng 101 percent.”

“Very thankful especially kay Lord. First win and not too good of a game for us but syempre mas magpe-prepare pa kami. Marami kaming natutunan so maghahanda pa kami sa next game namin.”

Ahead by just two points in the fourth 15-13 Bierria Chai Troncoso and Angeli Araneta connived in a 6-1 run that gave them a seven-point 21-14 advantage.

Chargers reinforcement Prisilla Rivera and Araneta then traded hits before Akari’s errors doomed them at the end. Akari ended the game with three attack faults.

Rose Doria added 13 points which included four blocks while Troncoso chipped in 12 points in just two sets played.

How can The Enquirer offer readers a lengthy story (with four photos) about Gold Star dropping ""chili"" from its brand name without once mentioning its decades-long and Quixotic quest to compete with Skyline as the iconic purveyor of Cincinnati's signature dish? All the best to Gold Star I guess as it morphs into just another generic lunch joint but the real story here − one that interests Cincy food fans a lot more than two pages of unchallenged Gold Star spin − is the white flag the company is raising in the chili wars. Gold Star used to aggressively bill its chili as ""The Taste That's Taking Over"" a thinly veiled shot at Skyline but that never came close to happening. And now it's official in our chili culture that it never will.

Gratitude for the new Beechmont Corridor Trail

As a cyclist/runner/walker I would like to express my deepest gratitude for all those who worked to complete the new trail connector between the Lunken trail and the Little Miami River trail. To all those who contributed work hours finances and planning/execution your efforts are very much appreciated. Residents of Hamilton Clermont and Warren counties now have multiple avenues of available trails upon which to ride/run/walk. The Hamilton County park system is further enhanced by the new connector and we are blessed to be able to enjoy the fruits of their labor.

Giving to charity an option when selling a business

Despite the professional advice provided by Crystal Faulkner and Tom Cooney in their Sept. 28 article ""Considerations when ready to sell a business"" they omitted any discussion of charitable planning as a part of this complicated event. If a business owner has charitable intent he or she can transfer their entire business some assets or stock to the charity of their choice using a variety of methods (outright gifts deferred gifts trusts) and thereby avoid capital gain and estate taxes and even benefit themselves or family members. A trained planned giving officer can help craft these types of gifts.

Tell stories of women who choose to keep their babies

The Enquirer recently published a two-page article ""Anxious people cross state lines for abortions"" (Sept. 4) dedicated to a day in the life of a woman pursuing an abortion. I would challenge The Enquirer to publish a similar length article about a woman making the opposite choice to save her baby. To choose life for the baby couldn’t be easier. There are many pregnancy centers in Ohio and Cincinnati in particular where any woman or girl interested in saving her baby is welcome.

I recommend the Pregnancy Center East where all services are free. They offer medical financial emotional and physical support for the mother (and dad) for as long as needed even after the baby’s birth. They can help with parenting the child if that is the mother’s choice or with an adoption plan. The center states that there are 36 couples wanting to adopt for every child born. The child is placed directly with the adoptive family without the need for foster care.

For any woman who is pregnant and considering abortion consider choosing life. For information call the Pregnancy Center East at (513) 321-3100.

News media should present every side to a story

I was glad to see the Sunday edition had a Business Section. As I read through it I came across the article ""1st Lady: GOP sells women short."" This had nothing in it about business but only an opinion by Jill Biden. A free political ad.

About a year ago The Enquirer solicited from its conservative readers input about subjectivity in The Enquirer. This Sunday's article seems to belie the sincerity of the request to make any changes. In fact as I recall The Enquirer has not even been fully presenting the myriad of issues from the Dobbs case. I have not seen anything about the 17 physical fire bombing and vandalizing attacks against churches and birthing centers supporting pro-life stances by the group self described as ""Jane's Revenge."" Even FBI Director Wray noticed this violence but not The Enquirer. Political violence from Jan. 6 or Jane's Revenge and others should be equally intolerable.

A July 2022 Pew Research poll of journalists in this country (""US journalists differ from the public in their views of 'bothsidesism' in journalism"") revealed that 76% of adults believe journalists should present every side to a story equally but 55% of America's journalists do not. When it comes to credibility not political shilling where will The Enquirer stand?

UC leadership negligent when it comes to pedestrian safety

The extremely dangerous pedestrian street crossings on Jefferson Avenue have gone ignored for far too long by the University of Cincinnati leadership and there needs to be accountability for the recent student fatality and carnage adjacent to the Uptown Campus where a student was propelled some 50 feet in the air by a speeding motorist.

The university has a dedicated police force at its disposal and yet police officers and patrol cars don't seem to be patrolling the nearby streets stopping scofflaws and issuing tickets. Thousands of students faculty staff and visitors use the nearby sidewalks on a daily basis and the lack of any sort of UC police patrol seems nonexistent off-campus.

Excessive speeding is so common on Jefferson Avenue and MLK they should be considered ""freeways"" not city streets. It is time for someone in authority to be held accountable for such gross negligence and I am calling on the UC Board of Trustees to place Dr. Neville Pinto the president of the university on suspension for a year. He should also be required to spend at least an hour a day walking the off-campus street sidewalks with his staff. Maybe that way he and his staff will start thinking about student safety which should be one of their highest priorities.

No parent should have to consider if their child will be killed going to class at UC and now that is exactly what nearly 500000 parents are thinking about.

Cincinnati roads are a mess

Hey Cincinnati your roads are a mess. I remember a letter to the editor about two years ago from an outsider saying he was astonished at the condition of our roads and that they were like third-world countries he had visited. I felt the same about Norwood roads when my daughter lived there about six years ago. It has been a while since I visited Hyde Park and of all places that one would expect good roads I found Edwards and Madison roads in terrible condition. Cincinnati can and should do better.Likewise our new MLK interchange off of I-71 is such an wonderful traffic flow improvement but how about adding some landscaping to that concrete jungle like they do off the newer I-75 interchanges. It would make such a huge difference!

Appalachians helped build Hamilton and many other cities

Kentucky migrants helped build Hamilton as an industrial city (""Hamilton Sheds its Hamiltucky Image"" Sept. 7) and their descendants are helping build its new post-industrial future. We work in service high tech manufacturing and all the professions. We have helped provide the wealth and talent to support arts institutions and other public works.

We are today’s nurses waitpersons elder care workers restaurant owners school teachers lawyers and law enforcement officers. We urban Appalachians are proud of our performance in Ohio during the Hamiltucky days and we are proud of our current contributions. We have made the Miami Valley the world center of Bluegrass and other genres of mountain music. We have produced more books of social science poetry and novels than any community in Appalachia. We have produced several films including Dale Farmer’s recent ""Mountain Minor.""

Hamilton is not the only city Kentuckians and other Appalachian workers helped to build. There are also Middletown Franklin Newport Fairfield Elmwood Place Lockland and Sharonville and to a lesser degree we have helped shape the larger cities of Cincinnati Covington and Dayton. All three of these cities have had Appalachian mayors and council members. One of us was president and CEO of Procter and Gamble; others are deans and professors at our universities.

Rehiring search firm a bad idea

Seriously the city of Cincinnati has hired the same search firm to find Health Board candidates that was hired to find city manager candidates. PoliHire recommended two candidates for city manager who were already employed by the city. One of the candidates had bankruptcy and financial issues as well as a residency question. The search firm failed to make the city aware of these things during the process. Maybe The Enquirer's Sharon Coolidge who uncovered those issues should be hired by the city for background checks.

How are taxpayers supposed to believe City Council is a responsible steward of our tax money with decisions like this? What business would rehire the firm that did this kind of job the first time around?

Airlines take advantage of people's misery during hurricane

I simply do not understand how the airlines can be so greedy when personal safety is at stake as was the case with Hurricane Ian. This was our experience with one of the airlines and I'm pretty sure the others jumped their ticket prices too.

On Saturday a one-way ticket from Tampa to Cincinnati was $59. Checking back on Sunday it was $120. By Tuesday morning that one-way ticket had jumped to about $550. Seems ruthless to me that the airlines take advantage of those situations.

It was the same story after Hurricane Ian had come ashore missing Tampa. Booking a return ticket to go back home on Thursday cost $314 for a Friday flight. It went higher for flights leaving on Saturday.

It seems to me the airlines have forgotten all the help they received after the pandemic. Do unto others. Many personally and financially reach out to help those impacted. Seems airlines want to take advantage of other's misery to financially help themselves.

Bipartisanship in Congress is all but dead

Bipartisanship in Congress like it or not is all but dead. For confirmation of that all you need do is look at the vote counts for major legislation over the past couple of years and with few exceptions you'll find that each party voted in virtual unanimity. That means that when voting in the midterms if you're voting for any Democrat candidate you're really voting for Pelosi-Schumer and if you're voting for a Republican it's McCarthy-McConnell. With that in mind your struggle to pick between two candidates is really not as important as it used to be no matter how ""independent"" those candidates act. Too bad.

In 2016 Cisco Opened Its First Production Facility in India

The report claims that Cisco wants to benefit from government initiatives in India targeted at fostering domestic manufacturing. The source added that cooperation with an original design manufacturer (ODM) supplier would be utilised to set up Cisco's new factory. Including its Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) plan the Indian government recently revealed a series of schemes to promote domestic manufacturing. This strategy also aims to boost foreign investment in the country. In the year 2016 Cisco opened a production facility in Pune.

In order to create 2G 4G and 5G O-RAN for its OpenBeam portfolio in India that is appropriate for Indian and international bandwidths the U.S.-based O-RAN supplier Mavenir has established its production facility in Pune. “The OpenBeam Open RAN radio solutions are available across all frequency bands and can be used for a wide range of use cases including enterprises and public settings across urban or rural environments” Mavenir had said in a statement.

Sanmina and Reliance Industries subsidiary Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (RSBVL) have also partnered to make India a manufacturing hub. “The joint venture will create a world-class electronic manufacturing hub in India in line with the Prime Minister’s ‘Make in India’ vision. The joint venture will prioritise high technology infrastructure hardware for growth markets and across industries such as communications networking (5G cloud infrastructure hyperscale datacenters) medical and healthcare systems industrial and cleantech and defense and aerospace” Sanmina said in a release.

In accordance with the firms the partnership will build a production facility in Chennai which will work as an incubator hub to assist the environment for electronics start-ups and product development in India. The future 5G installations in the nation are expected to present commercial prospects for telecom equipment makers. As part of the India Mobile Congress event India's Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi formally declared the beginning of the 5G revolution in the nation on October 1.

Over 200 Indian cities will get 5G connectivity in the upcoming six months Vaishnaw added. In the following two years he continued 80–90% of the nation might have access to 5G services.

On August 1 the 5G spectrum auction in India came to an end and local carriers bought spectrum worth a total of $19 billion.

Bharti Airtel was the first telecom operator to roll out 5G in India. The company has activated its 5G services in eight locations with the aim to gradually reach the entire population by March 2024.

As telecom players hustle to launch 5G services across the country many use cases – from a 5G-connected ambulance to a robot for delivering medicines and food to the patient's bedside - could become a reality in India over the next few years. ET explainsThe showstoppers at the recently concluded India Mobile Congress (IMC) in New Delhi included 5G-connected ambulances a cattle tracker smart office solutions and cloud gaming. The idea behind a 5G-connected ambulance was to deliver critical/initial care to patients during the ‘golden hour’ or the first 60 minutes before a trauma or injury when prompt medical attention can often save lives. The ambulance will allow real-time transmission of a patient’s vitals and other health data from the vehicle directly to the hospital from where doctors can instruct paramedical staff. For mobile users enhanced mobile broadband and cloud gaming could be initial use cases. Cloud gaming will attract gaming enthusiasts as it will do away with the need for a gaming console as games could be played on a 5G-enabled smartphone. Reliance Jio Infocomm has launched a 5G-connected ambulance with Medulance an emergency medical response service provider. Bharti Airtel has demonstrated a 5G-connected ambulance use case in partnership with Apollo Hospitals and US-based networking gear maker Cisco . The ambulance is equipped with cameras and smart devices that allow real-time two-way audio and video communication high-definition footage transmission location tracking and real-time streaming of patient health data to a doctor over a high-speed 5G network.During the launch of 5G services on October 1 Prime Minister Narendra Modi experienced several 5G use cases first-hand. He could drive a car remotely and witness augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) through wearable devices. Airtel became the first telecom player to launch 5G services in eight cities while Reliance Jio has also announced a beta launch of 5G in four cities. Both telcos will gradually expand their 5G network coverage across India level by the end of 2023. Vodafone Idea has not yet announced the date of its 5G launch.The ecosystem around 5G mobile handsets enterprise use cases and devices has yet to fully develop in India. “The initial phase will be a lot more on enhanced mobile broadband. Most of the operators will launch a fixed wireless access device. This will be the most popular thing in the short run” said Peeyush Vaish partner and telecom sector leader Deloitte India. “There's going to be a very very big uptake from a B2B perspective on 5G but that is far away” Vaish added. The 5G network’s ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability will enable consumers to enjoy enhanced 4K video cloud gaming XR applications and live sports. The adoption of 5G however hinges on a developed and affordable ecosystem. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are another area of concern. India has a good and affordable smart-watch ecosystem which is likely to benefit from 5G services but advanced IoT use cases such as smart cars at affordable prices are still in the future said Aniket Dani director Crisil Research.According to telecom network gear maker Ericsson the following are a few global implementations in the enterprise segment. Telefónica Ericsson and Mercedes-Benz are building the world's first 5G mobile network for automobile production at its ""Factory 56"" in Sindelfingen Germany which will be the blueprint for all future vehicle assembly facilities worldwide.Ericsson and Volvo Cars have carried out a successful test handover of connected cars between two mobile 5G networks in different countries at the AstaZero test track in Sweden. Telia in Sweden will build and manage a dedicated 5G-ready mobile network for mining company Boliden at Aitik the world's most efficient open-pit copper mine in the north of Sweden. Ericsson and Ooredoo showcased an immersive sports demo that was broadcast live to a virtual stadium at Mall of Qatar where consumers experienced the VR and immersive experience of the match remotely."

Phillies fans packed Citizens Bank Park and could be seen waving white rally towels for most postseason—and even some regular season—games. Most Philadelphia fans probably still have the white towel with ""Fightin' Phils"" sprawled across it in white lettering on a red background somewhere.

Now that the Phillies have reached the MLB playoffs and will bring back postseason baseball to Philadelphia for the first time since 2011 on Friday against the Atlanta Braves the rally towels will come back as well.

However they won't be the classic white ones that fans and players grew accustomed to seeing. White rally towels have been banned by MLB since the last time the Phillies were in the postseason. Instead the towels you will see being waved around by fans on Friday during NL Division Series Game 3 will be red. It's apropos it is referred to as ""Red October"" after all.

""I wish they could bring the white towels back"" Phillies' first baseman Rhys Hoskins said. ""I’ll take any towels. They’ll bring ‘em back."" Hoskins is apparently in favor of the red towels though because when asked what color he wants to see he pointed to the red Phillies hat on his head.

It'll be a different look than in year's past but it's the symbol of a new era in Philadelphia Phillies postseason baseball. Either way the Bank is sure to be electric on Friday and Saturday if Game 4 is necessary.

Game one of the National League Wild Card Series was no different.

Friday was a pretty exciting day to be a Philadelphia Phillies fan.

That's right it wasn't some hyper-realistic dream the Phillies stormed back in the ninth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals rallying to a 6-3 win and pocketing game one of the National League Wild Card Series.

The contest exhibited a multitude of the themes that the Phillies had shown throughout their 2022 regular season: resilience a fighting spirit and most prevalently youth.

The difference maker in Friday's win was more than just Jean Segura's clutch single or Zack Wheeler's phenomenal outing – it was once again the Phillies 'Daycare'.

Bryce Harper Jean Segura and Aaron Nola all spoke on the 'daycare' both before and after Friday's game. Segura mentioned that he sees the Daycare as ""some VIPs on our team.""

That proved accurate both during the regular season and on Friday night.

In the rollercoaster that was game one the Phillies' one-through-five hole hitters managed a paltry 1-for-19 stretch reaching base just three times in total. Kyle Schwarber Rhys Hoskins J.T. Realmuto Bryce Harper and Nick Castellanos combined for one singular RBI and recorded all but one of the team's strikeouts on the day.

Conversely the bottom of the Phillies' lineup proved the pulse of the club going 4-for-13 reaching base six times and scoring thrice driving in five of the six Phillies' runs. 40-percent of the Phillies' eventual baserunners were players over the age of 30. The other 60-percent? All players under the age of 26. Three of the Phillies six runs scored came via the daycare as did half of the team's total RBIs. Collectively they struck out only once.

Think about it: Alec Bohm's wearing of a 101 mile-per-hour fastball Edmundo Sosa's stolen run Bryson Stott's multiple impressive plate appearances Brandon Marsh's RBI single under Nolan Arenado's glove... Without their younger core it's safe to assume that Friday's thrilling comeback victory likely doesn't happen. In some sick alternate reality the Phillies fall at the hands of Ryan Helsley and are fighting for their postseason life on Saturday.

Luckily the Daycare came to the team's rescue once again.

The rookies boosted the regulars on Friday night hopefully those same veterans can return the favor on Saturday as Aaron Nola and the Phillies aim to punch their ticket to the NLDS.

In a significant step towards promoting clean energy Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday declared Modhera  a village in the Mehsana district of Gujarat as India 's first solar-powered village .""Modhera which is associated with the Sun Temple will also be known for its strides in solar energy. Big day for Modhera as it takes a giant leap towards harnessing solar power"" said PM Modi  while addressing a huge gathering at Modhera.Now people of Modhera need not pay for electricity but they can start selling it and earn from it asserted the Prime Minister.Till a while back the government used to supply electricity to citizens but now with the installation of solar panels citizens will produce their own electricity said PM Modi.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said that the people of the state have blessed him for the last two decades and voted for him irrespective of his caste.""People of Gujarat have blessed me for the last two decades without looking at my caste without looking at my political background.""Before becoming the prime minister Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat between 2001 and 2014.Assembly elections in Gujarat are slated to be held soon. The elections are crucial for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which aims to retain power in PM Modi's home state while the Congress hopes for a win after remaining out of power for 27 years in the state.Modhera is famous for its Sun temple which is situated on the river Pushpavati . It was built by King Bhima-I of the Chaulukya dynasty in 1026-27.According to the Gujarat government which shared information in a series of tweets over 1000 solar panels have been installed on the village houses generating electricity round the clock for the villagers. Significantly they will be provided with solar electricity at zero cost.The Gujarat government has said that it has ensured the sustainable implementation of various welfare projects in Gujarat keeping in mind the Prime Minister's vision of increasing the use of renewable energy in India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2FobWVkYWJhZC9ndWphcmF0LXBvbGljZS1wYW5kaXQtZGVlbmRheWFsLWVuZXJneS11bml2ZXJzaXR5LWxhdW5jaC1zdXJ2ZXktb24tcHVibGljLXNhZmV0eS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDczMzA4OS5jbXPSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9haG1lZGFiYWQvZ3VqYXJhdC1wb2xpY2UtcGFuZGl0LWRlZW5kYXlhbC1lbmVyZ3ktdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1sYXVuY2gtc3VydmV5LW9uLXB1YmxpYy1zYWZldHkvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0NzMzMDg5LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gujarat Police Pandit Deendayal Energy University launch survey on public safety,"AHMEDABAD: Harsh Sanghavi the state MoS (home) on Saturday launched Garima project of the Gujarat Police and Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) at PDEU .

Sun 09 Oct 2022

FC Isle of Man have suffered a last minute defeat as visitors Padiham scored in extra time.

It was in the 93rd minute of the match that Joel Melia put the ball in to the Raven's net and gave a 1-0 win for the Lancashire side.

Manager Chris Bass snr says this is a higher level of football and that the Team did have ""at lot to learn"".

Bass went on to say ""it was sad to lose the game in the fashion they did"".

When the sides last met in August the Ravens beat Padiham 1-0 with a Jack McVey goal from a penalty.

FC Isle of Man have lost nine games out of fourteen with four wins and draw; it puts them at 17th in the North West Counties Football League Premier Division.

The next three games for the Manx side are away with the Ravens playing at West Didsbury & Chorlton on Tuesday evening (KO 7.45pm).

The next home game will be on October 29th where FC Isle of Man will hope to prevent a repeat of the 5-1 loss they suffered the last time they met Congleton Town in August.

OXFORD Miss. – Corinth Coca-Cola Bottling Works Inc. has been serving beverages since 1907. In that time the family-owned and operated organization has expanded from its original location in Corinth to multiple locations across the Mid-South.

And all the while family members have run the business. In its fifth generation of owner-operators Corinth Coke not only has deep roots in Coca-Cola and the Mid-South but also at the University of Mississippi where four generations of the family earned degrees.

To honor their UM legacy while helping future generations of students the family has funded one scholarship – the Corinth Coca-Cola Business School Scholarship Endowment – and formalized a second one Refreshments Inc. Partners in Business Scholarship Fund which has supported School of Business Administration students for many years.

“Our family has owned and operated this business for more than 100 years and we’ve got connections to Ole Miss that go back for generations as well” said Ken Williams Jr. who has two children who are either recent graduates or current students and represent the fourth generation of family at the university.

Corinth Coke’s chair Sandy Williams (BBA 57) and his wife Rosemary Taylor Williams (BS 60) a native of Lucedale as well as president and CEO Kenneth Williams (BBA 63) and his late wife Nancy Kincade Williams (BS 63) a native of Clarksdale all earned degrees from Ole Miss.

After completing undergraduate work at Millsaps College Corinth Coke’s COO Ken Williams Jr. earned his MBA in 1994 from the university. His daughter Emma is a junior at Ole Miss pursuing a degree in communication sciences and disorders. His oldest daughter Elizabeth graduated in 2018 with a degree in elementary education just like her grandmother Nancy Kincade Williams did in 1963.

Nancy Williams’ father Robert P. Kincade played football for the Rebels from 1935 to 1938 including the Rebels’ first and only appearance in the Orange Bowl in 1936.

“Our connections to Ole Miss are early and often” Williams said. “And several of us have been educated in the School of Business Administration.

“Our involvement with Ole Miss has been extremely beneficial to us and we want to aid students in northeast Mississippi so they have the same opportunities at the business school.”

To achieve this goal of helping other students the Coca-Cola Business School Scholarship awards a minimum of $1000 for four semesters to full-time students enrolled in the school who are residents of Alcorn Itawamba Lee Prentiss or Tishomingo counties.

Scholarship recipients must have a strong academic record as well as a history of involvement in extra-curricular activities and service to others and their communities.

“We believe it’s important to educate young people from our region in the decades to come” Sandy Williams said. “And we think Ole Miss is one of the premier places for that to occur and it’s right here in our own backyard.”

The Refreshments Inc. Partners in Business Scholarship provides funds to full-time sophomore junior and senior students in the school who are residents of Alcorn Itawamba Lee Marshall Pontotoc or Union counties.

The Refreshments Scholarship is funded in part by an annual golf tournament said Ken Cyree Ole Miss business dean and a veteran participant in this fundraiser.

“I have enjoyed the relationship with Kenneth and Sandy Williams since I have attended their charity golf tournament that benefits the Refreshments Inc. Scholarship for about a dozen years” Cyree said. “These events reveal the heart of this wonderful family to educate and elevate people in their organization and across the state and region.

“It has been great to meet the family members and interact with them over the years. They are selfless and caring individuals and I appreciate their dedication and commitment. They have left quite the legacy on their family company Corinth and Ole Miss in addition to the region.”

Family members hope the scholarship helps strengthen northeast Mississippi communities Kenneth Williams Sr. said.

“Our dream is that with our assistance some of the students from this area will attend the business school and then stay in Mississippi and join one of the many quality companies already established or perhaps even start their own business venture” he said. “Hopefully they will use their talents to better the state for generations to come.”

“We believe that those who live and work in the communities in these counties are part of our family” said Ken Williams Jr. “We’ve always felt that being involved in community events across the territories is an essential part of what we do.”

The Corinth Coca-Cola Business School Scholarship Endowment and the Refreshments Inc. Partners in Business Scholarship Fund are open to accept gifts from individuals and organizations. To contribute send a check with the endowment’s or the fund’s name noted in the memo line to the University of Mississippi Foundation 406 University Ave. Oxford MS 38655 or give online at https://give.olemiss.edu.

Kelly scored the game-winner in the 2022 Euro final this summer at Wembley Stadium in London to help the Lionesses claim their first major tournament trophy.

After England’ 2-1 win over the USWNT at Wembley on Friday Chastain met the English forward to reflect on Kelly’s big moment and what it meant for the next generation of women’s soccer players.

“I think that’s what every young girl wanted to be is seen on the football pitch and to have a space out there that they belong” Chastain told her. “The fact that it was on such a big stage and the significance of that victory obviously has changed the world of football here in England just like in the U.S. 20 something years ago.”

Chastain said there were a lot of young girls in the stands for Friday’s game which had a crowd of 76893 fans and that Kelly’s goal in the Euro final in July helped propel the game forward. Kelly had scored 20 minutes into stoppage time to secure the 2-1 win over Germany.

“They will forever remember the moment” Chastain said. “And they will want to have an opportunity to replicate it in 20 years. That’s fantastic to me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTE4NTEwONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PBBM's 1st 100 days: Recap of accomplishments policies,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTE4NTEwONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC80EEBC0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTE4NTEwONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Osborne's unwavering high standard of integrity drives him forward and inspires others to do likewise. He leads and encourages others from the front not the back by setting an example and always looking for ways to serve others.

""It joys me to see the look on people's faces when they're presented with a courtesy that's no longer common. I do it because it's pleasing to the Lord which is mainly why I do anything"" he said.

Osborne a Dewey High School senior is one of two students chosen as October Students of the Month in the Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise and Patriot Auto Group program.

He ranks first academically in his Dewey High School class and recently placed among the Top 100 in a national essay contest through one of his many AP courses. He also has been featured as a standout trombone soloist in The Big Red Pride.

Osborne is the youngest of a blended family of eight and enjoys all the attention afforded to him by his rank as the favorite child he says. He doesn't have his own car but hopes to rectify the situation soon.

He can't decide on his major at Liberty University. His heart is pulled into two directions: musical performance and education or software engineering.

Osborne was raised with computers — his father works in tech support — and he finds excitement in mathematics and coding. On the other side he has played piano for 10 years and trombone for six.

He calls music the best way to express himself and take a break from the world.

Osborne volunteers with his church the National Honor Society and ConocoPhillips' Global Finance Town Hall.

He doesn't back down from a challenge and loves anything to do with strategy. He fills those two interests by being an avid Magic the Gathering card player.

Osborne has slowly convinced his youth pastor and friends to join in on the card game and has attended local tournaments in Bartlesville.

He said his father is the biggest influence in his life.

""He taught me how to think to look for the why people do things not just the how they do things"" Osborne said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Victor New York company that owns Napa’s Robert Mondavi Winery and Healdsburg’s Simi Winery on Thursday sold various brands to The Wine Group of Livermore which owns the Benzinger Family Winery in Glen Ellen.

The labels included in the deal were Cooper & Thief Crafters Union The Dreaming Tree Monkey Bay 7 Moons and Charles Smith Wines. Zepponi & Co. of Santa Rosa served as an adviser to Constellation Brands on the sale.

In January 2021 Constellation Brands sold to E. & J. Gallo Winery a portfolio of more than 30 lower-priced brands for $810 million to pare down its operations.

Constellation also reported its earnings Thursday and noted net sales at its wine and spirits business grew 1% for the past quarter compared to same period a year ago.

The company also said it expects its wine and spirits business should have net sales from net-zero growth to a 2% decline for the current fiscal year.

Napa Valley winery files for bankruptcy

Spring Mountain Vineyard in St. Helena filed for bankruptcy last month as the winery that suffered damages in the 2020 Glass Fire claimed debts from $100 million to $500 million according to court records.

The winery controlled by Jaqui Safra who also owns Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. has 850 acres of property and employs 70 workers. It is best known for serving as the backdrop for the “Falcon Crest” TV series that ran 1981-1990 on CBS.

Court documents show the winery has been unable to come to agreement with its lender MMG which provided Spring Mountain a $185 million loan in October 2018.

In subsequent years the two parties have had to amend the loan and also enter into a forbearance agreement. They had ultimately agreed to retain a broker to sell the property by a certain date according to a court filing in the bankruptcy case.

Safra contends in the bankruptcy filings that his company has paid $103.6 million of the loan but because of a current interest rate of 16% MMG is now owed about $205 million.

The winery also is engaged in another federal suit with its insurer Mt. Hawley Insurance Co. over a $10 million insurance policy from claims from the Glass Fire. Spring Mountain said it had suffered more than $35 million in damages as a result of the blaze according to a court filing in that separate case.

Healdsburg winery adds new team members

Flambeaux Wine in Healdsburg has added two new members to its team at the family-owned winery.

Sarah Kelley has been named as the direct-to-consumer sales and marketing administrator after having worked for more than two decades at such local wineries as Flanagan Wines and Dutton-Goldfield.

Mike Mahoney has assumed the director of hospitality position after working for various hotels and resorts before entering the wine industry at Williamson Wines and Dutton Estate Winery both located in Sonoma County.

With its “welcome back to candy” tagline Tidbits gummies are formulated with prebiotic fiber and fruit juice while free from sugar alcohols artificial sweeteners and artificial coloring. A bag contains 4 grams of sugar.

“We’ve created the best better-for-you candy” said David Vartanian who co-founded parent company Stealth Health with his wife Kristi. “From a formulation perspective we wanted to make sure this product was compliant with the highest standards of natural grocery retailers in the United States. We looked at their banned ingredient lists.”

Whole Foods Market for example does not sell products containing hydrogenated fats high-fructose corn syrup and certain colors preservatives and flavors. Tidbits recipes do not incorporate any of these ingredients nor do they include allulose which has not been approved for use in the European Union or Canada.

Rather than resembling traditional candies Tidbits feature a small gumdrop shape.

“We didn’t want to give you a gummy bear a gummy worm a peach ring… They’ve all been done” Mr. Vartanian said. “We don’t want consumers to go into it with an expectation it’s going to taste a certain way only to fail them because it doesn’t taste like the real thing.”

Flavors include acai grape tropical citrus and wild berry.

“We didn’t want to give you the classic flavors you already know” Mr. Vartanian said. “We wanted to be mainstream but with an elevated twist.”

The products are available online at Amazon.com and tidbitscandy.com and are slated to roll out to natural grocery retailers soon Mr. Vartanian said.

Prior to launching the business Mr. Vartanian co-founded launched and scaled emerging brands for Constellation Brand Ventures Anheuser-Busch InBev’s ZX Ventures and PepsiCo Ventures. He began his career with The Hershey Co. in progressive sales roles.

He described Stealth Health as a “permissible snacking platform” that may encompass additional brands and product categories.

“We started with candy because it’s an easy one; people know it and like it” he said. “But we wanted to do it in an undercover healthy way… That’s the big vision for Stealth Health.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZy54dHJhd2luZS5jb20vZW4vd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtbGFyZ2VzdC13aW5lLXByb2R1Y2VyLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is the Largest Wine Producer in the World?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='blog.xtrawine.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/what-is-the-largest-wine-producer-in-the-world/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA310D00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZy54dHJhd2luZS5jb20vZW4vd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtbGFyZ2VzdC13aW5lLXByb2R1Y2VyLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

Perhaps it will make you feel a little better about your own budget pressures. Or at the very least you may feel less alone as you navigate the cost of living crisis now gripping the globe. COVID lockdowns curb Chinese prices If you want to avoid rapidly rising prices China is the place to be – if you don’t mind ongoing COVID-lockdowns that is. But even Chinese consumers are feeling the pinch on some items as North Asia Correspondent Eryk Bagshaw reports: While much of the rest of the world grapples with surging inflation China – in the midst of ongoing COVID-lockdowns inflicting self-harm on the economy – has contained inflation to between 2-3 per cent.

Inflation fell to 2.5 per cent in August year-on-year from 2.7 per cent a month earlier. Fuel prices which are controlled by state economic planners dropped as did food despite the drought gripping parts of the country. “[The] zero-COVID policy is a major deflationary force which supports production but saps demand” said Macquarie Group’s chief China economist Larry Hu. Pork a key ingredient in many Chinese meals is always a sensitive price point. It jumped by 22.5 per cent in August on the back of more people cooking at home forcing the Chinese government to dip into the national meat reserves to bring prices back down in time for the holidays in September and early October. Falling demand has hit the property sector the hardest with new home prices declining for the twelfth consecutive month in August. That has triggered concerns about a property market collapse as developers abandon empty apartment blocks and buyers are left holding empty assets.

Externally China’s rolling COVID restrictions are having an upward inflationary impact outside of its borders by tightening shipping supply lines and limiting the flow of goods out of its ports – pushing up prices for electronics and other consumer items in Australia and around the world. Rice and rents surge in South-East Asia From protests in Jakata over rising fuel costs to Singapore’s rental crisis many Asian nations are grappling with price pressures reports South East Asia Correspondent Chris Barrett: Over a few cheap beers this week at Colbar a traditional kampong-style eatery in the Singapore suburbs one person at our table complained about their landlord raising the rent on their one-bedroom apartment by $SGD800 ($867) or about 25 per cent. “Take it” was the response from the rest of the group.

In Singapore skyrocketing rental prices are the talk of the town. The housing market in the Southeast Asian financial hub is not cheap at the best of times. In the past year however rent has been going through the roof. Driven by new arrivals including from Hong Kong as well as Singaporeans upgrading to condominium apartments usually occupied by expatriates prices are up 27 per cent in the past year. Rents are soaring in Singapore. Credit: Bloomberg Now two-bedroom condo units in Orchard the red dot’s famous shopping centre are going for as much as $SGD9000 a month and when tenants’ leases are expiring their rents are being forced up by as much as 40 per cent. In Singapore already eye-watering private school fees paid by expats and their employers are also on the rise as inflation has reached a 14-year high of 5.1 per cent and the cost of owning a car is up 24 per cent in a year.

At the other end of the scale the rising price of the city-state’s famous chicken rice has also been in the news since Malaysia concerned about its own domestic supply suspended chicken exports in June. Singapore until then imported 3.6 million chickens a month from its closest neighbour – about a third of what it needs – and has since had to strike deals with Indonesia instead to try and cover the shortfall. Malaysia has suspended chicken exports. Credit: AP In Malaysia where inflation hit 4.7 per cent in August consumers are feeling the pinch from the depreciating value of its currency the ringgit most keenly at the supermarket. Everything from carrots which are imported from Australia to bottled cooking oil has gone up noticeably the kitchen frying staple impacted by a shortage of workers to harvest palm oil as well as global push factors like the war in Ukraine. The cost and supply of edible oil have also been a big deal this year in Indonesia whose government responded by imposing a price cap and then a controversial short-lived export ban.

More recently it has been fuel and rice that are putting the squeeze on people in south-east Asia’s largest economy. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Jakarta and other cities last month after fuel subsidies were cut to relieve pressure on the government budget. It was a decision that sent prices at the bowser up by 30 per cent hurting the country’s 130 million motorcycle users in particular. The latest pressure point is rice with a kilogram in Jakarta’s main market surging from 9500 rupiah (96 cents) to 13600 rupiah in the past month. Cost of living to swing US midterms The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act is aimed in part at cooling price pressures. But Americans still face rapidly escalating costs relative to wages and may soon take out their frustration at the polls as North America Correspondent Farrah Tomazin reports:

It’s a weekday morning in Washington and a woman in a pink sweatsuit is examining a shelf of fruit at Whole Foods one of America’s main supermarket chains. Rising prices are hurting shoppers at Whole Foods stores in the US. Credit: Patrick T. Fallon She picks up a small plastic container of pre-cut organic pineapple cubes shaking her head at the $US13.96 price tag – the equivalent of almost $22 in Australia. “This is why we call this grocery store Whole Pay Cheque instead of Whole Foods” the 43-year-old social worker from south-east DC tells me. “The prices are astronomical.” Walk into any supermarket furniture outlet or petrol station across the country and you’re likely to hear similar concerns.

With national inflation hitting a 40-year high this year countless Americans are feeling the pinch as the cost of necessities spikes faster than many average incomes. In supermarkets the price of almost everything on the shelf has surged. Eggs for example were 40 per cent higher in August than the same last year according to the latest consumer price index figures. Chicken and bread rose by about 16 per cent over the same period and even processed fruits and vegetables spiked by more than 14 per cent. US petrol prices surged mid-year but have moderated since then. Credit: AP At the bowser average US gas prices reached a record high in June topping $5 per gallon. They’ve come down since – the national average was sitting at $3.86 a gallon by Thursday this week – but the decision of oil-producing nations on Wednesday to cut production by 2 million barrels a day has renewed anxiety about potential future pain. As for housing affordability? Rents continue to rise at the fastest pace in decades – a record 11.3 per cent last year according to real estate research firm CoStar Group – fuelled by a lack of supply and higher post-pandemic demand.

The Biden administration says it has sought to alleviate some of the price pain by attempting to fix broken supply chains giving the Federal Reserve “full reign” to fight inflation and tapping into the strategic oil reserve - something it may have to do again in wake of OPEC’s production cuts. It also recently passed the so-called Inflation Reduction Act - a sweeping new law that aims to lower prescription drug costs tackle climate change and raise taxes on billion-dollar corporations. With the midterm elections looming next month President Biden will be hoping for better news on cost-of-living pressures. Credit: AP “This is the single most important legislation passed in the Congress to combat inflation and one of the most significant laws in our nation’s history” Biden said last month at a White House ceremony to showcase the reforms. But the country’s economic reality is somewhat harsher than the President’s rosy messaging – particularly for low-income families and Black and Hispanic Americans because a disproportionate share of their income goes toward essentials such as housing transportation and food.

And with the midterm elections in five weeks the cost of living in the US could end up determining who controls Congress after November 8 – and in turn the fate of Joe Biden’s first-term agenda. Britons fork out $20 for fish and chips And finally to London where a grief-stricken nation is also confronting some of the highest power prices in the world and a rapidly escalating price tag for the nation’s most loved dish as Europe Correspondent Rob Harris reports: The fish and chip shop a staple of British cuisine is bearing the brunt of an economic crisis that threatens to cripple Britain and Europe this winter. The traditional “chippy” has been smashed by rising energy bills dramatic increases in the wholesale costs of vegetables and the British government imposed tariffs on Russian fish in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

An increase in prices and a 25 per cent tariff on all seafood imported from Russia – where about a third of all imported white fish in Britain is sourced from - has had a devastating effect on the industry. In turn the price of a meal has increased from an average of £8.50 ($14.80) to £11.50 ($20.05) nationally. Fish and chips is becoming exorbitantly expensive in Britain. Credit: AP Industry bosses fear the cost of living crisis could force 3000 of Britain’s estimated 10500 chippies to close in Britain’s cities and villages could also be lost. Potato crops were also ravaged by the UK’s heatwaves this summer which saw a record-breaking 41 degrees Celsius being recorded in some parts of the country. The increase in wholesale prices of potatoes has been passed on to customers in restaurants takeaways and supermarkets. But it is on their power bills that Britons are feeling perhaps the biggest pinch with an average price per kilowatt hour for electricity of 89 cents compared with 29 cents in Sydney and 21 cents in Melbourne.

Prime Minister Liz Truss has intervened to freeze energy prices for households for two years. In early September Truss announced that the average annual bill for a typical household would be capped at £2500 to protect consumers from the intensifying cost of living crisis and a scheduled 80 per cent rise in the cap to £3549. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has announced support for consumers being battered by high energy prices - but the cost to the public purse is uncertain. Credit: AP The ultimate cost of the policy is uncertain as it is highly dependent on the wholesale cost of gas which has soared since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine put a squeeze on already-volatile international markets. Ballpark projections had put the cost anywhere from £100 billion to £150 billion. Richard Coleman Ord a fifth-generation chip shop owner from Colmans in South Shields says soaring prices had been even tougher on business than the pandemic. “The potatoes the fish the oil all the commodity prices have gone up beyond our wildest dreams - even though we’ve been in business for 60 years” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Costco Is Pulling These Beloved Items From Stores,"Costco is one of the most iconic and nifty big box retailers to shop at and their stores carry a wide variety of products that shoppers rave about online. As reported by Eat This Not That! some of our favorite Costco items simply cannot last forever and the warehouses use a method that many customers have deemed the “death star.”

When an item is about to be discontinued the publication notes that shoppers may find a “small asterisk in the top right-hand corner of its price tag.” This ultimately signals that the item will not be restocked once sold out. Popular YouTube channel Gina’s Shopping Life (which often covers Costco-related information and savings deals) just uploaded a round-up of Costco items that contain the star and that will soon unfortunately be absent from shelves:

Condiments and Breakfast Cereals:

In the YouTuber’s video the content creator explained that the following products were marked with the dreaded star:

Log Cabin Original Syrup (which used to be sold in packs of two 64-ounce jugs) and is now discounted to $7.49 each while supplies last

Hershey’s Simply 5 Syrup (similarly and formerly sold in packs of two) and remaining packs are $10.69

Carapelli Unfiltered Organic EV Olive Oil

Big Tree Farm Organic Coco Aminos Teriyaki Sauce & Marinade

Kellogg’s Frosted Mini Wheats (Gina’s video showed 70-ounce boxes that include two bags of the cereal) sold for $8.99

Many product prices have increased over the past year and the popular warehouse — known for providing bulk items at a cheap price—did admit that membership prices could increase if need be. However with all of these increasing prices there is some good news; Costco has been stubborn about keeping some of their customer favorites at a low cost sometimes even to their own detriment.

Here are a few of the Costco items that seem to be inflation-proof and for even more Costco shopping tips here are 10 Costco Finds Customers Are Currently Raving About.

Hot Dog & Soda Combo

The infamous hot dog and soda combo at Costco's food court will remain $1.50 for eternity — or at least that's what Costco's CFO Richard Galanti promised in a recent earnings call. He mentions that the profit margins that the company is experiencing through their gas and travel sector they are able to absorb some of those losses they are experiencing in their food court. According to Fox Business the $1.50 combo was introduced in the 1980s and the price has yet to change since.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Pumpkin Pie

Costco customers over on Reddit have been thoroughly discussing the low prices of the Costco Pumpkin Pie which seems to be around $5.99 for most customers across the country. Some are even pointing out the decrease in price saying that the pie was sold at $6.99 last year.

With such a low price this pie can actually become an affordable snack. ""At about $6 if you slice it in the traditional 8-piece pattern that's 75¢ a slice"" writes Reddit user u/ADHDCuriosity. ""A filling snack for less than a buck!""

This is not to be confused with the organic version which tends to be a bit higher in price so be sure to take a look at the label before buying your pie in Costco's bakery section.

Rotisserie Chicken

According to the Consumer Price Index chicken prices nationwide have increased by 16.4% and experts predict that number will continue to increase due to the ongoing bird flu outbreak. And yet while chicken prices are rising Costco—and other major wholesale retailers like Sam's Club and BJ's—the rotisserie chicken will remain under $5 for customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzYzOTU0OTcvY29zdGNvLWl0ZW1zLWRpc2NvbnRpbnVlZC1mYWxsLTIwMjItbmFtZS1icmFuZC0yL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzYzOTU0OTcvY29zdGNvLWl0ZW1zLWRpc2NvbnRpbnVlZC1mYWxsLTIwMjItbmFtZS1icmFuZC0yL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seven items Costco is discontinuing this fall including popular name-brand items and tasty treats...,"'DEATH STAR' Seven items Costco is discontinuing this fall including popular name-brand items and tasty treats

The items were seen with the ""death star"" which refers to an asterisk used by the retail giant to foretell the discontinuation of an items.

This asterisk on the price tag of the item reportedly indicates that it will be discontinued at the very least through the rest of the season.

Worst case scenario items tagged with the death star disappear and never return.

The items that will soon disappear from shelves were revealed in a recent video by Gina's Shopping Life.

Log Cabin Syrup

One of the noted items is Log Cabin Original Syrup which came in packs of two 64-ounce jugs.

Customers can currently buy the product at Costco for $7.49 each while supplies last.

Dumplings

Pulmuone Chicken Dumplings are also reportedly being kicked to the curb as well as the Pulmuone Thai Basil Dumpling.

A Costco shopper in San Francisco found them on clearance and they will soon be absent from stores.

Hershey's Simply 5 Syrup

The rich Hershey's Simply 5 Syrup is getting pulled from the rack according to Gina.

However you may purchase the two-pack for $10 while supplies last.

Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats

The champion's cereal Kellog's Frosted Mini Wheats is getting the boot.

The product along with the previously mentioned syrup have been at Costco for some time and Gina was surprised to see them being discontinued.

Drinks and Condiments

Sadly drinks and sauces are also getting evicted including:

Kirkland Signature Strawberry Margarita made with Gold Tequila

Kohana Organic Coffee Cold Brew Concentrate

Carapelli Unfiltered Organic EV Olive Oil

Big Tree Farm Organic Coco Aminos Teriyaki Sauce & Marinade

Refrigerated and Frozen Foods

Additional foods that are expected to be discontinued include:

Just Cook ABF Lemon Herb Chicken Thigh

Calle Sabor Sofrito Chicken Thigh

Pescanova Citrus Herb Shrimp

Eli's S'mores Squares

Cado Frozen Dessert Java Chip Non-Dairy

Salty and Sweet Snacks

Some of the snacks that you may have been used to seeing will no longer be sold at Costco:

Nature's Intent Seed & Nut Keto Bombs

Hawaiian Host Toasted Coconut Milk Chocolate Macadamias

Clif Bar Builder's Variety Protein Bars

Wonderful Pistachios Chili Roasted Kernels

Hoody's Keto Coconut Dark Chocolate Trail Mix

Kinder Bueno Chocolate Bars 20 Count

Schwartz Brothers Lemon Bars

Simple Mills Organic Garlic & Herb Cracker

Kellog's Scooby Doo Grahams

Schwartz Bros Organic Everything Bagel Chips

News of the discontinued items comes after a Costco super fan broke down the best fall deals in the warehouse store.

SUPPLIED

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) a member of the World Bank Group on October 8 awarded Cambodia’s first EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) green-building certification for commercial office projects to Phnom Penh’s VTrust Tower owned by Golden Tree Co Ltd (GT).

This comes just three days after GT received approval in-principle from the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) to issue the Kingdom’s approximately $3 million inaugural “green bond” on the local bourse and is seen as a boost for the company’s pre-issuance preparations. CSX CEO Hong Sok Hour believes that the debt security could be issued as soon as next month.

According to edgebuildings.com: “EDGE is a green building certification system focused on making buildings more resource-efficient.”

Citing an IFC report GT commented in a statement that “28 per cent of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions originate from buildings” and suggested that “the development of green buildings presents an enormous opportunity to reduce global carbon footprint and environmental impact”.

The report “Green Buildings: A Finance and Policy Blueprint for Emerging Markets” indicates that “market potential for green buildings in cities in developing countries is astronomical – an estimated $24.7 trillion by 2030” the statement highlighted.

The Grade B VTrust Tower is located on Street 169 across the street from Bak Touk High School in Prampi Makara district’s Veal Vong commune.

According to the website the building was given “Predicted Savings of EDGE Certification” ratings of: 24 per cent in “energy savings”; 52 per cent in “water savings”; 84 per cent in “less embodied energy in materials”; and a 232.04-tonne reduction in CO2 emissions per annum.

Speaking in the statement GT executive vice-president Judy Tan stated that the international certification was a testament to her company’s dedication in aligning with the government in cutting CO2 emissions.

“Beyond environmental stewardship GT is further committed to [the] ESG [environmental social and governance] standard. We would like to do more keep on improving ESG issues that we and the industry as a whole are currently facing.

“We believe this initiative would help us design and implement long-term sustainable policies that are able to support GT’s growth and strengthen our competitive advantages in term of improvement in risk management service quality and excellence in operation for our tenants teammates partners and all stakeholders. ” she said.

The statement said that GT plans to increase its distinct portfolio of green commercial office buildings and “develop manage and invest in green residential projects and eco-industrial parks”.

And without elaborating further the statement added that the company also seeks to build a synergised “community of businesses” geared towards jointly managing resource risks and improving performance in criteria specific to the environmental and socio-economic fields.

Meanwhile the CSX’s Sok Hour told The Post last week that GT’s green bond is planned to carry a coupon rate of seven per cent and a tenor of five years. He explained that the issuance process of this class of debt security would be largely the same as that for regular bonds but with climate and environmental considerations added to the eligibility criteria.

“Eco-friendly and climate-forward investments are becoming popular and that’s why Golden Tree Co Ltd and a number of other companies are looking for accreditation from experts among independent parties such as international institutions like the World Bank.

“I believe that these securities could be more special than previously-available ones in that it will be open to individual investors as well” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtobWVydGltZXNraC5jb20vNTAxMTY1MDI2L2FjbGVkYS1zZWN1cml0aWVzLXBsYy1uYW1lZC1iZXN0LXNlY3VyaXRpZXMtYnJva2VyYWdlLWluLWNhbWJvZGlhLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ACLEDA Securities Plc. named best securities brokerage in Cambodia 2022,"ACLEDA Securities Plc. named best securities brokerage in Cambodia 2022

But as progress maintained steady over the last several months the Environmental Protection Agency was seemingly waiting as patiently as his fans were for his videos to upload.

When they took action its effects sent ripples across the aftermarket automotive performance community. The contents of correspondence between Rich and the EPA said in no uncertain terms that the Model D as it's known with its new engine was violating provisions of the Clean Air Act. Long story short that means registration suspensions and fines that add up make a base model Lexus blush.It's by no means the first time Rich has been a thorn in the side of powerful figures in the automotive industry. As far back as the mid-2010s he was detailing his struggles to source OEM parts as minute as wheel nut covers through Tesla's official supply network. He then one-upped himself by gathering bits and pieces of two salvaged Model S doner cars. Through his trademark brand of DIY magic Rich made it all work harmoniously with an LS V8 from a 2011 Camaro and called it ICE-T Rich was now on the radar of private automakers and government bodies regulating them whether by accident or on purpose. With this in mind maybe Rich shouldn't be surprised when fines in excess of $45000 per violation threatened to be levied against him come in the form of a certified letter straight from his state branch of the EPA. Rich should consider himself lucky he's not a resident of New Jersey.Because as pointed out their particular state EPA branch can be even more aggressive. Scouring the internet for out-of-regulation diesel pickup trucks for sale and taking them to the crusher if they're not put back into compliance. It would be a travesty if the Model D were destroyed using the same justifications. So instead of cowering in fear Rich lawyered up with someone who isn't your average civil defense attorney. His name is Allen. He's a licensed attorney and the owner of SQ Motorsports a performance shop in Louisville Kentucky. Only to find out the letter was a fake one sent out as a sick joke. The investigation as to the letter's origins is still ongoing.Through his legal practice Allen represents clients who've been served with letters from government regulators for possession of emissions-incompliant racing vehicles that in his words ""may get driven six weekends a month."" check out the video below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzIwMjMtcmFtLTI1MDAtaGVhdnktZHV0eS1yZWJlbC13aXRoLWN1bW1pbnMtbW90b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why The 2023 Ram 2500 Heavy Duty Rebel Is Now A Compact Power Wagon,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzIwMjMtcmFtLTI1MDAtaGVhdnktZHV0eS1yZWJlbC13aXRoLWN1bW1pbnMtbW90b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHA6Ly9iYXJiYWRvc3RvZGF5LmJiLzIwMjIvMTAvMDgvaGFwbGVzcy1iYXRzbWVuLWNvc3Qtd2VzdC1pbmRpZXMteWV0LWFub3RoZXItc2VyaWVzL2FtcC_SAVtodHRwOi8vYmFyYmFkb3N0b2RheS5iYi8yMDIyLzEwLzA4L2hhcGxlc3MtYmF0c21lbi1jb3N0LXdlc3QtaW5kaWVzLXlldC1hbm90aGVyLXNlcmllcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hapless batsmen cost West Indies yet another series,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPConnectionPool(host='barbadostoday.bb', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/10/08/hapless-batsmen-cost-west-indies-yet-another-series/amp/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x0000018ECA088070>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHA6Ly9iYXJiYWRvc3RvZGF5LmJiLzIwMjIvMTAvMDgvaGFwbGVzcy1iYXRzbWVuLWNvc3Qtd2VzdC1pbmRpZXMteWV0LWFub3RoZXItc2VyaWVzL2FtcC_SAVtodHRwOi8vYmFyYmFkb3N0b2RheS5iYi8yMDIyLzEwLzA4L2hhcGxlc3MtYmF0c21lbi1jb3N0LXdlc3QtaW5kaWVzLXlldC1hbm90aGVyLXNlcmllcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vdmlzdWFsc3Rvcmllcy9zcG9ydHMvbXVzY2xlLXBvd2VyLW1vc3QtNnMtaW4tdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC0xMTQxOS0wOS0xMC0yMDIy0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi92aXN1YWxzdG9yaWVzL3Nwb3J0cy9tdXNjbGUtcG93ZXItbW9zdC02cy1pbi10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTExNDE5LTA5LTEwLTIwMjI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Muscle Power: Most 6s in T20 World Cup,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vdmlzdWFsc3Rvcmllcy9zcG9ydHMvbXVzY2xlLXBvd2VyLW1vc3QtNnMtaW4tdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC0xMTQxOS0wOS0xMC0yMDIy0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi92aXN1YWxzdG9yaWVzL3Nwb3J0cy9tdXNjbGUtcG93ZXItbW9zdC02cy1pbi10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTExNDE5LTA5LTEwLTIwMjI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA089F30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vdmlzdWFsc3Rvcmllcy9zcG9ydHMvbXVzY2xlLXBvd2VyLW1vc3QtNnMtaW4tdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC0xMTQxOS0wOS0xMC0yMDIy0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi92aXN1YWxzdG9yaWVzL3Nwb3J0cy9tdXNjbGUtcG93ZXItbW9zdC02cy1pbi10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLTExNDE5LTA5LTEwLTIwMjI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Twenty-three customers in the restaurant’s drive-through lane took turns Thursday paying for the person next in line behind them — a new record-high number at the restaurant.

“It was kind of unreal” said employee Sharlene Wincek who was working the drive-through lane at the time.

The spontaneous gesture of goodwill toward strangers impressed the McDonald’s crew so much that Wincek posted it on Facebook congratulating Union Grove for the community’s generosity.

It also turned an average day at work into a memorable and heartwarming experience.

Restaurant manager Tyler Gaethke said he was amazed to see so many people reach into their pockets and connect with total strangers through mutual benevolence.

“Sometimes you have good days and bad days” Gaethke said. “But that was a great day.”

The concept of “pay it forward” — popularized by a 2000 movie with that name — involves random acts of kindness toward others typically by buying their coffee meal or groceries. It is often done anonymously so a recipient never knows who their secret donor was.

At the Union Grove McDonald’s restaurant 835 15th Avenue which serves about 900 customers a day employees usually see someone pay it forward in the drive-through lane about once a day.

A recipient has the option of grabbing their free lunch and leaving. But frequently when someone discovers that their meal has been paid for they continue the spirit of giving by anonymously paying for the person in line behind them. And so on.

The previous record-high streak at the restaurant was 15 people in a row.

Bob Wright of Burlington was No. 8 in the sequence Thursday. When Wincek told him that his Big Mac meal had been paid for Wright smiled and took care of the next customer.

Even though it ended up costing Wright a few dollars more than his own lunch would have cost he said it felt good to help someone else.

“It seemed like the right thing to do” he said. “Someone buys you lunch — why not?”

Wincek said she is always careful not to pressure people into continuing a pay-it-forward streak. She realizes that money is tight and that even just a few dollars can make a big difference for some families.

When Wincek watched one customer after another pay it forward until 23 had participated she was speechless.

Several of them paid more than what their own meal would have cost. But whether the next customer was getting a simple cup of coffee or lunch for a carload of people everyone just continued giving and giving.

“It was beautiful” Wincek said. “I feel like it’s the community coming together.”

The process sometimes slows things down in the restaurant’s drive-through lane as employees take a moment to explain to each customer what is happening.

But no one seems to mind the minor inconvenience.

Autumn Russell a shift manager at the restaurant said she has worked at other McDonald’s locations in the past. She has never seen so many people pay it forward as she does in Union Grove.

Russell said she will not complain about the line moving a little more slowly.

“People want to help each other out” she said. “It’s wonderful.”

Mill Spring NC – October 8 2022 – Lauren Balcomb took the win in the $75000 John Deere Greenville Turf & Tractor Grand Prix CSI 2* astride Verdini D’Houtveld Z owned by Balcomb herself and partner Sharn Wordley with an impressive time of 39.95 seconds. Following close behind in second place Sharn Wordley (NZL) riding Fernando Cardenas’ 2009 Warmblood gelding Valentine Car (Son of Juan Car x Galiani CH) who sped to a time of 40.10 seconds. David O’Brien and Chansonette Farm LLC’s 2012 Oldenburg stallion El Balou Old (Eldorado VD Zeshoek x Balou du Rouet) snagged the third place position with a time of 41.36.

Guilherme Jorge’s (BRA) course challenged 32 entries with 13 combinations going clear and advancing to the jump-off. Wordley and Valentine Car had the leading time early on in the class however Balcomb and the 2011 Zangersheide gelding Verdini D’Houtveld Z (Verdi TN x Caretino 2) were able to beat his time by a small margin.

“I think I was a little bit faster to the combination. I left one stride out and we were both pretty fast everywhere else.”

While Verdini D’Houtveld Z is known on the show circuit as a top show jumper he actually was bought by Balcomb to do three day eventing: “I’ve owned since he was a six year old. I’ve been jumping him Grand Prix level for a long time now. He was actually a [3-day eventing] horse that’s what I bought him to be because I was still eventing. Then I brought him [to America]. He did a few events and he was jumping so well that I did some show jumping as I was ready to make the change.”

I mean to get to compete under these lights the music the atmosphere it’s amazing. Everyone’s really friendly. It doesn’t get much better than this.”

This was a memorable night for Balcomb as she had some very special visitors: “My parents are here visiting from Australia. This is the first competition that they’ve seen me jump the Grand Prix level…They’re here looking after our two babies we’ve got our 18 month old and six week old baby here.”

Balcomb also took the Marthaler Jewelers’ Leading Lady Award as the highest placed female rider in the Grand Prix. As the winner of this award Balcomb will take home a 14-karat gold necklace with .33 carat diamonds. “It’s such a great prize” Balcomb exclaimed “I was really hoping to win the award tonight!”

Urban and company offered a string of hits including “Days Go By” “Never Comin’ Down” “Somewhere in My Car” and “John Cougar John Deere John 3:16” as well as his 2021 Billboard Country Airplay hit “Wild Hearts” which honors “all of those dreamers ready to fly” as the country music singer encourages them that “Anything can happen in this life/ If you got that heart and the passion and a God lit fire inside.”

Over the nearly four decades Urban has spent honing his craft from playing tiny clubs to sold-out arenas it’s clear that his own passion for music and performing hasn’t dimmed. That timespan also forged a musician with not only ace guitar skills and an encyclopedic knowledge of a range of music but a level of musical dexterity that allows him to interweave his own hits with snippets and riffs of everything from Ram Jam’s 1977 hit “Black Betty” to interspersing his own “Kiss a Girl” with Ed Sheeran’s “Bad Habits.” The lofty musicianship displayed by Urban and his band made the meticulously planned set feel spontaneous and freewheeling.

Trending on Billboard

He themed the evening “Broad to the Big Time” offering a retrospective of his career including footage from a 1997 set of his former trio The Ranch playing at Jack’s Guitar Bar off Nolensville Road in Nashville.

“I started playing in the clubs when I was about 15 years old four hours a night five nights a week” Urban told the crowd “all the way up until the late ‘90s when I was still playing the clubs … so tonight we are going to be highlighting the journey from places like that to those who play Nissan Stadium.”

Though Urban’s set was noticeably missing early-career songs — such as The Ranch’s “Desiree” or their rendition of “Some Days You Gotta Dance” (recorded prior to the Chicks’ 1999 hit with the same song) as well as “Where the Blacktop Ends” or “But For the Grace of God” from his 1999 debut solo album — Urban instead used that time to shine a spotlight a couple of the “Wild Hearts” putting those famed 10000 hours in Nashville right now.

He welcomed local Nashville singer Kayley Green a regular performer at Nashville bar The Stage. Urban accompanied Green as she offered a spot-on powerful version of Martina McBride’s “Independence Day” before duetting with Urban and singing Miranda Lambert’s vocal part on “We Were Us.”

On the other end of the spectrum Urban welcomed Luke Combs the reigning CMA entertainer of the year (an accolade Urban first won in 2005 and again in 2018). The decibel levels inside the building ratcheted as Combs performed “When It Rains It Pours” later taking on Eric Church’s vocal role on the 2015 Urban/Church collaboration “Raise ‘Em Up.”

Urban also incorporated a tribute to Country Music Hall of Famer Loretta Lynn who passed away on Tuesday (Oct. 4) at age 90. Urban performed “Blue Eyed Kentucky Girl” and “If You’re Looking at Country” as images of Lynn including one of the late icon with Urban lit up the massive screens.

“We love you Loretta” Urban said.

Throughout the evening Urban offered a master class in what it means to not just entertain an audience but to connect with them and make them feel as one with the entertainer. As is part and parcel of an Urban show he took time to read various signs that fans held up around the arena and grabbed a pair of binoculars to see signs in the furthest reaches of the venue. That proved good news for a young girl from Starkville Miss. who held up a sign requesting a photo with Urban and stating that she skipped school to attend the concert. Urban obliged inviting the girl and her family onstage.

As is customary at an Urban show he also made the trek through the crowd to a satellite stage at the rear of the arena giving fans in the nosebleeds a front row seat as he played a brief acoustic set that included “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” “Better Life” and building into an angsty rendering of “You’ll Think of Me” (“Take your space and take your bulls— reasons but you’ll think of me” he growled as the crowd cheered). As he strained the final notes from his acoustic guitar he signed it and slowly lowered it into the crowd gathered around the small stage gifting it to an audience member.

But that electric live-wire connection between Urban and his fans doesn’t only rely on gifts and onstage photos — just as often it was simply Urban’s bold willingness to be vulnerable enough with his audience to share unpolished silly moments — another signal of the trust Urban has painstakingly built with his fans over the years. He engaged the whole audience in a singalong of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” (“Everybody’s got a guilty pleasure song” Urban said) or sinking down beside his microphone stand center stage to engage the audience in a vocal challenge of “How low can you go?”

Notably it’s those years building that connection one fan at a time that have allowed Urban to freely explore and meld in other musical genres into his own from pliable pop beefy rock soul hip-hop reggae and more. Though Urban is primarily known as an ace entertainer masterful guitar player and noted songwriter he’s often not credited enough for his vocal talents. Throughout the evening he showcased his supple-yet-commanding tenor which easily swooped and soared through that range of music.

The evening neared its conclusion as Urban offered a challenge to the audience — as the blazing stage lights slowly faded and the entire arena went pitch black Urban dared the audience to light up the arena themselves.

As the light from thousands of cell phones quickly bathed the room in a soft glow Urban said “This is proof positive that what we can’t do alone we can do together. Don’t’ fall for the ‘divide and conquer.’ We are stronger together and always have been.” He encouraged the audience to seek unity and pursue their best selves adding that while everyone is different and may want different things “We can find common ground with our fellow humans.”

With that he ripped into his 2002 hit the gratitude-filled “Somebody Like You” tweaking a key lyric as he sang “I don’t want to take this life for granted like I did in 2019.”

From there he sailed through the moody “Blue Ain’t Your Color” followed by “The Fighter” albeit sans his duet partner Carrie Underwood who was out of town and gearing up for her Denim & Rhinestones tour.

The concert concluded in a shower of confetti and cheers from the audience as he exited the stage returning shortly after to perform “Stupid Boy” accompanied only by his guitar. A riser elevated Urban — who by this point had swelled the acoustic performance into a guitar solo operating at a fever pitch. As the final notes rang out over the arena Urban hoisted his guitar into the air as balloons and confetti rained down over the audience.

Urban’s openers for the evening were Ingrid Andress and Tyler Hubbard.

Andress’ concise set was impactful for her easygoing performance style. Though the sound was slightly muddied her voice was still pristine on “Seeing Someone Else” “Lady Like” and “More Hearts Than Mine.” The audience was treated to its first surprise appearance of the evening when Sam Hunt made his way to the stage to collaborate on “Wishful Drinking.” But Andress was at her best on a cover of The Allman Brothers band’s “Whipping Post” dropping to the floor and lying on the stage for the song’s grungy final notes.

“You weren’t expecting that were you? That was my favorite song to sing in college” she told the crowd.

Hubbard’s opening slot for Urban marks his first as a solo artist having spent 12 years as half of the duo Florida Georgia Line. His set was a mix of new solo songs such as “Everybody Needs a Bar” and “Way Home” as well as FGL hits “Cruise” and “Meant to Be” (with Andress returning to the stage to perform Bebe Rexha’s role).

“I’m so grateful to have a second first single in my career” he said before singing his debut solo single “5 foot 9.”

Hubbard most often handled lead vocal duties for FGL so even his solo renderings of the duo’s biggest hits sounded familiar to fans. His gratefulness for the chance to forge a solo career was palpable another “Wild Heart” thankful to be seeing his dreams realized.

“I spent the last 12 years of my career chasing a crazy dream with my brother BK” Hubbard said. “I’m so extremely grateful for those years. I never want to take for granted that time. You have been gracious to let me try some new songs.”"

Oil prices have bounced around quite a bit this year. Brent oil the global-pricing benchmark started 2022 below $80 a barrel before soaring into the $120s following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It has since cooled off steadily falling back into the $80s on global economic concerns.

However OPEC recently took a step to stem the slide in crude prices by agreeing to slash its output by 2 million barrels per day starting next month. That move has already pushed oil back up into the mid-$90s. Crude could keep rebounding as those barrels start coming off the market next month.

With the prospect of higher oil prices we asked some of our energy contributors what oil stocks they believe are best positioned to capitalize following OPEC's bold move. Here's why they think Chevron (CVX -0.07%) ExxonMobil (XOM -0.41%) and Devon Energy (DVN -1.34%) stand out as the top oil stocks to buy following OPEC's latest attempt to influence the oil market.

This is the norm not the exception

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Chevron): Stepping back the big story with regard to oil prices is that they were heading lower and then they started to head higher again in a rapid and dramatic fashion. This time around it was news from OPEC which is a common theme but not a necessary one. Oil and natural gas are commodities and they are volatile -- hard stop.

Conservative income investors should see the current price moves not as a signal to buy or sell a stock but as a warning that it is best to err on the side of caution when selecting a long-term energy investment. That pretty much pushes you into the diversified integrated energy giants a list that includes ExxonMobil TotalEnergies (TTE 0.20%) BP (BP -0.29%) Shell (SHEL 0.76%) and Chevron. Of this group Chevron currently has the strongest balance sheet with a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.17 times. It is at least from a financial perspective extremely well positioned to handle energy market volatility today.

Chevron also offers a fairly generous 3.9% dividend yield and an over three-decade long history of annual dividend increases making it a Dividend Aristocrat. It hasn't managed through every up and down in the oil sector as well as it has this last one but it has proven again and again that dividend investors are a top priority. Oil is volatile. Chevron has proven it can successfully ride the wave while protecting the interests of conservative dividend investors.

OPEC's move is a boon for this dividend giant

Neha Chamaria (ExxonMobil): With OPEC going for a surprisingly big production cut oil prices are already heading higher in anticipation of a tighter oil market. As one of the world's largest oil exploration and production companies ExxonMobil stands to benefit from higher oil prices. The impact though could be even more powerful now what with the oil and gas giant's breakeven oil price falling aggressively.

ExxonMobil is targeting a breakeven oil price of only around $37 per barrel between 2022 and 2023. As long as Brent crude averages around this level ExxonMobil can fund its capital-spending program and maintain its current dividend payout. That also means the company can generate a lot more cash at higher Brent crude prices and use that incremental money to not only fund growth but also repurchase a greater number of shares and pay out larger dividends to its shareholders. It should be a win-win for investors.

In fact ExxonMobil's preliminary third-quarter numbers suggest its free cash flow during the quarter more than doubled year over year driven primarily by higher production and oil prices. While oil prices cooled off in Q3 there's potential for a much stronger fourth quarter now if oil prices firm up. That should help ExxonMobil deliver exceptionally strong numbers for the full year and further add to the stock's appeal especially among income investors as they look forward to a dividend hike from ExxonMobil later this month which will also be the oil stock's 40th consecutive annual dividend increase. Add it all up and ExxonMobil makes for one heck of an oil stock to buy now on OPEC's latest move.

Enhancing its ability to capitalize on crude oil

Matt DiLallo (Devon Energy): Devon Energy has feasted on higher oil prices this year. The oil and gas company's operating cash flow more than doubled during the second quarter while free cash flow hit a record at $2.1 billion. That gave the company a considerable windfall to allocate on behalf of shareholders.

Devon used that money to pay a growing dividend (it pays a base rate and a variable payment of up to 50% of its quarterly free cash flow) repurchase shares strengthen its already solid balance sheet and enhance its portfolio. The company's total dividend outlay rose 22% in Q2 pushing its annualized dividend yield above 8% while it has repurchased 4% of its outstanding shares this year. Even with that its cash balance ballooned to $3.5 billion against $6.5 billion of debt.

The oil company is using some of its cash to acquire additional cash-gushing oil properties. It bought the assets of RimRock Oil and Gas in the Williston Basin for $865 million and Eagle Ford producer Validus Energy for $1.8 billion. It paid around two times cash flow for those assets. Because of that it's in an even better position to capitalize on higher oil prices following OPEC's latest move. That should enable it to produce more cash that it can use to pay dividends buy back its wildly undervalued stock and make other value-enhancing moves.

Devon's growing exposure to oil prices enhances its ability to capitalize on OPEC's move to push crude prices higher. That makes it stand out as a top oil stock to buy to cash in on the likely OPEC-fueled rebound in oil prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved several types of revolutionary wearable tech for people with diabetes—and newer technology may be on the horizon.

Types of Wearable Tech for Diabetes

There are several innovative wearable technology models that have been recently approved (since 2018) by the FDA.

Wearable tech for people with diabetes includes devices such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems and insulin pumps which can make it easier and much more efficient for a person with diabetes to manage their blood sugar. Originally developed for people with type 1 diabetes advancing technology has expanded their use among people with type 2 diabetes.

CGMs allow a person to track glucose levels on an ongoing basis. Insulin pumps deliver a precise amount of insulin at every dosage administration period. When the two systems are combined the result is tighter blood sugar control than ever before.

A CGM is a compact monitoring and transmitting device with an implantable or a stick-on (affixed to the skin) sensor to detect blood sugar—which it does in real time usually every five minutes. A sensor is either implanted in the skin (via a small cannula that is placed just under the skin by your doctor) or attached to the skin adhesively. The sensors must be replaced every 10 to 90 days depending on the CGM model you use. A transmitter is connected to the sensor to transmit blood glucose readings either to a monitoring device or to your smartphone (depending on the CGM model).

Most CGM systems provide blood glucose readings along with additional data such as alarms for notification of pre-set high and low blood sugar levels and more.

Why Continuous Glucose Monitoring?

Finger-sticks are limited in their ability to measure blood glucose levels—which fluctuate constantly—on an ongoing basis. When blood glucose monitoring is ineffective this can translate to long-term complications of diabetes (such as damage to the nerves circulatory system vision problems and more).

Continuous blood sugar monitoring means more accurate and effective adjustment of insulin and subsequently the maintenance of healthier blood sugar levels. Today this is possible due to the innovative wearable tech for diabetes that is available.

Continuous monitoring can also offer immediate real-time protection against extremely high or low blood glucose levels that could result in dangerous adverse symptoms (such as disorientation or unconsciousness).

Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems

There are several models currently available and each differs in exactly how often and how long the glucose readings can be obtained (requiring that the sensor is changed at various intervals from 10 to 90 days). The newest model names and features include the following.

Model: The Eversense CGM System

Automatic Insulin Pumps

Before advanced medical technology became available insulin was given by self-injection for those with type 1 diabetes. Today there are other choices including the insulin pump. The insulin pump is about the size of a deck of cards; it is worn outside of the body (around the waist attached to a belt or armband).﻿﻿

How Insulin Pumps Work

The insulin pump delivers insulin via a thin tube (catheter) that is placed under the skin (into a layer of fat tissue). The pump works via a computerized mechanism that administers small doses of short-acting insulin continuously (called the basal rate) followed by a variable dose of insulin when a large meal is ingested (called a bolus).﻿﻿

Most insulin pumps are equipped with bolus calculators to help you figure out how much the bolus insulin dosage should be (based on your blood sugar level and your food intake at each meal). The way the insulin pump administers insulin is much like how the human pancreas works.

Is Wearable Tech Effective?

Many people can benefit from wearable technology for diabetes including those who are elderly. It's common that older adults have difficulty performing their own blood sugar checks particularly those who have dementia. Nearly 20% of elderly people with dementia also have diabetes.﻿﻿ These people are usually more prone to low blood sugar because of the medication they take for dementia. They may also have trouble recognizing the warning signs of hypoglycemia due to their dementia.

According to a 2019 study published in The BMJ older people with diabetes could benefit from the use of wearable technology namely wearable glucose monitors.﻿﻿

According to lead study author Dr. Katharina Mattishent from the University of East Anglia Norwich Medical School: ""Older people with memory problems can find it more difficult to keep an eye on their blood sugars.”

Mattishent stated ""Devices which continuously monitor people with dementia could help keep them out of hospital preventing unnecessary distress and saving the NHS money.""'﻿﻿

The study discovered that the CGM device provided greater ease in monitoring glucose levels for the people with diabetes in the study as well as their caregivers. The study also found that real-time wearable tech—devices with automated data transfer—for diabetes may be more suitable for older people with diabetes.﻿﻿

CGM is also helpful for parents since they're able to not only monitor but control their child's glucose levels with greater ease.

Other Studies

In a randomized control study published in 2016 in those with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes who injected insulin several times each day the use of the CGM system (compared to the standard finger-prick method) resulted in a greater decrease in HbA1c levels during a 24-hour time span.

The HbA1c test indicates the average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months. The use of CGM allows you and your doctor to focus not only on the HbA1c but on the glucose management indicator or GMI. GMI reflects how well controlled glucose has been over a specific period of time. The advantage of the GMI measurement over the HBA1c is that GMI is based on the percentage of time that glucose has been within normal range while the HBA1c test doesn't reflect how well glucose has been controlled over the same period. The GMI is also independent of hemoglobin so it doesn't change if you have other conditions such as anemia or kidney disease.

Benefits of Continuous Glucose Monitoring: HbA1c vs. GMI Testing The HbA1c test indicates the average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months.

Tips for Selecting Wearable Tech for Diabetes

Before deciding on the right type of wearable technology for you it’s vital to have a discussion with your healthcare provider to get a list of features and elements that are the most important for your diabetes management. Not all features will apply to each person with diabetes.

Selecting an insulin pump can be a complicated process. Here are some factors to consider from Diabetes Education Online:

Insurance coverage (check the durable medical equipment portion of your healthcare insurance policy)

Cost (which can fluctuate greatly)

Ease of use (some systems can be complicated to set up and use)

Online or local education (video tutorials or classes on how to use the technology)

Healthcare provider/diabetic team familiarity (to help educate you on the use of the monitor)

Maintenance

Intermittent or continuous transmission of blood glucose levels

How often does the sensor need to be replaced?

Features (such as illuminated screens audio and more)

Warm-up period (some models take up to 12 hours from the time the sensor is replaced to start producing readings)

Alarms and notifications (for high and low blood sugar and trends and patterns)

Information storage and retrieval (tracking time and date of each test result keeping track of trends sharing information with the physician etc.)

Type of transmission (is an external transmitter needed or is information automatically sent to a smartphone?)

Does the system come pre-calibrated or does it need to be manually calibrated?

Compatibility with other technology (such as insulin pumps)

Customer service and technical support (24-hour support for technical problems?)

Considerations for insulin pumps include:

Insurance coverage (insulin pumps can cost over $6000)

The weight and size of the pump

Ease of use of the system (depending on your level of technical savvy)

Lowest basal rate delivery (the hourly insulin basal rate is calculated by dividing the total basal dose by 24 but always check with your diabetes team to get help particularly when initially calculating your basal dose)

Background patterns available (such as weekday weekend night shift exercise day etc.)

Waterproof or water-resistant feature

Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio program feature (helps to estimate the size of bolus when eating carbohydrates)

Customizable bolus programs (including automatic settings for specific foods such as pizza and more)

Various types of alarms and alerts

Compatibility with other technology (such as CGM systems)

Local insulin pump education availability

Familiarity of your healthcare team with the model/technology

Customer service availability (and 24-hour technical support?)

Upgrades (costs future features that will be available?)

Infusion set (the parts that connect the insulin pump to your body) compatibility—brand-specific (proprietary) or universal?

The Future of Wearable Tech and Diabetes

The future of wearable tech and diabetes looks promising. Big medical equipment manufacturers and other well-known technology corporations are looking into the development of new technology. Soon new diabetes management technology may emerge incorporated into smartwatches smart shoes and socks and perhaps even contact lenses.﻿﻿

A Word From Verywell

To say that the new wearable technology for diabetes may transform the way diabetes is managed in the future is not an exaggeration. Compared to traditional methods of blood sugar monitoring (daily finger-pricks) providing blood sugar levels several times per day the modern CGM systems transmit blood sugar level reports over 280 times a day. A person with diabetes (as well as healthcare providers) can be informed every five minutes regarding the fluctuation of blood sugar.

Other ways to save

Meanwhile there are plenty of other ways to save money on clearance items at other stores as well.

If you don't have a Dollar General store nearby Walmart also offers clearance deals for their customers quite often.

In fact those shoppers who have Walmart's mobile application can find even greater discounts on items that are already on clearance.

If you use the price scanner there are often weekly deals.

One clearance aficionado was even able to find an item that was originally priced at $897 for $5 through the application.

Another TikToker who goes by the username dealswithnat2 also found several bags and purses that actually cost $1 instead of the higher prices that they were listed for.

Of course Dollar General's greatest competitors like Dollar Tree still have excellent deals as well.

The US Sun has coverage on a recent deals pro who was able to find nine Dollar Tree items for only $1.25 each with some name brands included.

Even stores like Aldi can offer great selections too.

And a shopper found 35 items at Aldi starting at only $3.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtidHguY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvcG9saWNlLXN1c3BlY3QtYXJyZXN0ZWQtYWNjdXNlZC1zZXh1YWxseS1hc3NhdWx0aW5nLXdvbWFuLW91dHNpZGUtZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwv0gGAAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtidHguY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvcG9saWNlLXN1c3BlY3QtYXJyZXN0ZWQtYWNjdXNlZC1zZXh1YWxseS1hc3NhdWx0aW5nLXdvbWFuLW91dHNpZGUtZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police: Suspect arrested accused of sexually assaulting woman outside of Dollar General,"GREEN TOWNSHIP Ohio (WXIX/Gray News) -A man is accused of following a victim to her car and sexually assaulting her in a Dollar General parking lot in Ohio according to court records.

A DOLLAR Tree employee is giving customers the inside scoop on certain products to avoid while shopping at the discount store.

Brenda who works for the store said that shoppers should really steer clear of frozen seafood or meat as some of the items can be hit or miss.

It wasn't all bad news though she also said that the store’s cinnamon bites are “amazing” and admitted that Dollar Tree customers love frozen fruit and vegetables according to Mental Floss.

But she warned: “I don’t eat any of the frozen fish or rib eyes because I don’t trust frozen seafood or meat that costs a dollar.”

The worker recommended that shoppers should go to their local store to buy frozen fish and meat.

And Nate a store manager from Massachusetts claims he’s heard reports that the steak doesn’t cook well and it's been compared to rubber.

A one-dollar steak was put up against a $12-a-pound ribeye and a supermarket's $9-a-pound one as part of a taste test held in Kentucky in 2016 WCPO reported.

A firefighter who tasted the three meat samples described the one-dollar steak: “I guess it was meat.”

Another commented: “It’s not terrible.”

Meanwhile other firefighters described the piece of meat as “OK” “chewy” and “very rubbery”.

Customers can try a series of hacks to save cash while shopping at Dollar Tree.

The store allows shoppers to use printable internet manufacturer coupons.

Customers should also buy in bulk when they visit the discount store.

And you can use a rebate app such as Ibotta which allows you to get cash back every time you shop online in-store or from your phone.

Another way to save is by paying with a cash-back credit card.

The Sun has also shared a series of employee secrets from retailers such as Costco and Trader Joe’s.

'EMPLOYEE SECRETS'

Workers at Trader Joe’s use bells to communicate with their colleagues.

If shoppers hear one bell ring it means more cashiers are required at the register.

Two rings signal a customer at a register needs help the cashier cannot provide.

And three bell rings mean that a supervisor's assistance is required for a transaction.

And in some Trader Joe's stores staff hide stuffed animals on shelves for kids to find rewarding them with a lollipop at checkout.

Meanwhile Paige Saunders who worked at Costco for several years offered insight into secrets about the retailer.

When asked if employees actually hide products or misplace them on purpose she claimed in a YouTube video: ""We aren't hiding things to trick customers or moving things on purpose. Another team does it overnight.

""Finding the products ourselves after things have been moved is the most infuriating thing ever.

She claimed that employees themselves don’t choose to move items around the store.

Saunders debunked myths that shoppers could use cash cards to go into Costco and purchase items without a membership.

The Sun reported how Americans normally hear a bell when Costco’s hugely popular rotisserie chicken is ready.

And an employee revealed exactly what the asterisks on price labels mean for shoppers.

They said the marking might means consumers want to stock up on the product while they still can.

The asterisk means that the location you are in does not plan to reorder the item they told Readers Digest.

The Sun reached out to Dollar Tree for comment.

Want good advice? Ask your grandmother. Alanya Williams did and now he's TikTok-famous for creating budget meals from ingredients bought at Dollar Tree. Williams who according to ""Good Morning America"" works as a cook at a California assisted living facility shares his cheap-meal magic in TikTok videos under the screen name @thundermane328 getting tens of thousands of views every time.

Williams has been working in kitchens for decades according to ""GMA."" His budget-conscious approach began as a teenager after being surprised that the frozen meals and snacks that cost him $200 at the grocery store were gone in a few days. He went to his grandmother who suggested that he instead buy inexpensive staples like rice potatoes ground beef and mixed vegetables to craft his own dishes.

Williams' TikTok videos take viewers to Dollar Tree with the frozen foods case as a favorite stop. In one TikTok he selects a package of frozen chicken patties and some frozen mixed vegetables before going elsewhere in the store for cheese biscuits instant mashed potatoes and sweet tea. The bill is $6.25 his target price. Back home Williams preps and bakes the biscuit mix heats up the potatoes and cooks the chicken patties and frozen vegetables in separate skillets. He uses items already in his pantry to enhance the meal turning milk flour and spices into gravy.

The WVU Innovation Corporation will provide 1.2 million square feet of space for various organizations. The pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment is still in the building and former employees of Viatris and its predecessor Mylan Pharmaceuticals will maintain the facility.

“Twelve individuals who are passionate about this facility and worked for Mylan some of the 15 to 20 years” said Stacey Armstrong the president of the WVU Innovation Corporation. “They are our boots on the ground to make sure the facility is well maintained.”

Mylan Pharmaceuticals used the site through 2020 as the merger between the company and Upjohn Business was being finalized.

“The way it was developed over time — adding sections on over the years — the way Mylan and then Viatris did it really sets it up nicely to be able to section it off into different components” Armstrong said.

Officials are reviewing the companies interested in moving into the space. Some businesses may need sterile areas while other groups may need large offices or climate-controlled areas.

“We want to be thoughtful about who we bring in and how they partner with us and how they can work with one another” Armstrong said. “You don’t get an opportunity very often to have a very big open finished well-cleaned well-maintained space and get to figure out proactively how to fill it up.”

Hope Gas — the new entity created with the Hearthstone Energy purchase of Dominion Energy gas assets — will open their headquarters in the space. South Korea-based insulin producer UNDBIO considered the facility but it will instead build a new facility in Morgantown."

In subsequent comments the man also tweeted that the Domino’s outlet he ordered from was in Delta Garden Mira road.

To another question of whether the box was tampered with the user wrote that he had ordered the pizza from Zomato and that the box was sealed. And Zomato did respond to the issue and asked for details.

On this matter the company told Moneycontrol that they will collect samples from the customer.

“As a responsible brand we immediately contacted the customer upon receiving the concern to ascertain the facts of the matter through various channels of communication. Our quality team has also conducted a thorough investigation of the restaurant in question and no anomaly was found in the inspection. We follow a strict no-glass policy in our kitchen and operation area"" Domino's said.

“We will be investigating the matter further once we get the samples from the user and take action accordingly” the statement added.

This is not the first time the fast food pizza chain has courted controversy.

In August viral photographs of Domino’s pizza doughs stored among mops angered Twitter as users tagged food safety officials to take note.

It was easy. What's the big deal?,"Recently I drove a Tesla Model 3 on an electric roadtrip from Southern California to Portland and back. The total distance was around 2200 miles with the bulk of the driving happening over the course of five days (three up two down) and I only “spent” about 25 minutes waiting for the car to charge total over the whole trip.

There are many travelogues and YouTube channels that go into deep analyses of efficiency and charging speed with lots of detail on how exactly to plan an electric roadtrip. Though I typically do enjoy those sorts of details I didn’t actually think to keep track of any of them during this trip since they’re all sort of unnecessary at this point because electric roadtrips are easy.

The roadtrip included a mixture of heavy driving days on interstates and lighter days on state routes with side routes and sightseeing. We had two drivers in the car along with luggage for three and didn’t bother to plan the route ahead of time except for the goal of getting a little time on the Northern California/Oregon coast and seeing some coastal redwoods along the way. Both of us have plenty of experience driving and charging electric cars though this is the longest electric roadtrip I personally have been on.

And that 25 minute number – that counts the amount of time spent waiting for charging and doing nothing else productive. If we were getting a meal that was “free” charging time since we need to eat anyway. In other words time spent charging that would have otherwise been spent driving if we weren’t charging.

Side routes? Detours? No problem

It has been said many times that electric roadtrips are doable as long as you stick to the plan and don’t deviate at all. Most chargers are along main routes which see the most traffic – smaller routes have fewer chargers or slower ones or don’t have any at all.

Well… we didn’t have a plan. We didn’t plan our route ahead around charger availability merely left in the morning and charged where we wanted to once we got hungry or needed to take a driving break. In the car’s navigation system it’s easy to pull up a list of chargers see what services exist at each stop and search the map nearby for restaurants hotels bathrooms and so on. And if you’re new to this whole thing you can ask the car to route you to your destination and it will tell you where to charge and for how long (you can modify the plan if you’d like and we usually did).

Restaurants near the Tejon Ranch charger Say “take me to Portland”and the car shows you this

Everything was straightforward until the second morning of the trip where right before setting out towards the coast from Williams CA I sustained an injury which needed urgent care (I won’t bore you with the details of how badly my insurance company Oscar dealt with the situation but they deserve mention for being unhelpful). Turns out there’s no urgent care in Williams CA so off we went on twisty roads towards the coast. After a couple hours through mountains and trees we got to Fort Bragg which along with urgent care facilities also had a supercharger despite being quite far from anything that might be considered a main road.

The car’s ultrasonic sensors were not happy with me for this

We continued on and drove through the Avenue of the Giants an area of coastal redwoods the tallest trees in the world which were breathtaking to behold and only made better by the silence of driving with electric propulsion. At one stop a man in a truck remarked “You’re the first Tesla I’ve seen in four days” presumably suggesting that Teslas mostly stick to the main roads and don’t get out to the more empty regions. We thought that was odd since at no point on the trip did we feel restricted by charging concerns (and we did see other EVs but maybe not as many as we saw on the main roads or near the cities).

Unfortunately we had to end our side-route adventure the next day turning in through the mountains towards Grant’s Pass due to the time loss associated with our medical misadventure. The coastal route would have added about two hours (of driving not charging) along with sightseeing time and we had a dinner to get to – though charging in Bandon and Lincoln City on the coast would have been just about as easy as our charges in Grant’s Pass and Harrisburg were.

Charging is available fast and pleasant

Charging was never a problem during our electric roadtrip. We chose hotels with chargers (by checking PlugShare) but these hotels were in the towns we wanted to stop in so we didn’t have to go out of our way to find these overnight charges.

Each overnight charge was “free” insofar as it was included with the hotel and it was nice to leave in the morning with a 100% charge (rather than ~80% which is the usual state of charge to leave a supercharger at). This provided more flexibility on where to charge during the day and saved some money on supercharging fees.

Every charge save one or two was associated with a meal or bathroom break which meant we spent little actual time charging during the trip. Every stop by the time we were done with what we needed to do on the stop the car was already ready to go with 200+ added miles of range.

Whether it be walking to and eating fast food waiting to be seen at urgent care (whoops) devouring the haul from a local fruit stand or having free wine samples (only the passenger of course) there was plenty to do at each stop and only ever a few minutes if at all spent “waiting” for the car to charge enough to continue on.

On that wine tasting point a special mention goes to the Olsen Run Winery at the Harrisburg OR supercharger which exists poetically on the property of an old gas station (though for some reason isn’t listed in the in-car search for nearby restaurants – don’t be fooled stop there anyway).

Instead of serving up stinky cancer-causing dino juice it now pushes electrons and delicious burgers (with veggie option) fries shakes and free wine tastings and even serves as an event space (in… the middle of nowhere). It was such a pleasant stop that even though we didn’t need a charge we stopped again on the way back South from Portland just for the burgers and conversation. We hope to see more entrepreneurial innovation with properties like this converting stinky old gas stations into something much more pleasant.

And we didn’t even take advantage of every charge opportunity – one of which was actually easier for non-Teslas. We stopped at a rest stop right after the CA border just to look around and by chance happened to find a free CCS/CHAdeMO DC fast charger there. We didn’t have the necessary CHAdeMO or CCS adapter but didn’t need a charge anyway though we still got an emotional charge standing by a pleasant river breathing clean air unsullied by gas station fumes and seeing some unnervingly bold deer crawling all over the place on the rest stop lawn which was clearly marked “no pets.”

All told we probably only spent a total of about 25 minutes across the whole trip doing nothing but charging. This was primarily at the last charge on the last day where we stopped at an outlet mall (Tejon Ranch East supercharger) after business hours and spent about 15 minutes watching a couple play with their dog in the parking lot while charging. The point is: The amount of extra time spent actively charging across the whole trip was no more than the amount of active time it takes to fill up at gas stations – and perhaps even less.

650 miles in one day

Typically on roadtrips I don’t like to do more than around 300 miles in a day. After that point you start feeling like you’ve been in the car forever like you haven’t gotten to see or do anything outside of the car you feel cooped up and tired and stressed and so on.

But sometimes you just want to get home and rest your broken toe and you don’t have any particular sights you want to see along the boring I-5 in California. So you spend the morning tooling around Mount Shasta after an overnight charge then set out to drive almost the entire length of California in one day.

And when driving in a car with one driver with a broken toe and the other with a bum knee autopilot is nice to have. While the promise of full self-driving is not here (…yet?) autopilot does work well on highways and helps reduce fatigue on a long drive like this.

On this 650 mile day we stopped for three charges – Woodland to get a pizza Firebaugh for a taco and Tejon Ranch. Again we didn’t have to wait for the car until the very last charge where we weren’t hungry and didn’t need a break so waited about 15 minutes.

Even if people recognize that electric roadtrips are doable they will often carve out an exception for these long driving days suggesting that they would be hindered by charging when they really need to make a lot of ground quickly. Well given that we only “spent” 15 minutes charging during this 650 mile day (again not counting the two fast food meals and bathroom breaks which we needed anyway) that doesn’t really sound like much of a hindrance given that at least one 10-minute gas stop would be necessary if the roadtrip were done on gas (and don’t forget the ~5-7 other gas stops that would have been needed over the 2200-mile trip and can’t be done overnight at a hotel).

Reminders why electric roadtrips are important

We did make a brief stop during our longest driving day to look at Shasta Lake which put a bit of a point on why we spent five days doing an electric roadtrip instead of the more convenient option of burning fuel in a plane to get to where we were going:

California like many parts of the world is experiencing historic drought. Shasta Lake the largest reservoir in the state is at critically low levels. The lake feeds the Bay Area and the Central Valley the most agriculturally productive land in the nation which provides more than half of the fruits vegetables and nuts for the entire US.

This drought is exacerbated by climate change causing dry weather and high temperatures in the area and climate change is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel emissions from transportation are the largest contributor to climate change in the US (another major factor is animal agriculture which not only produces methane emissions but uses large amounts of water).

The rest of the final day was spent driving through that valley which also happens to be one of the more polluted places in the country. Air pollution from trucks and machinery gets trapped by the mountains causing constant smog conditions. Despite being in a valley you wouldn’t really know it because much of the time you can’t see the mountains all around you due to the smog.

There’s supposed to be mountains in the background but that thing in the foreground seems to obscure them…

So not only was an EV the right choice for the practical side of the roadtrip but also for the greater picture – trying to avoid the environmental disasters caused by fossil fuel usage.

Your mileage may vary?

We encountered no charging reliability problems on the trip. There were a few supercharger connectors that weren’t working at some of the stops but the car informed us ahead of time which ones were inactive and it never affected charge speed or the locations we chose to charge at.

Of course this trip was on the West Coast of the US mostly in California the state with the most EVs. I have been assured that the trip would be more difficult elsewhere or on a network other than Tesla’s superchargers (though other cars will gain access to Tesla’s system soon™). Other networks probably wouldn’t be as easy and other cars don’t have as elegant a routing and “nearby search” system as the Tesla system or as simple of a “plug-and-charge” payment system like superchargers have.

But I have also been assured that this trip would be difficult with so many people talking about how hard it is to take roadtrips in an electric car.

But it wasn’t hard it was easy. So this suggests to me that those other trips while perhaps not as easy as mine may well be more possible than people think they are.

(*The comments below say the same – many say this trip would be more difficult elsewhere alongside several stories of readers who have done similar trips elsewhere and with other cars and it wasn’t a problem including one reader who emailed us about a similar drive from Portland to Santa Cruz and back in a Leaf in five days with one 450-mile day.)

I will reiterate again that we did not plan a route ahead. We didn’t plug our trip into ABRP or other route planners. We didn’t stick to a specific speed so we could make our charging plan. We changed routes frequently on a whim we charged when or where we felt like doing so or where there was a restaurant we were interested in. None of this was an issue. It was just a regular roadtrip but less polluting more pleasant and cheaper.

And yet there is a persistent myth that since EVs are supposedly incapable (they are not as displayed above) of doing this one thing that most cars will never do they are therefore not an acceptable source of transportation. Nevermind that they are superior in normal driving tasks – and as displayed above not even inferior in this one – somehow this myth still persists.

It should also be noted that trips like this are not a common occurrence. As a practical matter most cars will rarely if ever do a roadtrip like this. But particularly in America cars are not sold for what they’ll be used for but for every conceivable purpose the buyer could ever imagine using them for. You’re not being sold a tool you’re being sold a dream – the dream of freedom in the form of a $1000/mo car payment.

This is the reason the “electric roadtrips are impossible!” myth has gained so much traction – Americans are buying the dream of the Great American roadtrip and think that an EV makes that dream impossible.

Well I’m here to tell you that it’s not impossible. In fact it’s more than possible – it’s even better than the alternative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9idXNpbmVzcy9tY2RvbmFsZHMtaGFsbG93ZWVuLXBhaWxzLXJldHVybi10cm5kL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzEwLzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL21jZG9uYWxkcy1oYWxsb3dlZW4tcGFpbHMtcmV0dXJuLXRybmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's announces return of Halloween pails -- just in time for trick-or-treating,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cnn.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/10/09/business/mcdonalds-halloween-pails-return-trnd/index.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA98B7F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9idXNpbmVzcy9tY2RvbmFsZHMtaGFsbG93ZWVuLXBhaWxzLXJldHVybi10cm5kL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzEwLzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL21jZG9uYWxkcy1oYWxsb3dlZW4tcGFpbHMtcmV0dXJuLXRybmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

It’s getting millions in grants to support that dream. Plenty of help is being supplied from environmentalists neighboring cities and residents who have volunteered hours of their time to clean up Ecorse Creek long neglected amid decades of industrial use.

The effort is starting to pay off. The city is about to revamp its public boat launch build a new kayak dock and a fish cleaning station and improve the site’s parking lot on the Detroit riverfront. In addition Pepper Road Park is getting a splash pad and a new kayak launch that will serve Ecorse Creek.

The upgrades slated for the public boat launch is possible due to a $1.6 million federal grant aimed at boosting tourism from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has also awarded $1 million to the city for the planned upgrades. In the past year the city has received close to $3 million from federal state and county funds for the various projects.

“I know that this funding will be a great benefit not only to highlight our district’s natural resources but will also help to further much needed economic development for the city” said U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib the Democrat who represents the city of the $1.6 million federal grant announced last month. It's also designed to help communities diversify its economy from coal and heavy industry.

'A beautiful thing'

“The water is a beautiful thing about living in Michigan and living Downriver. It’s wonderful” said Mayor Lamar Tidwell as he stood in the parking lot of the Ecorse Boat Ramp 4633 W. Jefferson Ave. The city borders 2.5 miles of the Detroit River. In addition Ecorse Creek winds through 2.1 miles of the city mainly through residential streets.

“We know this is our main attraction to Ecorse. We want to make it so that people want to come here” and enjoy the water Tidwell said. The Ecorse Boat Ramp is already popular attracting more than 6000 boaters so far this year Tidwell said. On a recent unseasonably warm and sunny October morning the launch was in heavy use by people with small fishing boats including a couple from Inkster who fishing for perch.

“We believe we can get about 10000 boat launches a year after the improvements” Tidwell said. The improvements include replacing the current dock with a new one that is compliant with the federal American Disabilities Act. A few yards away the new kayak slip will be created. Not far away from the slip will be the new fish cleaning station since the boat launch is popular among fishing enthusiasts. The improvements which have not begun are expected to be completed by the end of 2023 Tidwell said.

The ramp is near Mud Island a small nature preserve that’s part of the Detroit International Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is run by the federal U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and includes more than 30 separate parcels of land mainly located Downriver. Mud Island is among the habitats that supports 300 species of birds.

“During the winter we get lots of people who come here because they can see bald eagles” at Mud Island Tidwell said.

Activists have also played a role in helping to revitalize Ecorse. In May a legal settlement was reached by the Sierra Club and Earthjustice in a Clean Air Act enforcement case against DTE Energy. The utility is giving a combined $2.7 million to 10 community-based environmental justice projects in Ecorse River Rouge and the 48217 ZIP code aimed at improving public health and reducing environmental impacts. The settlement also requires DTE to retire the River Rouge Trenton Channel and St. Clair coal plants by 2023.

Parts of Ecorse’s riverfront is an idle parcel of land owned U.S. Steel Corp. The city is negotiating with the company to use part of the property to further transform the riverfront Tidwell said.

A welcoming spot for recreational users

Beyond the riverfront Ecorse Creek is starting to become a welcoming spot for recreational users. At Pepper Road Park work on a new kayak slip and a splash pad is just starting. The city park runs along Ecorse Creek. Several years ago a group of residents began cleaning Ecorse Creek. Kayaker Kelly Rose is pivotal in overseeing the group called Ecorse Creek Committee.

“I moved to Ecorse six years ago and it was really the first time I noticed the creek” Rose said. “I saw that it was beautiful. Everything was overgrown around it. I was sad when I saw all the garbage.”

Rose and other volunteers have removed mattresses plenty of shopping carts tractor tires and other large debris from the creek over the years. The group is currently removing large trees.

The group’s effort helped secure the city $102000 from the U.S National Fish and Wildlife Service for habitat restoration at Pepper Road Park and put in a kayak launch. The Ecorse group is now working with groups interested in cleaning up the creek in neighboring Lincoln Park. The city is also working with Lincoln Park to secure funding for bike/pedestrian path along the creek.

Another result of the cleanups is that less trash appears to be dumped in the creek Rose said.

“That’s really encouraging” Rose said. “People are starting to see this gift that we have and that more of us can use and enjoy.”

MLive meteorologist Mark Torregrossa predicts peak color change coming toward the tail end of this month in southeast Michigan.

Thanks to trail advocates and pathway development initiatives many Washtenaw County residents have a car-free route for cycling a short ride or drive away from where they live.

Chief among them is the Washtenaw County Border-to-Border (B2B) Trail now spanning about 35 non-continuous miles and looping in a handful of parks and natural areas perfect for leaf-peeping. Those who prefer dirt to pavement also have no shortage of options particularly in the western part of the county.

Here are a few places to take in the fall colors by bike before they’re gone.

Huron River Drive and the B2B Trail to Dexter

While not a pathway built purely for bikes Huron River Drive northwest of Ann Arbor can feel like one on the weekends when Lycra-clad cyclists outnumber drivers.

The roughly seven-mile stretch between the Barton Nature Area and Zeeb Road winds along the Huron River with minimal climbing great views of the water and few interruptions along the route.

Plug into the B2B Trail at the western edge of this section for a quick jaunt into downtown Dexter via the paved pathway through the woods of the Dexter-Huron Metropark an area that feels secluded even while running along the railroad and behind subdivisions off Dexter-Ann Arbor Road.

This is a classic Ann Arbor-area ride likely already in most experienced cyclists’ rolodexes but it is also a great chance for beginners to see what the area has to offer. Access it by bike from Ann Arbor or park at the Barton Nature Area.

B2B Trail from Dexter to Hudson Mills Metropark

This route is is a nice extension of the above ride continuing along the Huron River through the wooded Hudson Mills Metropark on the B2B Trail.

It starts in Mill Creek Park on the edge of downtown Dexter traversing a series of wooden walkways before climbing into the forest along the river eventually reaching North Territorial Road in about five miles.

Cross the bridge there and hop onto the three-mile loop on the paved walking trail through Hudson Mills a great spot for a rest on benches by the river before heading back.

Parking is available at Hudson Mills Metropark and in Dexter.

Ann Arbor’s Gallup Park

While on the shorter side as a dedicated bike ride the paths through Gallup Park Ann Arbor’s most popular recreation area are beautiful this time of year.

A paved pathway combining the B2B Trail and Gallup Park Pathway extends just over three miles on the southern bank of the Huron River passing through picnic and play areas.

Cross the river at Dixboro Road to continue on the B2B Trail toward Ypsilanti or continue on the pathway to Parker Mill County Park where a two-mile paved connector offers access to the Matthaei Botanical Gardens to the north.

Mike Levine Lakelands Trail

Washtenaw County residents looking to go a bit further afield should check out the Mike Levine Lakelands Trail running between Hamburg Township in Livingston County and Blackman Township in Jackson County.

The 33-mile rail-trail route isn’t all paved. The paved section extends from M-36 just west of Pinckney to the trail’s eastern endpoint near U.S. 23 with the remaining trail surface a mix of dirt track and crushed limestone that can be a bit rougher for bikes without wider tires.

A list of trailheads and parking is available from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources here.

Potawatomi Loop and the Waterloo-Pinckney Trail connector

If you’re ready to leave pavement behind altogether the rugged and challenging Poto Loop is a longstanding area mountain biking gem.

The main trailhead is at the Silver Lake Day Use Area in the Pinckney Recreation Area and the entire loop extends some 18 miles with a shortcut available to trim some mileage off that total.

The trail offers views of several lakes and is entirely within the western Washtenaw County natural area making it perfect for taking in fall foliage.

For the first time this season mountain bikers also have the option of using a new connector between the Potawatomi Trail and the DTE Energy Trail system following a section of the Waterloo-Pinckney Trail.

Entering the Waterloo Recreation Area and plugging into the B2B Trail the trail offers a new look at a part of the natural area previously off-limits to cyclists.

“My role at Duke Energy is government and community relations and I serve Newberry County among others. This presentation came together with Anne reaching out to me and teaching me what the Newberry Opera House does. We had a good conversation about the Duke Energy Foundation” said Tyson Blanton with Duke Energy.

A key focus from the Arts for All program according to Blanton was Dufford Diversity Week and the STEM Camps at the Newberry Opera House.

“They fit into our focus areas” she said. “We were able to work together to find a way to let the Duke Energy Foundation support those programs at the Newberry Opera House” she said.

Blanton also gave credit to Newberry Opera House Board Member Keith Avery (CEO of the Newberry Electric Cooperative) as she said he started the initial outreach.

Anne Pinckney Smith development director at the Newberry Opera House said that the Newberry Opera House is excited to partner with Duke Energy again.

“We have had a long relationship since the very beginning of the Newberry Opera House back in the 1990s” she said. “We do a lot of outreach in our community through the Dufford program and we had our first event recently.”

Smith added that it is very important that the children of Newberry County are exposed to the arts regularly.

“Arts are always cut first in schools. We feel it is our duty to give the arts to the community. As we say beyond the tower to expand our focus” she said.

Jack Shields Newberry Opera House Board chair said that he is proud to be able to continue the relationship with Duke Energy.

“As we heard from Mayor Foster Senn Duke Energy has been a part of Newberry for over 100 years. That is something to be proud of right there. So it is wonderful to be partnering with Duke and we appreciate their support” he said.

She started her career in 1960 after being married at age 15 and already having had four children. She did have some help on the way: her father played the banjo her mother played the guitar and her husband to whom she remained married for 50 years encouraged her to sing professionally and helped her get recording contracts with Decca Records and MCA. Along the way she put up with his alcoholism fighting with her and cheating on her but she made good use of her life stories in her songs. Just about everyone has heard her biggest hits:

• “You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man)”

• “Don’t Come Home A-Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on Your Mind)”

• “One’s on the Way”

• “Fist City”

• “Coal Miner’s Daughter”

• “The Pill”

• “Rated X”

• “You’re Looking at Country”

and many more.

A Brilliant Career

She wrote more than 160 songs and released 60 albums. She received the most nominations for the Grammy Award (18) and won three times. She had 24 number one hit singles 11 number one albums was the ACM Artist of the Decade in 1970 and was the first woman to be named entertainer of the year in the Country Music Association in 1972 and by the Academy of Country Music in 1975. She received seven American Music Awards eight Broadcast Music Incorporated awards 13 Academy of Country Music awards eight Country Music Association awards and 26 fan-voted Music City News awards. She was named “Artist of the Decade” for the 1970s by the Academy of Country Music was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Country Gospel Music Hall of Fame was the recipient of Kennedy Center Honors and was the first female country artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Death After a Stroke and a Broken Hip

Lynn died in her sleep at her home on October 4 2022 at the age of 90 most likely from heart failure caused by immobilization from broken bones and a stroke. Everyone loses bone with aging. She broke her arm and had multiple broken bones from falls and also had knee surgery. In May 2017 at age 85 she suffered a stroke that probably caused her to spend a lot of time sitting and lying in bed. On January 1 2018 she fell and broke her hip. Her fall was probably due to her lack of coordination caused by the stroke and like most women over 80 she was likely to have osteoporosis with weakened bones that break easily. The broken hip would cause even more immobilization that leads to heart failure.

How Not Moving Causes Death from Heart Failure

Every medical student learns that your skeletal muscles strengthen your heart not the other way around (Physiological Reviews Jan 1 1955;35(1)). When your skeletal muscles contract they squeeze the veins near them to contract and push extra blood back towards you heart. This increased flow of blood back to the inside of your heart widens and stretches your heart. This causes the heart to contract with more force against the increased resistance and makes the heart muscle stronger. When you lie in bed or sit and do not move for just a few days your heart muscle weakens and the longer you stay immobile the weaker your heart muscle becomes (Eur J Epidemiol 2014 Aug;29(8):559-65). Eventually your heart muscle becomes too weak to pump enough oxygen to your brain and you stop breathing and die of heart failure (Circulation Research Jan 23 2020;126(6))

Lessons from Loretta Lynn’s Long and Productive Life

You can cause heart failure just by sitting or lying down all the time. Every healthy person should have activities that keep them moving. You will benefit from cutting your own lawn washing your own dishes and cleaning your house. You will benefit even more by having a regular exercise program. Extensive research shows that exercising in a group markedly increases your chances of not dropping out and continuing your exercise program. If you have a condition that limits your activity you should check with your doctor to see what you can do to keep moving without harming yourself.

DeMalto said on October 8 2022 at approximately 5:43 a.m. a black 2011 Toyota Camry was traveling northbound on South Dupont Highway approaching exit # 156 in New Castle. At the same time a pedestrian was walking southbound on South Dupont Highway and began crossing the roadway directly in the path of the Camry. As a result the Toyota struck the pedestrian on the highway. The subject was then struck by a second vehicle a black 2013 Cadillac XTS which had been traveling northbound behind the Camry.

Both vehicles came to a stop at the scene which was dark and had limited street lighting. The pedestrian a 74-year-old man from Wilmington Delaware was wearing dark clothing and did not appear to be in possession of a light or other means of illumination. He was pronounced deceased at the scene. Identification of the victim is pending notification to the next of kin. Neither of the vehicle operators were injured and both were properly restrained.

La destruction partielle du Pont de Crimée symbole de l’annexion de la péninsule et infrastructure essentielle à l’approvisionnement de l’armée russe en Ukraine couronne une série d’humiliations pour la Russie de Vladimir Poutine.

Pour Vladimir Poutine une mauvaise nouvelle chasse l’autre sur le front ukrainien. Alors que l’armée russe ne cesse de perdre du terrain face à l’avancée des troupes de Kiev l’attaque du pont de Crimée samedi 8 octobre est venu conclure une série d’échecs pour le président russe.

Des images de vidéosurveillance diffusées sur les réseaux sociaux ont montré une puissante explosion au moment où plusieurs véhicules circulaient sur le pont dont un camion que les autorités russes soupçonnent d'être à l'origine de la déflagration.

Pour le Kremlin qui vantait il y a quelques mois encore la sécurité entourant l’édifice l’humiliation est totale.

Le pont de Kertch qui relie la Crimée à la Russie constitue une ligne de ravitaillement capitale des forces russes pour tenir les territoires occupés au sud de l’Ukraine alors que se profile la bataille pour la ville de Kherson.

Au-delà de sa valeur stratégique le plus grand pont d’Europe (19 km) construit en seulement 3 ans est un symbole aux yeux des Russes de l’annexion de la péninsule et de son rattachement à la Russie. Un Vladimir Poutine triomphant l’avait inauguré en jean et blouson noir au volant d’un camion le 16 mai 2018.

De son côté Kiev n’a pas revendiqué l’attaque. Ce qui n’empêche pas ses responsables de jubiler. ""Malheureusement c'était nuageux en Crimée"" a ironisé le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky.

Quant au chef du Conseil de sécurité ukrainien Oleksi Danilov il publiait sur twitter une vidéo de l’incendie accompagnée du célèbre “Happy Birthday Mister President” chantée par Marilyn Monroe. La veille Vladimir Poutine célébrait ses 70 ans.

Des élites russes exaspérées

L’attaque de cette infrastructure-clé intervient alors que l’armée russe accumule les revers cuisants sur le terrain. Après avoir repris la ville de Lyman dans l’Est une armée ukrainienne galvanisée a de nouveau enchaîné les succès cette semaine.

Selon Kiev ses troupes ont repris plus de 400 km2 aux Russes ces derniers jours dans le Sud. Certaines vidéos sur les réseaux sociaux montrent des soldats russes se rendre sans combattre comme cet équipage d’un char d’assaut.

À Moscou les critiques des élites sur la conduite de la guerre se font de plus en plus bruyantes. Elles ne visent pas Vladimir Poutine directement comme c’est d’usage en Russie mais ses conseillers et le ministère de la Défense.

L'état-major de l'armée est notamment visé pour la faiblesse de l'équipement et de l'encadrement des soldats mobilisés. Même les plus ardents propagandistes s’inquiètent de l’état de délabrement de certaines unités russes. ""Je suis fatigué de recevoir des messages disant que les mobilisés doivent acheter leur équipement avec leur argent. Pourquoi un homme mobilisé un héros doit-il acheter ce dont il a besoin ?” s’est récemment emporté le célèbre présentateur télé et propagandiste Vladimir Sololyov.

Le dirigeant tchétchène Ramzan Kadyrov avait lui fustigé le commandement militaire tandis qu'un haut responsable parlementaire Andreï Kartapolov avait appelé sur Telegram l'armée à ""arrêter de mentir"" sur ses défaites.

Quelles mesures de représailles ?

Signe du mécontentement en haut lieu Moscou a annoncé samedi avoir nommé un nouvel homme à la tête de son ""opération militaire spéciale"" en Ukraine le général Sergueï Sourovikine 55 ans.

Vétéran de la guerre civile au Tadjikistan dans les années 1990 de la deuxième guerre de Tchétchénie dans les années 2000 et de l'intervention russe en Syrie lancée en 2015 Sergueï Sourovikine dirigeait jusque-là le groupement de forces “Sud” en Ukraine selon un rapport du ministère russe datant de juillet.

Selon RFI Serguei Sourovikine est surnommé “Armageddon pour sa tendance à l'usage de missiles contre des infrastructures civiles”. Faut-il y voir un indice de la nature des mesures de représailles envisagées par Moscou ?

La Russie qui n’accuse pas directement Kiev de l’attaque du pont de Crimée tout en évoquant la ""nature terroriste de l’Ukraine"" laisse planer le doute sur la réponse qu’elle entend apporter à cet affront.

Vladimir Poutine doit réunir lundi son Conseil de sécurité un format rassemblant les principaux ministres responsables politiques et représentants des services de sécurité et de l'armée.

Pour le moment les autorités russes tentent de minimiser les dégâts subis par le pont de Kertch et assurent que le trafic ferroviaire et routier a pu reprendre. ""Tous les trains programmés vont passer en totalité"" a affirmé dimanche le vice-Premier ministre russe Marat Khousnoulline selon l'agence Ria Novosti.

Les autorités de Crimée avaient annoncé samedi que la circulation avait également repris pour les voitures et les bus sur la seule voie routière du pont restée intacte. Des ferries ont pris également le relais pour effectuer la traversée notamment pour les poids lourds.

Over the years the process has been refined the cameras have got smaller and it’s become more accessible to normal people. But we wouldn’t be where we are today without one man in particular: George Eastman the founder of the Eastman Kodak Company.

After a trip to the Caribbean in 1878 with a camera that was as big as a microwave (not that they existed then) and chemicals that were extremely toxic Eastman decided that there must be a better way to take photos. Using what he knew about the chemistry and equipment needed he set out to find a way to simplify the process and reduce the size of the camera needed.

• Check out the best film cameras

Ten years after Eastman’s trip to the Caribbean Kodak launched the single most important camera in its history: the Kodak 1 Box Brownie which completely revolutionized film photography. It cost $25 (almost $800 in today's money) came preloaded with roll film weighed 900g and after taking 100 photos it needed to be sent back to Kodak to be loaded with more film.

In the years that followed Kodak continued to make the developing process more efficient cameras kept getting smaller and eventually photography became accessible to all. Kodak’s slogan ""You press the button we do the rest"" brought photography into the mainstream and it quickly became a national craze.

To honor Eastman's achievements in making film photography accessible to all the American Chemical Society has awarded the Kodak Group a Historic Chemical Landmark Designation. This puts Eastman in the same category as scientists such as Edwin Land who cofounded Polaroid and Alexander Fleming who discovered penicillin.

""This Landmark honors George Eastman Eastman Kodak and the many generations of Kodak chemists scientists and engineers who made photography an everyday part of our lives before the advent of smartphones and digital cameras"" said Angela K Wilson Society president. ""Many of us remember the enjoyment of taking pictures sending the film to be developed and waiting to see the printed photos.""

We have a lot to thank George Eastman for and it's great that his achievements are receiving the recognition they deserve. It's easy to pick up a film camera these days and not think about how much the process has changed and simplified since Louis Daguerre came up with the Daguerreotype process in 1838. Despite how much camera technology has advanced since the first digital cameras burst onto the scene film photography is as popular as ever with many modern photographers choosing to work entirely analog.",,,,,,,,,

After all who could ever forget Axl Rose's triumphant bitchery as he stormed off stage yelling ""Thanks to the lame ass security I'm going home"" slamming his microphone to the ground breaking it into pieces before a full on riot of angry fans erupted? Ah the 90s.

Still if you don't remember this incident (or weirdly somehow want to relive it) you can now get a little piece of the action so to speak. Someone for whatever reason has put one of the chairs from venue formerly known as the Riverport Amphitheatre on eBay. Yes what was once likely launched as a projectile is now on the verge of becoming a rock and roll collectible.

The incident that sparked the madness was a member of the crowd taking photos of the band during a performance of ""Rocket Queen."" Rose seeing the photographer began screaming to security ""Take that! Take that! Take that!"" before taking matters into his own hands. Rose then yelled ""I'll do it goddamn it!"" and then proceeded to jump into the crowd and—presumably—hunt for the unlucky shutterbug. You can watch the initial incident unfold in the video below.

Props to the rhythm section of Duff McKagan Izzy Stradlin and Matt Sorum for never losing the beat throughout the melee. But ultimately that's the best that can be said about the whole scenario. Rose was later sued for the incident at Guns N' Roses were banned from playing St. Louis until 2017.

As for the person auctioning off the chair the description of the ""item"" reads: ""I was in the audience at the GN'R concert that ended in the infamous ban of GN'R in St. Louis in '91. A friend grabbed a chair during the mayhem on the way out and put it in my car. I've held on to this piece of history for 31 years. The wife said it's time to find it a new home. I am auctioning the chair as well as the original ticket stub.""

Unfortunately however the listing was taken down—as no bids were offered. I guess the people of St. Louis are still pissed at Rose. But if you want to check out the original listing you can check it out here.

Ironically this would not be the last riot Rose would instigate; barely a year later while touring with Metallica Guns N' Roses cancelled their performance after hours of making fans wait as a result of what was deemed a throat issue with Rose. Fans revolted and the ensuing riot is still one of the most infamous incidents in the history of live performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvMTk2OS1jYW1hcm8tc2l0dGluZy1mb3ItMzAteWVhcnMtZmVhdHVyZXMtb2RkLWN1c3RvbWl6YXRpb25zLXdvb2QtYXJtcmVzdHMtMjAwNzcxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1969 Camaro Sitting for 30 Years Features Odd Customizations Wood Armrests,"Say what you want about the ’69 Camaro but it’s impossible to consider it an ugly car. And yet it goes without saying the Camaro isn’t everybody’s cup of tea so it’s not a surprise that some people try to customize the car in the most well unusual ways.

This 1969 Camaro has been sitting for nearly three decades in a garage until the owner passed not a long time ago.eBay seller thechevyscrounger says they pulled the car from the garage and started inspecting it only to discover that the body has been hand-painted. It looks like grease the seller says so be ready to give the car a full respray if you want to get it back on the road.But the odd customizations this Camaro has received don’t stop here.For example the previous owner installed wood armrests because God knows why. They look weird and awful in the photos shared by the seller yet they claim the whole thing looks much better in person. However if you’re thinking of restoring this Camaro back to its original specifications the original armrests are still around and they go with the car.And speaking of a potential restoration to factory specs there’s something you need to know about the engine. The unit that was in charge of powering this Camaro was a 6-cylinder unit that had already been pulled from the engine bay.Right now in charge of putting the car in motion is a 350 (5.7-liter) but as it turns out the new engine has never been hooked up completely. In other words it requires some work on this front as well so this Camaro is clearly a massive project on all fronts.Getting your hands on this Chevrolet isn’t going to be easy as the car has already received the attention of several bidders. The top offer right now is a little over $3500 but the reserve is yet to be unlocked.",,,,,,,,,

MissionGO Unmanned Systems a leader in uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) production and operations announced a 3-year partnership providing UAS inspection services to Southern California Edison the largest subsidiary of Edison International and primary electricity supply company for much of Southern California.

With high temperatures and extreme droughts throughout the region staying ahead of mechanical issues malfunctioning equipment and dangerous failures is a priority for energy and utility companies. Using UAS to view and inspect transmission and distribution electricity poles – along with other components of critical infrastructure – minimizes the time and hazards while increasing the quality and quantity of collected data (read more about the impact of UAS on utility inspections here.)

“MissionGO is proud of our history with Southern California Edison and we look forward to continuing our work together” says Chris Corgnati President of MissionGO “SCE’s commitment to safety makes MissionGO the perfect partner to keep the people of California connected and secure.”

Throughout the last three years working with Southern California Edison MissionGO’s UAS inspection team performed over 6500 sorties and catalogued more than 1200 hours of flight time. The team reviewed and captured data from 20000 distribution poles and 4000 transmission poles with zero incidents. These flight operations have prevented wildfires and given Southern California Edison the time needed to prioritize and repair infrastructure to keep the community safe.

After a rigorous vetting and demonstration process MissionGO was selected as one of two companies to secure this new contract with Southern California Edison. The contract includes nearly 160000 poles to be inspected and is estimated at $50 million over the next 3 years. This being one of the largest UAS services contract in the world MissionGO is looking forward to bringing on talented pilots and crews to continue this critical work in California.

Joe Piazza MissionGO’s Director of Infrastructure Inspections says the team is ready and excited to continue the work in California. “We’ve made an impact to the people here – not only through our safe and reliable services – but also through the community engagement and education of our teams.”

MissionGO has provided critical infrastructure inspections via UAS since 2019 and is working with companies across the United States to deliver detailed reports on all types of infrastructure in every type of environment. From urban construction cranes to wetland pipelines remote transmission lines and more. Learn more about MissionGO’s infrastructure inspection services at www.missiongo.io.

In a blog post on its website EA announced that the Origin platform which has existed as EA’s primary game launcher for over 10 years is about to be replaced with the EA app as it comes out of open beta.

Described as EA’s “fasted and lightest PC client to date” the EA app has a “new streamlined design” to enable players to “easily find the games and content” they need as well as providing a way to “discover your new favourite games”. The client features automatic game downloads and background updates in order to “ensure that your games are ready to play when you are”.

The EA app enables connections so that an “ultimate” friends list can be built consisting of friends on other platforms and services such as Steam Xbox and PlayStation. Players will receive a “custom unique ID” so that they are “easily recognisable” as well as being able to see what their friends list is playing.

For users on the Origin platform EA will be “inviting” them to move over to the EA app soon as well as ensuring that by the time their invite is received “all” games and content will be on the app waiting. Local and cloud saves will transfer to the new app as well as Origin friends lists.

For those too impatient to wait for the invite the EA app can be downloaded right from the blog post. Simply run the installer and it’ll replace Origin during the installation process.

The new EA app is currently only available for Windows with Mac users forced to continue using the Origin for Mac program for now. It’s unclear whether a version of the EA app for Mac is on the way or not.

The latest project from the Housing Authority of the County of San Joaquin (HACSJ) and the county harbors 49 one- and two-bedroom apartments for homeless veterans. Once occupants are moved in — Peter Ragsdale executive director of HACSJ said a snag with PG&E is the holdup — Victory Gardens will house roughly 100 homeless veterans and their loved ones and pets.

“We take people as they come” Ragsdale said. “Homeless mental health challenges addiction … its housing with services.”

Rent is capped at 30% of income. If an occupant has no income rent will be around $50 Ragsdale said. Eligible occupants are veterans eligible for Veterans Affairs medical benefits — generally those with an honorable discharge — at which point they’d have a licensed social worker to help them be successful in housing Ragsdale said. Five units are also for regular housing choice vouchers which Ragsdale said allows them to house veterans who have a dishonorable discharge or other service-related challenges that may cause them to leave the military without full benefits.

2021:SJ Housing Authority breaks ground on affordable units for homeless veterans

Victory Gardens is strategically located near San Joaquin General Hospital the future regional VA community-based outpatient clinic under construction visible from I-5 and close to public transportation. Built on 2.5 acres of county-owned land the project is a public-private partnership between the housing authority its nonprofit arm Delta Community Developers Corp. DFA Development and San Joaquin County.

County Supervisor Tom Patti a candidate in the November elections to represent the 9th Congressional District in Washington D.C. said the board of supervisors has prioritized veteran housing and support services but he’s ready to do more.

“I’m proud to see this is the fruition of everybody’s collective vision” Patti said. “We have stakes in this game for victory for our veterans and for addressing the homelessness issue the tragedy the humanitarian crisis truly a national crisis and it needs to be declared that.”

An “unprecedented” amount of federal housing vouchers will help operate the project long-term Ragsdale said. Congressman Josh Harder Patti’s opponent in November said Ragsdale and the housing authority are moving at ""the speed of light"" even through COVID. The project broke ground August 2021 and was set in motion three years ago.

Most of the veterans living at Victory Gardens will be Vietnam veterans many of whom were not treated with the respect and dignity they deserved Harder said.

“Some of them were spat on. One of the Vietnam vets in San Joaquin County told me he took his uniform off put it under his bed and never wanted to talk about it” Harder said. “I think this project is a culmination of efforts to try to fix some of those challenges over the last 50 years to make sure we dignify the service of those veterans.”

It's estimated there are roughly 140 unhoused veterans in San Joaquin County. At 49 units Victory Gardens is space to make a sizeable difference.

“Victory Gardens will not solve veterans homelessness in San Joaquin County … This is actionable this is replicable and the team behind this project humbly and fortunately are ready to do more” Ragsdale said. “We’ve taken roughly $3-4 million local dollars and turned it into this.”

Victory Gardens is HACSJ’s third permanent supportive housing project and the first Veteran Housing and Homelessness Prevention project in the county after the housing authority was awarded $6.8 million from the state program. The housing authority also secured $19 million in highly-competitive low-income housing tax credit equity — developers provide equity to fund affordable housing projects in return for tax credits a government-administered program to help affordable housing be a feasible investment for developers — to bankroll the majority of Victory Gardens.

“These problems can be solved” Ragsdale said. “Permanent supportive housing is a critical need in our community and I think we have to take the opportunity this moment in time where the federal and state governments are putting unprecedented resources into solving this problem.”

Ragsdale said the housing authority has received a $24 million HomeKey award from the state — another round of funding is coming Spring 2023 — and is in talks with the county on utilizing the funds for a modular-build project on the land adjacent to Victory Gardens.

So this spooky season WMAR-2 has come up with a list of our 15 all time favorite Halloween movies to watch.

This list in no particular order includes some of the most legendary horror movie franchises from past and present.

It's completely opinionated so let us know some of your favorites.

Halloween Franchise (1978- Present):

Yes we know how to cliche it is to start a Halloween list with a movie titled Halloween but it has longevity. The series follows Lauri Strode the last remaining member of her family as she tries to stop her rampaging serial killer brother Michael Myers. Myers is seemingly invincible as he finds a way to return the big screen year after year. At the end of every movie he's either shot stabbed run over or set on fire and still manages to return to Haddonfield to terrorize more unlucky Halloween goers every year. He also does a really good job at finding whoever it is he's stalking. Halloween Ends is set the be the final movie as we follow Michael Myers for another Halloween season.

Nightmare on Elm Street Franchise (1984- 2010):

We promise this list isn't filled with only old slasher movies. This series was something different in an era dominated by silent killers like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers Freddy Krueger actually talked! The crispy slasher delivered puns and witty one-liners before he ends his victims. Before he was a dream hopping serial killer Krueger was a just a regular serial killer. Which admittedly isn't much better but for the residents of Elm Street things didn't get much better when they burned him for his crimes. It's impossibly difficult to fend off a dream stalker.

Associated Press

Dark Skies (2013):

This film follows the life of an everyday family as they live in a peaceful suburb. This peace is quickly interrupted when they find that strange things start happening to them. They wake up one morning and their alarm system is activated and all their furniture is turned upside down. One of the children even wakes up with strange markings all over his body. They soon find out they're being targeted by an alien threat.

Conjuring Franchise (2013- Present):

Can't have a scary movie list without ghosts. The Conjuring Universe is made up of several movies all based on true events. The franchise follows Ed and Lorraine Warren as they investigate paranormal activity. They encounter haunted dolls possessed people and a demonic nun. The latest addition to the franchise follows the couple as a young man is accused of murder but claims demonic possession as his defense.

IT (1960-2019):

This movie takes a fear of clowns to the next level. Seven kids in Derry Maine battle an evil that takes form every 27 years. Primarily in the form of a clown known as Pennywise the creature feeds on personal fear. Even when the kids move out of town the evil clown still finds a way to terrorize them and suck them back into town.

Chucky (1988-Present)

If we're talking about horror we cannot forget about the infamous killer doll Chucky. His story begins in 1988 in the film 'Childs Play'. Charles Lee Ray a serial killer uses black magic to put his soul inside a doll named Chucky. Karen Barclay buys the doll and gives it to her son who late realizes that Chucky is alive. For years Chucky seems to find a way to terrorize people as he comes back in multiple films. The latest installment is the series 'Chucky' which serves as a sequel to the 'Cult of Chucky' which is now in its second season on Syfy and USA.

Collider

Scream (1996-Present)

It's hard to bring up Halloween movies without talking about one of the most iconic slasher figures of the generation. Ghostface made his debut on the big screen in 1996 in film 'Scream"". A year after the murder of her mother Sidney looks into a series of murders as she believes they have a connection. Sidney is haunted by Ghostface for years the latest installment came out this year showing the cast all grown up still battling their past ghosts. Scream was Also made into a series the next installment is set to be released in 2023.

IGN

Unfriended (2014 2018)

We all love hopping on group video calls with our friends whether it's FaceTime Skype or even WhatsApp. Trouble came for a group of friends when they decided to hop on their traditional Skype call and were met with an unexpected visitor. Laura Barns was a young student who took her own life after suffering from bullying. The ghost of Barns joins the Skype call to exact revenge on those who bullied her. The next installment came in 2018. Unfriended: Dark Web takes a more realistic approach as a young man discovers a laptop that is actually the source of trading on the Dark Web. The movie is set from another Skype call where a group of friends are in for a horrific ending.

Candyman (1985-2021)

We've all heard his name but we wouldn't dare utter it without fear. The legend of Candyman dates back to 1985 with his first appearance in the novel 'The Forbidden'. The original film released in 1992 with actor Tony Todd portraying the myth. The myth of Candyman is closely similar to that of Bloody Mary if you look into a mirror and chant his name five times he appears. Summoning him often costs the individual their own life. The 2021 portrayal of the film digs deeper into the legends and its parallels as Jordan Peele put his own spin on it.

Insidious (2010)

The further is a place we all would not want to go that's why a family goes through a paranormal quest to save their comatose son. Married couple Josh and Renal Lambert with their sons Dalton and Foster and infant daughter Cali recently moved into a new home. Dalton sneaks away to explore the attic where he encounters a frightening entity and falls form a step stool he then enters into a coma. Three months without any result they take the child home. Once home the family begins to go through different paranormal events that lead up to a quest to save Dalton from many different spirits.

Hocus Pocus (1993)

A cult classic that never gets old no matter your age. Almost 30-years later its popularity still remains. So much so that Disney Plus finally released its highly anticipated sequel. This Halloween flick takes you on a journey from the 1600s to the 1990s. That's how long the evil Sanderson sisters have haunted Salem Massachusetts. The movie starts off with a young man trying to save his little sister from the sinister witches but instead they turn him into a cat. Fast forward three centuries when new kid Max moves into town and unknowingly lights a candle that will change his life forever.

Halloweentown (1998)

This Disney Channel Original follows teen siblings who have no idea they're witches. Their mom doesn't want to spill the beans and prefers to raise the children as mortals. Grandma has other plans and chooses to reveal the family secret. The Cromwells come from Halloweentown a magical place where ghosts witches and werewolves live. But lately something has been going terribly wrong there and it's up to the young siblings to help grandma get to the bottom of it.

Hubie Halloween (2020)

Adam Sandler stars in this Netflix comedy. Hubie is a deli counter worker who cares deeply about his hometown of Salem especially around Halloween time.

Most in the neighborhood often bully and make fun of him for his many quirks. But when a kidnapper starts terrorizing the town it's Hubie that steps up big to protect his fellow residents earning the admiration of his life-long crush!

Ghostbusters Franchise (1984)

Who you gonna call? You can't have a list of classic Halloween films without including Ghostbusters! Starring comedy legends Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd the movie follows a group of friends who start a paranormal investigation service when reports of ghost sightings begin haunting New York City. The original movie led to billions in merchandise sales that later turned into television series video games and sequel movies.

AP Photo Shown in this scene from the 1984 movie ""Ghostbusters"" are Bill Murray Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.

The Exorcist (1973)

Despite not being about Halloween this movie is an all time favorite among horror fans and was partly filmed in nearby Georgetown It's about a young girl named Regan who becomes possessed by demons. Doctors can't figure out the problem so her mother turns to a pair Catholic priests. Their only hope to set Regan free is through an exorcism. The movie is responsible for launching multiple sequels and television series.

In addition to staying hydrated and planning breaks you can also review which Disney World rides are pregnancy friendly — and which ones are not. If you’re going to visit Disney World while pregnant you might want to review which rides you have to take off your to-do list.

Disney World Rides That Are Not Pregnancy Safe

In general the rule of thumb for pregnancy and Disney World rides is height restrictions. Any ride with a height restriction (of any height) is not recommended for pregnant people and you’ll see signs notifying guests of these restrictions outside the entrance of these rides. If you see “expectant mothers should not ride” on any ride sign you know that it’s not considered safe.

The reasons these rides are considered unsafe are due to factors like speed rapid starts and stops and pressures and forces the body may experience. The full list of Disney World rides that are not safe for pregnant riders is listed below:

Avatar Flight of Passage

Barnstormer

Big Thunder Mountain Railroad

DINOSAUR

Expedition Everest – Legend of the Forbidden Mountain

Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind

Kali River Rapids

Star Tours – The Adventures Continue

Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance

Test Track

Tiana’s Bayou Adventure (Coming in 2024; must be 40 inches or taller)

Tomorrowland Speedway

The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror

Pregnancy Safe Rides

So are there any safe rides? The short answer is yes!! Any ride without a height restriction is typically considered safe which means tons of classic Disney rides like Dumbo the Flying Elephant “it’s a small world” and Peter Pan’s Flight are not restricted.

Shows parades and character meet-and-greets are also safe options! Basically there are plenty of things you can do while visiting Disney World pregnant but you have to cross thrill rides off your list.

Note that it might be a good idea to speak with your doctor or midwife to find out if you should avoid any specific movements (drops and spins for example). The rides below include short drops but are technically not restricted so you may want to consider your personal limitations.

Road closures in the Hartford area are expected to be lifted by around 2 p.m. Saturday.

No one knows that better than the Hubbells. For the past three years the family of six from Bristol has come out to support the runners in the Hartford Marathon.

More than 8000 people from across the state and country participated in the 29th annual Hartford Marathon on Saturday running the 26.2-mile marathon 13.1-mile half marathon 3.1-mile Charity 5K and Team 26.2-mile relay race.

Mom Tia Hubbell said her favorite part each year is “Watching the accomplishment on the runner’s faces when they finish.” Her 8-year-old son loves the fist-bumps from passersby. But the entire family enjoys making runners smile with their hand-decorated signs.

In a sea of posters dedicated to moms dads friends and loved ones others provided motivational messages for all.

One sign read “You’re impossibly fast and strong!” Another said “You don’t sweat you sparkle!” and “Pain is temporary. Race results are online forever.”

Leigh-Anne Spokane held a slightly less encouraging message. Her poster read “Why? Why? Why?”

“I am not a runner. You couldn’t even make me run if you chased me” Spokane laughed. “There’s not a part of me that could do it. I admire all these people but I still think they’re nuts.”

Spokane came up from Raleigh North Carolina with her husband Steve. The Hartford Marathon marked his 35th half-marathon on his quest to run a race in each state before turning 65. Earlier this year he ran in Springfield Illinois. In November the 61-year-old will participate in a half marathon in Madison Wisconsin.

Waving pink and purple pom-poms Racquel Lunser and a “hype team” from Racquel Addiction Fitness came to cheer on 50 members from their Hartford gym who ran in Saturday’s events.

“So many people will say ‘I can’t do it’ or they just feel like they’re not a runner” Lunser said. “[I love] to see people that never really were runners accomplishing their goals.”

While spectators cheered Troy Mogielnicki ran crowd control along the final turn. Mogielnicki was one of 2000 volunteers. He has volunteered for the last 20 years through the Hospital for Special Care.

“I can’t run any more so it’s nice to be able to be part of it in some way” Mogielnicki said.

The chants cowbells and airhorns grew deafening as the marathon participants ran the final yards to the finish line.

Christine Myers of Altamont New York won the Hartford Marathon in 2021. This year she came in sixth.

Myers said that with each marathon her favorite part is the feeling of completing the race.

“You’re running for other people” Myers said. “It’s not for you it’s for others.”

Jennifer Fannon of Burlington ran in honor of her father who passed away from brain cancer in 2012.

As she crossed the finish line Fannon overcome with emotion began to cry as her friends and family greeted her.

“It felt empowering. I worked years to get a Boston [Marathon] qualifier time and I finally did it” she said.

Arynne Moody from Pennsylvania said she ran this marathon for herself during an ongoing battle with bulimia.

“The fact that I can still do it … that’s what’s important” Moody said. “At the finish the runner’s high is such a real thing. You’re hurting but for at least a couple of seconds when you cross that finish line you don’t feel a thing.”

Moody crossed the finish line beside Jennifer Small of New Hampshire. Saturday marked their 15th marathon. To passersby the women looked like life-long friends but they had just met last weekend.

“Running is like that you just life each other up” Moody said.

“You’re just instantly friends” Small said. “[With] the camaraderie everyone I ran by was cheering saying ‘Good job! High-five!’… Running unites people.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyYW50LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzA4L2hhcnRmb3Jkcy1ldmVyZXR0LWhhY2tldHQtYW4tYXNzaXN0YW50LWNvYWNoLWF0LWhhbGwtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtd2lucy1ldmVyc291cmNlLWhhcnRmb3JkLW1hcmF0aG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hartford's Everett Hackett an assistant coach at Hall High School wins Eversource Hartford Marathon,"Everett Hackett’s first marathon was the Eversource Hartford Marathon.

Hackett who lives in Hartford has run the marathon and the half-marathon for many years. He was third in the marathon in 2019 fourth in 2020.

He never got to break the finish line tape — until Saturday.

Hackett who took the lead with less than a mile to go won the 26.2-mile race in 2:24:37 beating runner-up Ruben Sanca of Salisbury Mass. who led most of the race by less than a minute. Eric Ashe of Natick Mass. finished third (2:26:22).

“It’s awesome” said Hackett 32 who is a teaching assistant and an assistant track and cross country coach at Hall High School in West Hartford. “I’ve been wanting to win this race since I started running it probably five-six years ago.

“I’m happy to finally win it. I wanted a faster time for sure but the win is great.”

Hackett who grew up in West Hartford is the first winner of the race from Hartford.

Alexandra Niles of Montclair N.J. a former college gymnast who picked up running 15 years ago won the women’s race in 2:43:24. Jenna Gigliotti of Amherst Mass. was second (2:49:20) and Val Curtis of Niceville Fla. third (2:52:02).

“I didn’t even think I would run a marathon” said Niles who ran marathon No. 15 Saturday of her start in the sport. “I did not think I’d be fast. I’ll run 5Ks for fun and meet people. That was my plan.”

Niles 39 qualified for the Olympic trials in 2020 and hopes to do so again.

“I was trying to break 2:40” she said. “I was solid through the half. Around 20-22 I started cramping. I was like ‘OK can I just keep going enough to hold onto first place?'”

Runners set out at the start of the Eversource Hartford Marathon on Saturday morning. There were 1088 finishers in the marathon 2898 in the half-marathon and 1557 in the 5K. STEPHEN DUNN|Special to the Courant

There were 1558 finishers in the 5K 2898 in the half-marathon and 1171 in the marathon Saturday. Ben Decker a graduate student at Yale won the half-marathon in 1:05:27 and Annmarie Tuxbury of Newport R.I. won the women’s half in 1:12:40. Angelia Rafter a graduate student at Central Connecticut who lives in Glastonbury broke the women’s 5K record from 2003 winning in 16:15 and John Amenta of Fishkill N.Y. won the overall 5K in 15:04.

“The goal was to get the course record” said Rafter 23. “Alex [Norstrom who won the marathon last year] my boyfriend said ‘Take out the first mile it’ll hurt the second mile and then just cruise the last mile. I just did exactly that.”

At about the 3-hour mark of the races an unidentified male runner collapsed in front of the finish line of the half-marathon and medical personnel began to perform CPR on him. The runner was brought into the medical tent and then taken to Hartford Hospital. According to a race spokesperson the hospital reported that the runner was in good condition and his vital signs were stable and within normal limits.

Hackett was surprised by his win. His training cycle hadn’t gone all that great and he wasn’t sure how he would fare Saturday.

But he found himself in the lead pack early then watched as Sanca broke away around Mile 5. Hackett Ashe and Joe Darda of Chaplin who finished fourth ran together until about Mile 15 when Hackett began to accelerate.

“After the out and back I started to reel [Sanca] in really slowly” Hackett said. “I honestly did not think I was going to get him. Mile 25 I was pushing like ‘Finish hard.'”

Hackett passed Sanca midway through the 25th mile.

“I was running scared from that point” Hackett said. “He’s a great runner. He crushed a 10K a couple weeks ago; he beat me by like a minute and a half.”

Ashe thought about trying to make a move but a stomach cramp slowed him down at Mile 25.

“Me and Joe were together until 22-23” Ashe said. “I was watching Everett catch Ruben and I thought maybe I could potentially catch them because they weren’t too far away but the stomach cramp did me in.”

Sanca said he had been battling an illness earlier in the week.

“I just couldn’t hold it in the end” he said. “I got sick earlier in the week and I’ve been trying to recover.”

Hackett who ran at Hall High has qualified for the Olympic marathon trials twice but said Saturday’s race was a bigger accomplishment even though he’s run much faster on the course.

He was heading out after the race to Rhode Island where the Hall cross country boys’ team one of the top teams in the state was competing in an invitational meet.

“Hopefully those kids are pumped” he said. “Hopefully they hear about this and they’re excited about their race.”

(Sean D. Elliot/The Day) Buy Photo Reprints

Outspoken Port Authority critic Kevin Blacker is challenging two career politicians — and the two-party system — in his run for Congress.

Blacker a farmer and landscaper from Noank with a degree in soil science became intimately involved with local politics in the past several years as he advocated against the State Pier project.

Joint venture partners Ørsted and Eversource will use the pier for the assembly and staging of offshore wind components needed for the construction of South Fork Wind the first of three offshore wind projects State Pier is expected to serve.The project is meant to make New London an offshore hub and create clean energy.

News broke in August that a federal grand jury has subpoenaed six years of port authority records as part of an investigation into the quasi-public agency. The port authority has handed over documents as part of an ethics probe by the Office of State Ethics and to the state attorney general’s office as part of its antitrust probe. The authority additionally provided information to the State Contracting Standards Board when that group investigated the port authority’s procurement activities.

If elected Blacker 36 of Noank said he’d use his voice as a congressman to “get some answers as to what’s going on with the multiple federal investigations.”

“I’d call attention to there’s a major problem down there it doesn’t make common practical sense it’s dishonest and it’s hurtful to the public” Blacker said. “I don’t see or hear Mike France doing anything. Joe Courtney’s even worse he’s going along supporting the project basically gushing over how great it is.”

“I think that due to how powerful the political players are that are involved down there nobody in conventional politics wants to speak up against it” Blacker added.

Blacker was charged two years ago first with a felony then dropped to a misdemeanor for vandalism after he painted street signs near State Pier pink. The charges are still pending.

Courtney has heard Blacker’s criticisms on the State Pier. He downplayed Blacker’s presence in the race noting that the Green Party usually puts up a candidate.

“I’ve met Kevin before he’s a hard-working guy somebody who’s very passionate about his beliefs and I certainly respect that” Courtney said. “The one issue that has become his signature which is to block the offshore wind project is contradictory to the Green Party’s stated mission to protect the environment and fight climate change.”

While Courtney admits the plan was flawed in the beginning he said with accommodations made for Cross Sound Ferry a $750000 yearly allowance to New London and other changes the plan is now sound.

“At some point the opponents of it have morphed into completely blocking this. I’m for decarbonizing our energy system so I support the project in its present form” Courtney said.

In response to Courtney’s comments Blacker said “The two FBI investigations and Attorney General investigation of State Pier are no more intended to block offshore wind than I am.”

“I think offshore wind in its current form is a politician's solution to climate change. Gives guys like Joe something to talk about right before he asks you for a donation” Blacker added.

Priorities

The primary critique of Blacker is that he’s a one-issue candidate. But in his interview with The Day Blacker staked out positions on the economy abortion guns and other issues.

He said he is prioritizing “honest common-sense government that serves the people the public not just the politically connected” and challenging the two-party system. He called himself an “ardent supporter” of former third-party candidate for governor Oz Griebel who earned almost 4% of the vote in 2018.

Another priority of Blacker’s is an unusual one for a politician.

He said he wants to “remind people that viable well-staffed local independent newspapers are vital to the proper function of the American system.”

“One of the things I set out to do with the State Pier fight was to reestablish … the importance of the newspaper” Blacker said. “The average citizen armed with the truth and the newspaper can accomplish almost anything.”

Blacker said he would also be focused on climate change which is in line with the Green Party’s environmentally conscious platform.

“We need a source of energy that is clean and renewable and non-polluting but it has to be economically viable” Blacker said. “It’s going to take a combination of a lot of small common-sense practical solutions but also some totally radical innovation.”

“We’re not in a position to not have nuclear energy” he continued. “The question is what do you do with the waste? It’s risky. Right now it’s boring old technology. We are capable of thinking of a better solution.”

Spending and submarines

Blacker said the government should spend money more efficiently especially when it comes to military spending.

“I think we need to look at military spending in terms of a war in Iraq a war in Afghanistan sending support to Ukraine — what is the true motivation? With the amount of money we’re spending is it wise?” Blacker said.

As for Courtney’s record on military spending Blacker said “General Dynamics is one of his biggest donors. I think he’s serving them.”

Blacker believes part of the job of representing the 2nd Congressional District is securing submarine contracts “If we need the submarines…If we truly need the submarines in the interest of national defense.” But he continued “I would encourage some diversification at Electric Boat. I know there has been interest in manufacturing wind components finding something else they can do.”

On taxes Blacker believes Connecticut’s are crippling. He said his goal would be to close tax loopholes for the wealthiest citizens.

“This person is extremely wealthy and they didn’t pay any tax whatsoever because they used this loophole and that loophole and dodged this and that” Blacker said. “If the working stiffs like myself are paying 30% whatever tax bracket we’re in that doesn’t seem real fair.”

Abortion guns the 2020 election

Blacker said that he is pro-choice: “I believe that every pregnancy is unique and I would have more faith in the mother’s judgment than in any government’s judgment.”

On the issues of guns and mass shootings Blacker falls somewhere in the middle of Courtney’s support for more stringent gun regulations and France’s fierce belief in the Second Amendment.

“I’ve shot guns before. I own guns. I was taught when I was a kid and I wanted to get a BB gun I had to take a hunter’s safety course” he said. “They’re something that have to be handled responsibly because they have the potential to do a lot of harm. I have an open mind about guns.”

“When people talk about guns the underlying issue is these mass shootings and school shootings and gun deaths and suicides and domestic violence” he continued. “In the immediate future … I would look for things that both sides could agree on. If you did certain crimes you can’t own guns.” Blacker also advocated for safer gun storage.

Blacker said he believes Biden won the 2020 election. He said there is no issue with increased absentee balloting. But “Was it fair? I don’t know.”

The Green Party candidate returned to one of his favorite targets Deputy Secretary of the State Scott Bates of Stonington when explaining his reasoning. There have been reports of corruption at the Port Authority during Bates’s leadership as chairman from 2016 to 2019.

“I would have more confidence in the integrity of our elections if we didn’t have people like Scott Bates who was caught lying to the legislature … as the Chief Operating Officer of the office of the Secretary of the State” Blacker said. “I don’t believe Donald Trump won but I also don’t know what the full truth is.”

‘Daily lessons in humility’

Blacker would not trade stocks if elected and he believes in term limits.

“Joe Courtney’s been there 16 years Larson’s been there 30 years DeLauro’s … been there 15 or 20 years” he said. “Joe’s had his turn let somebody else have their turn.”

Blacker agreed with the characterization that he is an outsider who found his way into politics. He emphasizes that as one of the biggest differences between he and the other candidates aside from age — “I’m a lot younger than them and a young person approaches the world differently than a person who’s on the other side of the hill like them.”

“Farming is nothing but daily lessons in humility and problem solving” Blacker said. “Both of them are career politicians. They had careers before this but they’re making a career of politics. Joe was a lawyer Mike was in the Navy. I don’t have any political experience. My job is mowing lawns it’s making hay. I’ve taken a lot of risks they wouldn’t be able to because they’re counting on it for their jobs and their career.”

(Published 2022),"Buying a home in New York City requires an especially large financial commitment these days — the median sale prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn both hit record highs ($1.25 million and $985000) in the second quarter of 2022. So when buyers are willing to pay even more to live in apartments and buildings with added amenities they’re probably looking for something specific.

A recent study by StreetEasy examined the prices of more than 55000 StreetEasy listings that sold between June 2020 and early August 2022 to find how much of a premium buyers were willing to pay for particular amenities in otherwise comparable apartments and buildings.

The data was used to determine the effect that specific amenities had on closing prices in two price brackets — under $2.5 million (90 percent of sales) and $2.5 million or more.

Interest in particular perks grew during the pandemic and these preferences showed in the results. In the lower price bracket buyers valued flex space (for exercising working and going to school from home). Refrigerated storage lockers designed to keep grocery deliveries fresh were important to buyers in the both brackets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtaW5ndHJlbmQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmUvcmV2aWV3cy93ZF9ibGFjay1wNDAtZ2FtZS1kcml2ZS1yZXZpZXctdGlueS0yZ2Itcy1wb3dlcmhvdXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WD_Black P40 Game Drive review -- Tiny 2GB/s Powerhouse,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtaW5ndHJlbmQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmUvcmV2aWV3cy93ZF9ibGFjay1wNDAtZ2FtZS1kcml2ZS1yZXZpZXctdGlueS0yZ2Itcy1wb3dlcmhvdXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7BC9AB0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtaW5ndHJlbmQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmUvcmV2aWV3cy93ZF9ibGFjay1wNDAtZ2FtZS1kcml2ZS1yZXZpZXctdGlueS0yZ2Itcy1wb3dlcmhvdXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

ExxonMobil has been ordered to reinstate two scientists who were fired after being suspected of leaking information to The Wall Street Journal the US Labor Department said Friday.

A federal whistleblower investigation found the oil and gas giant terminated the two computational scientists illegally in late 2020. The Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration also ordered ExxonMobil to pay the two employees back more than $800000 in back wages interest and compensatory damages.

An article in The Wall Street Journal last year claimed ExxonMobil might have inflated its production estimates and the value of oil and gas wells in the Texas Permian Basin where much of US production is located. The story scrutinized the company’s assumption in its 2019 SEC filings that drilling speed would increase substantially in the next five years.

Exxon denied the allegations at the time maintaining that it was reaching its drilling targets. “The claims made about drilling rates are demonstrably false” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said.

The two unidentified employees “raised concerns about the company’s use of these assumptions in late 2020” according to the Labor Department’s release. Exxon claimed it fired one scientist for “mishandling proprietary company information” the Labor Department statement said and the other for “having a ‘negative attitude’ looking for other jobs and losing the confidence of company management.”

In a statement to CNN Business Exxon denied the allegations and said that it will “defend itself accordingly.”

“The terminations in late 2020 were unrelated to the ill-founded concerns raised by the employees in 2019” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said.

Though neither employee was revealed as a source for the Journal’s story OSHA learned that the company knew one of the scientists was a relative of a source quoted in the WSJ article and had access to the leaked information.

“ExxonMobil’s actions are unacceptable. The integrity of the US financial system relies on companies to report their financial condition and assets accurately” said Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFicm9la25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDgvbmV3cy9ndXlhbmEvdXMtZGVwdC1vZi1sYWJvci1vcmRlcnMtZXh4b25tb2JpbC10by1yZWluc3RhdGUtZW1wbG95ZWVzLXN1c3BlY3RlZC1vZi13aGlzdGxlYmxvd2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Dept of Labor orders ExxonMobil to reinstate employees suspected of whistleblowing,"ExxonMobil has found itself in hot water after improperly dismissing two of its employees in violation of several statutes of the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Act.

The OSHA in a release yesterday informed that it has ordered ExxonMobil Corp. to immediately reinstate two employees and pay them more than $800000 in back wages interest and compensatory damages. A federal whistleblower investigation found the company terminated them illegally after suspecting them of leaking information to the Wall Street Journal.

According to an article in the Washington Post ExxonMobil had announced unexpectedly bullish targets for pumping oil out of Texas and New Mexico in the spring of 2019 the news sparked confusion for two scientists at the company.

It added that the two scientists Damian Burch a mathematician and Lindsey Gulden a geoscientist became alarmed when they began to suspect management was planning to pin what they considered as a potentially fraudulent forecast on them. They complained to ExxonMobil’s human resources investigators that Burch’s team was pressured to doctor data to make it look like the company was poised to generate billions of dollars more in oil than it was according to interviews and the findings of a Labor Department investigation.

According to the OSHA in September 2020 the Wall Street Journal had alleged that the global oil-and-gas company may have inflated production estimates and the reported value of oil and gas wells in the Texas Permian Basin. The newspaper reported ExxonMobil’s assumption that drilling speed would increase substantially in the next five years may have been inaccurate. These assumptions were included in company filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019.

OSHA’s investigation found ExxonMobil fired two computational scientists who raised concerns about the company’s use of the assumptions in late 2020. The company claimed it terminated one of the scientists for mishandling proprietary company information and the second for having a “negative attitude” looking for other jobs and losing the confidence of company management.

OSHA learned that ExxonMobil knew that one of the scientists was a relative of a source quoted in the Wall Street Journal article and had access to the leaked information. The investigation determined that the communication with the newspaper related to alleged company violations is protected activity under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The act also protects the scientists despite ExxonMobil’s belief that they had access and possibly leaked information to the publication. Neither was revealed as a source for the article.

“ExxonMobil’s actions are unacceptable. The integrity of the U.S. financial system relies on companies to report their financial condition and assets accurately” said Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker. “Whistleblower protection is integral to ensuring that financial disclosure laws work. As was the case in this instance OSHA will aggressively protect the rights of employees who raise concerns related to financial improprieties or potential fraud against shareholders.”

The Washington Post quoted Exxon’s response. “We reject all claims made by the former employees and will defend the company accordingly” Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said in an email. “The terminations in late 2020 were unrelated to the ill-founded concerns raised by the employees in 2019.”

Further “As we have stated throughout we welcome the opportunity to meet with OSHA to provide additional information or witness interviews as necessary” Norton wrote. Company officials said the scientists were not fired for blowing the whistle to federal agencies but for violating company policies.

The company argued that the scientists misunderstood the data and that Exxon was able to exceed targets they disputed. “The employees were neither qualified nor informed enough to offer an opinion let alone a make a credible complaint” Norton said.

OSHA’s Whistleblower Protection Program enforces the whistleblower provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and more than 20 whistleblower statutes. These statutes protect employees from retaliation for reporting violations in the workplace.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL29jdC8wOS9mcmFuY2VzLW9pbC1zdHJpa2VzLXB1c2gtb24tYXMtcGV0cm9sLXN0YXRpb24tcXVldWVzLXdvcnNlbtIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL29jdC8wOS9mcmFuY2VzLW9pbC1zdHJpa2VzLXB1c2gtb24tYXMtcGV0cm9sLXN0YXRpb24tcXVldWVzLXdvcnNlbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,France’s oil strikes push on as petrol station queues worsen,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL29jdC8wOS9mcmFuY2VzLW9pbC1zdHJpa2VzLXB1c2gtb24tYXMtcGV0cm9sLXN0YXRpb24tcXVldWVzLXdvcnNlbtIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL29jdC8wOS9mcmFuY2VzLW9pbC1zdHJpa2VzLXB1c2gtb24tYXMtcGV0cm9sLXN0YXRpb24tcXVldWVzLXdvcnNlbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA919DE0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL29jdC8wOS9mcmFuY2VzLW9pbC1zdHJpa2VzLXB1c2gtb24tYXMtcGV0cm9sLXN0YXRpb24tcXVldWVzLXdvcnNlbtIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL29jdC8wOS9mcmFuY2VzLW9pbC1zdHJpa2VzLXB1c2gtb24tYXMtcGV0cm9sLXN0YXRpb24tcXVldWVzLXdvcnNlbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

(WTVY) - A racial slur led to the murder of a Dothan businessman and the arrests of two young suspects according to a violent crimes’ investigator.

Robert Blount reportedly used the slur during a phone conversation with his girlfriend and because her speaker was on others overheard.

Among them was Mekhi Telfair a Black man who police accuse of retaliating in the most violent of ways.

These startling details were made public for the first time on Friday when Dothan Police Investigator Morgan Owens testified during a hearing that tested the strength of this case.

Blount’s phone conversation occurred as his girlfriend with whom he had argued that night was among a group that gathered on September 3 to watch college football.

After hearing the slur Telfair who is 24 and Blount a 48-year-old FedEx contractor who was white exchanged angry text messages though the two were not acquainted Owens said.

A few hours later Telfair allegedly asked his friend Koston McWaters who also attended the get-together to drive him to Blount’s home and about a block away Telfair got out of the vehicle.

Owens said he entered the home possibly through the back door and killed Blount who suffered multiple wounds from shotgun blasts.

His girlfriend who was intoxicated discovered his body when she was driven to Blount’s home by one of her friends in the early morning of September 4.

Within a couple of days of that gruesome discovery Telfair and McWaters also 24 had been charged with the most serious of crimes---Capital Murder.

Defense attorneys though accuse police of grasping at straws to make this case.

“You haven’t found the murder weapon have you? Arthur Medley asked Owens.

“No” she replied.

And she said that McWaters changed his story multiple times before settling on one version and admitting that he knew that Telfair planned to shoot Blount.

Medley and Manish Patel who is McWaters’ attorney believe the suspects should be given bonds.

Houston County District Judge Benjamin Lewis is considering that request but Owens’s testimony convinced him the charges should remain intact and he sent this case forward to a grand jury.

That's where Syd Kitson and his partners built an environmentally friendly fully sustainable town that they hoped would be hurricane proof. Kitson an eco-conscious developer and former pro football player rode out the hurricane at Babcock Ranch. Unbelievably none of the 5000 people there lost power during the storm.

""We were in the bullseye"" Kitson told correspondent Bill Whitaker for this week's 60 Minutes. ""And I remember sitting here. I had the weather on. And the weather person says 'Well this Category 4 hurricane is now heading for Babcock Ranch.'""

""And not only is it heading for Babcock Ranch but it's going to be on the eastern side of the wall which is the worst place to be"" Kitson said.

""How long did the hurricane sit over you?"" Whitaker asked.

""It was about eight to ten hours"" Kitson said.

At the height of the storm there were white caps on the lake in a video Kitson shot on his iPhone.

""So as soon as the sun came up the next morning I jumped in my car and I started driving out. And the only damage were a few down trees and a few shingles off the roofs"" Kitson said. ""That's it. And so our recovery was maybe a day.""

Babcock Ranch was designed to accommodate Florida's climate and ecosystems with indigenous plants and natural waterways for drainage; it was built 25 to 30 feet above sea level to help mitigate flooding from storm surges. There are sustainable water and sewage systems; all electric and phone lines are buried.

""We are the first solar-powered town in America"" Kitson told 60 Minutes. ""We have a solar field that's 150 megawatts.""

That solar field features a massive solar array of 700000 panels built by Florida Power and Light. Those panels withstood Ian's brutal beating.

""There's a lot of water but you don't see a single panel that's been dislodged. And there was quite a bit of wind that came through here over the last few days"" Kitson told Whitaker. ""Gusts of over 150 and it did not take a single panel out of here which is really just remarkable.""

The Indian residential rooftop solar segment is at the cusp of a robust growth phase. From 2 gigawatts (GW) cumulative installed capacity as of fiscal year (FY) 2022 the residential market will likely reach 3.2GW by FY2023 says the report’s co-author Vibhuti Garg Director South Asia IEEFA.

In 2020 average cost of a residential rooftop solar system in India was $658 per kilowatt (kW) declining by 73 percent from the 2013 level. In comparison in 2020 the residential rooftop solar cost in leading residential markets such as Japan the UK Switzerland and the US was 3.3x to 6.4x that of India.

India government’s recent push by launching a single national digital portal to simplify the process of residential rooftop solar installations and formalising a direct benefit transfer mechanism will boost capacity addition.

The new Central Financial Assistance (CFA) scheme will allow residential consumers to buy rooftop solar systems from any registered supplier of their choice says co-author Prabhakar Sharma Senior Research Associate JMK Research.

Policy hurdles

State governments must resolve issues such as delays in net metering approvals and communication of the benefits of rooftop solar installations. Sometimes state electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) delay subsidy payments to the installers disrupting the latter’s working capital flow.

All state electricity distribution companies must grant net metering approvals to the consumers within a strict and short timeline. In the case of residential rooftop solar systems DISCOMs in general need to be restricted to carrying out two activities: inspecting solar plants and selling the net meters says Akhil Thayillam Senior Research Associate JMK Research.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMjEwLzEyNzY3NDIuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China launches 1st comprehensive solar probe to share data with world's scientists,"China sends the Kuafu-1 satellite into a preset orbit via a Long March 2D carrier rocket on October 9 2022 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China's Gansu Province. Photo: Wang Jiangbo

China sent the country's Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) - a satellite specially designed to carry out a comprehensive probe of the Sun - into preset orbit via a Long March 2D carrier rocket on Sunday morning from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China's Gansu Province.The satellite also known as Kuafu-1 which is named after Kuafu a giant in Chinese mythology who indefatigably chased the sun was jointly developed by the Innovation Academy for Microsatellites of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) CAS National Astronomical Observatory the CAS Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics and the CAS Purple Mountain Observatory. Nanjing-based CAS Purple Mountain Observatory will operate the spacecraft the Global Times learned from mission insiders.Dubbed China's first comprehensive solar probe Kuafu-1 will conduct continuous solar observations for at least four years and its main scientific goals include the formation of the solar magnetic field solar flares and titanic blasts known as coronal mass ejections as well as their relationship in a simultaneous fashion Gan Weiqun the program leader and a research fellow with the Purple Mountain Observatory told the Global Times on Sunday.Chinese scientists will also use the satellite to support space disaster weather forecasts that might affect high-tech activities such as human spaceflights communication and navigation the Global Times learned from a statement the developers provided on Sunday.To achieve these goals the Kuafu-1 carries three payloads - the Lyman-alpha telescope (LST) Hard X-ray telescope (HXT) and Full-disk solar vector MagnetoGraph (FMG) according to Gan.

It marks a world's first to observe the solar magnetic field solar flares and titanic blasts and deploy a corresponding payload combination onboard all at once. It is also a world's first in deploying a near-Earth satellite platform to detect the all-solar vector magnetic field and the non-thermal radiation of solar flares as well as to simultaneously observe images heliostat formation and coronal propagation of coronal mass ejections.Also marking a world's first the Kuafu-1 will realize simultaneous imaging of the full heliosphere and the corona via the LST Gan added.With a designed service life of four years Kuafu-1 will work in the Earth's polar orbit some 720 kilometers above ground so that it will be capable of conducting 24-hour continuous observation directly of the Sun with a rather short communication delay according to Gan.Naming the satellite after Kuafu also represents the heroic and tenacious spirits of ancient Chinese ancestors in exploring nature and the Chinese people's unremitting quest to uncover the mystery of the Sun developers revealed.Gan said that the satellite would enter formal service after a testing period of four to six months.Li Hui another research fellow with the Purple Mountain Observatory and chief designer of the scientific application system of the satellite told the Global Times that after testing data collected by the spacecraft will be open to scientists and researchers all over the world in a timely fashion free of charge.Li added that such a sharing policy is also in line with international norms which Chinese solar physicists have enjoyed and benefited from. ""Therefore we shall fully open data collected by our comprehensive solar probe"" said Li.According to developers the three sets of payloads on the Kuafu-1 will collect around 500 gigabytes of data every day and that will be open to global researchers.NASA launched the Parker Solar Probe in 2018 which adopted a rather bold method of being the first to fly directly through the Sun's corona - the hazardous region of intense heat and solar radiation in the Sun's atmosphere that is visible during an eclipse.But the US probe admittedly revolutionary cannot yet look into the Sun directly all the time as the telescope instruments cannot withstand heat of over 5000 C so its observations will not be as continuous as those of the ASO-S Gan said.Gan explained that Xihe China's first solar probing satellite that attained state approval in June 2019 and was launched in October 2021 carries an H-alpha telescope that can be also deployed on Earth's ground but could overcome challenges including the atmospheric agitation when sent into space. It is dedicated to execute spectral imaging observations of the H-alpha band of the Sun and to mainly experiment with such technology.Kuafu-1 has different yet more specific solar probing tasks and it is designed to yield major scientific breakthroughs. So the deployment of the ASO-S marks a great leap in the domain."

Fans react online after shock loss to Chargers,"There is a long growing list of frustrating and bizarre Browns losses over the years.

But Sunday's 30-28 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers at FirstEnergy Stadium has to be near the top of the list.

Chargers coach Brandon Staley practically gave the game away to the Browns. Up 30-28 Staley and his coaching staff — which includes former University of Akron coach Tom Arth — decided to go for it on fourth and 2 with just over a minute left in the game. The Browns had no timeouts remaining.

Los Angeles failed to convert on fourth down giving the Browns had a chance to move to 3-2 for the season. Instead the Browns are now 2-3 after five weeks of the NFL season after rookie kicker Cade York missed a 54-yard field goal to win the game.

But Simms wasn't the only one questioning the Browns after the game. So were plenty of fans. Here's a look at what some had to say:

Bringing his ""All-American Road Show"" to Brew City Stapleton mesmerized the Fiserv Forum crowd across two hours filling the arena with wildfire guitar licks whiskey-like warmth and the textured soul-rich country blues that made him a regular Grammys favorite.

Here are eight of the highlights from another searing yet soothing shot served up from the ""Tennessee Whiskey"" singer.

1. A slightly different show

It's been barely more than a year since the soulful country singer last strummed into Milwaukee – with no new album in between – so for fans double-dipping the two concerts they knew they were probably getting an excellent show but maybe not many surprises on the setlist. And indeed there weren't many new entrants to the setlist on Saturday night – just the slow jams ""What Are You Listening To?"" and ""Joy of My Life"" – but there was enough jostling of the lineup (""Whiskey and You"" for instance moved out of the opener spot to begin now with ""Nobody to Blame"") to make everything feel fresh and keep the standards satisfying.

2. Engaging interactions

Stapleton said it pretty much straight-up on Saturday night: He wasn't going to talk much. After his opening batch of ""Nobody to Blame"" ""Parachute"" and ""Second One to Know"" Stapleton thanked the crowd and said he was going to focus on giving them as much music as the band could. With a 22-song two-hour set the country star delivered on that promise – but was also a little chattier than he let on. After ""Worry B Gone"" he dryly told an loudly enamored fan that he loved them too ... and thanks for screaming about it. A little later after wrapping up the intimate ballad ""What Are You Listening To?"" Stapleton joked with the crowd that the song shot up the country charts ... to just number 46. Add in his classic method of introducing his band crooning their names and hometowns into the medley of ""Tennessee Whiskey"" and you had a pleasantly personable night in between all of the excellent music.

3. Slowin' it down

Normally when a musician slows it down and plays their ballads the crowd typically disengages everyone takes advantage of a drink or bathroom break and it's often a buzzkill. That wasn't the case Saturday night at Fiserv Forum. Near the middle of the set Stapleton took the stage solo and settled things down with ""What Are You Listening To?"" – a modest ballad and even more modest success from early in his career – a stirring stripped-down rendition of ""Traveller"" and the tender and raw love song ""Whiskey and You."" The country singer basically apologized to the crowd by saying he'd cut it out with the slow stuff after ""Whiskey and You"" – but considering the almost sacred magnitized hush that washed over the rapt crowd during the segment the emotion both intimate and playing to the back of the giant room no apology necessary.

4. ""Free Bird""

Loud drunk guys demanding ""Free Bird"": Rejoice because at Chris Stapleton shows you finally get what you ask for. Well a little of it. Before launching into ""The Devil Named Music"" at the start the final act Stapleton gave the crowd a taste of the Lynyrd Skynyrd classic before dreamily melding it into his own tune. Sure it's one of the ultimate concert cliches – but the Grammy winner is one of the few artists who can pull it off and make it sound like a searingly soulful part of his own catalogue of hits performed not like it's a cover but a deeply felt song pulled from his core. To top it off with the slowly building and barreling howl of ""The Devil Named Music"" somehow makes an iconic song even better.

5. ""Fire Away""

A palate cleanser from last night pic.twitter.com/UQ7mkODckg — Matthew Mueller (@aManAboutFilm) October 9 2022

At some point Stapleton's signature move of ending ""Fire Away"" by letting the crowd take over for a final chorus exclusively lit by a twinkling sky of cell phone flashlights isn't going to have the same mesmerizing emotional punch. But that point sure wasn't Saturday night. Coming near the end of the evening the sight of the entire Fiserv Forum glowing at full brightness without a light on in the bowl and cooing the ballad out into the night is still a warm and wondrous musical moment a soothing communal statement before leading into the final rock-out jam sessions on the setlist.

6. Paying tribute

Wisconsin sure does love opening up to Chris Stapleton at his Brew City shows – says something about the warm comforting energy of his music and his presence. At his last Summerfest gig a sign celebrating a dearly departed friend earned a shoutout and an autograph from the performers – and at this latest show during the penultimate song ""Broken Halos"" a fan in the crowd passed what appeared to be either a prayer card or photo of someone dear up to Morgane Stapleton on stage who spent most of the song holding the remembrance close to her heart and up in the air. It was already a special night for Stapleton fans in attendance – but especially for that fan with that final grace note.

7. ""Outlaw State of Mind""

Listen I understand that the mandated encore rigmarole is annoying in this modern time and that after about two hours taking the stage a little after 9 p.m. it was a late night with an early Packers game the next day. But I was stupefied by the not-insignificant amount of folks leaving before – and even during – the encore. Sure Stapleton pretty much always saves ""Outlaw State of Mind"" for last so there's not much surprise to the finale – but even if you've seen Stapleton several times and know some of the routines the song still serves as a perfect closer a satisfying rolling thunderstorm of a hit that ends each show with an awesome jam session and a final roaring note echoing into the night.

8. Outstanding openers

Obviously Stapleton was the main event but those who arrived closer to the time on the ticket got a bonus excellent show thanks to the two great opening acts. Morgan Wade warmed up the responsive Fiserv Forum crowd with a short collection of high-quality raw country rollicks followed by Elle King who's a headliner in her own right at this point. Blasting out a barrage of giddily rowdy hits – including her breakout smash ""Ex's & Oh's"" and ""Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)"" – in between casual vapes calling an old unsupportive teacher a b*tch re-litigating her famous lineage and proclaiming her love for the crowd with a sweet-tart kick. Between their two efforts the night was already off to an outstanding start before it seemingly began.

In late July a large sinkhole appeared near the town of Tierra Amarilla in Chile’s Copiapó province in the Atacama salt flat. The crater which has a diameter of more than 100 feet emerged in one of Chile’s most lucrativeregions for copper and lithium extraction. The nearby Candelaria mining complex—80 percent of the property is owned by Canada’s Lundin Mining Corporation and 20 percent is owned by Japan’s Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd. and Sumitomo Corporation—had to halt its operations in the area. On August 1 Chile’s National Geology and Mining Service (Sernageomin) tweeted that it had assembled a team to investigate the sinkhole that appeared less than 2000 feet away from human habitation. The mayor of Tierra Amarilla Cristóbal Zúñiga questioned why the earth had given way near the Alcaparrosa mine and whether the appearance of the hole had something to do with the mining operations. “Today it happened on an agricultural property” the mayor told Ciudadano ADN radio “but our greatest fear is that this could happen in a populated place on a street in a school and protecting the integrity of our inhabitants is our greatest concern at the moment.”

By Vijay Prashad and Taroa Zúñiga Silva

Government officials traveled to Tierra Amarilla to investigate the sinkhole. On August 12 Marcela Hernando the minister of mining joined Cristóbal Zúñiga and others to tour the Alcaparrosa mine. Before the visit Zúñiga called for the authorities to apply “maximum sanctions” to punish those responsible for the sinkhole which seems to have been caused by underground mining activities carried out by the Candelaria mining complex. The government agency responsible for the investigation—Sernageomin—has suspended all mining activity in the area and is continuing with its forensic assessment to ascertain the reasons behind the earth collapsing near the mining complex.

Moratorium on Mining

“We should not be speaking of any kind of extraction in the Atacama salt flat” Ramón Morales Balcázar told us a few days after the sinkhole was discovered. Morales Balcázar is the founder of Fundación Tantí a nongovernmental organization in San Pedro de Atacama that is dedicated to the promotion of agroecology and socio-environmental sustainability. “The Atacama salt flat is exhausted [and has been] deeply impacted by copper and lithium mining and tourism. We should be working to restore the ecosystem there” said Morales Balcázar. The word “exhausted” is also the title of a new report coauthored by Morales Balcázar that offers a chilling portrait of the depletion of groundwater as a result of global lithium extractors. “Lithium extraction the newest industry to the region [of the Atacama salt flat] is now yet another way the scarce water resources are being depleted” stated the report.

Morales Balcázar is part of a team of researchers known as the Plurinational Observatory of Andean Salt Flats (OPSAL). These scholars are engaged in fine-grained research about what they see as the ecocide of the salt flat which stretches across Argentina Bolivia and Chile. A book written by these scholars in 2021—Andean Salt Flats: An Ecology of Knowledge for the Protection of Our Salt Flats and Wetlands—offers a detailed assessment of what they call “green extractivism” and “green growth.” Extractivism refers to the extraction of natural resources from the earth to make profits without any consideration for the earth being mined or for the people who live in the areas being mined. “Extraction and extractivism are not the same” said Morales Balcázar. The former is the mere removal of natural resources which can be done sustainably without harming the earth and is carried out for the social well-being of the people who live near the mines.

“We have been holding conversations with Indigenous institutions and trade unions to imagine different regimes of extraction” Morales Balcázar told us. When the workers at Albemarle—a U.S. mining company—went on strike in 2021 Morales Balcázar and other colleagues spoke with them about the possibility of thinking about new kinds of extraction techniques although “it is really not something we can see in the near future” said Morales Balcázar. One reason why miners at Albemarle and the Indigenous institutions (such as the Consejo de Pueblos Atacameños) cannot conceive of any alternative is that even if they get trinkets from the mining wealth that is still seen as a better option than facing unemployment.



Bolivia’s Alternative

North of Chile in Bolivia the concept of “resource nationalism” has framed the debate around lithium extraction in the country. In 1992 the government of then-Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora signed an agreement with the U.S.-based company Lithium Corporation of America now known as FMC Corporation which “allowed the company to take all the lithium it could giving Bolivia only eight percent of the profits. Many Bolivians were outraged over the deal” according to a 2010 article in the New Yorker. This led to protests by the Potosí Civic Committee which eventually ended the contract.

When Evo Morales took over as president of Bolivia in 2006 the residue of this battle shaped his “resource nationalism” approach to lithium and other minerals. “He vowed to ‘industrialize with dignity and sovereignty’ promising that raw lithium would not be exploited by foreign corporations but instead processed by state-controlled entities in Bolivia and transformed into batteries” noted a 2018 article in Bloomberg. In 2007 Bolivia developed a lithium industrialization policy. The Mining Corporation of Bolivia (Comibol) we learned from officials there at the time encouraged Bolivian scientists to develop and patent traditional methods of extraction through evaporation (although this method has struggled due to the high levels of magnesium found in the Bolivian lithium). Morales’ government invested heavily in the lithium industrialization scheme which led to Bolivia being able to develop its own batteries (including cathode production) and develop its own electric car through the state-owned Quantum Motors. To control and manage lithium production a company called Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos(YLB) was created in 2017 by the government.

“We were making great progress” Evo Morales told us “until the coup of 2019 and then the pandemic.” The coup eventually led to his ouster. “We will coup whoever we want” wrote Elon Musk whose company Tesla relies on lithium for its batteries and electric cars. Such is the anger against the possibilities of “resource nationalism.”

Developments in Bolivia show that new ways of extraction are being explored even if these are not perfect. Environmental challenges in the Salar de Uyuni the world’s largest salt flat and grumbles by people who live there continue to define lithium extraction. However the lithium industrialization policy and the great care taken by the country for what the Bolivians call Pachamama—the earth—during the extraction process offer some differences from the extraction work done by the large Canadian and U.S. mining companies. In Chile Lester Calderón a union leader in the city of Antofagasta who ran for governor in 2021 wrote an article in January 2022 in which he argued that the Indigenous communities must decide about the way lithium is used and that the resources (including water) of Chile must be nationalized. These elements are in place in Bolivia and yet there are challenges ahead for the people there.

Bolivia’s current President Luis Alberto Arce Catacora hopes to renew the state-led lithium industrialization policy but cannot find the resources domestically to do so. That is the reason why his government has embarked on a process of drawing in investment from outside (currently six firms from China Russia and the United States are still competing to secure the bid).

The center of the struggle in Bolivia is Potosí where the Spaniards who ruled the region had for centuries hollowed out the earth to draw silver to export to Europe. “We were the center of [silver] exploitation but remained at the fringes of the country’s decision-making” Potosí government official Juan Tellez told Reuters. “That is what we are trying to avoid now with lithium.” The people of Potosí like the people of Tierra Amarilla in Chile want to imagine a different kind of extraction: one that is controlled by those who live by the sources of the metal and one that does not destroy the earth creating sinkholes everywhere.

Speaking on CNBC Friday morning Greenblatt praised Henry Ford of the Ford Motor Company perhaps the most infamous American Jew hater and someone Greenblatt has previously criticized.

Greenblatt favorably compared Ford to the billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk head of the Tesla electric vehicle company.

“Elon Musk is an amazing entrepreneur an extraordinary innovator. He’s the Henry Ford of our time” Greenblatt said about the prospect of Musk taking over the social media platform Twitter.

“He’s taken on big huge complex tasks that no one thought could be solved like rocketry or mobility or solar” Greenblatt said about Musk. “And to think what he can do with the public square. I mean I’d certainly have some qualms about just a handful of companies controlling so much of the public debate but I’m hopeful the regulators will give this a chance.”

It was a jarring analogy. The ADL has outlined how Ford an automotive pioneer was one of the lead purveyors of virulent antisemitism in the US in the early 20th century. The ADL has also analyzed whether Ford profited from Nazi slave labor and in 2020 Greenblatt called on then-US president Donald Trump to apologize for praising Ford.

It was also a 180 for Greenblatt and the ADL on Musk’s intended Twitter acquisition. In April when Musk revealed his intention to buy the platform the ADL posted an analysis titled “Elon Musk Plans to Buy Twitter. Right-wing Extremists Rejoice.”

Greenblatt promoted the piece on Twitter saying it was a “key perspective to pay attention to.” There has been widespread apprehension among Jewish leaders at the prospect of Musk who has derided curtailing hate speech controlling Twitter.

After backlash Greenblatt said he might have made a more apt comparison.

“Admittedly the Henry Ford reference was wrong even though he was an innovator in the automobile industry. I certainly was not trying to praise Ford and didn’t intend to minimize his contemptible antisemitism in any way” he said in a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

But he added that he stood by his praise for Musk in fields outside social media and said Musk’s success in his previous ventures meant he could set high expectations for Musk’s Twitter ownership.

“While I clearly could have been much clearer I was laying down a gauntlet about what we expect Elon Musk to do” Greenblatt said. “As I have been saying for months we have serious concerns around how Musk will handle hate and harassment on the platform. As I’ve stated publicly repeatedly we want to be cautiously optimistic about how Musk will run the platform because he successfully has innovated other industries and tackled incredibly complex problems.”

“I would implore him to apply an equal level of effort and resources not just to optimizing the business model but to turning around the toxicity so rampant on Twitter and improving public discourse as a result” Greenblatt said.

Musk is on the hook to complete his purchase of Twitter by October 28 to avoid a trial over his past effort to back out of the deal.

""Chip"" Waikem Jr.

Special to the Canton Repository

A good friend once asked me what it was like to see my family name on the back of so many cars in Stark County.

It was pretty cool. But starting next year the Waikem name will appear on fewer and fewer cars. Eventually it will disappear. It’s a bittersweet time for our family and it might be helpful to other family businesses to know how we came to this point.

When I was 19 years old my father summoned me to his cramped office and asked one question: “What do you want to do with your life?”

I told him I wanted to sell cars like him.

He turned to the man across the desk and said “Well Terry there’s your answer.” Terry Blosser had wanted to buy the dealership but he now knew a second Waikem generation would someday take charge. My future was cast in Ford Blue.

Only 13% of all family businesses ever get to the third generation. Less than 3% ever make it to the fourth. Now I know why. Finances are rarely the reason successful family businesses sell. But it’s extremely rare for succeeding generations to share the same passions.

More guest commentary:Do not stand idle while your neighbor bleeds

'I ... fell in love with the art of selling cars.'

My father started Waikem Motors because he loved to wheel-and-deal and hated the idea of working in a factory. Those were pretty much the only options available to anyone in his generation with immigrant parents and no education.

I on the other hand fell in love with the art of selling cars. I loved everything about it from the time I started sweeping the floors at age 13. I met my wife Cindy there and while dating we often spent Sundays washing cars on the lot.

It wasn’t romantic but I’ve closed tens of thousands of deals in my lifetime and Cindy remains my best.

My brothers had their own reasons for joining the family business and for almost half a century we worked together to put the Waikem name on one out of every four cars sold in Stark County. Years ago we tried to buy a dealership in Irvine Texas but were beaten to the punch by a GM employee.

We then focused all our attention on a strip of land between Canton and Massillon where we knew everyone and everyone knew us.

Waikem Motors grew to 14 brands and more than 300 workers.

Waikem Motors grew to represent as many as 14 automotive brands with over 300 employees. Almost all were great people though one salesman robbed a Harter Bank branch on his dinner break then treated himself to a celebratory steak dinner at the Imperial House restaurant. He saw his face on local TV at the same time as two highway patrolmen dining across the room.

I doubt they were any more surprised than we were upon learning why he never came back from his break. I have enough stories like this to last three generations.

There have been ups and downs through the years. I remember the banks arguing with my father until he threw the keys to the dealership across the desk and told them to take it. They didn’t and we worked our way out of a jam to become Stark County’s largest automotive company.

The last three years have been our most successful ever. But the business was changing in ways that drained the passion from a family already growing unwieldy.

Once upon a time I knew every manufacturer’s dealer representative and they knew me. We formed relationships over years of working together. Now they come and go so fast I can’t even tell you who I’d call in a pinch.

Manufacturers themselves are changing their dealer relationships. Owning a dealership used to mean you represented all their automotive products. Now some manufacturers are talking about splitting their dealerships with one group selling electric vehicles while another sells conventional.

The future will compete with the past.

As a family we agreed it was time to sell.

At the same time my brothers and the next generation were developing their own special passions. Younger brother David loves fishing so much he almost breathes water and has already opened two successful Fisherman’s Central stores.

Everyone else’s hearts were starting to wander. As a family we agreed it was time to sell and although I love my brothers dearly I can honestly say it was a rare moment of total agreement.

A dealership broker found another family operation whose passion for the car business remained strong. The Diehl’s are sharp honest and good people. Soon their name will supplant the Waikem name on the backs of cars throughout Stark County.

I wish them well.

My father was a street-smart man who loved life and business. I learned many lessons from him the most important being to thank people who did you a service.

Thank you Stark County. For years we sold automotive dreams but thousands of customers made our family’s dreams come true.

We leave the car business in debt to only one group. You.

Clark established a solid copper mining operation at the United Verde Mine with smelters onsite at Jerome and later Clarkdale.

Mining accelerated in the Verde Mining District as the area also attracted other mining ventures including the development of the United Verde Extension Mine (UVX) which began with George W. Hull who organized the United Verde Extension Mining Co. in 1894.

Hull a resident of Jerome since 1883 sought to capitalize on possible extensions of the United Verde ore body adjacent to the United Verde Copper Mine holdings. He purchased claims west south and east of Clark’s property through the financial support of Louis Whicher a New York broker. One of these included the Little Daisy Claim east of the United Verde Mine patented in 1901. The mine was located below the “Big Hole” or United Verde Mine.

The United Verde Extension Gold Silver and Copper Mining Co. was subsequently formed followed by a decade of exploration costing $500000 that revealed weakly mineralized host rocks and small ore pockets. By 1912 after an investment of $500000 only a few streaks of ore were discovered and mining operations suspended.

Major Andrew Jackson Pickrell one of the property’s investors convinced James S. Douglas (known as Rawhide Jimmy) son of Dr. James Douglas (Phelps Dodge Co.) along with George E. Tener of Pittsburgh to invest in the Little Daisy Claim. With $300000 capital development resumed.

The UVX a separate distinct deposit that originally was thought to have been the faulted-off apex of the larger United Verde deposit was discovered in 1914. Geologists later determined that it was a separate volcanogenic ore body. By 1916 15% copper ore was struck at the 1400-foot level. Preparations were made to exploit the deposit and in 1918 a smelter was built one mile south of Cottonwood at Verde later christened Clemenceau to process ore at the U.V.X.

The UVX Mine while only one-tenth the size of the United Verde Mine continued to produce until the ore body was exhausted in 1938. Declining ore production necessitated the closure of the Clemenceau smelter the year prior. The U.V.X. production of high grade copper ore accounted for over 20% of the total copper production in the Verde Mining District. James Douglas amassed $42 million in dividends at the culmination of the venture.

Another mining venture not as successful was undertaken by the Haynes Copper Co. in 1907 involving the Haynes massive sulfide deposit half a mile northwest of the United Verde Mine. This deposit separated by gabbro an igneous rock formed by slow cooling magma was originally part of the United Verde ore body. Beginning with a three-compartment shaft sunk to 1200 feet including numerous drifts and cross-cuts along with other exploration attempts involving diamond drilling at the 3700 foot level by the 1930s produced no significant ore.

During Clark’s 47-year ownership of the United Verde Mine production included over 20 million tons of ore mined with a recovery of over 2 billion pounds of copper 900000 ounces of gold and 33 million ounces of silver. Dividends included $102 million of which Clark and his heirs owned 95% of shares. Phelps Dodge Corp. acquired the United Verde Mine from William Clark’s heirs in 1935. Decline in open pit operations followed due to reduced ore values. Open Pit mining ceased in 1940 after 41.8 million tons of material was extracted. Underground mining replaced open pit mining until operations ended at Jerome on March 23 1953. The United Verde Mine produced over two- and three-quarter billion pounds of copper coupled with gold and silver production valued at $475 million. The UVX Mine is credited with over three-quarters of a billion pounds of copper with gold and silver production at $125 million.

Small scale mining operations continued in the area through the early 1990s. From 1954 to 1975 the Big Hole Mining Co. leased the Big Pit at the United Verde Mine from Phelps Dodge extracting 206777 tons of ore from small copper veins. Shipment was trucked to Clarkdale then by rail for processing at the Douglas smelter. Recovery figures included 25.3 million pounds of copper nearly 2900 ounces of gold and 200000 ounces of silver.

Additional mining occurred at the UVX involving underground exploration and development conducted by the A.F. Budge Mining Ltd. from 1989 to 1992. Recovery from 76000 tons of ore including gold-bearing siliceous flux amounted to 21000 ounces of gold and 174000 ounces of silver.

At 50 tons per day a silica-rich flux containing 0.1 to 0.25 oz. Au/ton was delivered by truck to railhead at Clarkdale for shipment to the Phelps Dodge's Hidalgo smelter in New Mexico. This operation was terminated in late 1992 after recovering approximately 21000 ounces of gold and 174000 ounces of silver from about 76000 tons of ore.

Today Jerome’s economy is based upon tourism capitalizing on its mining history and the town’s unique geological topography which may again see resurgence in mining should the discovery of another mineral deposit prove profitable.

(Gray News) - A Kentucky man found out he had a $1 million winning Powerball ticket months after finally checking his numbers.

According to the Kentucky Lottery the man who wanted to remain anonymous had a stack of tickets dating back to June when he sat down recently to go through them.

“I had gone through about 40 tickets to see if I had any winners. I was looking at the numbers on my phone when I saw the same numbers I’ve been playing come up. I kept looking at the ticket making sure it was correct” he told lottery officials. “I leaned back on my couch and started yelling for my family to come to check it out.”

The lucky jackpot winner said he has been picking the same numbers for years consisting of a combination of family birthdays and only checks his tickets occasionally.

Kentucky Lottery officials said the man’s ticket was sold at a Crossroads IGA neighborhood market in Lexington. It matched the first five white ball numbers to win the game’s second prize on Aug. 31.

“They [his family] checked Google to see how much you win for matching the five white ball winning numbers without the Powerball. They told me we had just won a million dollars. I kept asking myself am I dreaming?” the man shared.

He said he still had to go to work the following day but admitted having difficulty sleeping before knowing he would be coming to lottery headquarters to claim his prize.

Lottery officials said once he got to work he took time to watch the Aug. 31 drawing to make sure that those were the winning numbers and sure enough they were.

The Kentucky Lottery said the man received a check for $710000 after taxes and he told them that his family might consider buying a new home.

Compared with all the others still flying in the world it’s a true junior having been born just 16 years ago. Yet in the fast-evolving world of today it’s already in need of some upgrades.

The F-35 is currently flying in the skies of the world in three variants and they’re even younger than 16 years as 2006 is the year of the platform’s first flight. The U.S. Marine Corps got its version first (the F-35B in 2015) then the U.S. Air Force (F-35A in 2016) and finally the U.S. Navy (F-35C in 2019). In between countless allied nations started deploying their own versions.The current-spec F-35 is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney afterburning turbofan engine which generates about 43000 pounds of thrust (F-35A). The engine is potent enough to push the plane to a top speed of Mach 1.6 (1228 mph/1976 kph).Depending on configuration loadout and a lot of other factors fuel consumption for the plane varies greatly but according to some could reach as much as 5600 liters (1481 gallons) per hour.That being said America’s top military brass decided there was need for a new F-35 engine to be developed. One that could be more powerful last for longer and above all provide better fuel economy.Enter the XA100 Adaptive Cycle Engine a piece of technology in the process of being made in the labs of General Electric (GE). It’s a piece of hardware described as capable of giving the F-35 revolutionary capabilities (next-gen combat propulsion they say) and more importantly it’ll probably make its way into the world’s first sixth-generation fighter aircraft the so far-called Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD).Meant for the F-35A and F-35C and capable of fitting them without structural modifications the engine was first fired up in December 2020 as the “world’s first flight-weight three-stream adaptive cycle engine."" Most recently (to the time of writing) the second prototype completed testing procedures inside the Air Force’s Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) reaching “the final major contract milestone” in the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) under which it is being developed.What adaptive cycle means in this case is that the engine can work in either high-thrust mode providing the pilot with the maximum amount of power when they need it the most or in high-efficiency mode when full power is not needed and fuel savings can be reached.Speaking of full power in the case of the XA100 tests have shown it could be 10 percent more powerful than current engines reaching 45000 lbf. The difference may not seem all that great on paper but it’ll probably make all the difference in the world during dangerous missions as it also translates into 20 percent more acceleration.When choosing to save fuel the engine should be 25 percent more fuel efficient and that’s a big gain regardless how you look at it. It means the F-35 could need 1400 liters (370 gallons) less each hour if we take the estimates made above as a reference point.Saving fuel also translates into an increased range which in this case is 30 percent more (F-35A with the current engine can cover 1350 miles/2172 km with internal fuel) but also twice as effective thermal management as the hardware comes with an extra source of cooled air but also with 3D-printed heat exchangers. All in all the engine can withstand 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius) more heat than the current design.More importantly the XA100 has been designed in such a way that if the American military ever decides to feed its planes biofuels it could run on those just as well.At the time of writing the XA100 adaptive cycle engine for the F-35 is still in testing stages. GE is now getting ready to transition to an engineering and manufacturing stage but more prototypes will still have to be made and tested.Estimates are the first one should take its rightful place inside an aircraft and be flown by the end of the decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2RlZmVuY2Utcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtaW4tdGFsa3Mtd2l0aC1kcmRvLXRvLXJldi11cC1hbWNhLWVuZ2luZXMtMjcwNDM1NS_SAXVodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9kZWZlbmNlLXJvbGxzLXJveWNlLWluLXRhbGtzLXdpdGgtZHJkby10by1yZXYtdXAtYW1jYS1lbmdpbmVzLTI3MDQzNTUvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rolls Royce in talks with DRDO to rev up AMCA engines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.financialexpress.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) AbramsX technology demonstrator will be unveiled during the AUSA 2022 Association of United States Army defense exhibition that will take place in Washington D.C. from 10 to 12 October 2022. With the AbramsX GDLS demonstrated its ability to develop a new generation of Main Battle Tank offering more firepower protection and mobility able to counter all the new threats of the modern battlefield.

As the next generation of Main Battle Tank the AbramsX technology demonstrator features reduced weight for improved mobility and transportability delivering the same tactical range as the M1A2 Abrams with 50% less fuel consumption.

The AbramsX's hybrid power pack supports the U.S. Army's climate and electrification strategies enhances silent watch capability and even allows for some silent mobility. With a reduced crew size and AI-enabled lethality survivability mobility manned/unmanned teaming (MUM-T) and autonomous capabilities AbramsX can be a key node in lethal battlefield networks and serve as a bridge from Abrams SEPv3 and SEPv4 to future tank.

The AbramsX is completely based on a new design compared to the M1A2 Abrams tank family. In terms of protection the AbramsX is fitted with a new armor package mounted on the hull and the turret. The tank also integrates an APS (Active Protection System) able to intercept anti-tank guided missiles and other current projectiles by launching a small warhead and initiating it at a safe distance from the protected platform at a precisely calculated moment and defeating or destructing the threat through a shock-wave effect.

The firepower of the AbramsX is also strengthened using a new generation of 120mm main gun able to fire new ammunition MRM (Mid-Range Munitions) AMP (Advanced Multi-Purpose) and AKE (Advanced Kinetic Energy). A coaxial machine gun is mounted on the right of the main armament and a remotely operated weapon station is mounted on the turret roof which is armed with one 30mm automatic cannon and one machine gun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiaWEuY29tL25ld3MvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWxhYm9yLWNyaXNpcy10aGluay1kaWZmZXJlbnRseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Can Manufacturing Solve the Labor Crisis?

According to Soap Opera Digest Alley Mills who has been with The Bold and the Beautiful for 15 years has left the show for General Hospital. At this time little is known about Mills' role on GH as the producers are keeping a tight lip on any specifics.

Mills 71 has been a working actress for nearly six decades. Throughout her career she's appeared in a wide range of TV shows such as The Waltons; Hill Street Blues; Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman; and Yes Dear. She is most well-known as Arnold family matriarch Norma in the original Wonder Years series but since 2006 she has portrayed Pamela ""Pam"" Douglas in The Bold and the Beautiful. Currently Mills does not appear to have commented on the casting news.

Back in 2018 Mills sat down with Soap Opera Digest to discuss her time on The Bold and the Beautiful and share some of her most cherished moments and memories. When asked her favorite storyline up to that point Mills revealed ""Probably going to the cabin to try and kill Donna by tying her in the chair and pouring honey all over her and letting the grizzly bear in. It doesn't really get any better than that. That whole storyline had great moments like the scene of me popping the tea bag in my mouth in order to freak her out. If you don't remember Pam was telling her how serious she was as a formidable stalker as if trapping her in the tanning booth and putting green in her hair and gray on her teeth wasn't enough right?""

She went on to say ""I love working with Jennifer Gareis [Donna] and I'm so happy with how that relationship has evolved since those days. Even when she was just coming back for the family weddings and holidays the writers always tried to give Pam and Donna a little bit of business even if it was just handing her a tissue because Donna always cries at weddings.""

Mills also confessed who her favorite scene partner is admitting ""Oh my favorite person would be Susan [Flannery ex-Stephanie]. I love her and I miss her so much. She could always make me laugh. I remember when Pam got her modest apartment Susan said something like 'Where the f— are you living? This is ridiculous. She should live in the Taj Mahal. She inherited all of Ann's money so I'm sure she's richer than Eric. She's a Douglas; that was the money that started Forrester Creations. Where are the oil paintings from Dad? Where are the Tiffany plates?' I couldn't stop laughing.""

Unless you’ve buried your head in the sand for years you’ll already know that the world needs to embrace electric cars to help release us from the reliance on oil and for the environment.

You may also have been wondering why everyone isn’t already using these cars powered by pure electricity.

Of course they have a number of sigma associated with them. For example people may think they still can only travel for an extremely limited distance before needing a charge or they may have concerns about electric car safety.

But all of this doesn’t explain why these cars are not already far more popular. To answer this conundrum you need to understand the history of electric cars.

The Unfortunate History

The real history started in the early 1800’s where inventor Robert Anderson made a carriage with an electric motor powering the wheels instead of a horse.

But I’m not going to concentrate on these very early years. Not to diminish the achievements of these inventors but these early days consisted of one off inventions which didn’t make it into mass production.

They did become popular in the early 1900’s but even that was short lived when gasoline cars became reliable and petrol prices dropped.

What I will focus on is the history of the (almost) mass produced electric vehicle the EV1.

The General Motors EV1

The first true attempt at investigating the possibility of mass producing an electric car was made by General Motors with their EV1 model.

It was originally shown in 1990 at the Auto Show in Los Angeles. At this stage it was only a concept car which they named the ‘Impact’.

After the show there was a huge amount of interest from the automobile media yet it took six years for this car to be transformed from a concept to a reality.

In 1996 the EV1 was made available in a small number of car dealerships. As the car was so new and expensive it wasn’t available to buy but was only available as a leased car.

This is where it gets quite controversial.

On one side it seemed like people were ready to commit to the EV1 even with the early limited drive range (due to the old acid based batteries). Even celebrities such as Tom Hanks sang the praises of the EV1.

On the other side many people complained that GM wasn’t doing enough to promote the EV1 spending relatively low amounts on advertising.

They did release a new model in 1999 that among various other improvements used the new nickel hydride batteries extending the drive distance to approximately 100 to 140 miles before needing a charge.

With the new model more and more drivers wanted to lease the EV1 and its future was looking good until an announcement from GM in 2003 stating that there wasn’t enough demand for the EV1 car to make it profitable and that they would be taking all the EV1 cars back from the lease holders without the option of buying them.

The recall alone shocked many EV1 drivers but not giving them the option to purchase it drove many to outrage with a number of public demonstrations by EV1 drivers.

There was even a mock funeral held by a number of celebrity EV1 drivers where they mourned the death of the electric car.

Now whether GM killed off their EV1 car on purpose or whether it really wasn’t profitable I really do not know but I do believe this car had great potential which was cut short before its time.

A good documentary to learn more about the unfortunate history of electric cars is called Who Killed the Electric Car.

The Hopeful Future

You may have been thoroughly depressed after reading the unfortunate history of these cars. But don’t give up the future of electric vehicles is bright indeed!

GM may have wished they stuck with the EV1 because more and more people now want green cars these days.

Fortunately a number of car manufactures have now taken the plunge and are finally mass producing electric cars.

The Chevrolet Volt

Now really the Volt isn’t a pure electric vehicle as it’s a hybrid. But the reason why I’m including it in this post is because drivers can run it in the pure electric mode until the batteries run out where it switches to the traditional gasoline hybrid engine.

Ironically Chevrolet is a division of GM which shows at least they really are trying a green car.

The pure electric mode range is quite low in my humble opinion which is around 25 to 50 miles but at least this should be enough for most work commuting.

The Toyota Prius Plug-in

Another step in the right direction is the Prius Plug-in by Toyota. The Prius has been an immensely popular hybrid car for many years now.

The Plug-in takes the hybrid a step further by offering a pure electric drive mode. Similar to the Volt it will switch over to a hybrid gasoline mode when the batteries run low.

When I say pure electric mode that’s not entirely accurate as their website states that even while in the dedicated electric mode it still needs gas in the tank to operate. This leaves me quite confused but I assume the gas usage will be extremely low while in the dedicated electric mode.

Again it has a quite low range in the dedicated electric mode of around 11 miles. This should be fine though for short commuting trips or shopping trips.

Overall I think the Plug-in is a good move forward.

The Tesla Model S

This is where the fun really starts though.

Tesla Motors headed by Elon Musk (who was the co-founder of PayPal) has pushed the boundaries of electric cars on so many levels. Unlike most other car manufacturers Tesla cars are pure electric no combustion engine no gas tank etc.

Their first electric car was the Roadster which is a high performance sport car outperforming many traditional sports cars. I’d personally love to own a Roadster but due to its price this car is out of my budget and I believe it was meant to be more of a statement of what you can achieve with these types of cars than an attempt to sell huge numbers.

Their second model is known as the Model S which is a family sedan which I believe has the potential to sell in healthy numbers.

With the top end battery (costing a painful $20000 USD extra) the Model S has an amazing 300 mile range before needing a charge. The standard battery still has a good range of 160 miles for those who don’t want to spend the extra on the battery upgrade.

This alone makes it very appealing to me but it’s the acceleration which also impresses me with it doing 0 to 60 in only 5.6 seconds close to some sports cars.

They’re listing the price at $57400 which isn’t cheap but with the tax incentives some countries such as the US are giving for these types of cars it could be a great commercial success.

They’re even making an SUV (the Model X) which has similar range and performance but this won’t be in production until 2014 I believe.

I personally think if their Model S is a financial success they’ll be able to make a truly affordable family car with their next model. If and when this happens I believe the age of the electric green cars will finally be upon us.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdXRvL2VsZWN0cmljLWNhcnMvMjAyNC1ob25kYS1wcm9sb2d1ZS1lbGVjdHJpYy1zdXYtcmV2ZWFsZWQtY28tZGV2ZWxvcGVkLXdpdGgtZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTQ3MTc5OTguY21z0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2F1dG8vZWxlY3RyaWMtY2Fycy8yMDI0LWhvbmRhLXByb2xvZ3VlLWVsZWN0cmljLXN1di1yZXZlYWxlZC1jby1kZXZlbG9wZWQtd2l0aC1nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTQ3MTc5OTguY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024 Honda Prologue electric SUV revealed: Co-developed with General Motors,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='timesofindia.indiatimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /auto/electric-cars/2024-honda-prologue-electric-suv-revealed-co-developed-with-general-motors/articleshow/94717998.cms (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC83857B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdXRvL2VsZWN0cmljLWNhcnMvMjAyNC1ob25kYS1wcm9sb2d1ZS1lbGVjdHJpYy1zdXYtcmV2ZWFsZWQtY28tZGV2ZWxvcGVkLXdpdGgtZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTQ3MTc5OTguY21z0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2F1dG8vZWxlY3RyaWMtY2Fycy8yMDI0LWhvbmRhLXByb2xvZ3VlLWVsZWN0cmljLXN1di1yZXZlYWxlZC1jby1kZXZlbG9wZWQtd2l0aC1nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTQ3MTc5OTguY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8xMC9nbS1maW5hbmNpYWwtdG8tcGF5LTMtNW0taW4tbGVhc2UtdGVybWluYXRpb24tYW5kLXJlcG8tdmlvbGF0aW9ucy_SAWtodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMTAvZ20tZmluYW5jaWFsLXRvLXBheS0zLTVtLWluLWxlYXNlLXRlcm1pbmF0aW9uLWFuZC1yZXBvLXZpb2xhdGlvbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Financial To Pay $3.5M In Lease Termination And Repo Violations,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8xMC9nbS1maW5hbmNpYWwtdG8tcGF5LTMtNW0taW4tbGVhc2UtdGVybWluYXRpb24tYW5kLXJlcG8tdmlvbGF0aW9ucy_SAWtodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMTAvZ20tZmluYW5jaWFsLXRvLXBheS0zLTVtLWluLWxlYXNlLXRlcm1pbmF0aW9uLWFuZC1yZXBvLXZpb2xhdGlvbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8386B90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8xMC9nbS1maW5hbmNpYWwtdG8tcGF5LTMtNW0taW4tbGVhc2UtdGVybWluYXRpb24tYW5kLXJlcG8tdmlvbGF0aW9ucy_SAWtodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMTAvZ20tZmluYW5jaWFsLXRvLXBheS0zLTVtLWluLWxlYXNlLXRlcm1pbmF0aW9uLWFuZC1yZXBvLXZpb2xhdGlvbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Hackett who lives in Hartford has run the marathon and the half-marathon for many years. He was third in the marathon in 2019 fourth in 2020.

He never got to break the finish line tape — until Saturday.

Hackett who took the lead with less than a mile to go won the 26.2-mile race in 2:24:37 beating runner-up Ruben Sanca of Salisbury Mass. who led most of the race by less than a minute. Eric Ashe of Natick Mass. finished third (2:26:22).

“It’s awesome” said Hackett 32 who is a teaching assistant and an assistant track and cross country coach at Hall High School in West Hartford. “I’ve been wanting to win this race since I started running it probably five-six years ago.

“I’m happy to finally win it. I wanted a faster time for sure but the win is great.”

Hackett who grew up in West Hartford is the first winner of the race from Hartford.

Alexandra Niles of Montclair N.J. breaks the tape to win the women’s division of the Eversource Hartford Marathon in 2:43:24 Saturday. STEPHEN DUNN|Special to the Courant

Alexandra Niles of Montclair N.J. a former college gymnast who picked up running 15 years ago won the women’s race in 2:43:24. Jenna Gigliotti of Amherst Mass. was second (2:49:20) and Val Curtis of Niceville Fla. third (2:52:02).

“I didn’t even think I would run a marathon” said Niles who ran marathon No. 15 Saturday of her start in the sport. “I did not think I’d be fast. I’ll run 5Ks for fun and meet people. That was my plan.”

Niles 39 qualified for the Olympic trials in 2020 and hopes to do so again.

“I was trying to break 2:40” she said. “I was solid through the half. Around 20-22 I started cramping. I was like ‘OK can I just keep going enough to hold onto first place?'”

Runners set out at the start of the Eversource Hartford Marathon on Saturday morning. There were 1088 finishers in the marathon 2898 in the half-marathon and 1557 in the 5K. STEPHEN DUNN|Special to the Courant

There were 1558 finishers in the 5K 2898 in the half-marathon and 1171 in the marathon Saturday. Ben Decker a graduate student at Yale won the half-marathon in 1:05:27 and Annmarie Tuxbury of Newport R.I. won the women’s half in 1:12:40. Angelia Rafter a graduate student at Central Connecticut who lives in Glastonbury broke the women’s 5K record from 2003 winning in 16:15 and John Amenta of Fishkill N.Y. won the overall 5K in 15:04.

“The goal was to get the course record” said Rafter 23. “Alex [Norstrom who won the marathon last year] my boyfriend said ‘Take out the first mile it’ll hurt the second mile and then just cruise the last mile. I just did exactly that.”

At about the 3-hour mark of the races an unidentified male runner collapsed in front of the finish line of the half-marathon and medical personnel began to perform CPR on him. The runner was brought into the medical tent and then taken to Hartford Hospital. According to a race spokesperson the hospital reported that the runner was in good condition and his vital signs were stable and within normal limits.

Hackett was surprised by his win. His training cycle hadn’t gone all that great and he wasn’t sure how he would fare Saturday.

But he found himself in the lead pack early then watched as Sanca broke away around Mile 5. Hackett Ashe and Joe Darda of Chaplin who finished fourth ran together until about Mile 15 when Hackett began to accelerate.

“After the out and back I started to reel [Sanca] in really slowly” Hackett said. “I honestly did not think I was going to get him. Mile 25 I was pushing like ‘Finish hard.'”

Hackett passed Sanca midway through the 25th mile.

“I was running scared from that point” Hackett said. “He’s a great runner. He crushed a 10K a couple weeks ago; he beat me by like a minute and a half.”

Ashe thought about trying to make a move but a stomach cramp slowed him down at Mile 25.

“Me and Joe were together until 22-23” Ashe said. “I was watching Everett catch Ruben and I thought maybe I could potentially catch them because they weren’t too far away but the stomach cramp did me in.”

Sanca said he had been battling an illness earlier in the week.

“I just couldn’t hold it in the end” he said. “I got sick earlier in the week and I’ve been trying to recover.”

Hackett who ran at Hall High has qualified for the Olympic marathon trials twice but said Saturday’s race was a bigger accomplishment even though he’s run much faster on the course.

He was heading out after the race to Rhode Island where the Hall cross country boys’ team one of the top teams in the state was competing in an invitational meet.

Dr. Scott Selph emergency services director for HCA hospitals in West Florida said the most common type of injury is orthopedic typically related to people attempting tasks better left to professionals.

“The number one injury we’re seeing are orthopedic injuries from cleaning debris whether it’s to clean up your yard or using a ladder to get on the roof” said Selph who oversees emergency services for Hospital Corporation of America in Pinellas Sarasota Manatee and Charlotte counties. “For the big jobs like tree removal or getting on a roof just recommend hiring professionals for that.”

And:Hurricane Ian victims can get help with aid shelter and more with these resources

At HCA Florida Blake Hospital which is both a Level II trauma center and a burn center patient volume has increased 10% to 20% Selph said then added that in addition to orthopedic injuries there have been an increase in heat-related illnesses and respiratory issues.

Blake typically sees 115 to 120 patients a day at its Emergency Department.

At HCA Florida Doctors Hospital in Sarasota the emergency caseload has increased 20% to 25% he added.

“The closer you are to where the catastrophic devastation was in Lee County the more those patients in need are coming up north” Selph said.

HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital in Charlotte County closed Sept. 29 because of damage from Hurricane Ian.

HCA Florida Englewood Hospital incurred minor damage during the storm and reopened Oct. 6 once water and power were restored.

Disaster mobile units improve care flow

The increase in patient volume and injury type mirrors that experienced by Sarasota Memorial Health Care System – especially the 110-bed Venice hospital which because of its location at the Laurel Road exit off Interstate 75 was one of the most easily accessible medical facilities in the hours after Hurricane Ian made landfall near Fort Myers.

“Right after the storm passed there was a backlog of EMS cases” SMH spokeswoman Kim Savage said. “We saw a lot of people who were suffering from a variety of ailments.

“Then right after the storm passed we saw a lot of injuries from people who were clearing debris” she added. “We saw chainsaw injuries we saw branches that had punctured their skin and got infected.”

That workload is in addition to cardiac care and stroke patients in need of care.

A 20-ambulance team stationed in Venice aided with transfer of patients to the larger Sarasota campus as well as hospitals as far away as Tampa and Orlando.

Both the Sarasota and Venice hospital campuses remained open with staff sheltering in place; the two hospitals cared for more than 700 patients during and immediately after the storm.

The Venice campus and its 28-bed emergency department got a big boost Oct. 2 after a federal Disaster Medical Assistance Team set up a 30-bed tent facility just outside the hospital’s ambulance bay.

The federal team of 37 doctors nurses physician assistants paramedics and pharmacists functions as a second emergency department.

“In the last 24-hour period they saw 88 patients in their ER compared to 114 that we saw in ours” Savage said. “They’re helping quite a bit with that volume.”

DMAT tent facilities of varying capabilities opened up in North Port and Port Charlotte in the past week. Including facilities that opened in Lee County – where local hospitals were hobbled by Hurricane Ian – Savage said as many as seven tent facilities have opened.

“Our volumes are still very high but what we have been able to do is manage it and create as normal a process as we can now in triaging and treating patients” Savage said. “As we’ve found our new rhythm things are going much more smoothly.

“We don’t have as long wait times we’ve got that Disaster Medical Assistance Team set up outside of our ER in Venice and that’s helping with the influx of patients from the south.

Savage said the number of elective surgeries scheduled has been reduced and patients first seen in Venice are still being transferred to Sarasota or other hospitals.

“We’re just managing until things get back to the new normal” she added.

Charlotte hospitals up and running

The unexpected closure of ShorePoint Health Venice hospital by its parent company Community Health Systems Inc. in September left south Sarasota County with a deficit of available bed space at Sarasota Memorial-Venice and HCA-Englewood.

Both the ShorePoint Health Port Charlotte and ShorePoint Health Punta Gorda hospital facilities are up open and functioning according to an email from Jennifer Siem a spokesperson for Bravera Health – a Nature Coast-based hospital system also owned by CHS Inc.

ShorePoint Health Punta Gorda is operational for emergency and inpatient services and limited surgeries and Emergency room patients are no longer experiencing unusually long wait times.

“Community need for health care services is at an all-time high and our teams have provided care for hundreds of patients since the hurricane – many who have suffered aftermath-related injuries requiring emergency care” Siem wrote. “Our teams also are delivering babies taking care of critically ill patients in their ICUs and performing dozens of procedures – even while sterile supplies are still limited – including the first open heart surgery Tuesday since the storm. All of this is taking place under very challenging circumstances.""

She added that ShorePoint Port Charlotte is caring for more than 200 patients and has activated contingency plans for inpatient and surgical services “to operate at more than double our normal capacity.”

PPE exports to the US fell by around 50 per cent between August and September of 2019 in a significant drop which raised alarm bells at key US government agencies.

China also started to buy up global PPE stocks in Europe Australia and the US around the same time experts said.

The fall in PPE supplies exiting China the world’s biggest manufacturer of PPE raises new questions about the true timeline of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.

An altered timeline would significantly challenge the theory that the pandemic originated from a seafood market in Wuhan where the first cases emerged in December 2019.

The anomaly was uncovered by former US government officials including Dr Tom McGinn a Senior Health Advisor at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Colonel John Hoffman a Senior Research Fellow with the Food Protection and Defence Institute whose career spans decades in US government and military.

The pair were unconvinced that the virus had started at the Wuhan Wet Market in December 2019 after and began looking for an alternative theory.",,,,,,,,,

At the Target department store in Exeter Township Tuesday afternoon for a story on halloween costumes.

In the past few weeks Craig Cislo dug out the spray-painted tombstones from his attic scoured websites for a giant animated reaper and convinced his teenage son to dress as a bush to spook trick-or-treaters.

Cislo 43 of Dallas plans to spend about $700 for Halloween to step up his family's front yard decorations. He has noticed more neighbors are joining in too with large inflatables animatronics and even an elaborate display inspired by ""The Walking Dead.""

""My wife and I joke — because we take a daily walk — that we have competition this year"" he said.

As retailers brace for a lackluster holiday season many are planning to pump up sales early by dangling a wider assortment of Halloween merchandise. Even if consumers are cutting back on spending elsewhere they say Halloween gives people a chance to get into the holiday spirit with relatively inexpensive celebrations before Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Home Depot and Lowe's stocked up on a wide range of spooky lawn ornaments including giant mummies and skeletons. Target executives expressed high hopes for sales of costumes haunted house cookie building sets and other Halloween merchandise even after cutting the company's profit outlook twice. And Party City  which sells costumes balloons and bags of candy plans to hire about 20000 seasonal employees before the Oct. 31 occasion.

The push around Halloween comes as more people return to in-person gatherings. Participation is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels this year with nearly 70% of Americans planning to celebrate according to the National Retail Federation's annual survey.

That's expected to lift total Halloween spending to a record $10.6 billion a jump from last year's $10.1 billion the survey found. On average consumers plan to spend $100 for candy decor cards and costumes.

For some shoppers celebrations like Halloween offer an escape from the worries of everyday life. As customers face troubling news headlines Covid surges and political uncertainty they're seeking more ways to celebrate and ""bring joy to their families"" said Christina Hennington Target's chief growth officer.

""This is one of the reasons we continue to see such strength in our seasonal categories which we expect will continue in the back half of the year"" she said on the company's earnings call in August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbWlkamVyc2V5Lm5ld3MvMjAyMi8xMC8wOC9kZXZlbG9waW5nLTItc3RhYmJlZC1pbi1hcmVhLW9mLWhvbWUtZGVwb3QtaW4tc291dGgtYnJ1bnN3aWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Developing: 2 Stabbed In Area Of Home Depot In South Brunswick,"UPDATE:

Year built: 1994

Square footage: 15900

Market value: $2914380

Owner: Dan Fischer

How long it’s been empty: 16 years

Why it’s empty: A faulty foundation

Dan Fischer an Illinois lottery magnate loves a good distressed asset.

He certainly got one when he purchased Dotty’s a chain of dozens of lottery delis in 2007. After Nevada regulators caught the previous owner lying Oregon’s lottery commissioner forced the sale of the immensely profitable franchise. Fischer grabbed it for $15 million The Oregonian reported at the time.

In 2012 Fischer struck again purchasing an abandoned Zupan’s on Hayden Island. It’s a stone throw from Dotty’s #24 one of the state’s highest-earning lottery retailers due to its proximity to Washington where video lotteries are outlawed (“In Luck” WW July 27).

The upmarket grocery store closed in 2006 just three years after its grand opening. Freezer doors wouldn’t open. Shopping carts started to mysteriously roll away on their own volition. The foundation the owners determined had collapsed.

Zupan’s sued the contractor and the architect for $9 million. They countersued for nonpayment and the parties settled their legal battle in 2007. The store never reopened.

“It’s sad that we’re really not more conveniently located to serve North Portland and Vancouver” Don Ramey Zupan’s director of marketing told The Portland Sentinel after the store’s closure.

But no one made the needed repairs. Five years later Zupan’s sold the building to Fischer for just over $1.5 million.

His bargain has yet to bear fruit. Fischer tested the market in 2018 offering to sell the still-unstable building for $2.2 million according to an advertisement on his broker’s website. Despite the building’s “attractive contemporary design” and “excellent visibility to I-5” there have yet to be any takers.

The broker is now offering the vacant building for lease.

Russ Sheldon answered the phone at Fischer’s company Oregon Restaurant Services Inc. His name was listed as the registered agent on the two companies that Fischer used to purchase Dotty’s and the beleaguered Zupan’s. He said he works in the warehouse.

“I don’t know what he bought it for” Sheldon said. “It is what it is—just a building right now.”

You're not alone - here's how it became cool,"Apparently Spam is cool. The 85-year-old canned block of meat has undergone a cultural reinvention.

Hormel has sold a record amount of Spam for seven straight years and 2022 is on pace for another such milestone. The conglomerate behind Skippy and Jennie-O turkey says it can't make Spam fast enough and is increasing production capacity.

Spam is a trending ingredient on TikTok and on the menu at fine-dining restaurants in coastal cities. In 2019 a limited-edition Spam pumpkin spice flavour sold out in minutes. (You can still buy it on Ebay where it goes for up to $100 per can.)

What is behind this phenomenon? Why does this slab of cooked pork that has long been stigmatised as fake meat linked to wartime rations and hilariously spoofed on Monty Python now have cachet with foodies?

Spam's popularity in Hawaiian Asian and Pacific Island cuisine has influenced its growth. As more immigrants came and fusion dishes and ethnic cuisines entered the cultural mainstream Spam has reached new younger foodies say Hormel food analysts and researchers.

Edgy and clever advertising campaigns also have helped Spam attract a broader customer range than the Baby Boomers who grew up eating it sometimes reluctantly.

""Spam has undergone a reputation makeover"" said Robert Ku an associate professor of Asian and Asian American studies at Binghamton University and the author of 'Dubious Gastronomy: Eating Asian in the USA'. ""A lot of celebrity chefs have been Asian and Asian American and reintroduced Spam to a new audience.""

'Miracle meat'

More than 100000 visitors stream into the Spam museum every year in Austin Minnesota with stories to tell about Spam and recipes to share said Savile Lord the manager of the museum in the brand's hometown. Visitors most often ask her and other museum ""Spambassadors"" how Spam got its name and what the heck is in it.

Spam first hit shelves in 1937 as a 340 gram 25-cent convenient and long-lasting protein in a tin can during the lean years of the Great Depression. Spam contained nothing but pork shoulder chopped ham water sugar and sodium.

It was a concoction of George Hormel and his son Jay meatpackers in Austin. The Hormels had been working on the ""problem of canning a nonperishable pork product for a good many years and at last we solved it"" Jay told The New Yorker in 1945.

They offered a $US 100 [$150] prize for the best name for the food. It needed to be short for display purposes and to fit on one-column newspaper advertisements. It also had to pronounceable in any language.

The brother of a corporate executive threw out ""Spam"" a combination of ""spice"" and ""ham"" at a party and Hormel ""knew then and there that the name was perfect.""

From the beginning Spam was marketed as a time-saver and a food for any meal: Spam and eggs. Spam and pancakes. Spam and beans spaghetti macaroni and crackers. Spamwiches.

""Never have you imagined a meat could turn into so many interesting uses. Morning noon or night – cold or hot – Spam hits the spot!"" read one early advertisement. Spam was a ""miracle meat"" the company told consumers in newspaper spots and radio ads.

And then came World War II the decisive moment in Spam's growth.

At many Pacific outposts which had little refrigeration or local sources of meat American and Allied troops relied on the canned meat that could be stored away for months and eaten on the go.

Hormel says more than 100 million pounds [45 million kilograms] of Spam were shipped overseas to help feed the troops during the war. Uncle Sam became known as Uncle Spam much to the dismay of troops forced to eat it every single day.

""During World War II of course I ate my share of Spam along with millions of other soldiers"" Dwight D. Eisenhower later wrote to Hormel's president. ""I'll even confess to a few unkind remarks about it – uttered during the strain of battle.""

For the citizens of conflict-wracked countries in the Pacific struggling with hunger and famine during the war and rebuilding years however Spam was a symbol of access to American goods and services. Sometimes it was the only protein source available. After troops left Spam remained becoming an ingredient in local dishes.

""Spam became part of Asian culture"" said Ayalla Ruvio a consumer behaviour researcher at Michigan State University who studies identity and consumption habits. ""It represented a piece of America. It's like Coca-Cola or McDonald's.""

American troops also introduced Spam in Korea during the Korean War in the early 1950s and Budae Jjigae (Army Stew) became a popular Korean dish. Spam also remains a common ingredient in dishes almost anywhere US soldiers were stationed such as Guam the Philippines and Okinawa Japan.

In Hawaii where the US military has long been a major presence more Spam is consumed per person than any other state. It's stacked on a block of rice and wrapped in seaweed to make Spam musubi and sold at fast-food chains like McDonald's in Hawaii. There's even an annual Waikiki Spam Jam festival.

Spam musubi and tacos

Many soldiers returning from World War II vowed never to eat Spam again and the brand became linked to rationing and economic hardship. But Spam has appealed to new consumers in recent years.

""When I first started getting into the brand we started to notice this transition to a stronger multicultural set of consumers"" said Brian Lillis who has been product's brand manager for six years. ""They brought with them the traditions of utilising the product in their home country or where maybe their ancestors came from.""

Hormel has worked with chefs at Korean Taiwanese and Vietnamese restaurants to get Spam on menus. As more people have been introduced to these dishes they go home and try to make their own versions Lillis said.

Spam highlights its versatility in dishes on social media and TV advertisements. There are ads for Spam and eggs as well as Spam fried rice Spam musubi yakitori and poke.

Spam has made a comeback in the United States because Asian and Asian American chefs such as Chris Oh have tried to reinvent it in their own ways said Ku the Binghamton University professor. ""They brought some of the culinary influences of Asia and the Pacific and upscaled it.""﻿

Find Vox’s coverage of those arguments here. A deeper overview of the case is below.

One of the most important provisions of the Constitution states that “Congress shall have power ... To regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes.”

This provision gives the federal government vast authority over the national economy and over the various businesses that make up that economy. It is the reason why landmark federal laws ranging from the minimum wage to the ban on whites-only lunch counters to much of Obamacare are allowed to exist.

This constitutional provision known as the “Commerce Clause” does not simply empower Congress to regulate interstate and international trade and in effect the national economy. It’s also long been understood to prevent states from enacting laws that significantly impede free trade throughout the Union.

As the Supreme Court explained in Hughes v. Oklahoma (1979) the Commerce Clause addresses “a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention”: the Framers’ belief that “the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.”

Which brings us to National Pork Producers Council v. Ross a case the Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday. In that case the pork industry accuses California’s voters of trying to impose their own food policy preferences upon the nation as a whole in violation of the Constitution’s safeguards against allowing one state to interfere with the nation’s economy as a whole.

In 2018 California enacted Proposition 12 a ballot initiative that imposes some of the strictest animal welfare standards in the country upon certain farmers. Of particular relevance to the Pork Producers case Prop 12 forbids pork farmers from confining a breeding sow “with less than 24 square feet of usable floor space per pig.” And it forbids the sale of any pork in California that was produced by a farm that did not comply with this rule.

Trade organizations representing the pork industry sued claiming that Prop 12 will impose high costs on farmers in all 50 states and drive up pork prices nationwide. Among other things they argue that it is “impracticable” for the industry to track in advance which cuts of pork will ultimately be sold in California so pork farmers everywhere in the country will need to change their operations so that all of their meat complies with Prop 12.

And in order to comply the pork industry claims these farmers will “need to spend “$293894455 to $347733205 of additional capital in order to reconstruct their sow housing and overcome the productivity loss that Proposition 12 imposes.” Ultimately the pork producers argue that Prop 12 will “increase farmers’ production costs by over $13 per pig a 9.2% cost increase” and those costs will need to be passed on to the consumer.

It’s unclear whether these dire predictions will actually become a reality and key figures within the pork industry have at times seemed to contradict the more alarmist positions taken by the industry’s lawyers. Hormel Foods for example put out a statement saying that it has “confirmed that it faces no risk of material losses from compliance with Proposition 12.” Similarly Tysons Food CEO Donnie King said in a 2021 interview that while Prop 12 is “not something we were excited about” his company can “certainly provide the raw material to service our customers in that way.”

Nevertheless the pork producers’ legal position is that Proposition 12 violates the Constitution’s guarantee that one state will not interfere too much with the rest of the nation’s markets.

These sorts of lawsuits which lawyers refer to as “Dormant Commerce Clause” suits rarely prevail. But the pork producers do raise an unusually strong case under some of the Supreme Court’s caselaw assuming that they can prove many of their dire economic predictions about Proposition 12’s impact.

At the same time there is a very good reason why the Court has historically been reluctant to strike down state laws that interfere with the economy in other states. In a modern integrated economy virtually any state law will have some economic impacts across a state’s borders. If the Court hands down a ham-handed decision in Pork Producers it could call into question hundreds or even thousands of state laws throughout the country.

What’s at stake in Pork Producers

Republican appointees have a supermajority on the current Supreme Court so lawyers advocating for conservative policy outcomes frequently file briefs proposing sweeping avulsing changes to federal law — before taking on a more measured and reasonable legal argument near the end of their brief.

The pork industry’s brief in Pork Producers fits this pattern. Much of its brief calls for broad new limits on a state’s ability to enact laws with “extraterritorial” effects — meaning that the law’s economic impacts are felt outside the state. Indeed at one point the pork producers suggest that “a State may not enact laws that have the practical effect of controlling conduct outside that State’s borders.”

If the Supreme Court were to embrace such an extreme rule then the United States might as well give up on the project of state lawmaking altogether. Nearly any state law will have some impact on the economy in other states.

Take for example the ongoing debate about whether states should legalize recreational marijuana. In my home state of Virginia people over the age of 21 may lawfully possess up to an ounce of marijuana in public. But marijuana possession is typically illegal just across the border in North Carolina.

Yet as the Supreme Court explained in Gonzales v. Raich (2005) one state’s marijuana laws necessarily impact the national market for this drug. Increased marijuana production anywhere in the country “has a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market for that commodity.” Similarly by banning recreational marijuana North Carolina lawmakers discourage hardworking Virginia cannabis farmers from growing product that can be sold in North Carolina diminishing those farmers’ profits in the process.

Nevertheless it is widely accepted that each state may decide whether or not to ban marijuana — or a myriad of other products they deem harmful — without running afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause. California for example recently banned 24 ingredients from cosmetics and personal care products because it believes them to harm people’s health.

Similarly imagine that California enacted a new law which appropriates funding to hire 10000 new public school teachers in the state. This law would also have extraterritorial effects. Among other things because California competes with other states to hire teaching talent this new appropriation would place upward pressure on teaching salaries throughout the country. But there’s no serious argument under existing law that hiring new teachers violates the Dormant Commerce Clause.

Again the point is that a strict ban on state laws that have “the practical effect of controlling conduct outside that State’s borders” could potentially prohibit states from legislating altogether — especially if the phrase “practical effect” is read broadly. A state law raising its hourly minimum wage for example could have the practical effect of making businesses in counties across the state line raise their wages too. Name any state law and it’s probably possible to identify some way that it shapes conduct outside of that state’s territory.

To win their case in other words the pork industry should have to do much more than show that Proposition 12 impacts how pork is produced in other states. If that were enough virtually any state law would be unconstitutional.

The strongest case against Prop 12

At the same time however there need to be some limits on one state’s ability to pass laws that impact nonresidents of that state. In 2021 for example Texas enacted a law that effectively forces major social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to stop removing content they deem offensive — including content from Nazis and white supremacists as well as many forms of targeted harassment.

While this law theoretically only applies to Texas residents and people and businesses who take certain actions in Texas social media companies would likely find it very difficult to identify which of their users are subject to the Texas law — and therefore would have no choice but to impose Texas’s rules on everyone who uses their site.

Even setting aside the fact that this Texas law violates the First Amendment why should Texas get to decide for the entire country what sort of content appears on Twitter? There’s something profoundly undemocratic about allowing a single state to decide this question for the other 49 states as most Americans do not get to vote for members of the Texas state legislature.

If the pork producers are correct about the economic impacts of Proposition 12 then a similar argument could be applied to California’s law. Why should the voters of California get to pass a law that might drive up the price of bacon in Florida by nearly 10 percent?

The Supreme Court’s decision in Pike v. Bruce Church (1970) established that a state law should be struck down if it imposes a burden on commerce in other states that “is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.” And the pork producers make a reasonable argument that Prop 12 is the rare state law that runs afoul of Pike. (Notably the Biden administration also filed a brief arguing that Pike requires the Court to strike down Prop 12.)

The argument goes something like this: The pork producers claim that 99.87 percent of the nation’s pork production occurs outside of California but Prop 12 will nonetheless force those out-of-state producers to comply with California’s animal welfare standards. They also argue that Prop 12 does nothing to protect the health and safety of actual California residents. And they bolster this claim by pointing to the California Department of Food and Agriculture’s own conclusion that it could not “confirm according to its usual scientific practices” that Prop 12’s sow confinement rules “reduce the risk of human food-borne illness.”

Assuming that all of this is true that would mean that Prop 12 does very little to actually improve the lives of Californians while simultaneously imposing tremendous costs on pork farmers in other states.

To this California offers two responses. One is that even if Prop 12 does not advance any public health goals the state still has a legitimate interest in “prohibiting the in-state sale of animal products that the voters view as morally objectionable.”

But this argument is hard to square with Lawrence v. Texas (2003) the landmark civil rights decision striking down a Texas ban on “sodomy.” Among other things Lawrence held that “the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice.”

To sustain a law a state must offer a justification that goes beyond “we banned this practice because we think it is bad.”

California’s strongest legal argument meanwhile is simply that Courts should be very cautious about striking down state laws that have extraterritorial effects. As Justice Antonin Scalia warned in a 1987 opinion the question of whether a particular state law imposes a burden on commerce that is “clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits” is the sort of inquiry that “is ill suited to the judicial function and should be undertaken rarely if at all.”

Judges simply are not very good at tracing out the economic impacts of a particular law. Or at predicting just how much the price of ham will go up in Wisconsin if California imposes new burdens on pork producers. And for all the reasons explained above it’s not clear where to draw the line between an ordinary law with extraterritorial effects — such as North Carolina’s marijuana ban — and a more extraordinary law that has too much impact on other states.

In any event the Court’s current majority has not shown much sympathy for arguments that judges should be cautious about poking around in policy areas that they barely understand so California may face an uphill climb in the Supreme Court if its best argument is that the judiciary should exercise restraint.

But whatever the Court decides in Pork Producers we should hope that it shows the same trepidation about striking down laws with extraterritorial effects that Scalia articulated in the 1980s. The United States has an integrated economy and virtually any state law will have at least some marginal effect on commerce in other states.

If this Supreme Court starts policing those laws it will find it difficult to figure out where to stop.",,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Global Computer Market Challenge

Cybersecurity is one of the main issues limiting the expansion of the global computer market. Threats to information security unauthorized access and student data privacy have grown as education has become more digitalized. The availability of valuable user and organizational data the lack of a centralized framework for data storage and the unrestricted usage of personal digital devices are the main factors making the educational sector vulnerable to cyberattacks.

As a result it is anticipated that the inadequate cybersecurity measures used by educational institutions and individual students would restrain the expansion of the computer market over the projection period.

Doctors who found enough new diagnoses could earn bottles of Champagne or a bonus in their paycheck.

Anthem a large insurer now called Elevance Health paid more to doctors who said their patients were sicker. And executives at UnitedHealth Group the country’s largest insurer told their workers to mine old medical records for more illnesses — and when they couldn’t find enough sent them back to try again.

Each of the strategies — which were described by the Justice Department in lawsuits against the companies — led to diagnoses of serious diseases that might have never existed. But the diagnoses had a lucrative side effect: They let the insurers collect more money from the federal government’s Medicare Advantage program.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After looking at the best cheap micro-cap and mid-cap stocks out there let’s turn our attention to cheap blue-chip stocks.

Typically blue chips or shares in venerable well-established companies aren’t cheap. That’s not to say they are usually overvalued or that investing in blue-chips results in subpar returns if you do not buy them at a discount.

As the famous Warren Buffett quote goes “it’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But what if you can buy a “wonderful company” at a more-than-fair price? There may be the opportunity for even more substantial long-term returns. First market conditions normalize resulting in discounted blue chips returning to fair prices. Then steady gains from price appreciation and dividends over a longer timeframe.

So what are the best cheap blue-chip stocks out there today? Consider these seven each a high-quality business currently trading at a low valuation.

BTI British American Tobacco PLC $36.81 GOOG GOOGL Alphabet $99.57 $98.68 IBM IBM $118.82 JPM JPMorgan Chase & Co. $105.98 PFE Pfizer $42.32 VZ Verizon Communications $36.85 XOM ExonnMobil $101.03

British American Tobacco PLC (BTI)

Blue-chip tobacco stocks like British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE:BTI) trade at low valuations even in a bull market. This of course is due to the industry’s cash cow product cigarettes being in secular decline. There is high uncertainty as to whether “big tobacco” can still thrive in a post-cigarette future.

Yet recently BTI stock has fallen to a meager price. Today you can buy this global tobacco giant (whose brands include Camel and Newport) for only 8.1x forward earnings. Besides being cheaper than the overall market BTI is also cheaper than peer Altria Group (NYSE:MO) which trades for around 8.6x forward earnings.

Not only that unlike Altria which lost billions on its Juul Labs investment British American Tobacco has demonstrated success in diversifying its product mix beyond cigarettes. This may leave it well-positioned to maintain (and grow) its high-yield dividend of 7.99%.

Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL)

It may be a relatively young company and may not pay a dividend but it’s apt to say Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a blue-chip stock. This is due to several factors including a deep economic moat high operating margins and a strong balance sheet.

Story continues

You may agree that GOOG stock is a blue-chip yet disagree that it’s one of the cheap blue-chip stocks. I’ll agree with you that this stock is not “undervalued” on an absolute basis as it trades for 18.8x earnings in-line with major indices like the S&P 500

However Alphabet’s current earnings multiple may overestimate how long its main digital ads business remains in a slump and underestimate the company’s potential to re-accelerate earnings growth. Shares have strong rebound potential once the digital ad market recovers and Alphabet’s other growth catalysts start to play out.

IBM (IBM)

While Alphabet is an ascending tech blue-chip IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a blue-chip tech “dinosaur.” At least that’s still the market’s perception of this more than century-old technology company.

Trading for 19.3x earnings and with a forward dividend yield of 5.44% critics of this stock will warn you that it’s a value trap and possibly a yield trap. Yet despite the poor performance of “Big Blue” over the past decade (down nearly 38.5%) the next ten years could be much more stellar for IBM stock investors.

Why? Chalk it up to its in-progress transformation into primarily a hybrid cloud computing company. Through bolt-on acquisitions IBM continues to bulk up its presence in the hybrid cloud space. Steadily helping it become a faster-growing company this could result in a move to substantially higher prices for IBM stock in the coming years.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)

As InvestorPlace’s Joel Baglole recently discussed JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been hammered by the market’s worries about a recession. These worries have outweighed the tailwind for this banking giant which is the sharp rise in interest rates which points to increased profitability.

However one can argue that these recession worries are already fully-factored into the valuation of JPM stock. Shares in the money center bank currently trade for 9.7x the estimated 2022 earnings. However this valuation doesn’t look at first glance as a big discount towards the low end of its valuation over the past five years.

If JPMorgan Chase can weather today’s economic storms and capitalize on the current rising rate environment future operating results could be stronger-than-expected. One bank stock analyst (Citi’s Keith Horowitz) anticipates this. A series of earnings beats could enable JPM to rise on a re-rating.

Pfizer (PFE)

If searching for cheap blue-chip stocks on a screener chances are one of the first ones you’ll find is Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The pharmaceutical giant trades at a super-low valuation (only 8.28x earnings) although there is a caveat.

You can say earnings in 2021 and 2022 were “boosted” by the rollout of its Covid-19 vaccine which the company co-developed with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX). With the vaccination wave long since passed Pfizer’s earnings are set to drop.

However even with an expected drop in earnings per share (or EPS) from $6.49 to $5.09 next year PFE stock is still cheap. Based on next year’s estimates Pfizer trades for 8.5x earnings. There may be room for shares to move higher towards a valuation on par with other pharma stocks. Pfizer’s peers trade at a valuation closer to ten times earnings.

Verizon Communications (VZ)

Rising interest rates have put pressure on telecom stocks which investors buy mainly for their high dividends. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) may not be as popular as AT&T (NYSE:T) among dividend investors yet this factor has pushed this “Baby Bell” nearly 28% lower year-to-date.

If rates keep rising VZ stock will likely slide lower. However if you’re bullish rates aren’t going much higher from here and are looking to scoop up dividend stocks at attractive valuations now may be the time to buy.

Verizon’s forward dividend yield currently comes in at around 7.08%. That’s only slightly less than AT&T’s current forward yield around 7.43%. Not only that as I’ve argued previously VZ beats T stock in areas like dividend coverage and dividend growth. Trading for only 7.4x earnings while higher than AT&T’s current multiple of 5.6x VZ is cheap even among cheap blue-chip stocks.

ExxonMobil (XOM)

Up until the start of this month ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) like other oil stocks was pulling back. This was in tandem with the slide in crude oil prices due to concerns that a recession-driven drop in demand would outweigh the impact to supply caused by Russia’s Ukraine invasion and subsequent sanctions.

However so far in October oil (and XOM stock) have started to bounce back. Hopes of oil prices “returning to normal” have been dashed as OPEC and its allies have agreed to production cuts. This could counter any impact on demand from a recession enabling prices to stay high.

In turn enabling ExxonMobil’s current level of profitability to continue. Currently trading at a discounted valuation of 11x earnings in anticipation of a drop in oil prices XOM could move higher due to multiple expansions. The company’s capital allocation plan may also help move the needle over a longer timeframe.

Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Owns These 31 Dividend Aristocrats,"Buffett has positions in more Dividend Aristocrats than Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings reveal.

Warren Buffett loves dividends. His beloved Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.69%) (BRK.B 0.64%) owns quite a few dividend stocks. Three of them have track records of at least 25 years of dividend increases.

But you might be surprised about how many members of dividend royalty the legendary investor really owns. Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds 31 Dividend Aristocrats.

Like Baskin-Robbins

Just what is Buffett's ""secret portfolio""? In 1995 investment firm New England Asset Management (NEAM) was acquired by General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re). Three years later Berkshire bought Gen Re. NEAM doesn't hide its equity holdings; it reports them on a regular basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However these stocks are often overlooked by Buffett's followers even though they are owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

When it comes to Dividend Aristocrats these ""secret"" Buffett stocks are like Baskin-Robbins ice cream: They come in 31 flavors. Below are all 31 of the Dividend Aristocrats in NEAM's portfolio:

Company Sector Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 3M Industrials 64 Abbott Laboratories Healthcare 50 AbbVie Healthcare 50 Air Products & Chemicals Materials 40 Automatic Data Processing Information Technology 47 Becton Dickinson Healthcare 50 Chevron CVX -0.18% ) Energy 35 Church & Dwight Consumer Staples 26 Coca-Cola Consumer Staples 60 Emerson Electric Industrials 65 ExxonMobil Energy 39 General Dynamics Industrials 25 Illinois Tool Works Industrials 58 International Business Machines Information Technology 28 Johnson & Johnson Healthcare 60 Kimberly-Clark Consumer Staples 50 Linde Materials 29 Lowe's Consumer Discretionary 48 McCormick Consumer Staples 36 McDonald's Consumer Discretionary 45 Medtronic Healthcare 45 NextEra Energy Utilities 28 PepsiCo Consumer Staples 50 PPG Industries Materials 50 Procter & Gamble Consumer Staples 66 Realty Income Real Estate 28 S&P Global Financials 49 Sysco Consumer Staples 53 Target Consumer Discretionary 50 VF Corp. Consumer Discretionary 48 Walmart Consumer Staples 49

Several of the stocks on the list belong to an even more exclusive club than the Dividend Aristocrats -- the Dividend Kings. These stocks have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.

Biggest bets

Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds relatively small positions in most of these 31 Dividend Aristocrats. Chevron though stands out as a notable exception. As of the end of the second quarter of 2022 NEAM owned more than 2.15 million shares of the oil and gas giant.

Chevron also ranks as one of Berkshire's biggest bets. It's now the third-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and has performed well so far this year.

NEAM doesn't have huge stakes in any of the other Dividend Aristocrats. The next two after Chevron are AbbVie and Procter & Gamble. At the end of Q2 NEAM owned 75345 and 71551 shares of these two stocks respectively.

Best of the bunch

It isn't easy to pick the best of these Dividend Aristocrats. I think that Chevron is one of the stocks directly owned by Berkshire Hathaway that is also in NEAM's portfolio that's most likely to soar in the fourth quarter. My reasoning is that oil prices will move higher and provide a catalyst for the top energy stocks.

There are also some unstoppable trends that could benefit a few stocks on this list. For example an aging population should drive increased demand for products developed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The shift to clean energy should work to Air Products' advantage as it produces blue and green hydrogen.

Many of these stocks will probably be big winners over the next decade and beyond though. The power of growing dividends to boost total returns is no secret at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,

O. vulgaris embryos and paralarvae were obtained from a broodstock comprised by individuals of similar sizes maintained in a 400 L flow-through system tank according to Iglesias et al.2541. PVC shelters were provided as refuges to induce natural spawning. Individuals were maintained under standard conditions of summer natural photoperiod (42°11′01″N 8°48′46″O) sea water temperatures (19–23 °C) and they were fed ad libitum with thawed crabs and fish three days a week. Once a laying occurs the female was kept in a separate tank at the same water temperature. The female took care of the spawn without being fed until hatching. Paralarvae were reared following an adaptation of the rearing protocol patented by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography42 in black cylindrical 500 L tanks with central aeration at an initial density of 4 individuals/L. The rearing seawater temperature was 20.8 ± 1.1 °C oxygen concentration 6.0 ± 0.5 ppm and 35.0 ± 1.0 psu salinity. Light intensity was of 600 lx with a 14 L:10D photoperiod. The flow-through seawater system was equipped with 10 5 and 1 μm filter cartridges. Nannochloropsis sp and Isochrysis aff. galbana (T-Iso) were used as green water at 3·105 cells/mL in a 3:1 proportion.

A set of 20 paralarvae sampled every 10 days from each experimental culture was also used to determine the individual dry weight after oven drying for 24 h at 80 °C25. The percentage of the specific growth rate (SGR %) for each trial was calculated following the formula: (% BW/day) = [(LnDW f - LnDW i ) × 100/(tf-ti)] where BW is the body weight DWf and DWi are the paralarvae dry weight at final time (tf) and initial time (ti) respectively. The different experimental designs paralarvae age at collection time and pictures of animals are shown in Fig. 1a.

Dietary experimental trial

Two dietary treatments were tested on newly hatched paralarvae. Artemia-based diet (A) consisted of Artemia metanauplii (Sep-Art EG INVE Aquaculture Belgium) on-growing for 5–7 days (average size 1.5 mm) with Tetraselmis chuii plus T-Iso (50:50) and fed on T-Iso for the last 24 h. Paralarvae were fed ad libitum and the Artemia concentration adjusted according to the observed consumption. The concentration of Artemia supplied per culture tank varied daily between 0.14 and 2.25 µg dry weight/mL which represents a daily density of 0.03–0.5 preys/mL. The improved mixed diet (M) consisted on four live preys supplied to the culture tank at the following concentration per day: zoeae of spider crab (Maja brachydactyla) at 0.20–0.99 µg dry weight/mL (0.002–0.01 preys/mL) zoeae of velvet crab (Necora puber) at 0.02–0.12 µg dry weight/mL (0.001–0.005 preys/mL) juveniles of amphipods gammarids (Jassa sp.) at 0.08–0.17 µg dry weight/mL (0.0005–0.001 preys/mL) and Artemia at 0.23–0.9 µg dry weight/mL (0.05–0.2 preys/mL). Paralarvae fed on A diet were grown until 30 dph the time point from which the culture survival began to decline whereas paralarvae fed on M diet showed pre-settlement behaviour at 40 dph. Artemia group at 20 dph showed 1.2 ± 0.2 mg of dry weight (SGR: 7.1%) whereas mixed group reached 2.7 ± 0.3 mg (11.12%) at 20 dph and 5.0 ± 1.1 mg (9.5%) at 30 dph.

Experimental trial under suboptimal rearing conditions

A suboptimal culture condition of octopus paralarvae was evaluated in order to analyse the effect of the stress caused by abiotic factors in animal culture and growth. Paralarvae were reared following the general culture conditions described above254142. In order to perform suboptimal conditions the volume of the culture tanks was reduced to 100 L and light intensity was increased to 1100 lux. The dietary treatment administered was the same as in M diet corresponding to the dietary experimental trial. Paralarvae grew until 20 dph the time point from which the culture survival began to decline. Suboptimal group of animals reached 1.6 ± 0.2 mg of dry weight (SGR: 8.6%).

Infection experimental trial

A small number of paralarvae of 0 and 40 dph fed on mixed M diet were exposed in vivo to the Gram negative bacteria V. lentus and an additional small number of paralarvae of 0 dph were exposed to the virus OsHV-1. A strain of V. lentus (kindly provided by Dr. R. Farto U. Vigo) was maintained frozen at −80 °C until use. After defrosting for a few minutes in ice bacteria were grown in liquid medium (TSB Tryptic Soy Broth with supplement of NaCl 2%) by incubation in continuous shaking at 22 °C for 48 h. Bacteria cultures were centrifuged (3000 g) for 3 min then the medium was discarded and the pellet was suspended in 0.2 µm filtered sea water (FSW) in order to prepare a bacterial suspension to be used for experimental infections. The number of colonies forming units (CFU) was estimated by seeding serial dilutions on TSA medium.

OsHV-1 viral suspension was prepared following Prado-Alvarez et al.40. Briefly infected oyster tissues (gill and mantle) were mashed diluted in artificial sea water (ASW) and filtered under sterilize conditions. Infection on tissues was previously corroborated by conventional PCR. Viral load was quantified by qPCR4344 using a collection of plasmid standards with a known amount of viral load.

Experimental infections were carried out by bath immersion at 22 °C in 6-well plates with 14 paralarvae each in 12 mL final volume containing 108 CFU/mL of V. lentus and 2.6 104 viral copies/µL of OsHV-1 µVar. Control paralarvae were exposed to ASW. Three paralarvae per condition were collected at 1 4 and 24 hours post-exposure for RNA-seq analysis and a total of 5 additional paralarvae were collected for transmission electron microscopy analysis (TEM).

Sample collection

For all developmental stages or experimental conditions and before any processing paralarvae and embryo were anaesthetised using cold sea water (lower than 2 °C) rinsed in distilled water and immersed in RNAlater (QIAGEN GmbH Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions for fixation and preservation at −80 °C until use.

In the case of embryo samples a number of 20 embryos (5 embryos/stage) at stages VIII X XV and XVIII (according to Naef 192845) were sampled from the female shelter and pooled together. Prior to introduction into RNAlater embryos were anaesthetised as indicated above and punctured in the chorion with a 0.5 × 16 mm needle to ensure proper penetration of the preservative into the embryo. In addition 5 biological replicates of 1 individual paralarvae each were sampled at 0 after observation of the fourth sucker in the arms (10 dph approximately) and at 20 and 40 dph from the improved mixed diet (M) treatment. In the Artemia-based dietary experimental trial and suboptimal culture conditions 5 biological replicates (1 paralarvae each one) were sampled at 20 dph. Finally in infection experimental trials 3 biological replicates (1 individual paralarvae each one) of newly hatched paralarvae and also 40 dph paralarvae were sampled at 1 4 and 24 h post-exposure to V. lentus and similar sampling procedure was performed after exposure to OsHV-1 at 0 dph.

All animal experiments were performed according to the Spanish law RD53/2013 within the framework of European Union directive on animal welfare (Directive 2010/63/EU) for the protection of animals employed for experimentation and other scientific purposes following the Guidelines for the care and welfare of cephalopods published by Fiorito et al.14 and approved by the Ethic Committee of the National Competent Authority (project number: CEIBA 2017-0249 for culture experiments and project number: CEIBA2014-0108; ES360570202001/17/EDUC FORM 07/CGM01 for infection experiments).

RNA isolation

Total RNA was extracted for both pooled embryos and individual paralarvae using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific® Waltman MA USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Library preparation and Illumina sequencing

Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB USA) (Fig. 1b). Index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Briefly mRNA was purified from total RNA (1 µg) using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5x). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H). Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. In the reaction buffer dNTPs with dTTP were replaced by dUTP. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3′ ends of DNA fragments NEBNext Adaptor with hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 250~300 bp in length the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter Beverly USA). Then 3 µL USER Enzyme (NEB USA) was used with size-selected adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37 °C for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95 °C before PCR. PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase Universal PCR primers and Index Primer. Finally products were purified (AMPure XP system) and library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system.

The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using PE Cluster Kit cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation the library preparations were sequenced on the Illumina platform Novaseq where non-stranded and paired-end reads were generated. A total of 46 libraries were constructed and sequenced (Supplementary File 1): 21 libraries including one pool of different developmental stages of embryos (EMB) and 5 biological replicates of paralarvae fed on improved mixed diet and sampled at different stages: after hatching (OP_0) after observation of the fourth sucker in the arms at approximately 10 dph (OPM_4s) and at 20 and 40 dph (OPM_20 and OPM_40); 5 libraries of 20 dph paralarvae fed on Artemia-based diet (OPA_20); 5 libraries corresponding to the suboptimal culture conditions at 20 dph (OS_20); and 15 libraries corresponding to the infection trials: 3 biological replicates per infection condition (24 hours post-exposure) including V. lentus viral OsHV-1 infection and control at 0 dph (VL_0 OsHV_0 C_0) and V. lentus and control at 40 dph (VL_40 and C_40). Subsequent bioinformatic analyses are represented in Fig. 1c and described in the following subsections.

Raw reads quality control

Clean data were obtained by removing reads with adaptor contamination and/or index codes reads containing uncertain nucleotides in a proportion higher than 10% (N > 10%) and low quality reads when nucleotides with base quality less than 20 constituted more than 50 percent of the read. The error rate (e) for each base was transformed using Phred score (Q phred = −10log 10 (e)). The relationship between Phred score and base quality was established with the Illumina CASAVA v1.8 software. Simultaneously Q20 Q30 GC content and sequence duplication level of the clean data were calculated.

Transcriptome reconstruction and hierarchical clustering

Clean reads from the 46 libraries were assembled in a global reference transcriptome. The left files (read1 files) from all libraries/samples were pooled into one big left.fq file and right files (read2 files) into one big right.fq file. Transcriptome assembly was accomplished based on the left.fq and right.fq using Trinity software46 with min_kmer_cov set to 2 and all other parameters set by default. Assembled contigs were clustered following Corset47 based on shared reads. The parameters use for each tool and program utilized for bioinformatic analysis are detailed in the Supplementary File 1.

Transcript functional annotation

Gene function was annotated based on the following databases: Nr (NCBI non-redundant protein sequences) Nt (NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequences) Pfam (Protein family) KOG/COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) Swiss-Prot (A manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database) KO (KEGG Orthology database) and GO (Gene Ontology). The software and parameters used in each database were as follows: Nt with NCBI blast 2.2.28 + (E-value threshold of 10−5); Nr Swiss-Prot and KOG using Diamond 0.8.22. For Nr and Swiss-Prot databases the E-value threshold was 10−5 and 10−3 for KOG; the prediction of protein structure domain (Pfam) was evaluated with HMMER 3.0 package (E-value threshold of 0.01) and based on the protein annotation results of Nr and Pfam the GO annotation was carried out using Blast2GO v2.548 (E-value threshold of 10−6). Finally KEGG Automatic Annotation Server was used to form the KEGG annotation (E-value threshold of 10−10).

Quantification of gene expression levels

Gene expression levels were estimated by RSEM49 for each sample using as reference the global de novo transcriptome filtered by Corset. Briefly clean data from each library were mapped back onto the assembled transcriptome using the aligner software Bowtie50 to obtain the readcounts for each unigene after mapping. Gene expression level was transformed into FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced) values.

It can be hard getting excited about Intel whether the company is dominating as it did in the 2010s or floundering as it is in the 2020s; it’s pretty difficult for people to fall in love with the status quo or a large company that loses to smaller ones. The opposite is true for Intel’s rival AMD which has always been the underdog and everyone (usually) loves the underdog.

But Intel couldn’t become the monolithic giant it is today without being a hot and innovative upstart once upon a time. Every now and then Intel has managed to shake things up on the CPU scene for the better. Here are six of Intel’s best CPUs of all time.

Intel 8086

Intel becomes a leader

The Intel 8086 basically ticks all the boxes for what makes a CPU great: It was a massive commercial success it represented significant technological progress and its legacy has endured so well that it’s the progenitor of all x86 processors. The x86 architecture is named after this very chip in fact.

Although Intel claims the 8086 was the first 16-bit processor ever launched that’s only true with very specific caveats. The 16-bit computing trend emerged in the 1960s by using multiple chips to form one complete processor capable of 16-bit operation. The 8086 wasn’t even the first single-chip processor with 16-bit capability as other CPUs having been pipped at the post by the General Instrument CP1600 and the Texas Instruments TMS9900. In actuality the 8086 was rushed out to put Intel on even ground with its rivals and finally came out in 1978 after a development period of just 18 months.

Initially sales for the 8086 were poor due to pressure from competing 16-bit processors and to address this Intel decided to take a gamble and embark on a massive advertising campaign for its CPU. Codenamed Operation Crush Intel set aside $2 million just for advertising through seminars articles and sales programs. The campaign was a great success and the 8086 saw use in about 2500 designs the most important of which was arguably IBM’s Personal Computer.

Equipped with the Intel 8088 a cheaper variant of the 8086 the IBM Personal Computer (the original PC) launched in 1981 and it quickly conquered the entire home computer market. By 1984 IBM’s revenue from its PC was double that of Apple’s and the device’s market share ranged from 50% to over 60%. When the IBM PS/2 came out the 8086 itself was finally used along with other Intel CPUs.

The massive success of the IBM PC and by extension the 8086 family of Intel CPUs was extremely consequential for the course of computing history. Because the 8086 was featured in such a popular device Intel of course wanted to iterate on its architecture rather than make a new one and although Intel has made many different microarchitectures since the overarching x86 instruction set architecture (or ISA) has stuck around ever since.

The other consequence was an accident. IBM required Intel to find a partner that could manufacture additional x86 processors just in case Intel couldn’t make enough. The company Intel teamed up with was none other than AMD which at the time was just a small chip producer. Although Intel and AMD started out as partners AMD’s aspirations and Intel’s reluctance to give up ground put the two companies on a collision course that they’ve stayed on to this day.

Celeron 300A

The best budget CPU in town

In the two decades following the 8086 the modern PC ecosystem began to emerge with enthusiasts building their own machines with off-the-shelf parts just like we do today. By the late 90s it became pretty clear that if you wanted to build a PC you wanted Windows which only ran on x86 hardware. Naturally Intel became an extremely dominant figure in PCs since there were only two other companies with an x86 license (AMD and VIA).

In 1993 Intel launched the very first Pentium CPU and it would launch CPUs under this brand for years to come. Each new Pentium was faster than the last but none of these CPUs were particularly remarkable and definitely not as impactful as the 8086. That’s not to say these early Pentiums were bad they were just meeting standard expectations. This was all fine until AMD launched its K6 CPU which offered similar levels of performance as Pentium CPUs for lower prices. Intel had to respond to AMD and it did so with a brand-new line of CPUs: Celeron.

At first glance Celeron CPUs didn’t appear to be anything more than cut-down Pentiums with a lower price tag. But overclocking these chips transformed them into full-fledged Pentiums. CPUs based on the Mendocino design (not to be confused with AMD’s Mendocino-based APUs) were particularly well regarded because they had L2 cache just like higher-end Pentium CPUs albeit not nearly as much.

Of the Mendocino chips the 300A was the slowest but could be overclocked to an extreme degree. In its review Anandtech was able to get it to 450MHz a 50% overclock. Intel’s 450MHz Pentium II sold for about $700 while the Celeron 300A sold for $180 which made the Celeron extremely appealing to those who could deal with the slightly lower performance that resulted from having less L2 cache. Anandtech concluded that between AMD’s K6 and Intel’s Celeron the latter was the CPU to buy.

In fact the 300A was so compelling to Anandtech that for a while it just recommended buying a 300A instead of slightly faster Celerons. And when the 300A got too old the publication started recommending newer low-end Celerons in its place. Among Anandtech’s CPU reviews from the late 90s and early 2000s these low-end Celerons were the only Intel CPUs that consistently got a thumbs up; even AMD’s own low-end CPUs weren’t received as warmly until the company launched its Duron series.

Core 2 Duo E6300

The empire strikes back

Although Intel had an extremely strong empire in the late 90s cracks were beginning to appear starting in the year 2000. This was the year Intel launched Pentium 4 based on the infamous NetBurst architecture. With NetBurst Intel had decided that rapidly increasing clock speed was the way forward; Intel even had plans to reach 10GHz by 2005. As for the company’s server business Intel launched Itanium the world’s first 64-bit implementation of the x86 architecture and hopefully (for Intel) the server CPU everyone would be using.

Unfortunately for Intel this strategy quickly fell apart as it became apparent NetBurst wasn’t capable of the clock speeds Intel thought it was. Itanium wasn’t doing well either and saw slow adoption even when it was the only 64-bit CPU in town. AMD seized the opportunity to start carving out its own place in the sun and Intel began rapidly losing market share in both desktops and servers. Part of Intel’s response was to simply bribe OEMs to not sell systems that used AMD but Intel also knew it needed a competitive CPU as the company couldn’t keep paying Dell HP and others billions of dollars forever.

Intel finally launched its Core 2 series of CPUs in 2006 fully replacing all desktop and mobile CPUs based on NetBurst as well as the original Core CPUs that launched solely for laptops earlier in the year. Not only did these new CPUs bring a fully revamped architecture (the Core architecture had almost no resemblance to NetBurst) but also the first quad-core x86 CPUs. Core 2 didn’t just put Intel on an equal footing with AMD it put Intel back in the lead outright.

Although high-end Core 2 CPUs like the Core 2 Extreme X6800 and the Core 2 Quad Q6600 amazed people with high performance (the X6800 didn’t lose a single benchmark in Anandtech’s review) there was one CPU that really impressed everyone: the Core 2 Duo E6300. The E6300 was a dual-core with decent overall performance but just like the 300A it was a great overclocker. Anandtech was able to overclock its E6300 to 2.59GHz (from 1.86GHz at stock) which allowed it to beat AMD’s top-end Athlon FX-62 (another dual core) in almost every single benchmark the publication ran.

The Core 2 series and the Core architecture revived Intel’s technological leadership the likes of which hadn’t been seen since the 90s. AMD meanwhile had a very difficult time catching up let alone staying competitive; it didn’t even launch its own quad-core CPU until 2007. Core 2 was just the beginning though and Intel had no desire to slow down. At least not yet.

Core i5-2500K

Leaving AMD in the dust

Unlike NetBurst Core wasn’t a dead end which allowed Intel to iterate and improve the architecture with each generation. At the same time the company was also creating new manufacturing processes or nodes at a steady pace. This gave rise to the “tick-tock” model with the “tick” representing a process improvement and the “tock” representing an architectural improvement. The first Core 2 CPUs were a tock (since they used the same 65nm process as NetBurst) and later Core 2 CPUs were a tick since they were manufactured on the 45nm process.

By 2011 Intel had already gone through two full cycles of tick-tock delivering better and better CPUs like clockwork. Meanwhile AMD was having an extremely hard time catching up. Its new Phenom chips finally brought quad-cores (and later hexa-cores) to AMD’s lineup but these CPUs were rarely (if ever) performance leaders and AMD returned to its old value-oriented strategy. The pressure was on for AMD when Intel launched its 2nd Gen CPUs in 2011.

Codenamed Sandy Bridge 2nd Gen Core CPUs were a tock and significantly improved instructions per clock (or IPC) in addition to increasing frequency itself. The end result was a 10-50% performance improvement over 1st Gen CPUs. Sandy Bridge also had pretty decent integrated graphics and was the first CPU to introduce Quick Sync a video encoding accelerator.

In its Core i7-2600K and Core i5-2500K Anandtech recommended the 2500K over the 2600K. The 2500K was just $216 had most of the performance of the 2600K (which cost $100 more) and beat pretty much every single last generation chip except for the workstation-class Core i7-980X. To this day the 2500K is remembered fondly as a midrange CPU with lots of performance for a good price.

Meanwhile AMD was simply left in the dust; Anandtech didn’t even mention Phenom CPUs as a viable alternative to 2nd Gen. AMD needed to launch a CPU that could compete with Sandy Bridge if it wanted to be more than just the budget alternative. Later in 2011 AMD finally launched its new FX series based on the Bulldozer architecture.

It went poorly for AMD. The flagship FX-8150 could sometimes match the Core i5-2500K but overall it was slower especially in single-threaded benchmarks; sometimes it even lost to old Phenom CPUs. Overall Bulldozer was a disaster for both AMD and PC users. Without a competitive AMD to keep its rival in check Intel could do basically whatever it wanted something which Anandtech was worried about:

“We all need AMD to succeed” it said in its coverage at the time. “We’ve seen what happens without a strong AMD as a competitor. We get processors that are artificially limited and severe restrictions on overclocking particularly at the value end of the segment. We’re denied choice simply because there’s no other alternative.”

Unfortunately that prediction would prove all too accurate.

Core i7-8700K

Intel gets with the times

Although Sandy Bridge was great it heralded a dark age for PC users who had always expected the next generation would be faster and cheaper than the last. But with AMD out of the picture Intel had no reason to offer better CPUs for less. Over the next six years Intel only offered quad-cores on its mainstream platforms and always for the same price: $200 for the i5 and $300 for the i7. Furthermore as Anandtech predicted Intel started locking down its CPUs more aggressively than ever before. All i3 grade processors up until 2017 had no overclocking support whatsoever and it didn’t take long for most i5s and i7s to get the same treatment.

Things got very frustrating by the time Intel’s 7th Gen Kaby Lake came out in early 2017. According to the tick-tock model Intel should have launched a 10nm CPU using a similar architecture as 14nm 6th Gen Skylake CPUs from 2015. Instead 7th Gen CPUs were identical to 6th Gen CPUs: same old 14nm process same old Skylake architecture. With this Intel announced the end of the tick-tock model and introduced the process-architecture-optimization model with 7th Gen being the optimization. People were understandably not happy with Intel as even generational improvements were ending.

It was ultimately up to AMD to change the situation and shake things up and it definitely did when it launched Ryzen just a couple of months after 7th Gen CPUs came out. Based on the new Zen architecture Ryzen 1000 CPUs finally got AMD back into the game thanks to good enough single-threaded performance and extremely high multi-threaded performance bringing eight high-performance cores to the mainstream for the first time. Intel’s competing 7th Gen did hold a lead in single-threaded applications and gaming but not enough to make Zen the new Bulldozer. For the first time in years Intel was compelled to offer something truly new and worthwhile.

Intel took Ryzen very seriously and rushed a new generation out the door as soon as it could. The 7th Gen only lasted for 9 months before it was replaced by 8th Gen Coffee Lake which was yet another optimization of Skylake but with even higher clock speeds and crucially more cores. Core i7 CPUs now had 6 cores and 12 threads Core i5s had 6 cores and 6 threads and Core i3s had 4 cores and 4 threads (which was identical to the old i5s). But one thing that didn’t change was the price which meant the value of 8th Gen was much much higher than that of prior Core CPUs.

Equipped with the fast single-threaded performance of the 7700K and an extra two cores the Core i7-8700K was Intel’s best flagship in years. Against AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X the 8700K was only a little behind in multi-threaded benchmarks and significantly ahead in everything else. Techspot concluded “it almost wasn’t even a contest.” At $360 it was also $100 cheaper than AMD’s flagship. The 8700K was a very well-rounded CPU with a relatively low price; if the 8700K was anything else it simply wouldn’t have been nearly as good.

The outlook for Intel was dreary however. Already with 8th Gen CPUs the process-architecture-optimization model was a failure as 8th Gen was the second optimization in a row. When 10nm Cannon Lake CPUs finally came out in 2018 it became clear that Intel’s latest process was extremely broken. How many more optimizations would Intel go through before it finally did something new?

It turns out quite a few.

Core i9-12900K

A much-needed comeback

In 2018 10nm was only suitable for barely functioning mobile chips. Things improved in 2019 when Intel launched its mobile Ice Lake CPUs but these were just quad-cores with decent integrated graphics; nowhere near desktop grade. Things improved again in 2020 with the launch of 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors which were an optimization of Ice Lake with even better graphics but still not good enough for the desktop.

Intel desperately needed 10nm desktop CPUs. Its 14nm process was very old and prevented increases in core counts and clock speed. In contrast AMD had gone from strength to strength with Ryzen 3000 Zen 2 CPUs and then Ryzen 5000 Zen 3 processors each more impressive than the last and now even stealing the gaming performance crown from Intel. It needed a comeback in a big way.

Finally in late 2021 Intel launched its first 10nm CPUs for the desktop 12th Gen Alder Lake. These CPUs were radically different from previous ones; its hybrid architecture combined large and powerful performance cores (or P-cores) with smaller and more efficient efficiency cores (or E-cores) delivering incredibly multi-threaded performance for the top chips and much-improved single-threaded performance for everything else.

The Core i9-12900K Intel’s new flagship sported a core configuration of 8 P-cores plus 8 E-cores making it both great at multi-threaded tasks and single-threaded tasks. In our review we found that the 12900K didn’t just put Intel on an equal footing with AMD but firmly back in the lead in every single metric. The Ryzen 9 5950X which launched as an expensive and premium flagship suddenly looked like a budget alternative but the 12900K was also much cheaper. Describing Alder Lake as a comeback is an understatement.

The only downside was that the 12900K (and Alder Lake in general) was a year late to the party and it also consumed a lot of power a sign that 10nm wasn’t quite ready for prime time. But nevertheless the renewal of competition had a very positive effect for basically everyone. Ryzen 5000 CPUs fell in price to match Intel and AMD finally launched new models for budget buyers in response to lower-end Alder Lake CPUs like the Core i5-12400 which was $100 cheaper than the 5600X while also being significantly faster. Alder Lake proved once again that we need both Intel and AMD to compete otherwise PC users get a bad deal.

Intel’s uncertain future

Alder Lake is about one year old now and Intel is following it up with Raptor Lake: an optimization. It’s a bit disappointing but Intel isn’t about to return to its old practices as 13th Gen CPUs offer more cores than 12th Gen for the same price which is similar to what happened with 8th Gen. Raptor Lake isn’t super exciting and it might not be fast enough to retake the lead from AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series but everyone can agree that more cores for the same price is a good deal.

But further beyond Intel’s future is uncertain. The company is apparently making good progress on its 7nm process (officially named Intel 4) which will debut in Meteor Lake but I’ve expressed some concerns over Intel’s strategy. With such a complex design that incorporates no less than four different processes I feel very uncomfortable with how many points of failure Meteor Lake has. Hopefully Intel executes its future CPUs just fine with this design philosophy because it can’t afford any more delays.

Even if Meteor Lake is a success though it’s hard to see Intel returning to the level of domination it has historically enjoyed. Earlier this year AMD surpassed Intel in market cap which means AMD is no longer an underdog but a full-fledged competitor. In this new era of the Intel-AMD rivalry we’ll have to see how things go when both companies compete as equals. Intel is still shrinking in size and ceding market share to AMD but hopefully it can remain an equal and not disintegrate any further. In theory a balance of power could be the best outcome for everyone.

The files are contained in a 2.8 GB zip file that expands to 5.86 GB after decompression but we haven't been able to verify if the contents therein are genuine and actually contain sensitive source code.

UPDATE (10/9/2022): In a new story we have reported that Intel has now confirmed the leak is legitimate and security researchers are analyzing the code for vulnerabilities.

News of the purported leak comes via Twitter postings from @glowingfreak and @vxunderground. We have reached out to Intel for comment.

The source code to the Intel Alder Lake has been leaked online.* Alder Lake CPU was released November 4 2021* Source code is 2.8GB (compressed)* Leak (allegedly) from 4chan* We have not reviewed the entirety of the code base it is massiveOctober 8 2022

The file appears to contain a plethora of files and tools geared for building a BIOS/UEFI for Intel's Alder Lake platform and chipsets. It is unclear where the leaker obtained the files but one of the documents does refer to ""Lenovo Feature Tag Test Information."" A few other clues have also emerged via the git log.

Even if the files are proven to include sensitive material it's unclear if they could be used to develop exploits — especially if it was obtained from a source external to Intel. It's easy to imagine that most motherboard vendors and OEMs would have similar tools and information available to build firmware for Intel platforms and Intel would likely scrub any overly-sensitive material before releasing it to external vendors. That said any sensitive material in the hands of nefarious actors is never good and small bits of information can lead to big vulnerabilities. Especially if it pertains to security features like the TPM (Trusted Platform Module).

While we don't know how the files were obtained recent hacks have targeted outside vendors to steal information from semiconductor manufacturers indirectly thus enabling ransom attempts.



The spate of recent attacks includes an attempt by RansomHouse to extort AMD after it obtained 56GB of data. AMD partner Gigabyte also had 112 GB of sensitive data stolen in the infamous 'Gigabyte Hack' but AMD refused to pay the ransom for the latter hack. As a result information about AMD's forthcoming Zen 4 processors was divulged before launch which later proved genuine.

Nvidia also suffered a recent attack that resulted in the theft of 1TB of its data but the GPU-making giant retaliated with its own operations to render the stolen data useless.

Alder Lake is the name of Intel's 12th generation Intel Core processors released in November 2021.

On Friday a Twitter user named 'freak' posted links to what was said to be the source code for Intel Alder Lake's UEFI firmware which they claim was released by 4chan.

The link led to a GitHub repository named 'ICE_TEA_BIOS' that was uploaded by a user named 'LCFCASD.' This repository contained what was described as the 'BIOS Code from project C970.'

Leaked Alder Lake BIOS source code

Source: BleepingComputer

The leak contains 5.97 GB of files source code private keys change logs and compilation tools with the latest timestamp on the files being 9/30/22 likely when a hacker or insider copied the data.

BleepingComputer has been told that all the source code was developed by Insyde Software Corp a UEFI system firmware development company.

The leaked source code also contains numerous references to Lenovo including code for integrations with 'Lenovo String Service' 'Lenovo Secure Suite' and 'Lenovo Cloud Service.'

At this time it is unclear whether the source code was stolen during a cyberattack or leaked by an insider.

However Intel has confirmed to Tom's Hardware that the source code is authentic and is its ""proprietary UEFI code.""

""Our proprietary UEFI code appears to have been leaked by a third party. We do not believe this exposes any new security vulnerabilities as we do not rely on obfuscation of information as a security measure. This code is covered under our bug bounty program within the Project Circuit Breaker campaign and we encourage any researchers who may identify potential vulnerabilities to bring them our attention through this program. We are reaching out to both customers and the security research community to keep them informed of this situation."" - Intel spokesperson.

Security researchers concerned

While Intel has downplayed the security risks of the source code leak security researchers warn that the contents could make it easier to find vulnerabilities in the code.

""The attacker/bug hunter can hugely benefit from the leaks even if leaked OEM implementation is only partially used in the production"" explains hardware security firm Hardened Vault.

""The Insyde’s solution can help the security researchers bug hunters (and the attackers) find the vulnerablity and understand the result of reverse engineering easily which adds up to the long-term high risk to the users.""

Positive Technologies hardware researcher Mark Ermolov also warned that the leak included a KeyManifest private encryption key a private key used to secure Intel's Boot Guard platform.

While it is not clear if the leaked private key is used in production if it is hackers could potentially use it to modify the boot policy in Intel firmware and bypass hardware security.

BleepingComputer has contacted Intel Insyde and Lenovo with questions about the leak and whether the private keys were used in production.

WWE Intercontinental Champion GUNTHER has addressed the controversy surrounding his title defence against Sheamus on SmackDown.

Towards the end of the October 7 title bout Sheamus had GUNTHER trapped in his Cloverleaf submission hold. The Imperium leader appeared to tap the mat twice before grabbing the rope to break the hold.

While some argued that GUNTHER had conceded the match via submission the official didn’t call the bout as GUNTHER only hit the mat twice before reaching the ropes.

GUNTHER ultimately retained his gold after striking Sheamus with a shillelagh behind the ref’s back.

On Twitter GUNTHER shared a WWE post questioning whether or not the Ring General tapped replying:

“Obviously no!”

As previously noted Sheamus had called the finish a ‘screwjob’ during his first reactions to the finish. The Irish star has now followed up with:

“The Austrian Tap Machine Tapped the Tap that was heard around the world… #screwjob #hetappedout #guntapper”

Western commodity futures markets started trading in England during the 16th century but the nation's first official commodity trading exchange the London Metals and Market Exchange was not established until 1877.

Commodities markets were created to reduce the risks born by both producers and wholesalers. Farmers got a price guarantee up front and the cash to carry them through until the harvest. Wholesalers were assured of an adequate supply of the product they needed at a set price when they needed it. Both parties took some risk that they could have gotten a better deal if they'd waited.

That original purpose has not altogether disappeared but today's trading in futures is an investment class all on its own and most of the buyers have no intention of accepting the delivery of a ton of wheat or a herd of cows.

Futures Trading in the U.S.

The United States got its earliest official commodity trading exchange in the West in 1848. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was created as railroads and the telegraph service established fast connections from the agricultural marketplace hub of Chicago to New York and other cities in the eastern U.S.

The first traded futures contracts in the U.S. were for corn. Wheat and soybeans markets followed. These three core agricultural commodities still account for the bulk of trading business conducted at the CBOT.

The next large market for trading futures contracts was the cotton market. Forward contracts in cotton began trading in New York in the 1850s leading eventually to the establishment of the New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE) in 1870.

Futures contracts for other products developed over time including cocoa orange juice and sugar. The growth in U.S. cattle production led to the creation of futures markets for beef and pork.

Modern Futures Markets

The 1970s saw a great expansion in futures trading markets.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) started offering futures trading in foreign currencies. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) traded T-bonds. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) began offering trading in various financial futures including crude oil and natural gas. The Commodities Exchange (COMEX) provided futures trading in gold silver and copper and later added platinum and palladium when gold ceased to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.

The rapid expansion of trading in financial futures led to the creation of futures contracts on the Dow Jones and S&P 500 stock indexes.

Although there are now futures trading exchanges worldwide the U.S. exchanges remain the most widely traded due in large part to the fact that two of the most heavily traded markets are the U.S. bond market and the wheat market.

When Did Futures Markets Begin in the U.S.? Futures markets became established in the U.S. in the 19th century. The railroad and telegraph systems made it possible to create central hubs for agricultural trade in the Midwest where much of the nation's food supply was grown and in the eastern states where its financial and business centers were established. The result was a more efficient way to buy and sell food in wholesale quantities for delivery to consumers at retail.

What Commodities Are Bought and Sold in the Futures Markets? In the U.S. the big three are and always have been corn wheat and soybeans. But the futures markets proved adaptable to many kinds of products from precious metals and oil to lumber. Financial futures are a later addition. They include stock futures foreign currency futures and interest rate futures among others. In other countries the major commodities are natural outgrowths of their economic strengths. In Australia it's wool. In Malaysia it's palm oil.

What Are Commodities? Commodities can be defined as raw materials that are needed to produce finished goods. By definition a commodity is fungible. That is there is no way to differentiate a commodity from one producer from the same commodity offered by a different producer. An ounce of gold is an ounce of gold.

The Bottom Line

Futures markets developed as a way for farmers and wholesalers to make a deal that benefitted both despite the volatile and uncertain nature of agriculture. They began as wholesale markets but developed over time into vehicles for investors.

Today's futures markets are global and fully electronic. Certainly wholesalers still buy futures contracts but many of today's futures buyers have no intention of taking possession of the goods they are contracting to buy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9yYWlsLW5vcnRoZXJuLWdlcm1hbnktc3RhbmRzdGlsbC1kdWUtdGVjaG5pY2FsLWlzc3VlLTIwMjItMTAtMDgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Malicious and targeted' sabotage halts rail traffic in northern Germany,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rail-northern-germany-standstill-due-technical-issue-2022-10-08/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9yYWlsLW5vcnRoZXJuLWdlcm1hbnktc3RhbmRzdGlsbC1kdWUtdGVjaG5pY2FsLWlzc3VlLTIwMjItMTAtMDgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9jdWx0dXJlLW5ld3MvYW5uYS1kZWx2ZXktcmVsZWFzZWQtaWNlLWN1c3RvZHktZGVwb3J0YXRpb24tMTIzNDYwNzc2OC_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvY3VsdHVyZS1uZXdzL2FubmEtZGVsdmV5LXJlbGVhc2VkLWljZS1jdXN0b2R5LWRlcG9ydGF0aW9uLTEyMzQ2MDc3NjgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anna Delvey Released From ICE Custody Still Faces Possible Deportation,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9jdWx0dXJlLW5ld3MvYW5uYS1kZWx2ZXktcmVsZWFzZWQtaWNlLWN1c3RvZHktZGVwb3J0YXRpb24tMTIzNDYwNzc2OC_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvY3VsdHVyZS1uZXdzL2FubmEtZGVsdmV5LXJlbGVhc2VkLWljZS1jdXN0b2R5LWRlcG9ydGF0aW9uLTEyMzQ2MDc3NjgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC9DE7A60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9jdWx0dXJlLW5ld3MvYW5uYS1kZWx2ZXktcmVsZWFzZWQtaWNlLWN1c3RvZHktZGVwb3J0YXRpb24tMTIzNDYwNzc2OC_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2xsaW5nc3RvbmUuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvY3VsdHVyZS1uZXdzL2FubmEtZGVsdmV5LXJlbGVhc2VkLWljZS1jdXN0b2R5LWRlcG9ydGF0aW9uLTEyMzQ2MDc3NjgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml3bWJ1enouY29tL3RlY2gvbmV3LW5va2lhLTVnLXNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtd2l0aC1zdHVubmluZy1mZWF0dXJlcy8yMDIyLzEwLzA50gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaXdtYnV6ei5jb20vdGVjaC9uZXctbm9raWEtNWctc21hcnRwaG9uZS13aXRoLXN0dW5uaW5nLWZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Nokia 5G Smartphone With Stunning Features,"New Nokia 5G Smartphone With Stunning Features

“Our goal is to advance screenings and medical care to reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer” said Janice Ryba CEO of St. Mary Medical Center. “We are thrilled to offer the Ion system and expect outcomes with this program to be exceptional.”

The Intuitive Ion endoluminal system is designed to address a challenging aspect of lung biopsy by enabling physicians to obtain tissue samples from deep within the lung. The Ion system features an ultra-thin ultra-maneuverable catheter that allows navigation far into the peripheral lung and unprecedented stability enables the precision needed for biopsy compared to manual techniques.

During bronchoscopy with Ion a certified physician uses the controller to navigate to the target along a digitally planned path. The catheter can articulate 180 degrees in any direction to pass through small difficult-to-navigate airways and around tight bends to reach all 18 segments of the lung.

“The investment in this technology complements our robotic-assisted surgical program enabling patients to receive all care – from biopsy to surgery – at St. Mary Medical Center” Ryba continued.

Ion is built on more than two decades of success in robotic-assisted technology by Intuitive the maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical system.

“With Ion the procedure allows for more precision more reach more stability – and more answers sooner” said Bilal Safadi MD an Ion-certified pulmonologist with Community Care Network Inc. on staff at St. Mary Medical Center. “Our patients benefit from diagnosis and treatment in the same day rather than having biopsies first and scheduling surgery for a later date. This is crucial to early treatment. ”

The Ion system is one of the numerous comprehensive cancer care options at the hospitals of Community Healthcare System which includes Community Hospital in Munster; St. Catherine Hospital in East Chicago; St. Mary Medical Center in Hobart and Community Stroke & Rehabilitation Center in Crown Point.

Who among us while planning a vacation has not used Booking.com in order to get competitive pricing for hotels cars or flights. So it is more than disappointing to see yet another company go political in an attempt to conform to what is now expected amongst businesses who are feeling the need to appear socially virtuous in today’s corporate woke atmosphere.

Asserting that it is “company policy to add such a disclaimer to all areas considered to be a ‘conflict zone’” (Some shriek some shrug at Booking.com settlements ‘warning’ on jpost.com) when speaking about Israel’s territories beyond the green line they suddenly feel compelled to warn their customers who seek to travel to those places. But what was seen by the international company as an important disclaimer ended up greatly angering many Israeli politicians – a move which will undoubtedly also offend and repel Israeli customers as well as many Zionistic supporters worldwide.

The warning which is scheduled to appear as early as this week will be posted on the Booking.com website stating that “visiting the area may be accompanied by an increased risk to safety and human rights or other risks to the local community and visitors.” When speaking to Ynet the company further elaborated as to why they found it necessary to take this measure explaining “Certain areas affected by conflict may pose a greater risk to travelers so we provide our customers with information that helps them make decisions and encourage them to check their government’s official travel guidelines as part of the decision-making process.”

A quick view of the Booking.com website shows a statement put out by the company which expresses its commitment to human rights as it respects a particular code of conduct for corporate social responsibility. Within that statement there is a section dedicated to modern slavery practices which includes the following wording: “We recognize that Modern Slavery in all its forms including slavery human trafficking forced labor debt bondage descent-based slavery servitude child slavery and forced and early marriage is a global issue and an increasing problem. In fact they state that there is a zero-tolerance approach within their own company for such practices and while that is good to hear I was unable to find a warning about booking a vacation in China where such practices against the Uyghur community is known to take place.

Nor does there seem to be a warning against discrimination and persecution of gays in Saudi Arabia another venue where the company services its customers.

They do make a point of stating “Our commitment to respect and promote human rights is based on internationally recognized standards and principles including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.” That sounds about right because internationally recognized standards and principles as well as the U.N. have a great track-record of exercising the hypocrisy of double standards when it comes to Israel while often turning a blind eye as they ignore real human rights abuses. Also it’s important to note that “settlements” in the West Bank are considered a violation of international law so these are the standards which Booking.com is choosing to recognize although the company doesn’t go as far as referring to the area as “the occupied territories.”

While most hotels and Airbnb’s located beyond Israel’s green line may not be too reliant upon Booking.com for their day-to-day businesses it is likely not lost on them that this new warning stems from pressure by political groups to both curtail tourism to those areas as well as be a punitive measure towards Israel which is very much the hallmark of the BDS Movement (Boycott Divestment and Sanctions of Israel).

As one tour guide put it “Just by doing it they are highlighting the fact that there is a tourism industry and tourism services in Judea and Samaria.” (JPost 10/2/22)

But the question is – why would Booking.com even choose to get into this fray? Does it have an upside for them? Because offending customers is something which should be prevented at all costs.

While this is only speculation it could be that they are going the route of ESG (Environmental Social and Governance) a new distinction used to showcase a company’s commitment to those same international ethical standards which Booking.com is committed to preserve.

But as those three foundational pillars of environmental concerns social interaction amongst customers and communities as well as governance showing transparency aspire to become the acid test for obtaining high scores amongst businesses many see it as a new way to control companies and customers in order to get them to conform to the desired behaviors being imposed on them.

The term ESG was first voiced by the United Nations Environment Program Initiative but in recent days has quickly gained support as the wave of the future for businesses who hope to enhance their global reputation and standing.

What is important is that there is a rating system which determines whether or not you are seen as an ethical company in which to do business. Seventy or above is considered a good score while anything under fifty is bad. As more and more companies are getting on the ESG bandwagon feeling the pressure to conform to these new expectations it’s entirely possible that this is a major consideration for Booking.com which sees their new warning policy as a step forward towards enhancing their social interaction rating as well as their transparency score.

After all such companies as Microsoft Accenture J.B. Hunt Texas Instruments Oracle Hewlett-Packard Adobe Nike Apple Mattel Costco Facebook Goldman Sachs and Chipotle are among those who have already decided that there is indeed an upside to being in corporate lockstep with the new demands that they believe afford them the respect and admiration of those who are committed to the same values of more socially woke businesses.

It would seem that Booking.com is becoming a true believer in those same principles and has found a way to achieve higher ratings. It’s just sad that it’s at the expense of Israel the only true democracy in the Middle East.",,,,,,,,,,,,

She was 72.

Mrs. Rich was born in Newark to Phyllis and Joseph Jacobs in 1949. She grew up in West Orange and graduated from West Orange High School in 1967.

She went on to earn her bachelor of arts in English from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor her master’s in the teaching of reading from New York University and her principal certification from Montclair State College.

Mrs. Rich was a dedicated public school teacher for many years starting her career at Satellite Academy High School in Manhattan. Later she was an adjunct professor at Bloomfield College and then worked for more than a decade as a high school English teacher in the Paterson public schools. She led a troop of high school-aged Girl Scouts for many of those years.

Her love and enthusiasm for public education also led her to an appointment on the Montclair Board of Education where she served one term. Even after her stint on the board she was a volunteer booster and supporter of PTAs and Montclair High School activities and athletics.

Over the years Mrs. Rich was an active member of the League of Women Voters and board member of the Montclair Fund of Educational Excellence.

After retiring from teaching her favorite hobbies were traveling binge-watching British murder-mysteries and spoiling and spending time with her grandchildren. She was also a steadfast believer in the Democratic Party and frequently got worked up about the sorry state of the world and of the nation’s political system.

Mrs. Rich is survived her husband Robert of Montclair; her brother Hank Jacobs of New York City; her sister-in-law Ilene Rich of New York City; her son Benjamin Rich (Karen Ancharski) of Washington D.C.; her daughter Joanna Bunting (Daniel) of London and five grandchildren Jacob and Mark Rich and Paul Hannah and Adam Bunting.

She was preceded in death by her parents.

A funeral service will be held at Temple Ner Tamid 936 Broad St. Bloomfield at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday Oct. 9 with burial to follow at Beth Israel Memorial Park in Woodbridge.

Shiva will be held at the Rich home from 7 to 9 p.m. on both Monday Oct. 10 and Tuesday Oct. 11.

Visiting a new town overrun with ducks two women are told that stepping on one will lead to dire consequences. One woman disregards the warning and is forced to spend an eternity with an ugly old man.

The other treads lightly and is ultimately rewarded with a handsome suitor.

“I don’t know what I did to deserve this” she says eyes cast to the heavens.

“I don’t know either” the man replies. “But I stepped on a duck.”

The joke was told by a classmate of Mark’s during a 90-minute vigil Sept. 29—two years to the day since Mark and his brother Jacob 8 were struck and killed in a Westlake Village crosswalk. The classmate a student at Ascension Lutheran School told the joke to a crowd of 250 or so gathered at Three Springs Park.

“I’ve heard all of (Mark’s) jokes many many times” Iskander said in an interview after the vigil. “He loved telling jokes. He told jokes every day on our way to school in the car. And whenever I took him to a work function everybody would be around Mark telling jokes and nobody would be talking to me.”

She said the one about the ducks is her favorite “and I’m so glad it was told today. It’s a really funny one.”

Levity wasn’t hard to find amid the sorrow that Thursday afternoon as friends relatives and officials from the city and the Los Angeles County sheriff’s and fire departments gathered to remember the boys and show support for their parents Nancy and Karim.

The event included guests writing messages on wooden hearts and hanging them like leaves blowing in the wind on remembrance trees.

Several people spoke about Mark’s humor and Jacob’s inquisitiveness.

Mariam Girgis the boys’ Sunday school teacher said it was Mark who opened her eyes to why being a teacher was right for her.

He was in her very first class when she had been asked to fill in for someone else. Full of doubt Girgis took on the task.

By the end of the class which included a lesson on King David Girgis put any doubt behind her and finally was able to relax—because she had “survived” the day.

“Then a small hand shot up from a few pews back” she said. It was a tiny boy in the second grade who until this moment was sort of hiding behind the other kids.

“Mark had not just heard the lesson. He had heard it and he had pondered it and he was now ready to unleash a series of incredibly thoughtful questions that were very challenging to answer” Girgis said fighting back tears.

“The lesson’s core sentiment was about loving everyone we meet and Mark wanted to make absolutely certain that he was clear on how he could apply this to his personal life.”

The class didn’t end until Mark had achieved total clarity along with everybody else including Girgis.

“I left that day a completely different person” she said. “I rushed home and I told my mom all about Mark. I told her about this precious boy who challenged me and opened my eyes and made me very aware of the blessing we received when we agreed to serve Christ. . . . I didn’t understand the magnitude of the blessing until I met Mark.”

Some of the people who showed up for the vigil wanted to support the family as the criminal case against the hit-and-run driver Rebecca Grossman continues two years later.

“We don’t know the (Iskander) family we just know the circumstances” said Rich deAnda a retired LAPD detective who came to the park with his wife Deborah.

Julie Cohen who organized the vigil didn’t know the Iskanders before the tragedy. Ever since she’s been a front-and-center supporter showing up for every court hearing in Van Nuys.

She’s also a mother of two and said it’s the “bond of brothers” that inspired her to want to help.

“Although my boys are grown when I look at Mark and Jacob I see my boys” she said.

Talking to the crowd the Rev. Cyril Gorgy the boys’ priest at Archangel Michael Coptic Orthodox Church in Simi Valley said that despite their short time on Earth their impact locally and abroad will live on through the Mark and Jacob Iskander Foundation.

“A person can live to 90-plus years old and may have only an impact on their immediate family” he said. “But here we have two beautiful angels that by their lives are impacting many generations to come here and across the globe.

“By the legacy of Mark and Jacob many orphans in Egypt will have a better future and by the legacy of Mark and Jacob many children will have access to fresh clothing and nutritional meals and necessities of life.”

Gorgy urged the crowd to hold the boys in their prayers and to do the same “for the people who caused the tragedy.”

The vigil ended with Nancy Iskander joining brothers Joseph and John Wisa—best friends of and respectively the same ages as Mark and Jacob—in a release of white doves.

“In the name of the father the son and the Holy Spirit amen” said Iskander before the trio with her husband at her side sent the birds flying.

Afterward Iskander who opened the vigil with a prayer said she wants Mark and Jacob to be remembered as loving life and loving God.

Her final message was one that could bring comfort to anyone experiencing trying times.

“I want everyone who sees me on my feet to know whatever they’re struggling with in life they’ll be OK” she said. “They’ll be on their feet as well.”"

We know construction season is a frustrating inconvenience for drivers and we always look for creative opportunities to mitigate that inconvenience” said Mayor Rod Roberson. “I am very impressed with our crew at Public Works; Engineering Streets and Traffic. Their ingenuity is saving millions of dollars and greatly minimizes the traffic disruptions on one of Elkhart’s busiest roads.

But some people living in front of the road construction are frustrated.





It's one of Elkhart's busiest streets and that's why city officials say they wanted to get work done on the major road --and fast. Doing something they have never done before having crews work non-stop for five days straight.

Those who live or drive on Johnson St. in Elkhart know the road has been anything but smooth for some time now. The city has taken proactive steps to repave it by implementing a continuous 5-day round-the-clock construction project to make necessary improvements.

I understand that the road needed done.. it really did. I mean we hear the semi truckers when they come through. They really needed it done. I just feel like it needed a little bit more planning and just a tiny bit more prolonged"" said Lesta Fry who lives nearby.

Fry says while the neighborhood did get a letter of notice for the project they didn't realize it would be 24/7.

""I was upset that all during the night that they were working and during the day they didn’t work as much so like our house shook our bedroom shook all of the glass and window shook and then I have a dog so he was very upset"" said Fry.



Fry says the redirected traffic to their backstreets has been chaotic seeing aggravated drivers speed through alleys.

Jeanelle Landells says she's had to find a new way around this week.

""If I want to go anywhere that way I have to either go all the way down like I use the ally or the street over here to get through Kroger’s and go around Beardsley street or I have to go all the way up through the back roads down to Bristol to get around anywhere so that’s been really inconvenient"" said Landells.



While frustrated those in the neighborhood know the project needed to get done and are thankful it will be done tomorrow.

“I’d rather have a couple of days than a couple of weeks which it definitely could’ve been so it makes it a lot easier to deal with knowing that It’s going to be over quickly"" said Landells.

There will be a ribbon cutting Friday to unveil the brand-new Johnson St. improvements.

Yesterday it was “offensive weapon” Michael Johnson Jr. who announced he was transferring from Florida Atlantic to join his father in Syracuse.

Johnson started his career at Penn State before heading to FAU. Last season he was listed as a quarterback at FAU but Johnson only attempted one pass in ten games. On the ground he carried the ball 23 times for 140 yards and 7 touchdowns.

Based on the tweet above it would appear that we could see Johnson in special packages to utilize his skill set. At 6’2” and 215 pounds he could line up under center in goal line or short yardage situations where Syracuse can make use of his ability to run the ball."

(AP) — No. 4 Michigan won Saturday with heart for Mike Hart.

After the running game coordinator collapsed on the sideline in the first quarter the Wolverines regrouped at halftime returned to Wolverines football and performed like Hart wanted.

Cornelius Johnson’s 29-yard touchdown reception early in the third quarter gave Michigan the lead and the jolt it needed Saturday to celebrate a 31-10 victory over pesky Indiana without their beloved coach.

“During the game Mike had a medical emergency he’s in stable condition and he’s going to stay overnight here in Bloomington for observation” head coach Jim Harbaugh said. “Talking about Mike and his health all our prayers go out to him.”

Hart’s absence dampened a historic day for the Wolverines (3-0 Big Ten) who improved to 6-0 for the second straight season — something they last did in 1976-77.

But the frightening first-quarter sideline scene certainly took its toll on Michigan.

The school’s career rushing leader went down unexpectedly moments after the Hoosiers tied the score at 7 prompting Michigan’s players to clear the bench and spread out across the field. Some dropped to one knee as Harbaugh and other staff members watched trainers strap Hart to a backboard before carting him off the field.

Hart flashed the thumbs up sign before leaving Memorial Stadium and heading to a hospital.

Michigan wasn’t the same afterward.

The two teams traded field goals and blocked field goals before settling for a 10-10 halftime tie. The Wolverines didn’t reassert control until Johnson capped a 98-yard drive to start the second half with the first of two touchdown catches.

It was exactly what Michigan needed. Luke Schoonmaker and Johnson each caught fourth-quarter TD passes to seal the victory on a day J.J. McCarthy produced his first 300-yard game. The sophomore quarterback finished 28 of 36 with 304 yards three TDs and one interception.

“It was good to see the young quarterback come of age today” Harbaugh said. “Tough game tight game couldn’t lean on the ground game today and he did it.”

The Wolverines second-half defense was equally dominant. It allowed just 29 total yards in the second half and constantly harassed Indiana quarterback Connor Bazelak. Michigan finished with seven sacks.

Indiana (3-3 1-2) lost its third straight and coach Tom Allen wasn’t pleased with how his team played the final 15 minutes.

“We had a chance in the fourth quarter against the fourth-ranked team in the country a really good team and didn’t finish” Allen said. “That’s highly disappointing. Scoring zero points in the second half is not enough and it’s got to change.”

Allen also had Hart on his staff from 2017-20 and walked across the field to see Hart before he left the stadium. McCarthy said the Wolverines awarded a game game ball to their running backs coach and Harbaugh acknowledged Hart would be missed on the trip home.

“We’ll move on with humble hearts” Harbaugh said. “It’s great to have the win and continue to pray for Mike. He’s a strong guy I have all the faith in the world in Mike Hart.”

THE TAKEAWAY

Michigan: The Wolverines have faced some strong tests in this series recently and they did again Saturday. But Michigan clearly did not play its best ball as the nation’s sixth-best scoring offense struggled to score.

Indiana: Allen’s team played its best first half of the season but still hasn’t played a complete game all season. The defense and special teams as usual kept Indiana close. What they’re lacking: a consistent offense.

POLL IMPLICATIONS

Michigan is still unbeaten but it’s shield of invincibility took a major hit against an Indiana team that wasn’t even at full strength on offense or defense. The powerful ground game was mostly stymied. The constant has been the defense and it was every bit as good as advertised. It will be interesting to see if the voters punish Michigan for a less-than-stellar showing.

STAT PACK

Michigan: Ronnie Bell had 11 receptions for 121 yards while Schoonmaker caught nine passes for 67 yards. Blake Corum rushed for 124 yards on 25 carries picking up 50 on his first run of the day. Corum also had a 1-yard TD run his 11th of the season.

Indiana: Bazelak was 25 of 49 with 203 yards one TD and one interception. Freshman Jaylin Lucas had four carries for 45 yards on a day the Hoosiers ran 25 times for 19 yards. Emery Simmons caught seven passed for 57 yards and Josh Henderson caught an 11-yard TD pass.

UP NEXT

Michigan: Returns home next Saturday for a showdown with No. 10 Penn State.

Indiana: Welcomes Maryland to Bloomington next Saturday.

I have an extensive relationship with JP Morgan Chase Bank but when running into an issue with wire services a crack was exposed in otherwise stellar customer service and it’s concerning.

Don’t Get Me Wrong I Like Chase

Many travelers like me utilize the bank for their excellent Chase credit cards. Over the years my relationship JPMorgan Chase Bank (NA) has grown to a variety of products including savings accounts business credit cards and even Chase Private Client checking. I have a number of business accounts with the bank and to this point I have been a happy customer.

The bank has been an essential tool for me and my family but especially also for my businesses. I contemplated not writing this post at all because outside of one particular area of the bank they’ve done fantastically.

But my experience with Chase Wire Services has been so appalling that I can’t possibly ignore it anymore.

Chase Wire Services Customer Service Is A Problem

One of my businesses has staff in Armenia and I have well documented that here. I have transferred between my Chase account and my corresponding account in that country numerous times so that I can distribute to contractors. I have made this transfer more than a dozen times every one of them has been initially delayed but then arrived sometime within the next 2-3 days. While I don’t love the fact that such regular transactions are first delayed 100% of the time and that I can’t accurately predict when they will ultimately arrive they have all made it eventually.

In early August I made the same drop-down wire transfer I always have. As always it was delayed but this time it never arrived. What’s worse Chase showed this transfer as completed. We gave it a few days and then inquired further. Here are some steps and events we’ve taken along the way:

Branch Meetings – I’ve met with multiple branches and multiple account executives managers and support staff. I’ve spent roughly 12 hours of my time and Chase staff’s time in this effort.

Secure Messages – I have sent a number of secure messages the “only” way to communicate with Chase Wire services is through secure messages through the app or website. (What does an old-school luddite do? Nothing they literally have no way to communicate with wire staff during an issue)

Branch Escalations – I have been dealing with the same “Jessica” who is calling on a recorded and monitored line and she calls daily to tell me that Wire Services has done nothing. She was calling weekly but after week three I wanted her to call me every day because I figured that if she or her boss looked at how much time was being spent on this issue something would get done. We talk every day and I was wrong. After about a dozen or so calls they finally researched a successful transfer but not the one in question. Cool.

Twitter – I’ve reached out

Everyone at Chase claims that the wire department doesn’t have a phone neither for internal purposes nor for customers to connect with them. I’ve heard everything from security concerns to thousands of open but unfilled positions at the bank due to COVID as a reason why the wire department literally doesn’t have a phone.

Seems unlikely.

When I follow the instructions and use secure messages the bank claims that they cannot reach anyone at the destination bank (incorrect they have not contacted them we have agents there.) They have researched the wrong wires. They have marked the case as closed and resolved as the money was delivered – though it obviously was not and I can prove that. They suggested that the recipient (me) was lying and that it had actually arrived.

Whether it’s COVID (it’s a little long in the tooth to still play this one) or security this approach is not working. The copy-and-paste answers from the secure message team don’t address the problem they often don’t even address the right transfer. Branch staff is so helpless that it makes me lose confidence in my entire Chase relationship.

I actually suggested that I should take Chase to small claims court. Even if I would lose it would still get the attention of their legal staff who might take out a calculator and figure out that their time is worth more than either just actually investigating what happened or giving me the money back that they said was wired but wasn’t. At least one branch manager said I should do just that.

It really isn’t this hard to send wires. In fact I used my Chase debit card to send a Moneygram and the money was there instantly for about the same fee. No delay. No waiting. If I have an issue with Moneygram I can connect with their staff online through chat and resolve the issue.

The escalations agent I deal with stated that similar issues take an average of two months to resolve (which we have already crossed) and that blows my mind. How is this profitable for the bank?

The bigger issue for me is that even if this failed transfer is returned as it should be (it’s been recalled and “is being sent back to me” for several weeks) I can’t rely on Chase to send the money a) on time b) predictably c) and be assured it will arrive ever or d) if something goes wrong that they will make it right.

What’s The Solution?

The solution is fairly simple.

The wire team needs to be contactable at least internally. If secure messages are going to be the way consumers communicate Chase needs to respond to the issue. The wire team has to be open to investigating the matter. The wire team has to be held accountable if and when they make an error. That’s not happening because I can prove they’ve made an error and there’s no one at Chase that can hold them to account.

Archaic problems like this will be why cryptocurrencies actually take off more than anything else. There’s no excuse for this in the modern era at all. The bank has all of the tracking information and none of the gumption to simply track it and correct the problem.

Conclusion

If Jamie Dimon had any clue as to the experience I have had (and likely many many others) I have no doubt he would do something about it right away. If his nephew had a wire go awry and told him over a Labor Day BBQ (this issue was already a month old by then) he’d be appalled and something would be done. Instead neither branch reps escalations nor wire services can seem to get it together. I am too small of a customer to care about so maybe it’s time I find a bank that will help me out when they make a mistake. What else can one do? My businesses customers and contractors deserve better than Chase feels bothered to deliver.

Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Owns These 31 Dividend Aristocrats,"Buffett has positions in more Dividend Aristocrats than Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings reveal.

Warren Buffett loves dividends. His beloved Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.77%) (BRK.B 0.59%) owns quite a few dividend stocks. Three of them have track records of at least 25 years of dividend increases.

But you might be surprised about how many members of dividend royalty the legendary investor really owns. Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds 31 Dividend Aristocrats.

Like Baskin-Robbins

Just what is Buffett's ""secret portfolio""? In 1995 investment firm New England Asset Management (NEAM) was acquired by General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re). Three years later Berkshire bought Gen Re. NEAM doesn't hide its equity holdings; it reports them on a regular basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However these stocks are often overlooked by Buffett's followers even though they are owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

When it comes to Dividend Aristocrats these ""secret"" Buffett stocks are like Baskin-Robbins ice cream: They come in 31 flavors. Below are all 31 of the Dividend Aristocrats in NEAM's portfolio:

Company Sector Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 3M Industrials 64 Abbott Laboratories Healthcare 50 AbbVie Healthcare 50 Air Products & Chemicals Materials 40 Automatic Data Processing Information Technology 47 Becton Dickinson Healthcare 50 Chevron CVX -0.21% ) Energy 35 Church & Dwight Consumer Staples 26 Coca-Cola Consumer Staples 60 Emerson Electric Industrials 65 ExxonMobil Energy 39 General Dynamics Industrials 25 Illinois Tool Works Industrials 58 International Business Machines Information Technology 28 Johnson & Johnson Healthcare 60 Kimberly-Clark Consumer Staples 50 Linde Materials 29 Lowe's Consumer Discretionary 48 McCormick Consumer Staples 36 McDonald's Consumer Discretionary 45 Medtronic Healthcare 45 NextEra Energy Utilities 28 PepsiCo Consumer Staples 50 PPG Industries Materials 50 Procter & Gamble Consumer Staples 66 Realty Income Real Estate 28 S&P Global Financials 49 Sysco Consumer Staples 53 Target Consumer Discretionary 50 VF Corp. Consumer Discretionary 48 Walmart Consumer Staples 49

Several of the stocks on the list belong to an even more exclusive club than the Dividend Aristocrats -- the Dividend Kings. These stocks have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.

Biggest bets

Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" holds relatively small positions in most of these 31 Dividend Aristocrats. Chevron though stands out as a notable exception. As of the end of the second quarter of 2022 NEAM owned more than 2.15 million shares of the oil and gas giant.

Chevron also ranks as one of Berkshire's biggest bets. It's now the third-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and has performed well so far this year.

NEAM doesn't have huge stakes in any of the other Dividend Aristocrats. The next two after Chevron are AbbVie and Procter & Gamble. At the end of Q2 NEAM owned 75345 and 71551 shares of these two stocks respectively.

Best of the bunch

It isn't easy to pick the best of these Dividend Aristocrats. I think that Chevron is one of the stocks directly owned by Berkshire Hathaway that is also in NEAM's portfolio that's most likely to soar in the fourth quarter. My reasoning is that oil prices will move higher and provide a catalyst for the top energy stocks.

There are also some unstoppable trends that could benefit a few stocks on this list. For example an aging population should drive increased demand for products developed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The shift to clean energy should work to Air Products' advantage as it produces blue and green hydrogen.

Many of these stocks will probably be big winners over the next decade and beyond though. The power of growing dividends to boost total returns is no secret at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvdXJuYWwtbmV3cy5uZXQvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9iYXJiYXJhLWotcm9zZS9hcnRpY2xlXzc5ZjlhYzJhLTljZGQtNTBkNS1iOGMxLTEwNWVhNjA4NTk5YS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barbara J.

To flush or not to flush?

It is a question Canada’s Competition Bureau says it cannot answer.

Three years ago Friends of the Earth Canada and lawyers from Ecojustice filed a grievance with the bureau saying the makers of 20 disposable wipes were falsely advertising the products as safe to flush down the toilet.

In February the Competition Bureau informed FoE in a letter that it was closing its inquiry because it’s not clear what it really means to be “flushable.”

“There are a number of competing guidelines about when a product can be considered to be disposable in municipal sewer systems” the letter reads.

FoE CEO Beatrice Olivastri called that “totally unacceptable.”

The FoE complaint was partly based on a study done at Toronto Metropolitan University which tested 23 different wipes products marketed as flushable and biodegradable and concluded none of them lived up to the claim.

They included baby wipes wet wipes for older kids and adults toilet brush cleaning cloths and diaper liners.

Ms. Olivastri said the Competition Bureau didn’t contact any of the organizations or experts cited in the complaint including the study’s authors or the International Water Services Flushability Group an association of water utilities and professionals that has developed a standard for what is truly flushable.

The complainants say the only other “standard” that exists was created by the makers of the wipes themselves and those haven’t been accepted by any municipalities in Canada or any waste water professionals anywhere in North America.

Citing confidentiality the bureau won’t say what its investigation found or who was interviewed.

Julie Baribeau a spokeswoman for the Competition Bureau told The Canadian Press in an e-mail while the investigation has ended the bureau “does not endorse the representations made about ‘flushability’ or the tests used to evaluate this feature.”

Wipes have become the bane of municipal waste water system operators around the world.

Massive blockages made up heavily of flushed wipes that are glued together by cooking fats and other oils put down the drain have been dubbed “fatbergs” in Britain. In 2019 a “fatberg” the length of a passenger jet weighing more than 90 tonnes backed up sewers in Liverpool.

Earlier this year British media reported that an island the size of two tennis courts and made up mostly of wet wipes was actually changing the course of the Thames River.

The National Association of Clean Water Agencies in the U.S. said in 2020 it was costing municipal waste water systems $441-million a year in extra operating costs for cleanup and clogs because of wipes.

The city of Calgary reported getting 7200 calls to remove blockages from sewers in 2021 and single-use wipes were the biggest culprit.

In the United States a number of class-action lawsuits have been filed against wipes makers.

Nine days before the Competition Bureau in Canada closed its investigation citing a lack of evidence a U.S. judge approved a settlement in a case against Kimberly-Clark Corp. brought by the city of Charleston S.C.

Kimberly-Clark did not respond to a request for comment on the Canadian investigation but in 2019 a spokesman told The Canadian Press the company stood by its claims that its Cottonelle wipes were indeed flushable.

Some U.S. states now have laws forcing manufacturers to include labels on all disposable wipes that they are not to be flushed.

Ms. Olivastri FoE CEO said Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne can review the Competition Bureau’s decision to suspend its investigation in Canada.

But in an e-mailed statement Mr. Champagne’s spokesman said the minister will not be asking the bureau to reconsider.

“Investigations under the Competition Act are carried out independently by the Competition Bureau” the statement reads.

“They hold discretion as to how or whether to proceed with a matter based on the evidence before it.”

The British government may be the first to solve the standards issue.

In January the U.K. launched a “call for evidence” seeking policy advice to handle the wet wipe dilemma including for “mandatory flushability standards” and the possibility of banning certain types of wipes completely.

In June then-environment minister Rebecca Pow told the British House of Commons the response to that call was “huge” and the department was now working its way through the advice.

“I say to everybody ‘If you don’t need to use a wet wipe don’t. And don’t chuck them down the loo” Ms. Pow said.

By Stephen Nellis Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper

(Reuters) -The Biden administration published a sweeping set of export controls on Friday including a measure to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment vastly expanding its reach in its bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances.

The rules some of which take immediate effect build on restrictions sent in letters this year to top toolmakers KLA Corp Lam Research Corp and Applied Materials Inc effectively requiring them to halt shipments of equipment to wholly Chinese-owned factories producing advanced logic chips.

The raft of measures could amount to the biggest shift in U.S. policy toward shipping technology to China since the 1990s. If effective they could hobble China's chip manufacturing industry by forcing American and foreign companies that use U.S. technology to cut off support for some of China's leading factories and chip designers.

""This will set the Chinese back years"" said Jim Lewis a technology and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) a Washington D.C.-based think tank who said the policies harken back to the tough regulations of the height of the Cold War.

""China isn't going to give up on chipmaking ... but this will really slow them (down).""

In a briefing with reporters on Thursday previewing the rules senior government officials said many of the measures were aimed at preventing foreign firms from selling advanced chips to China or supplying Chinese firms with tools to make their own advanced chips. They conceded however that they had not secured any promises that allied nations would implement similar measures and that discussions with those nations are ongoing.

""We recognize that the unilateral controls we're putting into place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don't join us"" one official said. ""And we risk harming U.S. technology leadership if foreign competitors are not subject to similar controls.""

The expansion of U.S. powers to control exports to China of chips made with U.S. tools is based on a broadening of the so-called foreign direct product rule. It was previously expanded to give the U.S. government authority to control exports of chips made overseas to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and later to stop the flow of semiconductors to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday the Biden administration applied the expanded restrictions to China's IFLYTEK Dahua Technology and Megvii Technology companies added to the entity list in 2019 over allegations they aided Beijing in the suppression of its Uyghur minority group.

The rules published on Friday also block shipments of a broad array of chips for use in Chinese supercomputing systems. The rules define a supercomputer as any system with more than 100 petaflops of computing power within a floor space of 6400 square feet a definition that two industry sources said could also hit some commercial data centers at Chinese tech giants.

Eric Sayers a defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute said the move reflects a new bid by the Biden administration to contain China's advances instead of simply seeking to level the playing field.

""The scope of the rule and potential impacts are quite stunning but the devil will of course be in the details of implementation"" he added.

Companies around the world began to wrestle with the latest U.S. action with shares of semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers falling.

The Semiconductor Industry Association which represents chipmakers said it was studying the regulations and urged the United States to ""implement the rules in a targeted way - and in collaboration with international partners - to help level the playing field.""

Earlier on Friday the United States added China's top memory chipmaker YMTC and 30 other Chinese entities to a list of companies that U.S. officials cannot inspect ratcheting up tensions with Beijing and starting a 60 day-clock that could trigger much tougher penalties.

Companies are added to the unverified list when U.S. authorities cannot complete on-site visits to determine if they can be trusted to receive sensitive U.S. technology forcing U.S. suppliers to take greater care when shipping to them.

Under a new policy announced on Friday if a government prevents U.S. officials from conducting site checks at companies placed on the unverified list U.S. authorities will start the process for adding them to the entity list after 60 days.

Entity listing YMTC would escalate already-rising tensions with Beijing and force its U.S. suppliers to seek difficult-to-obtain licenses from the U.S. government before shipping them even the most low-tech items.

The new regulations will also severely restrict export of U.S. equipment to Chinese memory chip makers and formalize letters sent to Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) restricting shipments to China of chips used in supercomputing systems that nations around the world rely on to develop nuclear weapons and other military technologies.

Reuters was first to report key details of the new curbs on memory chip makers including a reprieve for foreign companies operating in China and the moves to broaden restrictions on shipments to China of technologies from KLA Lam Applied Materials Nvidia and AMD.

South Korea's industry ministry said in a statement on Saturday there would be no significant disruption to equipment supply for Samsung and SK Hynix's existing chip production in China.

However it was necessary to minimise uncertainty through consultation with U.S. export control authorities it added.

On Saturday China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called the move an abuse of trade measures designed to reinforce the United States' ""technological hegemony"".

The Biden administration on Friday published a sweeping set of export controls including a measure to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with US equipment vastly expanding its reach in its bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances.The rules some of which go into effect immediately build on restrictions sent in letters earlier this year to top toolmakers KLA Corp Lam Research Corp and Applied Materials Inc effectively requiring them to halt shipments of equipment to wholly Chinese-owned factories producing advanced logic chips.The raft of measures could amount to the biggest shift in US policy toward shipping technology to China since the 1990s. If effective they could hobble China's chip manufacturing industry by forcing American and foreign companies that use US technology to cut off support for some of China's leading factories and chip designers.""This will set the Chinese back years"" said Jim Lewis a technology and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) a Washington D.C.-based think tank who said the policies harken back to the tough regulations of the height of the Cold War.""China isn't going to give up on chipmaking ... but this will really slow them (down).""In a briefing with reporters on Thursday previewing the rules senior government officials said many of the measures were aimed at preventing foreign firms from selling advanced chips to China or supplying Chinese firms with tools to make their own advanced chips.They conceded however that they had not secured any promises that allied nations would implement similar measures and that discussions with those nations are ongoing.""We recognize that the unilateral controls we're putting into place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don't join us"" one official said. ""And we risk harming US technology leadership if foreign competitors are not subject to similar controls.""The expansion of US powers to control exports to China of chips made with US tools is based on a broadening of the so-called foreign direct product rule. It was previously expanded to give the US government authority to control exports of chips made overseas to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and later to stop the flow of semiconductors to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.On Friday the Biden administration applied the expanded restrictions to China's IFLYTEK Dahua Technology and Megvii Technology companies added to the entity list in 2019 over allegations they aided Beijing in the suppression of its Uyghur minority group.The rules published on Friday also block shipments of a broad array of chips for use in Chinese supercomputing systems. The rules define a supercomputer as any system with more than 100 petaflops of computing power within a floor space of 6400 square feet a definition that two industry sources said could also hit some commercial data centers at Chinese tech giants.Eric Sayers a defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute said the move reflects a new bid by the Biden administration to contain China's advances instead of simply seeking to level the playing field.""The scope of the rule and potential impacts are quite stunning but the devil will of course be in the details of implementation"" he added.Companies around the world began to wrestle with the latest US action with shares of semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers falling.The Semiconductor Industry Association which represents chipmakers said it was studying the regulations and urged the United States to ""implement the rules in a targeted way - and in collaboration with international partners - to help level the playing field.""Earlier on Friday the United States added China's top memory chipmaker YMTC and 30 other Chinese entities to a list of companies that US officials cannot inspect ratcheting up tensions with Beijing and starting a 60 day-clock that could trigger much tougher penalties.Companies are added to the unverified list when US authorities cannot complete on-site visits to determine if they can be trusted to receive sensitive US technology forcing US suppliers to take greater care when shipping to them.Under a new policy announced on Friday if a government prevents US officials from conducting site checks at companies placed on the unverified list US authorities will start the process for adding them to the entity list after 60 days.Entity listing YMTC would escalate already-rising tensions with Beijing and force its US suppliers to seek difficult-to-obtain licenses from the US government before shipping them even the most low-tech items.The new regulations will also severely restrict export of US equipment to Chinese memory chip makers and formalize letters sent to Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) restricting shipments to China of chips used in supercomputing systems that nations around the world rely on to develop nuclear weapons and other military technologies.Reuters was first to report key details of the new restrictions on memory chip makers including a reprieve for foreign companies operating in China and the moves to broaden restrictions on shipments to China of technologies from KLA Lam Applied Materials Nvidia and AMD.South Korea's industry ministry said in a statement on Saturday that there will be no significant disruption to equipment supply for Samsung and SK Hynix's existing chip production in China although it was necessary to minimise uncertainty through consultation with US export control authorities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hhcnAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3VzLWNoaW5lc2UtbWlsaXRhcnktY2hpcC1iYW4v0gE-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVjaGFycC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvdXMtY2hpbmVzZS1taWxpdGFyeS1jaGlwLWJhbi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Targets Chinese Military With New Chip Export Ban!,"Spread the love

The US government just imposed sweeping chip and chipmaking export restrictions that target Chinese military capabilities!

US Targets Chinese Military With New Chip Export Ban!

On Friday October 7 2022 the US government announced new regulations on computer chips and chipmaking technologies designed to target Chinese military capabilities.

The stated goal of these new export restrictions is to “block the People’s Liberation Army and China’s domestic surveillance apparatus from gaining access to advanced computing capabilities that require the use of advanced semiconductors.”

According to US officials these rules target not only the sale and export of chips but also the tools and software that might help the Chinese military in any way including aiding the development of weapons of mass destruction.

Unlike earlier rules that target specific Chinese companies (like HUAWEI) the new rules have far greater reach covering everything from chips made by AMD and NVIDIA to complex and expensive hardware and software used to design and manufacture semiconductor chips.

These rules some of which go into effect immediately build on existing restrictions that were earlier applied to top chip toolmaking companies in the US like KLA Corporation Lam Research Corporation and Applied Material Incorporated.

It’s not just advanced chips used for AI computing and national security or military applications that are being targeted.

The new rules are more generic and forbid US companies from selling technologies to indigenous Chinese companies that will enable the production of:

DRAM chips at 18 nm or below

NAND flash chips at 128 layers or above and

logic chips at 14 nm or below.

Even foreign companies operating China are somewhat affected. US companies will need to obtain a license to export more advanced equipment to them.

But in a concession to South Korea the US government will spare SK Hynix and Samsung from these measures. US companies will be able to continue supplying their production facilities in China.

Many of the rules aim to block foreign companies from selling advanced chips or chipmaking technologies and tools to China. However the US government will need to “lean” on those countries to introduce similar measures.

Most advanced chips are manufactured in South Korea and Taiwan. If they continue to export to China they will allow China to bypass US restrictions.

Chinese Government Criticised US Chip Export Ban

On Saturday the Chinese government criticised the new US chip export ban calling it a violation of International economic and trade rules that will “isolate and backfire” on the US.

Out of the need to maintain its sci-tech hegemony the U.S. abuses export control measures to maliciously block and suppress Chinese companies. It will not only damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies but also affect American companies’ interest. – Mao Ning Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson

Despite Mao’s assertions that US actions will not stop China’s progress the new wide-ranging chip and chipmaking export ban will undoubtedly be detrimental to the Chinese semiconductor industry and set back its attempts at indigenous production by many years.

On the other hand this export ban will spur China to redouble its efforts to develop its own chipmaking capabilities and possibly “strike back” by restricting exports of rare earths to US companies.

US Chip Export Rules Affecting Chinese Companies Summarised

Here is a summary of the new restrictions that take effect on Friday (October 7 2022):

Tools that are capable of producing logic chips made using fin field-effect transistors (FinFET) are blocked from sale to China.

Tools capable of fabricating NAND flash storage chips with 128-layer technology or greater and DRAM based on 18-nanometer half-pitch or less technology are blocked from sale to China.

Servicing and maintenance of restricted tools are also banned which would prevent keeping advanced equipment in good enough shape to keep producing quality chips at high volume.

US citizens currently servicing or supporting tools on the restricted list must halt their activities by Wednesday October 12.

Export of items that China can use to make its own chip manufacturing tools such as a photolithography light source and other specialised components are also blocked from sale to China.

The US Commerce Department also enacted these additional measures on Friday:

31 Chinese entities were added to the Unverified List which consists of companies that the US government believes could divert technology that they purchase to restricted entities.

The Commerce Department expanded the scope of controls for the 28 Chinese firms already on the US Entity List including presumptively denying any licenses because of the risk they will divert technology to the Chinese military.

Then two weeks later these restrictions will take effect on Friday October 21 2022:

Using a new foreign direct product rule the U.S. will block any chips that used in advanced computing and artificial intelligence applications.

The foreign direct product rule can block chips made by non-US companies — including Chinese chip designers — if they use American technology or software.

TSMC may be forced by this new rule to halt production on advanced AI or supercomputer chips designed by Chinese firms that are fabricated in Taiwan unless it gets an exemption.

A new foreign direct product rule will apply to components and chips destined for supercomputers in China.

Fresh off their first loss of the season at Ole Miss the No. 13 Wildcats (4-1 1-1 Southeastern Conference) will try to beat the Gamecocks (3-2 0-2) for a third consecutive year. The teams are scheduled to kick off at 7:30 p.m. Saturday from Kroger Field.

All eyes this week have been on UK quarterback Will Levis amid reports he could miss Saturday's game due to an undisclosed foot injury he suffered during last week's game in Oxford Mississippi. Levis also dislocated the middle finger of his left (non-throwing) hand during last week's game in Oxford Mississippi.

Head coach Mark Stoops on Thursday did not rule Levis out against South Carolina but said ""I don’t know anybody that can predict the future."" If Levis is unable to play redshirt freshman Kaiya Sheron who starred at Somerset High School is likely to get the nod at quarterback.

Sunday October 9 2022 || By Michael Romain || @maywoodnews

In the last three years there have been at least three major warehouses and fulfillment centers opened in the nine-suburb Village Free Press readership area. But more workspace doesn’t necessarily translate into more jobs a recent report by IBD Weekly shows.

In fact giant e-commerce companies and retailers forced to do business in a virtual shopping landscape dominated by Amazon are pushing at breakneck speed to make warehouse work autonomous.

And the “holy grail of warehouse automation is a so-called ‘lights-out’ operation” IBD Weekly reports. “That’s a warehouse that runs without humans inside and can even operate literally with the lights out” (an idea that experts say is at least a decade away from realization IBD reports).

The reason for this rush to automate? There’s high demand for next-day and same-day delivery but the supply of workers willing and able to work in warehouses and fulfillment centers is diminishing.

IBD Weekly reported that leaked Amazon internal research warned that the e-commerce giant could run out of people to hire in its U.S. warehouses by 2024 adding that ”high worker turnover and employee dissatisfaction at its fulfillment centers” are part of why worker turnover is so high.

In August there were 505000 job openings in transportation and warehousing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. In the same month 244000 workers in that sector of the economy quit their jobs — “an all-time high” IBD reported.

And yet “the demand for new warehouses globally is surging” with companies “likely to add 44000 new warehouses over the next five years Interact Analysis shows.” There are already 170000 warehouses with more than 50000 square feet IBD reports.

Suburbs in Proviso Township are right in that global conversation with major warehouses having been built in Melrose Park Bellwood and Maywood since 2020.

Last year Amazon completed a massive multi-building 623000-square-foot distribution center on the site of the old Maywood Park racetrack at 8600 North Ave. in Melrose Park.

Earlier this year Duke Realty completed work on a nearly 300000-square-foot distribution center at 110 N. 25th Ave. in Bellwood. Duke announced last year that they had secured “a long-term lease agreement with a leading snack food manufacturer.”

In July Kroger Co. announced that it was opening an 80000-square-foot distribution center at 1900 Maywood Drive in Maywood.

Two properties ripe for development — the old St. Joe’s campus in Westchester and the 13 acres of land next to CarMax in Hillside dubbed Wolf Point 290 — have attracted serious proposals for either light manufacturing or warehousing.

And last year Crain’s Chicago Business reported that Amazon paid $11.6 million for the former Bosch site at 2800 S. 25th Ave. in Broadview so that it can build a last-mile delivery station.

So far it’s not clear if those plans are still happening. In September amid more and more signs that the economy is headed for a recession Amazon announced that it would close or cancel 44 warehouse facilities and delay the opening of 25 sites. A map of the closures cancellations and delays by CNBC did not include the Broadview site. Amazon representatives could not be immediately reached for comment on Sunday afternoon.

But the demand for warehousing isn’t keeping up with worker turnover particularly At Amazon. In September the company announced that it would increase pay and benefits for frontline workers at its fulfillment centers but it may not be enough to offset a nationwide labor shortage particularly in warehousing.

“The new generation wants to work in offices and in computing” Ash Sharma a senior research director at Interact Analysis a market intelligence firm told IBD Weekly. “They don’t want to be working in warehouses — it’s dirty it’s tiring it’s monotonous it’s not a lot of fun” he said.

And with the national unemployment rate in August at around 3.7% workers have choices. In Proviso Township the unemployment rate was slightly higher at around 4.2%.

As warehouse demand increases and worker supply decreases companies are increasingly looking to automation as a solution to their dilemma.

IBD Weekly reported that Amazon “accounted for 38% of warehouse automation spending in the U.S. last year Interact Analysis says” adding that the company has “ramped up automation in its fulfillment centers after it bought robotics company Kiva Systems in 2012.”

Kroger’s Maywood facility may be at the cutting edge of warehouse automation. In its July announcement the company touted the high-tech environment inside the facility with “more than 1000 bots whizz around giant 3D grids orchestrated by proprietary air-traffic control systems.”

Once orders are packed they’re loaded into a refrigerated delivery van that can store up to 20 orders and “powerful machine-learning algorithms optimize delivery routes considering factors such as road conditions and optimal fuel efficiency.”

The Maywood warehouse is one of 20 highly automated warehouses across the country that Kroger is opening in partnership with the U.K.-based Ocado Group a technology company that provides “end-to-end grocery fulfillment solutions to some of the world’s largest grocery retailers” Kroger representatives announced.

Indeed it can seem as if companies are locked in a robotics arms race. A month before Kroger announced that it was planting its highly automated warehouse in Maywood Amazon announced “several new robotic systems” including “Proteus it’s first fully autonomous mobile robot that moves large carts and Cardinal a robotic arm that identifies and lifts packages and stacks them into carts.”

Some analysts say there could be a bright side to the rush to develop that holy grail “lights-out” operation. IBD Weekly reported that according to some experts more automation could also translate into productivity gains and improved workplace conditions.

But the question though remains. Workplaces for whom? Robots or people?"

(AeroVironment)

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is poised to launch a competitive prototyping effort for a tactical drone after selecting AeroVironment’s Jump 20 earlier this year as an interim option. And according to Army aviation leaders the pool of competitors appears significantly larger than when competition began in 2019.

In 2018 the Army began considering requirements for a replacement for the Textron-made Shadow drone. The aircraft is widely used but is one of the most accident-prone unmanned aerial systems in the service’s inventory. It is also difficult to deploy and has a loud engine allowing for easy detection.

By 2019 the service narrowed the pool of competitors to two: a Martin UAV-Northrop Grumman team and Textron Systems’ AAI. Martin UAV supplied its V-Bat system while Textron offered its Aerosonde HQ.

Shortly after the Army added two more aircraft for evaluation: L3Harris Technologies’ FVR-90 and Arcturus UAV’s Jump 20. In 2021 AeroVironment acquired Arcturus for $405 million.

For about a year operational units evaluated the four different tactical drones culminating in a rodeo in spring 2021 at Fort Benning Georgia.

Two units received Arcturus’ offering while the other systems went to one unit each. That approach was based on the number of systems readily available and the service’s desire to get platforms to five units.

At the Fort Benning rodeo all five units tried each offering to compare them.

“Although the demonstrations were a critical portion of that to inform the requirements they weren’t necessarily going to be used as source selection” Maj. Gen. Robert Barrie the Army’s program executive officer for aviation told Defense News in a recent interview.

Demonstrations wrapped up in the first half of 2021 but it took until August 2022 for the Army to select one company to build an initial tranche of systems. The service was working through requirements an acquisition strategy and waiting for congressionally approved funding.

The Army in August awarded AeroVironment an $8 million contract to pay for one Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System which includes six air vehicles ground data terminals and ground control stations. The system will go to a single brigade combat team.

“Increment 1 ... really represents the current state of industry regarding performance capabilities that are going to get us rapidly deployable runway independent expeditionary [a] vertical takeoff [capability]” Barrie said ahead of the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference. “Increment 1 allows us to field a capability today that’s available.”

Increment 2 in which the Army prepares for a competitive prototyping phase “builds on that with all of those current demonstrated capabilities [but] it’s going to increase range [and] it’s going to incorporate a scalable control interface which [gives] the ability for multiple soldiers in multiple places to be able to control an Increment 2” Barrie said.

The second increment should also offer upgraded sensor capability — “specifically an enhanced laser designator” he added. The system is expected to offer more interoperability through manned-unmanned teaming for example and provide an improved controller interface.

Additionally he noted the second increment must enable organic maintenance of the system so the Army can “break ourselves of contractor logistics support.”

Following the Increment 2 competitive process which will involve multiple vendors the Army plans to choose a winner and buy its system in larger quantities than in Increment 1.

“It will be an incremental downselect [process] to maximize all of the competition” Barrie said.

Maj. Gen. Walter Rugen who manages the Army’s future vertical lift technology development said five units went through one of the longest soldier evaluations the Army has ever done and by the end were “pretty much demanding that technology.”

Because of that demand the Army decided to progress in an incremental fashion providing a unit immediate capability but then competing to pursue what the service considers to be a truly “transformational capability” Rugen said.

The incremental approach and a competition for a second increment are meant to help the Army get the best value for the best capability according to Barrie.

“One could argue: ‘OK [AeroVironment] won … therefore they have a leg up.’ The other side is we have well understood costs and capabilities and limitations with those systems” Barrie added. “So as we go into a competitive environment we will know very well what their system can do and we’ll be able to compare it against other systems.”

Asked whether to expect more industry participation this time around Barrie said: “100% yes. In fact I know we have a bigger pool.”

He wouldn’t provide a specific timeline on the Increment 2 prototyping effort but said decisions will come in fiscal 2023.

According to FY23 Army budget documents the service plans to enter FTUAS Increment 2 competitive prototyping in the first quarter of FY23 and wrap it up in the first quarter of FY25. The Army is slated to make a rapid fielding decision in the second quarter of FY25 and to hold an operational evaluation in the third quarter of FY25. The system is planned to then enter full-rate production in the second quarter of FY26.

The program moved quite rapidly and in April 2019 five companies were involved: AVX Aircraft/ L3Harris Technologies Bell Helicopter Boeing Karem Aircraft and Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky Aircraft. One year after that the Army trimmed the list some more and left in the competition are now Bell and Sikorsky.Bell's entry is called 360 Invictus  and it’ll be the focus of another coverage here on autoevolution at a later time. Today we’ll take a close look at everything we know about Sikorsky’s entry the Raider X.The machine is described as a compound helicopter meaning an aircraft that uses a main propulsion system and an auxiliary one meant to provide extra thrust thus allowing for greater speeds and faster acceleration.With twin counterrotating coaxial rigid rotors on top rotors and a pusher propeller to keep it stable at the rear the helicopter is still a mystery as far as full specifications go. Available info point to it being powered by a General Electric (GE) turboshaft engine capable of developing up to 3000 shaft horsepower – the unit was selected by the Army through the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) which was initiated in 2009 and concluded a decade later.Called T901  the engine is still in development and is the same that will make it into the UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache as a replacement for the T700 units currently in use. In March this year GE announced it has begun testing the T901.Aside from the increase in power (by comparison the T700 is capable of close to 1800 shaft horsepower) the new engine should also provide 25 percent more fuel efficiency and lower lifecycle costs.As said the engine will spin three propellers two of which will form what Sikorsky calls X2 rigid rotor. It’s the same one being tried for the SB-1 Defiant  the company’s entry together with Boeing in the other U.S. Army helicopter program the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA).The X2 concept is not fully and publicly detailed but we do know it can trace its roots all the way back to the XH-59A prototype flown back in the 1970s but with “improvements in vibration reduction weight reduction and blade technology.” We also know the design should enable the helicopter to “be flown by a single pilot with a single engine.”When used on the Raider X (which evolved from something called S-97 Raider which was about 20 percent smaller) the system should transform it into a highly-responsive machine capable of low-speed hover off-axis hover and level acceleration and braking.As a whole the Raider has been designed to be cheaper and easier to operate. This should be achieved by shifting from the usual way maintenance is being conducted to giving the aircraft the tools to self-monitor and engineers the ones they need to provide condition-based maintenance.As far as avionics and mission systems are concerned something called Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA) will be used. This will effectively transform the platform into one that could be upgraded on a plug-and-play basis and that for pretty much all of its most important systems: computing sensors survivability and weapons.As far as military capabilities are concerned nothing is certain or confirmed at the moment. FARA specs required a knife-fighter meaning it should pack the biggest punch in the smallest possible package.At the time of writing there is no estimate as to when the helicopter should be ready for duty. FARA initially called for a flight test evaluation for 2023 and production debut in 2028 but as things usually go in the defense industry that may change.",,,,,,,,,

By Stephen Nellis Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper

(Reuters) -The Biden administration published a sweeping set of export controls on Friday including a measure to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment vastly expanding its reach in its bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances.

The rules some of which take immediate effect build on restrictions sent in letters this year to top toolmakers KLA Corp Lam Research Corp and Applied Materials Inc effectively requiring them to halt shipments of equipment to wholly Chinese-owned factories producing advanced logic chips.

The raft of measures could amount to the biggest shift in U.S. policy toward shipping technology to China since the 1990s. If effective they could hobble China's chip manufacturing industry by forcing American and foreign companies that use U.S. technology to cut off support for some of China's leading factories and chip designers.

""This will set the Chinese back years"" said Jim Lewis a technology and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) a Washington D.C.-based think tank who said the policies harken back to the tough regulations of the height of the Cold War.

""China isn't going to give up on chipmaking ... but this will really slow them (down).""

In a briefing with reporters on Thursday previewing the rules senior government officials said many of the measures were aimed at preventing foreign firms from selling advanced chips to China or supplying Chinese firms with tools to make their own advanced chips. They conceded however that they had not secured any promises that allied nations would implement similar measures and that discussions with those nations are ongoing.

""We recognize that the unilateral controls we're putting into place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don't join us"" one official said. ""And we risk harming U.S. technology leadership if foreign competitors are not subject to similar controls.""

The expansion of U.S. powers to control exports to China of chips made with U.S. tools is based on a broadening of the so-called foreign direct product rule. It was previously expanded to give the U.S. government authority to control exports of chips made overseas to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and later to stop the flow of semiconductors to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday the Biden administration applied the expanded restrictions to China's IFLYTEK Dahua Technology and Megvii Technology companies added to the entity list in 2019 over allegations they aided Beijing in the suppression of its Uyghur minority group.

The rules published on Friday also block shipments of a broad array of chips for use in Chinese supercomputing systems. The rules define a supercomputer as any system with more than 100 petaflops of computing power within a floor space of 6400 square feet a definition that two industry sources said could also hit some commercial data centers at Chinese tech giants.

Eric Sayers a defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute said the move reflects a new bid by the Biden administration to contain China's advances instead of simply seeking to level the playing field.

""The scope of the rule and potential impacts are quite stunning but the devil will of course be in the details of implementation"" he added.

Companies around the world began to wrestle with the latest U.S. action with shares of semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers falling.

The Semiconductor Industry Association which represents chipmakers said it was studying the regulations and urged the United States to ""implement the rules in a targeted way - and in collaboration with international partners - to help level the playing field.""

Earlier on Friday the United States added China's top memory chipmaker YMTC and 30 other Chinese entities to a list of companies that U.S. officials cannot inspect ratcheting up tensions with Beijing and starting a 60 day-clock that could trigger much tougher penalties.

Companies are added to the unverified list when U.S. authorities cannot complete on-site visits to determine if they can be trusted to receive sensitive U.S. technology forcing U.S. suppliers to take greater care when shipping to them.

Under a new policy announced on Friday if a government prevents U.S. officials from conducting site checks at companies placed on the unverified list U.S. authorities will start the process for adding them to the entity list after 60 days.

Entity listing YMTC would escalate already-rising tensions with Beijing and force its U.S. suppliers to seek difficult-to-obtain licenses from the U.S. government before shipping them even the most low-tech items.

The new regulations will also severely restrict export of U.S. equipment to Chinese memory chip makers and formalize letters sent to Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) restricting shipments to China of chips used in supercomputing systems that nations around the world rely on to develop nuclear weapons and other military technologies.

Reuters was first to report key details of the new curbs on memory chip makers including a reprieve for foreign companies operating in China and the moves to broaden restrictions on shipments to China of technologies from KLA Lam Applied Materials Nvidia and AMD.

South Korea's industry ministry said in a statement on Saturday there would be no significant disruption to equipment supply for Samsung and SK Hynix's existing chip production in China.

However it was necessary to minimise uncertainty through consultation with U.S. export control authorities it added.

On Saturday China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called the move an abuse of trade measures designed to reinforce the United States' ""technological hegemony"".

Las Vegas Review-Journal

LAS VEGAS — A man accused of stabbing eight people on the Strip thought he was being ridiculed when he tried to take a photo with women dressed as showgirls according to his arrest report.

Yoni Barrios 32 was arrested Thursday and appeared briefly in court Friday afternoon wearing orange restraints over his hands. He faces six counts of attempted murder and two counts of murder.

Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said officials had not found a motive for the attacks.

“We’re still looking into why a person would do this” he said after Friday’s hearing.

He said he did not know why Barrios had been placed in hand restraints in addition to the wrist restraints typically used on inmates.

Hearing Master Daniel Westmeyer said Barrios will be held without bail until his next hearing on Tuesday.

Barrios is accused of fatally stabbing Las Vegas residents Maris DiGiovanni 30 and Brent Hallett 47 on Thursday morning on the 3100 block of Las Vegas Boulevard South.

The Clark County coroner’s office ruled on Friday that DiGiovanni died from a stab wound to the chest and that Hallett died from a stab wound to the back according to county spokesman Dan Kulin.

DiGiovanni was among four women posing as showgirls and Barrios asked to take a photo with them according to the arrest report released Friday by the Metropolitan Police Department. Witnesses said he was wearing a chef’s long-sleeved white jacket and holding a large knife. He claimed he was selling knives.

One showgirl told police she was uncomfortable with his proposal and backed away but the man charged at her and stabbed her in the back as she ran from him.

Witnesses said Barrios then stabbed DiGiovanni before running down the Strip and stabbing several more people according to the arrest report.

Two of the women including one who was stabbed ran into Wynn Las Vegas seeking help and waited for police there. A man who was stabbed told police that Barrios said “sorry man” before stabbing him in the back.

Police said Barrios threw a 12-inch knife into bushes on the sidewalk while running but was detained by Las Vegas Sands Corp. security guards behind the Palazzo.

Native of Mexico

Barrios who had an address in Los Angeles told police he arrived in Las Vegas a couple of days earlier to move in with a friend but the friend told him he could not stay at the house. Barrios then packed his things and took a bus to the Strip.

“Barrios stated that on the bus ride to the strip people were making fun of him and he wasn’t being treated like a human being” officers wrote in the report.

He told police he went into Wynn Las Vegas asking a janitor about jobs.

“The security guard told Barrios to jump in front of a train” detectives wrote in the arrest report.

Barrios then went outside and met the women on the pedestrian bridge.

“Barrios thought the women were laughing at him and making fun of his clothing” the arrest report states.

He told police that after attacking the women on the bridge he started looking for groups of people on the Strip to harm so he could “let the anger out” according to the report.

Barrios said he wanted to make money to go home to Guatemala but he was hoping officers would shoot him according to the arrest report. The report describes Barrios as a native of Mexico.

“My information is that he’s not a citizen of the United States” Wolfson told reporters on Friday.

Wolfson also said the defendant’s citizenship status would not affect how the case is prosecuted. Neither Wolfson nor the arrest report indicated whether Barrios was in the country legally.

In response to a Las Vegas Review-Journal request to interview Barrios at the Clark County Detention Center a Metro spokesperson wrote on Friday: “Due to his current housing he will not be able to conduct any jail house interviews at this time.”

An online fundraiser said the women worked for Best Showgirls in Vegas. Cheryl Lowthorp owner of Best Showgirls confirmed that three workers were wounded and DiGiovanni was killed.

“This fund is being created with the purpose to provide our girls with the resources they need to recover” she wrote. “This will go towards funeral medical professional help and other financial recovery efforts.”

Women dressed as showgirls could be seen posing for photos in front of The Mirage on Friday afternoon.

‘Beautiful spirit and soul’

Gage DiGiovanni identified his younger sister as Maris Jordan a 2014 Washington State University graduate who loved to travel the world.

“Maris and her husband Cole made their way through dozens of countries” Gage DiGiovanni wrote in a statement to the Review-Journal. “Their adventures led them all over Europe Asia while eventually calling Hong Kong home.”

The couple moved to Las Vegas because they enjoyed concerts and festivals.

“Maris always saw the best in people always gave them a chance and always accepted people for who they were” her brother wrote. “Her huge capacity for love lead her to have lasting friendships from all over the world. She was a beautiful spirit and soul and we will miss her for the rest of our lives.”

The family has started an online fundraiser to help with funeral expenses moving costs and travel arrangements.

Gage DiGiovanni also posted about his sister’s death on Facebook.

“Please pray for our family and her husband” he wrote. “We appreciate the space to grieve in the coming days and know she touched your lives as she did ours.”

His Facebook page indicated that the family was from Spokane Washington.

Cole Jordan could not be reached for comment Friday. Facebook posts indicate that he and Maris were married in 2017.

Wolfson said prosecutors should decide in the next 30 to 60 days whether they will seek the death penalty in the murder case. In the meantime he said visitors to the Strip should not be concerned for their safety.

“These are isolated incidents. These are random very unusual incidents” Wolfson said.

Anna Westby 26 suffered a punctured lung and was struggling to breath after being stabbed by Yoni Christian Barrios 32 who killed two and left six injured in a brazen attack in broad daylight outside the Wynn hotel.

One of the victims was Maris Digiovanni 30 Westby's coworker at Best Showgirls in Vegas who died in her arms after they were approached by Barrios who told detectives he was an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala with a criminal record.

'He pulled up a knife and he showed it to us as if modeling it' she told the New York Post. 'Before we could say anything at all. He grabbed the knife and he stabbed Maris in the heart' she said.

The moment was so shocking to Westby that she didn't even have time to worry about herself as she tried to apply pressure to Digiovanni's wound.

'And another guy said 'Ma'am you have a stab wound on your back.' I said 'I know.' Can you grab your shirt and apply it to my back while I apply this to her?'

Anna Westby 26 (above) recalled the moment her coworker at Best Showgirls in Vegas Maris Mareen Digiovanni 30 died in her arms during Thursday's stabbing attack

Digiovanni was stabbed to death in the broad daylight attack which also claimed the life of Brent Allan Hallett 47. Along with Westby five others were injured

Westby who suffered a punctured lung was rushed away on a stretcher by members of Clark County Fire Department. She said she tried to tend to Digiovanni's injuries while a stranger tended to the stab wound on her back

Yoni Christian Barrios 32 who is charged with murdering two and attempting to kill six more on Thursday told detectives that he is a Guatemalan immigrant and that he stabbed eight people so he could 'let the anger out'

Barrios who killed Digiovanni and Brent Allan Hallett 47 told police he did so to 'let the anger out.'

Fox News says Barrios was in the US illegally at the time and that he had a criminal record in California for unknown offenses. He was not known to ICE prior to the stabbing the outlet added.

Recalling the deadly encounter Westby said she and Digiovanni were out on the strip with two other coworkers when Barrios approached them.

After stabbing Digiovanni in the heart Westby said the man slashed a fellow showgirl Victoria Caytano. Westby said she and Digiovanni tried to run but to no avail.

'Maris made it only about 15 feet before she collapsed' Westby told the Post. 'And he came after me and stabbed me in the back and he ran off.'

The showgirl's boss Cheryl Lowthrop said her employee are still reeling over the incident as they mourned Digiovanni who also worked as an elementary school teacher.

'She was exceptional' Lowthorp told KLAS. 'She was exceptional she was on fire and beautiful and smart and radiant.'

As she faces a long recovery Westby told the local outlet that the attack has left her afraid and questioning the world.

'Knowing that someone could do something like this without ever being provoked” Westby concluded. 'It makes me question everything.'

Lowthorp has started a GoFundMe page to help her employees impacted by the tragedy and to cover funeral expenses and other costs for Digiovanni's family.

Westby who was stabbed in the back and suffered a punctured lung held Maris (above) in her arms as she died. The showgirl was also a local elementary school teacher

Friends and family members have paid tribute to the beloved woman - who was a Las Vegas resident and previously worked as a teacher in the city

A GoFundMe page for the showgirl victims has raised nearly $11000 as of Saturday morning

Barrios pictured Friday was charged with two counts of murder with a deadly weapon and six counts of attempted murder. Police said the attack was unprovoked

A Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department arrest report first obtained by Channel 8 News said Barrios came from California to Vegas two days earlier and planned to move in with a friend but when he arrived the friend backed out.

Barrios told detectives he took a bus to the strip where other passengers made fun of him and he ‘wasn’t treated like a human being.’

According to the report Barrios asked a janitor at the Wynn Hotel and Casino about job opportunities then asked the janitor to contact ICE for him so he could return home to Guatemala.

Barrios then asked a security guard at the hotel about selling his knives to pay for his trip home officers wrote.

The guard told Barrios to ‘jump in front of a train.’

Barrios exited the hotel and it was then that he approached his first victims.

He is currently held in the Clark County Detention Center and charged with two counts of murder with a deadly weapon and six counts of attempted murder.

Dewaun Turner 47 who witnessed five of the stabbings told the Las Vegas Review Journal that he saw two showgirls running and screaming while being chased by the knifeman.

One was on the floor after being stabbed and the other tried to run off. But the knifeman chased and stabbed her too.

Then the man stabbed a man who was walking with a woman.

Turner then saw him stab two more women with one of them seriously injured.

Tourists are among the victims Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo later told the media.

During that press conference Metropolitan Police Department Deputy Chief James LaRochelle said that the suspect started stabbing without provocation.

He said that authorities are in possession of video showing the suspect leaving the original scene and running down Las Vegas Boulevard heading towards Sands Boulevard.

Barrios was held by Sands security guards until the police arrived.

Digiovanni's brother Gage wrote: 'It is with great sadness that we say goodbye and see you later to my amazing little sister. Maris was a victim of the horrific random stabbing of eight people in Las Vegas today.

'Please pray for our family and her husband. We appreciate the space to grieve in the coming days and know she touched your lives as she did ours.'

One of Maris' friends took to social media to pay tribute to the 'kindest soul.'

Emma Leeson wrote about her friend: 'Absolutely shocked devastated and heart broken.

'The most kindest beautiful soul taken way to young this is so unfair and should never of happened - I can’t wrap my head around any of it.

'Thank you for all the incredibly fun amazing spontaneous memories and adventures we got to share together.'

Maris's cousin also remembered the 30-year-old as someone who 'brought a light to everyone's life.'

Ashlei Digiovanni said: 'I still can’t believe you’re actually gone. This world can be so evil. You brought a light to everyone’s life who crossed your path.

'I’m so thankful for the moments I got to have with you. From sunset chasing to dancing in your kitchen to nights out to talking about absolutely anything under the sun.

'You were one of the most open lighthearted and easy going people who wanted to make others’ days better. You were my cousin and my best friend. My heart is broken knowing I can’t snap or call you.

Of the injured persons two went to Sunrise Hospital Trauma Center. The remaining four went to University Medical Center.

Police said they began getting 911 calls around 11.40am on Thursday on the north end of the Strip. Earlier it was reported that the attacker told a woman he was a chef who wanted to take pictures with some of the showgirls with his knife. However he began stabbing people when the group declined the man's offer the woman added.

Barrios who cops said is not a Las Vegas resident was captured by Sands security guards and Metropolitan Police officers when he was running on a Strip sidewalk.

In a statement Metropolitan Police deputy chief James LaRochelle said that all evidence indicates “Barrios acted alone and there are no outstanding suspects at this time”. Police however said they were continuing to probe the motive but do not believe there was an altercation before the attacks.

The Clark County coroner’s office identified the deceased persons as Maris Mareen Digiovanni 30 and Brent Allan Hallett 47 - both Las Vegas residents.

Witnesses told Las Vegas TV stations that Barrios struck in several locations with some of the victims appearing to be showgirls or street performers who take pictures with tourists on the Strip.

A witness Pierre Fandrich told KTNV that he saw a “lot of blood” as one woman ran across a bridge one lay on the ground and another had a stab wound on her back as she tried to help the fallen female.

Democratic governor Steve Sisolak posted a message on social media saying “Our hearts are with all those affected by this tragedy”.",,,

Standing center stage at PNC Bank Arts Center Saturday night — his band’s largest local gig since they played the amphitheater eight years ago — the singer was quick to anoint New Jersey as “the best place in the world … the greatest state in the whole nation.”

The scruffy frontman from Red Bank rambled on about how the president should be moved to the Garden State then recounted his first-ever show at PNC — Depeche Mode in 1994 only because a Motley Crue tour got canceled — and spurred the crowd to consider whether their beloved breakfast meat was indeed Taylor Ham or pork roll.

The response to the latter wasn’t exactly cheering as it was a cacophony of charged declarations like an 18th Century town hall over who remained a loyalist to King George III.

Fallon grinned widely at the shouts of pig-disc fervor — again he knows his people.

And New Jersey rock fans know the Gaslight Anthem the band born from New Brunswick basements and the stuffy Court Tavern who rose to fame in 2008 with nostalgia-laden “The ‘59 Sound” LP and have remained the state’s most popular homegrown alt-rock band pretty much ever since.

With that around 10000 bundled-up fans braved the October cold Saturday (a brisk 47 degrees when the band hit the stage) for the Holmdel venue’s final show of the 2022 season and Gaslight’s first New Jersey show in four years since its trio of reunion shows at the Stone Pony Summer Stage in 2018.

After a couple nebulous hiatuses since 2015 the band announced in March their return to full-time status and that they’d begun to write their sixth studio album. While no new songs have come just yet fans were plenty pleased to run through the group’s well-traveled catalog Saturday belting to favorites “Great Expectations” “45” and the 2007 oldie “We Came to Dance” where Fallon made a point to emphasize the “Central Jersey skies” lyric.

For this new U.S. tour which kicked off last month in Portland Gaslight is touring as a six-piece: Fallon and core members Alex Rosamilia (lead guitar) Alex Levine (bass) and Benny Horowitz (drums) plus touring guitarist and (Fallon’s longtime collaborator) Ian Perkins and keyboardist Bryan Haring the latest edition. Haring’s extra vocal harmonies and piano plinks were welcome additions to fill out the band’s crunchy sound which frankly is better suited for clubs and theaters than cavernous outdoor spaces like this.

To that point the mix at PNC was subpar as it often is; Levine’s bass was mush the rest was too undefined not exactly a fair representation of the records.

The band remained taut and vibrant however with Fallon’s requisite gravel tearing through on the pumping “Mulholland Drive” and serrated “Howl.” The 2014 tune “Stay Vicious” slammed hard with its exceedingly heavy blues. The singer’s softer touch on the traipsing opener “Have Mercy” and pensive “Halloween” was poignant and certainly improved from the band’s early days — part and parcel of Fallon’s generally more subdued (and largely excellent) trio of solo records released since 2016.

Joyful bordering on eccentric Fallon 42 led the show with boyish enthusiasm and ease quick with a joke — “I hope you like metal this one’s called ‘Raining Blood’ by Slayer” he quipped before the very-not-metal “Mae” — and encouraging fans that it’s never too late to do what they want with their lives.

”If us six idiots can play up here you can do anything …we worked at a deli where a guy sold drugs out the back I showed up to work afraid I was gonna die” Fallon laughed.

The 95-minute set was about what fans should expect anchored primarily by cuts from “‘59 Sound” and 2012′s crowd-pleasing “Handwritten.” For the local crew an extra jam or two off ‘07′s debut “Sink or Swim” which was forged on and around the Rutgers campus would’ve been a nice homecoming touch.

But all in all it was an exciting return for the band and its devout gaggle of flannel and denim-clad supporters all of whom seem ready for the next chapter.

Australia Looks To Buy Manufacture HIMARS MLRS After Their ‘Super Success’ In Ukraine,"Following the success of the US-built High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) in Ukraine Australia is now looking to start manufacturing the MLRS in the country.

The HIMARS has attracted a lot of attention as one of the notable weapons during the ongoing Ukraine conflict due to its capacity to unleash deadly precision fires against Russian strongholds including command centers and supply depots.

The latest disclosure was made by a Lockheed Martin representative who said that plans to manufacture missiles for the US High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) in Australia are being discussed.

Canberra is already negotiating with the US to procure the deadly weapons system which could increase its military’s offensive power. The US announced in May 2022 that it had granted Australia’s request to buy 20 M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) for about US$385 million (AU$542 million).

The Lockheed Martin-built weapon system is marketed as an advanced cost-effective sustainable artillery option. It is built to provide multiple-launch rocket system firepower on a wheeled chassis.

Lockheed Martin Australia’s program director in the strategic capabilities office for missiles and fire control James Heading informed the media on October 4 that the company’s focus was on the rockets’ development rather than the launch vehicles.

At the Land Forces 2022 conference in Brisbane he stated that the firm is investigating what Australia wants. “Part of that resilience in the supply chain goes straight to energetics” he added.

He continued by saying that the energetics are the most difficult to ship in any conflict. With Thales already on board as a teaming partner the business aims to examine rocket motors and warheads.

“It’s all well and good to talk about the casings fins body and all sorts of things. We are exploring to see the capabilities and capacities here in Australia” he stated.

The crucial guidance system for the HIMARS rockets can also be produced in Australia but Heading noted that this depends on what the US government will permit to be released. Canberra is one of Washington’s most important strategic allies in the western pacific.

The strategic placement of Australia’s political and economic strength substantially contributes to maintaining regional peace. Therefore the US wants to assist Australia in creating and maintaining a robust and reliable armament for self-defense against its adversaries particularly China.

High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)

HIMARS is the most recent addition to the family of multiple-launch rocket systems. Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control developed the system in 1996 as a part of an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD) program.

The device fires its weapons and leaves the location at a fast speed before hostile forces can pinpoint the launch site. The system incorporates the MLRS’ self-loading and autonomous capabilities.

The driver gunner and section head comprise the three-person crew that controls the high-mobility artillery rocket system. However a crew of two or a single soldier may load and unload the computer-based firing control system.

The fire control system has a video camera keyboard controls a gigabyte of software storage and a GPS. It is possible to carry out firing missions manually or automatically thanks to the fire control computer.

HIMARS is designed to launch the full MLRS family of munitions including the extended-range rocket the reduced-range practice rocket and all future derivatives in addition to the conventional MLRS round.

HIMARS is currently in full-rate manufacturing after receiving approval to start production in March 2003. In November 2004 HIMARS successfully finished the initial operational test and evaluation. The first unit of the US military to receive HIMARS was the 3rd Battalion 27th Field Artillery Regiment XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery in May 2005.

The HIMARS’ most prominent strength over other types of artillery is its range. This makes it possible for the Ukrainian forces to employ the HIMARS from a distance. It also helps Ukraine to protect the system from Russian counterattacks.

Additionally Ukraine skillfully chose targets using the 80-kilometer range of HIMARS. They deliberately and strategically struck Russian command centers armaments storage sites and supply routes to stop and constrain Russia’s campaign in eastern Ukraine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvaW50LWZvcmNlcy5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS1lcXVpcG1lbnQtbmV3cy81ODM4MC1sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tYXdhcmRlZC11cy1hcm15LW0yOTktbGF1bmNoZXJzLWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin Awarded US Army M299 Launchers Contract,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.joint-forces.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /defence-equipment-news/58380-lockheed-martin-awarded-us-army-m299-launchers-contract (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8CF4E20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvaW50LWZvcmNlcy5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS1lcXVpcG1lbnQtbmV3cy81ODM4MC1sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tYXdhcmRlZC11cy1hcm15LW0yOTktbGF1bmNoZXJzLWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9sb2NraGVlZC1zci03MS1ibGFja2JpcmQtZmluYWwtZmxpZ2h0LWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,23 Years Ago Today The Record-Breaking Lockheed SR-71 'Blackbird' Made Its Final Flight,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9sb2NraGVlZC1zci03MS1ibGFja2JpcmQtZmluYWwtZmxpZ2h0LWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

While the economy may look a bit concerning now it pays to look out a few years. Take the home improvement market which is expected to grow at a nearly 5% pace through 2028. The two Goliaths of the sector -- and longtime rivals -- are Home Depot (HD -0.66%) and Lowe's Companies (LOW -0.69%).

Read on to see which of these two home improvement giants makes a more compelling buy in today's market.

1. Home Depot is on a roll

Founded in 1978 Home Depot transformed the hardware store as we know it. Now the largest home improvement retail chain in the world it operates more than 2300 stores across North America employs half a million associates and brought in over $151 billion in revenue last year.

When founders Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank opened their first Home Depot stores in Atlanta Georgia they realized their vision: A one-stop shop for all things home improvement. At roughly 60000 square feet each at the time and offering a much greater variety of products the first Home Depot stores instantly dwarfed existing hardware stores of the 1970s.

Today the average Home Depot store spans 105000 square feet and contains over 35000 products for sale. And Home Depot claims to offer more than 1 million products online through its e-commerce store. The company also provides home remodeling and other services boasting ""the industry's largest installation business for the Do-It-For-Me customer.""

Home Depot has shown exceptional strength this year delivering its highest-ever quarterly sales and earnings in the second quarter. According to CEO Ted Decker ""Our performance reflects continued strength in demand for home improvement projects."" The company posted a record $43.8 billion in sales a 6.5% increase over the same period last year. For the full year Home Depot expects total sales to grow roughly 3% over 2021 numbers with an operating margin of about 15.4%.

2. Lowe's delivers strong business sales growth

More than 50 years before Home Depot opened its doors Lowe's began as a small-town North Carolina general store. In addition to sewing supplies horse tack and snuff L.S. Lowe's original 1921 store also sold hardware and building materials. Today Lowe's serves roughly 19 million customers per week out of its nearly 2200 stores and the company posted sales of over $96 billion in fiscal 2021.

However it wasn't until 1946 that Lowe's became a hardware store exclusively. That's when the company adjusted its inventory to accommodate a post-World War II construction wave. Lowe's went public in 1961 and has since grown into one of the world's largest home improvement retail chains. Like Home Depot it also operates in the U.S. Canada and Mexico.

Joining the metaverse revolution over the summer Lowe's unveiled its virtual reality platform Lowe's Open Builder. This new tool allows shoppers to download digital versions of Lowe's products -- home décor and furniture products for example -- and then preview those items in their homes or yards with augmented reality. Using Lowe's Open Builder customers can get a realistic idea of how items will look before making any buying decisions.

Lowe's hasn't performed as well as Home Depot this year and in Q2 it saw a slight drop in sales versus last year. Although DIY sales were lower than expected Lowe's was able to make it up with a 13% increase in ""Pro"" customer category -- that is sales to contractors professional remodelers and facility maintenance businesses. Looking forward CEO Marvin R. Ellison remains steadfast in the company's ability to grab additional share of the home improvement market.

Which is the better buy?

To help gauge whether Home Depot or Lowe's is the better buy let's look at current market capitalizations price-to-earnings ratios and dividend yields.

Metric Home Depot Lowe's Market capitalization $296.7 billion $123.5 billion Price-to-earnings ratio 17.8 15.7 Dividend yield 2.62% 2.11%

On one hand Lowe's has a slightly lower price-to-earnings ratio than Home Depot -- at 15.7 vs. 17.8. On the other hand Home Depot offers a higher dividend yield to shareholders and is having a banner year.

With momentum currently in its favor Home Depot makes a better buy than Lowe's right now. However as the two biggest contenders in a market expected to reach over a trillion dollars by the end of 2028 both of these home improvement stocks show long-term promise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvcmV0YWlsZXJzLXRyb3Qtb3V0LTEyLWZvb3Qtc2tlbGV0b25zLXRvLWJvb3N0LWhhbGxvd2Vlbi1zYWxlcy5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvcmV0YWlsZXJzLXRyb3Qtb3V0LTEyLWZvb3Qtc2tlbGV0b25zLXRvLWJvb3N0LWhhbGxvd2Vlbi1zYWxlcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Home Depot's giant skeleton vs Lowe's massive mummy: How retailers are trying to boost Halloween sales,"A child looks at a halloween costume on the rack. At the Target department store in Exeter Township Tuesday afternoon for a story on halloween costumes.

In the past few weeks Craig Cislo dug out the spray-painted tombstones from his attic scoured websites for a giant animated reaper and convinced his teenage son to dress as a bush to spook trick-or-treaters.

Cislo 43 of Dallas plans to spend about $700 for Halloween to step up his family's front yard decorations. He has noticed more neighbors are joining in too with large inflatables animatronics and even an elaborate display inspired by ""The Walking Dead.""

""My wife and I joke — because we take a daily walk — that we have competition this year"" he said.

As retailers brace for a lackluster holiday season many are planning to pump up sales early by dangling a wider assortment of Halloween merchandise. Even if consumers are cutting back on spending elsewhere they say Halloween gives people a chance to get into the holiday spirit with relatively inexpensive celebrations before Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Home Depot and Lowe's stocked up on a wide range of spooky lawn ornaments including giant mummies and skeletons. Target executives expressed high hopes for sales of costumes haunted house cookie building sets and other Halloween merchandise even after cutting the company's profit outlook twice. And Party City  which sells costumes balloons and bags of candy plans to hire about 20000 seasonal employees before the Oct. 31 occasion.

The push around Halloween comes as more people return to in-person gatherings. Participation is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels this year with nearly 70% of Americans planning to celebrate according to the National Retail Federation's annual survey.

That's expected to lift total Halloween spending to a record $10.6 billion a jump from last year's $10.1 billion the survey found. On average consumers plan to spend $100 for candy decor cards and costumes.

For some shoppers celebrations like Halloween offer an escape from the worries of everyday life. As customers face troubling news headlines Covid surges and political uncertainty they're seeking more ways to celebrate and ""bring joy to their families"" said Christina Hennington Target's chief growth officer.

""This is one of the reasons we continue to see such strength in our seasonal categories which we expect will continue in the back half of the year"" she said on the company's earnings call in August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzA5L255Yy10ZWVuLW11cmRlci1zdXNwZWN0LXhhdmllci1sb3dlLWFycmVzdGVkLXdoaWxlLWp1bXBpbmctc3Vid2F5LXR1cm5zdGlsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NYC teen murder suspect Xavier Lowe arrested while jumping subway turnstile,"A 17-year-old wanted for murder was arrested when authorities caught him trying to get through a Brooklyn subway turnstile without paying sources said.

LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEwLzA4L2Rvd24tNTItaXMtbmlrZS1zdG9jay1hLWJ1eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Down 52% Is Nike Stock a Buy?,"Investors shouldn't rush to buy Nike shares before they consider alternatives.

Shares of Nike (NKE -2.31%) are down 52% since hitting an all-time high toward the end of last year. Weak results from major retailers meant investors had low expectations entering Nike's latest quarterly report but the swoosh still failed to deliver. Let's see why and what investors should make of it.

Nike reported decent revenue growth for the quarter but economic headwinds are presenting problems. Profits fell as inflationary costs in transportation and higher reliance on promotional sales and markdowns weighed on margins. The stock tumbled to new lows following the report.

Nike is a fantastic brand. It has one of the world's most iconic logos and the near-term uncertainty in the economy means investors can buy the stock at a cheaper valuation of 30 times this year's consensus earnings estimate which is down from over 40 earlier this year.

But before deciding to buy the stock investors should shop around to see if Nike really offers the best value relative to its underlying business growth.

Comparing Nike stock to alternatives

One way to determine if a stock is undervalued and worth buying is to compare its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to the average company in the S&P 500 index.

The S&P 500 index average forward P/E is currently 17. Is Nike worth its higher valuation? On the one hand its history of consistent growth brand strength and secular industry tailwinds justifies it. However Nike's long-term expectation for mid-to-high teens growth in earnings per share (EPS) compared to the median of 12% EPS growth for the average company in the S&P 500 index makes it difficult to justify paying almost twice as much for each share of Nike on a P/E basis.

Another way to gauge the value of a stock is to compare it to industry peers. Let's look at Lululemon Athletica. Lululemon reported revenue growth of 29% year over year in the most recent quarter which is blazing fast compared to Nike's 4% in its fiscal first quarter. On a constant-currency basis Nike is still growing the top line at only 10%.

Lululemon is also doing a better job of holding its profit margin up. It faces the same inflationary costs as other retailers right now but Lululemon still managed to grow earnings per share 33% year over year in the last quarter. Nike reported a 20% decline in EPS.

Overall Lululemon has navigated through supply chain issues during the pandemic and inflation far better than the world's largest athletic wear brand.

Analysts expect Lululemon to report full-year revenue growth of 26.7% with adjusted earnings per share up 27%. Lululemon reported ""robust"" guest traffic in stores last quarter in addition to strong growth in e-commerce.

By comparison analysts expect Nike to report full-year growth for its May-ending fiscal year of less than 5% on top of a 20% drop in earnings per share. Nike executives also pointed to ""strong demand"" in the marketplace in the last earnings report but that description should come with an asterisk since Nike had to rely on promotional sales to drive growth.

Promotional activity is increasing across the marketplace but Lululemon appears so far to be immune to this since it is positioned as a premium brand and is not known for discounting merchandise.

Nike stock is still too expensive

Despite growing much faster than Nike Lululemon stock trades at a forward P/E of 30.8 just slightly higher than Nike's 29.7 forward P/E.

Investors are getting substantially more growth with Lululemon for almost the same price. That makes Nike look relatively overvalued compared to its faster-growing industry peer.

Nike's premium to the S&P 500 and relatively low growth compared to Lululemon make it clear that Nike stock is still too expensive and should be avoided right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The award in Common Pleas Court was sizable for a suit filed by a single plaintiff not part of a class-action suit.

“The jury recognized that it was a wrong thing for Mobil Oil to knowingly have what they knew to cause cancer in a product that people had to use in the workplace in their vehicles and just in their daily lives and not tell the public” said Andrew DuPont attorney for Paul and Diane Gill who filed suit against Texas-based ExxonMobil in 2020.

ExxonMobil said it would appeal the verdict.

“This is an irrational verdict that we will ask the court to reverse before it becomes final” the company said in a statement e-mailed to The Inquirer. “Beyond that request we plan to exhaust all available appeals and are confident an appellate court will see the verdict for what it is. We are reviewing our next steps.”

DuPont an attorney with Philadelphia-based Locks Law Firm said Paul Gill’s work exposed him to benzene-containing products such as solvents degreasers oils and gasoline.

According to the suit Gill worked at an ARCO station in Painted Post N.Y. in 1974; an auto garage in Hamilton Valley Pa. from 1975 to 1980; and at a dairy farm in Lindley N.Y. from 1986 to 1994. Those jobs took place before Exxon and Mobil merged in 1999.

The suit said Gill worked directly and indirectly on a near daily basis with those products exposing him to benzene xylene toluene and other chemical compounds.

Gill now 67 was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2019. He suffered multiple symptoms and side effects as the result of the AML and treatments. The suit said the cancer was the “proximate result of his exposure to the defendants’ benzene-containing products and the defendants’ wrongful conduct.”

AML starts in the bone marrow and often quickly moves into the blood according to the American Cancer Society. It can spread to other parts of the body including the lymph nodes liver spleen central nervous system and testicles.

The suit said that benzene had been known to cause cancer before 1964 and that there is no safe level of exposure. It accused ExxonMobil of gross negligence saying the company knew or should have known that people working with or in close proximity to benzene-related products could suffer from “blood and bone marrow poisoning and damage damage to DNA chromosome damage cancer leukemia and other blood and bone marrow disease and damage.”

The suit also said that Gill did not know the “nature and extent of danger” he had exposed himself to over decades working in as a mechanic or at service stations. But it said ExxonMobil was aware and continued to make market and sell products with benzene without warning people who used those products or put controls in place. Benzene-containing products should have come with warnings instructions and training the suit said.

Gill’s illness “caused him pain suffering disability disfigurement deformity impairment mental anguish anxiety humiliation and increased susceptibility to infection” the suit said preventing him “from engaging in those activities from which he derives life’s pleasures.”

Gill’s wife Diane was awarded $500000.

Other attorneys representing Gill during the trial included Patrick Wigle and Rajeev Mittal of Dallas-based Waters Kraus Paul & Siegel.

In a similar case in Connecticut last year a jury reached the opposite conclusion and ruled in favor of ExxonMobil in a lawsuit brought by a widow who sought $40 million for her husband’s injuries and eventual death from AML according to the Hartford Business Journal. The husband Nicholas Yoranidis owned an ExxonMobil gas station. Jurors there found his widow had failed to prove the products were defective or establish a connection to Nicholas Yoranidis’ condition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Solid Previews At $6.6M – Friday AM Box Office Update,"UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios‘ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8286260>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL9IBkAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire bully Katherine Asplundh's new in-laws have $95M history of exploiting undocumented workers: ruling,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL9IBkAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8286EF0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL9IBkAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9vcGluaW9ucy9yZWNsaW5pbmctc2VhdC1yYWdlLWFpcnBsYW5lLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtcG9vbGUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBWWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvb3BpbmlvbnMvcmVjbGluaW5nLXNlYXQtcmFnZS1haXJwbGFuZS1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLXBvb2xl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: I’m a flight attendant.

Here's a wild stat: If one year ago you had split $1000 and bought equal amounts of stock in oil and gas midstream company MPLX (MPLX -0.36%) and Brazilian oil giant Petrobras (PBR -0.55%) you would have generated $360.38 in annual dividend income. These two companies combined for a dividend yield of 36% over the past year.

The chances of generating that kind of dividend income if you buy shares right now are pretty low (see below) but that doesn't mean you can't generate some serious income from these two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks. Here's why they may still be worth a look.

Aligned interests mean big payouts

Few things will reasonably ensure a favorable outcome for investors more than when their interests are aligned with a company's management team. Surprisingly this isn't always the case as the goals management needs to hit may not necessarily translate to growing shareholder value. With pipeline and processing company MPLX it's very much in the company's interest to pay sizable dividends to its shareholders.

MPLX's largest shareholder is Marathon Petroleum (MPC -1.94%) and the vast majority of MPLX assets are designed to serve Marathon's refining operations. The two just signed a new transportation-services agreement that lasts through 2032.

Since MPLX represents both a key supplier of transportation and logistics and a cash-generating asset for Marathon management has operated the business to ensure payouts can be sustained over the long haul. That means a payout that's well covered by cash generation -- it currently pays out about 60% of cash available for distribution -- and a manageable debt load -- the debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) ratio stands at 3.5 times. Management has even declared special dividends when the business is doing exceptionally well in addition to share repurchases.

What's also encouraging is that the company's capital-spending plans are much more modest than they were in the past. Annual capital spending in 2018 and 2019 was more than $2.5 billion whereas today management says it wants to keep annual capital expenditures (capex) around $900 million annually. That's slower growth but the stock's considerable payout can make up for it.

All in all management's incentive to generate cash for Marathon means that investors in the stock can benefit as well. As of this writing the stock has a distribution yield of 9.3%. That's a lot of cash going into your portfolio.

Higher risk but the potential reward can be hard to ignore

Let's get the shocking news out of the way. If you look up Petrobras' dividend yield today you'll see a forward yield of 49.7%. That's an eye-popping yield you should in no way count on going forward.

Petrobras' dividend is a variable-rate dividend that's set at 60% of quarterly cash from operations minus capital spending. Two quarters of extraordinarily high oil prices have led to a couple of bumper dividends in recent quarters.

Even if we assume that Petrobras' dividend will go down from here there are still some reasons to think that the company will be able to pay a decently high dividend for some time. The key to its success is the pre-salt offshore oil formations.

Oil production from these formations have absurdly low production costs -- lifting costs were $3.30 per barrel in the most recent quarter -- and it is becoming an increasingly larger share of total production for the company. Today about 74% of its production comes from pre-salt fields and it has another 15 offshore platforms slated to come online there between now and 2026. Even with high government royalty and tax rates management estimates the total cost per barrel across the business is $42 a barrel.

Historically Petrobras has been a highly indebted company with a poor operational record but several metrics suggest that it's getting its act together. Since 2015 it has reduced total recordable injuries per million man hours by 76%. Its refinery utilization rate -- a general sign of operational efficiency -- reached a respectable 89% in the most recent quarter. And perhaps most importantly it has reduced its overall debt load by $33 billion since 2019 to $53.6 billion and currently has $19 billion in cash on the books. From an operational and financial standpoint this isn't the same company it was three to five years ago.

Petrobras still has plenty of warts. Its dividends are paid in Brazilian reais and this currency has lost significant value to the dollar recently. Petrobras was also embroiled in Brazil's largest corruption scandals which resulted in the company writing down over $19 billion in bribes graft and writedowns of overvalued assets. (Seriously go look up Operation Car Wash).

That said the company appears to be in a much better position to generate shareholder value with more efficient operations an extremely low-cost production base and a rather shareholder-friendly dividend policy. Investors shouldn't expect a near-50% yield but even a fraction of that payment would be a nice dividend check.",,,,,,,,,

Despite many white-collar workers being resistant to return to the office some firms—including Google and Amazon—are taking the plunge and investing millions of dollars in sleek new workspaces.

Among those doubling down on office space is international hotel chain Marriott which is betting big with a new $600 million campus in Bethesda Maryland.

Last month Marriott opened the doors to its new headquarters—a 21-story 785000-square-foot building that took more than half a billion dollars and six years of planning and construction to complete.

The space which includes a new Marriott hotel next door is designed to house employees who work with more than 8100 hotels in 139 countries and territories.

The company which has adopted a hybrid work model for its corporate staff said in a press release announcing the opening of its new HQ that it “believes a blend of in-person and virtual connectivity enhances the associate experience enables collaboration for its global workforce and fuels business performance.”

Marriott said its offices were designed to prioritize childcare family support and wellness with facilities at the Bethesda headquarters including a fitness center meditation rooms medical resources and outdoor garden space as well as an 11000-square-foot childcare center that can accommodate 91 children up to the age of five.

Each workstation has an outside view through floor-to-ceiling windows the company said with workers offered sit-stand desks.

“The campus has been designed to better connect our global workforce in support of our hotels and teams around the world” Marriott CEO Anthony Capuano said in a statement. “Empowering associates and accelerating innovation were our key priorities and central in every decision we made to deliver a compelling environment for associates to work learn and thrive.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vY2hhc2UtdXBzLXRoZS1ib251cy1mb3ItdGhlLW1hcnJpb3R0LWJvdW5kbGVzcy1jYXJkLTY3NDg4MjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chase Ups the Bonus for the Marriott Boundless Card,"Chase has launched a limited-time offer for the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card giving new cardholders 100000 bonus points after they meet the offer's spending requirement. Consumers who are considering a new credit card should consider the bonus along with the card's other features to determine if it's a good fit.

Key Takeaways New Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card holders can earn 100000 bonus points when they spend $3000 in the first three months from account opening.

Interested consumers should apply for the card by Oct. 27 2022 to take advantage of this limited-time offer.

Carefully consider the card's value and other options to determine whether or not to apply.

Get More Marriott Points With the Bonvoy Boundless Card

The Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card from Chase is offering 100000 bonus points when new cardholders open an account by Oct. 27 and spend $3000 in the first three months from account opening.

Based on Investopedia research Marriott Bonvoy points are worth 1.05 cents apiece on average giving you a value of $1050 with this welcome offer. Keep in mind though that the hotel loyalty rewards typically have dynamic value which means that the value you can get per point depends on the destination property travel dates and cash value of the stay.

In general it's best to avoid applying for a credit card strictly for its sign-up bonus so make sure the card's other benefits make sense for you especially as they compare to the card's $95 annual fee:

Earn 6 points per dollar at participating Marriott hotels 3 points per dollar on up to $6000 spent in combined purchases each year on grocery stores gas stations and dining and 2 points per dollar on all other purchases.

Get a free night certificate each account anniversary year which is worth up to 35000 points.

Receive complimentary Silver Elite status with a chance to earn Gold Elite status when you spend $35000 each calendar year.

Also be sure to compare the card with other hotel and general travel credit cards to determine the best fit for you in the long run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9jcm93bmUtcGxhemEtbGEtY29uY2hhLWtleS13ZXN0LXJlZmxhZ2dlZC11bmRlci1tYXJyaW90dC1hdXRvZ3JhcGgtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1kZWNlbWJlci0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crowne Plaza La Concha Key West Reflagged Under Marriott Autograph Collection December 2022?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2022/10/09/crowne-plaza-la-concha-key-west-reflagged-under-marriott-autograph-collection-december-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS9jcm93bmUtcGxhemEtbGEtY29uY2hhLWtleS13ZXN0LXJlZmxhZ2dlZC11bmRlci1tYXJyaW90dC1hdXRvZ3JhcGgtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1kZWNlbWJlci0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2J3aG90ZWxpZXIuYnVzaW5lc3N3b3JsZC5pbi9hcnRpY2xlL01hc3RlcnMtb2YtTWFycmlvdHQtQm9udm95LWFuZC1UaGUtQ3Jvc3NpbmctY29tZS10b2dldGhlci1mb3ItZXhjbHVzaXZlLXRyaS1jaXR5LXRvdXIvMDgtMTAtMjAyMi00NDk3MDHSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly9id2hvdGVsaWVyLmJ1c2luZXNzd29ybGQuaW4vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvTWFzdGVycy1vZi1NYXJyaW90dC1Cb252b3ktYW5kLVRoZS1Dcm9zc2luZy1jb21lLXRvZ2V0aGVyLWZvci1leGNsdXNpdmUtdHJpLWNpdHktdG91ci8wOC0xMC0yMDIyLTQ0OTcwMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Masters of Marriott Bonvoy and The Crossing come together for exclusive tri-city tour,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='bwhotelier.businessworld.in', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/Masters-of-Marriott-Bonvoy-and-The-Crossing-come-together-for-exclusive-tri-city-tour/08-10-2022-449701 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA0AD810>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2J3aG90ZWxpZXIuYnVzaW5lc3N3b3JsZC5pbi9hcnRpY2xlL01hc3RlcnMtb2YtTWFycmlvdHQtQm9udm95LWFuZC1UaGUtQ3Jvc3NpbmctY29tZS10b2dldGhlci1mb3ItZXhjbHVzaXZlLXRyaS1jaXR5LXRvdXIvMDgtMTAtMjAyMi00NDk3MDHSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly9id2hvdGVsaWVyLmJ1c2luZXNzd29ybGQuaW4vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvTWFzdGVycy1vZi1NYXJyaW90dC1Cb252b3ktYW5kLVRoZS1Dcm9zc2luZy1jb21lLXRvZ2V0aGVyLWZvci1leGNsdXNpdmUtdHJpLWNpdHktdG91ci8wOC0xMC0yMDIyLTQ0OTcwMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2hvc3BpdGFsaXR5LmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3RlbHMvbGUtbWVyaWRpZW4tamFpcHVyLXJlc29ydC1zcGEtYXBwb2ludHMtaGVtYW50LWt1bWFyLWFzLWNoaWVmLWVuZ2luZWVyLzk0NzM2ODI40gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vaG9zcGl0YWxpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9ob3RlbHMvbGUtbWVyaWRpZW4tamFpcHVyLXJlc29ydC1zcGEtYXBwb2ludHMtaGVtYW50LWt1bWFyLWFzLWNoaWVmLWVuZ2luZWVyLzk0NzM2ODI4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Le Meridien Jaipur Resort & Spa appoints Hemant Kumar as chief engineer,"Hotels

While this is true everywhere India stands out as a world-class example for having developed the account-based payments infrastructure to ensure as many people as possible have access to instant easy payments directly from their bank account. All they need is a mobile phone.

The numbers speak for themselves. In the month of August 2022 India’s UPI payment system recorded 658 crore (6.58 billion) transactions amounting to INR 10.7 lakh crore1 or close to USD 13.3 billion. While this rapid surge is creating new imperatives for businesses like banks that traditionally depended on transaction fees it is also creating new relevancy for those that adapt and evolve with the times.

Here’s one way that banks and financial institutions can seize the initiative alongside technology partners like Mastercard that can help them to rewrite the rules of how Indian customers can pay and get paid.

Reimagining the Role of Banks

Most importantly we must preserve the convenience and zero cost that customers love while carving out a valuable indispensable role for banks and fintechs. Can such “value add” be safe and simple for customers?

Absolutely – here’s how.

First account-based payments are currently catering to small ticket transactions. Anyone who wants to make a larger payment must go… you guessed it – to their bank! What if banks enabled zero-fee seamless transfers in larger denominations?

Second – and this is important – the bigger the customer’s digital footprint the greater their exposure to fraud. To keep them safe with minimal disruption banks and payment companies continue to invest in security measures like biometrics such as thumbprint and facial recognition so customers don’t need to remember an endless stream of passwords and PINs. Biometrics are unbeatable. Even personal data is secure. But this is not the case for all digital wallets.

In fact safety doesn’t even have to be about fraud or leaked information. It can be as simple as: how does a customer get a refund from a merchant if there’s a billing mistake or if the goods they buy are defective? If someone pays via a digital wallet the money is instantly moved into the merchant’s wallet. The customer’s only recourse is to hope the merchant will be willing to compensate them.

But what if there was a way to leverage digital payments to provide an even better customer experience? Going cashless doesn’t mean an end to facilitating payments. Quite the opposite!

Enhancing Safety and Choice

To help people use digital payments safely and easily Mastercard has developed a solution to transform a digital payment into a transfer between a current account and/or savings account using a card-processing network.

With this solution customers use a virtual debit card or prepaid card that they access inside their bank’s mobile app. When they pay with their bank’s app the card facilitates the transaction by linking the customer’s bank account to the merchant’s account. Importantly this opens up a world of options for accountholders giving them instant access to millions of merchants across the world who accept cards.

And while this may sound familiar it is not a traditional credit or debit card transaction. It is a mobile payment made via the bank’s app just like customers are used to. And while the customer still pays nothing in fees using a virtual debit or prepaid card provides additional benefits and choices.

For one customers can fit their payments to their lifestyle using the bank app physically at a store using Tap & Go or via a QR code or at the checkout page of an e-commerce site. And they can do so around the world not only in India.

In addition this versatility would expand the use cases that digital payments can cover – online shopping of course but also subscriptions to a TV streaming service gym memberships (or other recurring payments) hailing a taxi or taking public transportation to name a few.

What’s more customers would enjoy the safety and security that comes with protections against fraud or billing errors.

And finally customers may gain access to an issuing bank’s loyalty reward programs spending vouchers and other perks.

The best part? Mastercard is ready today to help banks make all of this a reality.

We’re especially optimistic because the country’s booming digital economy is creating space for further innovation. This virtual card based solution presents a golden opportunity for India’s banks to develop trusted new products and services stay engaged with their customers and remain an indispensable part of their financial lives.

By working together with Mastercard banks can make digital payments simpler safer and more widely accepted. We look forward to collaborating with you to accelerate India’s drive to go cashless grow the digital economy sustainably and support the government in making Digital India a reality.

There’s never been a better time to partner experiment and build for the country’s bright future. Let’s do this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkLnJ1Z2J5L25ld3MvNzY2NTQ0L21hc3RlcmNhcmQtcHJlc2VudHMtc29uaWMtdHJvcGh5LXRvLXJ1Z2J5LXdvcmxkLWN1cC0yMDIxLXBsYXllci1vZi10aGUtbWF0Y2gtcmVjaXBpZW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mastercard presents sonic trophy to Rugby World Cup 2021 Player of the Match recipients,"The world’s first sonic trophy presented by Mastercard was today unveiled at Rugby World Cup 2021 in Aotearoa/New Zealand.

The trophy blends unique live-action audio recordings from the match edited in real time incorporating Mastercard’s sonic melody while celebrating indigenous Aotearoa/New Zealand culture through the voice of Piri Rongo Hetet-Wairau.

“Māori narratives highlight strength and leadership abilities of women and I’m honored to work with Mastercard to bring that symbolism to the trophy design for these incredibly talented athletes” Te Kiri said. “The trophy’s cloak-like shape color and patterns represent a woman's responsibility/role as a leader and her connection to her landscape. With the sonic element providing a commemoration of each match I am truly privileged to pay homage to these outstanding athletes and their individual and unique narratives.”

The company has committed to leading the charge in reshaping the way our world is designed coded and constructed by bringing diverse perspectives to the table to unlock powerful ideas that open up our industry and the world’s possibilities to women.

“Rugby World Cup 2021 is set to be the biggest celebration of women’s rugby the world has ever seen.

We are proud to partner with a brand that shares our vision and ambition to supercharge the women’s game worldwide.”

Over the past decade Mastercard has developed one of the most well-rounded women’s sports portfolios globally. This investment includes partnerships across tennis golf soccer and rugby as well as sponsoring players teams and events.

""I have played in stadiums where the electric atmosphere sparks emotions that cuts across cultures and nationalities; this was the exact same experience I had playing this beautiful game at 20000 feet above ground with a group of fearless football fanatics taking their passion for the sport to unprecedented heights.""

A bench of five judges led by Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu said MasterCard Asia Pacific PTE and the bank lobby have an identifiable stake in the matter as they will be directly affected by the outcome of the case.

Absa moved to the apex court arguing that the payments made to Visa International Services Association Mastercard Inc and American Express Ltd did not constitute royalty and KRA had no basis for demanding withholding tax.

Mastercard argues that the imposition of withholding taxes on the interchange and transaction fees as management and the professional fee will impact the use of its payment solutions in Kenya. “The applicant therefore stands to be prejudiced and its joinder is thus necessary” the court said. Mastercard says it has a direct interest in the case as the orders to be issued by the court will affect its engagement with Absa and all the other banks in its network.

The firm’s executive vice president in charge of customer delivery in the Asia Pacific region Shafi Shaikh said it will provide the court with an understanding of the nature of the MasterCard service and interchange fees.

He said the petition is a matter of public interest as it will impact the uptake and popularity of the use of debit and credit cards as modes of payment in Kenya. The court heard that the firm is a leading global payment solution provider through the MasterCard network that facilitates the processing of card payments throughout the world.

He said the interchange fees earned by Absa and other banks within its network act as an incentive to utilise the global payment system for transactions on debit and credit cards issued to cardholders and for customers to join the network. KRA demanded withholding tax on payments in 2012 from Absa saying the interchange fees were royalty and those to the other banks were for professional or management services.

The arrangement with the card companies enables Absa to issue its customers with credit debit and pre-paid cards which the customers use to pay for services and goods purchased from contracted retail outlets. In turn the lender has entered into agreements with the outlets to accept payments through the cards.

The demand prompted Absa to challenge the KRA’s move arguing that it was illegal and unreasonable. It was quashed by the courts in 2015 but KRA appealed and the decision was overturned.

KRA says the bank was obliged to pay withholding tax arising from its relationship and dealings with the credit card companies.

KBA said it has a direct interest in the petition being the body bringing together banking institutions licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya."

How did the draw work?

• Fifty-three national associations participated in the qualifying draw.

• Germany as the organisers of the UEFA EURO 2024 final tournament are automatically qualified and therefore did not take part in the draw.

• All Russian teams are currently suspended following the decision of the UEFA Executive Committee of 28 February 2022 which has further been confirmed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on 15 July 2022. Russia were therefore not included in the UEFA European Football Championship 2022–24 qualifying draw.

• The 53 teams that participated in the qualifying draw were seeded based on the overall rankings of the UEFA Nations League 2022/23 and were allocated to ten qualification groups (seven groups of five teams and three groups of six teams).

The draw principles were unchanged compared to the previous edition. The specific adaptations are highlighted here below:

• The four finalists of the UEFA Nations League were drawn into groups of five teams to allow them to participate in the finals in June 2023;

• Five country pairs were declared as prohibited. Those pairings could not be drawn into the same group: Armenia/Azerbaijan Belarus/Ukraine Gibraltar/Spain Kosovo/Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo/Serbia.

• A maximum of two winter venues could be drawn into the same group: Belarus Estonia Faroe Islands Finland Iceland Latvia Lithuania and Norway.

• Several country pairings were declared to represent an excessive travel distance. A maximum of one such pair could be drawn into the same group.

How were teams seeded for the EURO 2024 qualifying draw?

The 53 teams involved in the draw were classified on the basis of the overall 2022/23 UEFA Nations League rankings issued on completion of the Nations League group stage. Based on these rankings the teams were divided into seven pots: the 'UNL' pot which contained the four Nations League finalists followed by Pot 1 to Pot 6. The 'UNL' pot contained four teams Pot 1 contained six teams Pots 2 to 5 each contained ten teams and Pot 6 contained the three remaining teams.

The four Nations League finalists will play the final matches of this competition in June 2023. As a consequence these teams have only eight matchdays available for the European Qualifiers group stage and were allocated to groups of five teams.

• The draw started with the 'UNL' Pot and Pot 1 before continuing from Pot 2 to Pot 6. Each pot was emptied entirely before proceeding to the next pot.

• As a rule for each pot the teams drawn were allocated in alphabetical order from Group A to Group J. In the 'UNL' Pot the four UNL finalists were allocated in the order they were drawn to Groups A B C and D.

• In Pot 1 the teams were allocated in the order they were drawn to Groups E to J.

• As of Pot 2 when a draw condition applied or was anticipated to apply the team drawn were allocated to the first available group in alphabetical order.

• Since Pot 6 only contained three teams these teams were drawn into the sixth positions in Groups H to J to the first available group in alphabetical order.

Who were the EURO 2024 qualifying draw guests?

Four big-name former players (all past EURO finalists) were on stage to assist with the draw: Jürgen Klinsmann Karl-Heinz Riedle Gianluca Zambrotta and Demetrio Albertini.

How does the qualifying competition work?

There are ten groups: seven groups of five teams (Groups A–G) and three groups of six teams (Groups H–J). Teams play each other home and away in a round-robin system. Group matches are played according to the European Qualifiers match calendar from March to November 2023.

The ten group winners and the ten group runners-up qualify directly for the final tournament. The three remaining spots will be completed with the teams that qualify through the play-offs in March 2024.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL25mbC1kcmFmdC1uZXdzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtc3RhdGUtbWF0dC16aW1tZXIvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0MDUxMDAwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Mason McCormick contribute to the Steelers' OL in 2024?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

While Fautanu and Frazier seem likely to start on Day 1 or at least early in the season McCormick to this point has been viewed more as depth across the interior offensive line. However NFL Media draft analyst Chad Reuter believes McCormick could potentially take over a starting spot at guard for the Steelers and believes the three rookie starters might be an improvement over last season’s offensive line.

“McCormick has the toughness and athleticism to take a starting spot from James Daniels or Isaac Seumalo. Yes that potentially means the Steelers would start three rookies on the offensive line but some Steelers fans might argue McCormick left tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier will quickly constitute an improvement over last year’s group despite their lack of experience.”

I find it very very hard to believe that the Steelers would bench one of Seumalo or Daniels for McCormick. While there were some down moments for the most part the two were steady last season and among Pittsburgh’s best offensive linemen. Seumalo in particular brings leadership to a line that will still be very young and it’s really hard to fathom McCormick getting starter reps as a rookie.

Now could he compete with Nate Herbig for the top backup job at guard and potentially win it? Sure but even then McCormick is likely waiting for an injury to get his reps. The more realistic scenario here is that McCormick serves as depth and potentially as the team’s backup center behind Frazier as they worked him out at the position before the draft and he becomes a viable starting option after 2024 when Daniels’ contract will be up. The guard market got expensive in free agency this offseason and Daniels might be looking at a number the Steelers don’t want to pay. McCormick becomes insurance against them overpaying to keep Daniels around should he want a lot of money.

The selection of McCormick was an awesome one to help bolster Pittsburgh’s line depth and add a bully on the offensive line and it’s continually been praised since the draft concluded. But given what the Steelers currently have at guard it’s just hard to fathom the team benching two experienced starters who have been good in Seumalo and Daniels for McCormick. That doesn’t mean McCormick won’t one day be a starter but I’d be shocked if it happened in 2024 without injuries."

And whenever we go to McDonald's it never fails -- my children inevitably ask for a Happy Meal.

Usually I'll oblige even though I can in some cases get away with a lower credit card tab by ordering items off of the McDonald's menu individually. But for a few extra dollars I'm usually happy to indulge my kids in a Happy Meal and the bonus toy that comes with it.

But now it's not just kids who can enjoy a McDonald's Happy Meal. The fast food giant recently introduced an adult version of the Happy Meal and it's comparable to the kids' version in that it does in fact come with a toy.

But is the adult Happy Meal worth your money? That's debatable.

Paying up for nostalgia

The cost of a Happy Meal at McDonald's -- whether it's an adult one or a child one -- hinges on where you're located. But for the most part you can expect to pay around $2 to $3 extra for an adult Happy Meal compared to the cost of buying the items it contains as a regular combo meal.

Case in point: In New Jersey a Big Mac combo with fries and a drink costs just under $10. The Happy Meal containing the same food plus a toy is almost $13. The added cost therefore comes down to the toy you get in your grown-up meal. And so you'll need to decide if that's important enough to you to spend extra.

In my case it's easy to justify the higher cost of the adult Happy Meal -- I have kids who might enjoy sharing the toy. But if you're not so interested in reliving the experience of getting a toy with your dinner then you may want to skip the adult Happy Meal and order up a regular combo instead.

Another option? Get the adult Happy Meal as a one-time thing but then revert back to your standard McDonald's order once you've had that experience.

Some people might say that McDonald's Happy Meal toys will one day become collector's items. I'm not enough of an expert in that field to determine whether that's a spot-on projection or not. But given the quality of McDonald's Happy Meal toys it's fair to say that even if they do become collector's items one day many won't hold up well enough to be worth much down the line.

How should you spend your money?

Many people these days are finding that money is tight. We can thank our friend inflation for that.

If hitting McDonald's on the way home from work is something you don't do often and you want to try the adult Happy Meal once go for it. But don't expect it to be a repeat purchase.

And if you're really strapped for cash and are tempted by McDonald's either because you're short on time or are craving a Big Mac do yourself a favor and don't spend an extra few dollars you don't have for a little toy that may not make you relive your childhood so much as regret your purchase.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9yZXRhaWwvbWNkb25hbGRzLWljb25pYy1oYXBweS1tZWFscy1oYWxsb3dlZW4tYnVja2V0cy1yZXR1cm5lZNIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9yZXRhaWwvbWNkb25hbGRzLWljb25pYy1oYXBweS1tZWFscy1oYWxsb3dlZW4tYnVja2V0cy1yZXR1cm5lZC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald’s iconic Happy Meals Halloween buckets have returned,"McDonald’s has officially announced the return of its Halloween Happy Meal buckets for the first time in six years.

The buckets — a pumpkin a witch and a ghost named McPunk’n McGoblin and McBoo respectively — will return to restaurants nationwide on Oct. 18 the company said in a tweet on Thursday.

The buckets which double as reusable trick-or-treating containers were first introduced by the fast food giant in the 1980s and have made several temporary appearances in the decades since.

The original ""Boo Buckets"" were first released in 1986 but have not appeared since 2016.

The initial renditions had the same names as their contemporary counterparts but were all orange with different faces.

They were revised three years later with the green white and orange color distinctions. Other changes to the pails included removing the face entirely (before returning it) and modifying the lid.

While the fast food company is providing the candy containers Halloween candy prices are expected to jump 34% ahead of the spooky season according to PayPal.

The buckets often valued as collector items will not be exact replicas of their original rendition but people online were still crazed for their return.

The McDonald’s announcement came just a day after the company said it would be catering to adults with a new adult Happy Meal called the Cactus Plant Flea Market Box.

""Remember u are never too old for a happy meal"" the company said in a tweet.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnZlc3RvcnMtaGVhdmlseS1zZWFyY2gtbWVyY2stY28tMTMwMDE2MjkzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investors Heavily Search Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK): Here is What You Need to Know,"Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry to which Merck belongs has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Merck is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter representing a year-over-year change of +202.9%. Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.3%.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 points to a change of +473.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.3%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.7%.

With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Merck the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. For the current and next fiscal years $64.28 billion and $68.81 billion estimates indicate +6.9% and +7.1% changes respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Merck reported revenues of $15.78 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +8.9%. EPS of $2.07 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.32 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.95%. The EPS surprise was +6.7%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples such as price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on) is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

Merck is graded C on this front indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Credit: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com.

Merck & Co (MSD) has announced that its Phase III KEYNOTE-B21 (ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053) clinical trial of Keytruda plus chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer following surgery with curative intent failed to meet its primary endpoint.

Sponsored by MSD the trial is being carried out in collaboration with the European Network for Gynecologic Oncology Trial (ENGOT) groups and the GOG Foundation.

The randomised double-blind study involved 1095 patients to assess adjuvant treatment with Keytruda plus chemotherapy irrespective of radiotherapy status versus adjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.

The primary endpoints are disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints include safety.

According to the data from an interim analysis by an independent data monitoring committee the Keytruda regimen failed to show DFS improvement versus placebo.

The secondary goal of OS was not tested due to the lack of superiority in DFS.

Keytruda’s safety profile was in line with those in prior studies without any new safety signals detected.

The comprehensive data analysis from the trial is currently underway.

Keytruda has existing approvals in the US for certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma.

It is approved in combination with Lenvima for mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) advanced endometrial carcinoma patients after disease progression post-systemic therapy.

It is also approved as a monotherapy for MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient advanced endometrial carcinoma patients who have advanced post-systemic therapy and are not eligible for curative surgery or radiation.

Merck Research Laboratories global clinical development vice-president Dr Gursel Aktan said: “While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications while rapidly progressing clinical research evaluating Keytruda-based combinations and other investigational candidates including antibody-drug conjugates in endometrial and other types of gynecologic malignancies.”

Earlier this month MSD reported the final analysis findings from the Phase III KEYNOTE-811 trial of Keytruda plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy to treat human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma."

In the year since Meta has spent billions of dollars and assigned thousands of employees to make Mr. Zuckerberg’s dream feasible. But Meta’s metaverse efforts have had a rocky start.

The company’s flagship virtual-reality game Horizon Worlds remains buggy and unpopular leading Meta to put in place a “quality lockdown” for the rest of the year while it retools the app.

Some Meta employees have complained about frequent strategy shifts that seem tied to Mr. Zuckerberg’s whims rather than a cohesive plan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbWV0YXMtbmV3LWhlYWQtb2Ytc2VhdHRsZS1hcmVhLW9mZmljZXMtb24tdGhlLXJvYWQtdG8tYS1tZXRhdmVyc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta's new head of Seattle-area offices on the road to a metaverse,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Following a bout of censorship during that violent month — which witnessed a mass Palestinian uprising Israeli repression and a war on Gaza — Meta commissioned Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) to conduct a review into its moderation policies for Arabic and Hebrew language content across all three platforms and to produce a human rights due diligence report.

Among its key findings the BSR report observed that Meta’s censorship not only violated Palestinians’ fundamental rights but that the company did not apply its content moderation policies equally to the two languages. Rather Arabic content was overly moderated while Hebrew content was largely untouched.

The conclusions are far from surprising. In fact they firmly validate the lived experience of the majority of Palestinian users across all of Meta’s platforms who have long argued that the company’s censorship practices are both discriminatory and systematic. The findings further add to the heaps of evidence documented over many years showing that Meta is far from a neutral intermediary when it comes to Israel-Palestine.

Still while the report is a welcomed outcome for transparency and accountability it also falls short on recognizing the larger context that underpins Meta’s biased policies and actions — biases that emerged not just by accident but by design.

Shadowbans and overenforcement

During Israel’s brutal crackdown on Palestinian protestors in the Old City of Jerusalem and the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in late April and May 2021 along with the military onslaught on Gaza and the uprising that ensued many Palestinians took to social media to document by the minute the Israeli regime’s violence and human rights abuses. They also used the platforms to debunk disinformation about what was happening on the ground and to share an authentic alternative narrative to both mainstream press coverage and Israeli government propaganda.

Almost immediately social media companies including Meta began clamping down on Palestinian speech. Accounts belonging to Palestinian activists journalists and eyewitnesses were arbitrarily suspended and their content systematically taken down. Some users also experienced shadowbans soon after they expressed public support and solidarity with Palestinians with others finding that their Palestine-related posts had greatly reduced visibility among their followers.

At the same time dozens of Israeli group chats of the “Death to Arabs” variety were formed on WhatsApp to organize pogroms against Palestinian communities both inside Israel and in the occupied West Bank. Racist slurs incitement to violence and even direct calls for murder and genocide directed at Palestinians in Hebrew went undeterred on Facebook and Instagram.

According to BSR’s findings Meta’s overenforcement of its policies on Arabic content — which included erronous and arbitrary takedowns and suspensions — had an “adverse impact” on Palestinians’ rights to freedom of expression freedom of association and assembly political participation bodily security non-discrimination freedom from incitement and access to remedy.

Most notably BSR found that Meta censored Arabic content at a higher rate than Hebrew content during that period and further found that the detection rate of “potentially violating Arabic content” was much higher than Hebrew. This is because Meta has built classifiers — predictive algorithms that assess whether a piece of content fits into a “class” that violates the platform’s policies — to automatically detect and remove hostile Arabic speech while there are none for Hebrew.

Intentional bias

Although BSR states that Meta’s bias against Palestinians is “unintentional” this characterization of bias misses the mark on how institutional and structural discrimination and racism actually operate. In other words the company’s content moderation system is discriminatory not only due to its selective application but because of its very design.

Take for example Meta’s terrorism-related guidelines: the so-called “Dangerous Individuals and Organizations” policy or DIO. While the company refuses to publicly state who it classifies and bans as “dangerous” or “terrorist” a leaked list of 4000 persons and groups shows that it disproportionately targets Muslim communities from the Middle East and South Asia.

This partly explains why according to BSR “Meta’s DOI policy and the list are more likely to impact Palestinian and Arabic-speaking users both based upon Meta’s interpretation of legal obligations and in error.”

Whereas Meta has bended this rule among others in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — which even allows Ukrainians to freely praise the neo-Nazi Azov Regiment as a force for self-defence — no such conflict-sensitive exceptions have ever been made for Palestinians who are struggling against a no-less brutal military occupation.

Moreover the company’s treatment of the global non-Western majority where only crumbs of investment and resources are allocated is itself a structural problem that affects Palestine. From Myanmar to Ethiopia Meta treats non-English languages and communities outside of the United States and Europe as a non-priority despite the fatal consequences of unmoderated hate speech and incitement to violence.

The double standards witnessed in Israel-Palestine are therefore intertwined with deeper problems at the heart of the social media giant’s global practices. Contrary to Meta’s Corporate Human Rights Policy — which was launched just two months before the May crisis — the company has consistently shown blatant disregard to protecting the most vulnerable communities across its platforms.

Meta is thus not acting in blissful ignorance. Its rapid response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrates that the company can act when it wants — when there is a will there is a way. And despite thorough documentation of censorship disinformation targeted violence and hate speech against Palestinians it has failed to take any meaningful and serious action.

In fact the same violations are repeated over and over again. For instance as soon as violence erupted in Jerusalem in April 2022 — almost a year after the Sheikh Jarrah protests — Facebook shut down the page of the Palestinian news site Al Qastal while it broadcasted live from the Israeli occupation forces’ violent raid on Al-Aqsa Mosque. To continuously turn a blind eye to the adverse impact of its actions on an oppressed population despite the amount of evidence makes it clear that Meta’s bias is indeed intentional.

The result of activism

Meta’s response to the BSR report has so far been underwhelming. For one Meta did not publicly acknowledge any wrongdoing: it footnoted that its statement “should not be construed as an admission agreement with or acceptance of any of the findings conclusions opinions or viewpoints identified by BSR nor should the implementation of any suggested reforms be taken as admission of wrongdoing.”

For another despite acknowledging BSR’s 21 non-binding recommendations to address the negative impacts of its actions on Palestinian rights Meta provided no concrete timeline for when to take action. These important recommendations include reviewing the company’s DIO policy and its designation of deceased historical figures building classifiers for Hebrew language content and providing transparency for users over their enforcement actions such as feature limiting (shadowbanning). Meta also rejected one BSR recommendation that called for funding public research to examine the company’s legal counter-terrorism obligations versus its current policies and actions.

It is crucial to note that Meta’s commissioning of the report did not come out of pure good will but rather due to the persistent public and private campaigning of Palestinian regional and global activists and human rights groups calling on the company to stop silencing speech on Palestine. Now that the findings are out we must continue to demand that Meta respect peoples’ rights and hold it accountable for its censorship.

At this point Meta cannot evade responsibility for its biased moderation of Palestinian content. Systems are not created in a vacuum; they are a sum of corporate decisions. To not create classifiers for Hebrew hate speech despite its prevalence is a decision. Protecting pro-Zionist speech while deleting direct documentation of Israeli rights abuses is a decision. Answering censorship requests from an occupying power against its occupied population is a decision. It’s time for Meta to decide otherwise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy9tZXRhcy12aXJ0dWFsLXJlYWxpdHktbWVldHMtZmFjZWJvb2stcy1oYXJzaC1yZWFsLXdvcmxkLTExNjY1MzEzOTQ0Mzc3Lmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MvbWV0YXMtdmlydHVhbC1yZWFsaXR5LW1lZXRzLWZhY2Vib29rLXMtaGFyc2gtcmVhbC13b3JsZC9hbXAtMTE2NjUzMTM5NDQzNzcuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta’s virtual reality meets Facebook’s harsh real world | Mint,"It seemed a good time a year ago when the company once known as Facebook renamed itself Meta Platforms. Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that he sees the metaverse as “the successor to the mobile internet."" But the timing was awfully convenient as scandals around privacy and politics had continued to build around the ubiquitous social network. Just the month prior The Wall Street Journal published a scathing series called “The Facebook Files"" based on a trove of internal documents that showed the company’s awareness of and failure to address the wide-ranging problems on its platform.

And yet business was still booming. The company’s advertising revenue for the trailing 12-month period ended September 2021 was up 42% year over year—the best growth rate in more than three years. Operating margins were also comfortably back above the 40% mark for the first time since 2018—and 10 percentage points higher than what arch-rival Google was generating at the time.

But that was before a series of events combined to slow the global economy and cripple the online advertising market. That has cast a shadow over the company just as it makes its most ambitious attempt yet to prove that its metaverse aspiration actually has some legs. Meta will lift the wraps on its latest efforts in virtual reality next week just as it is also working through an extensive cost-cutting effort that involves office closures hiring freezes and staff cullings that Meta is taking some pains not to describe as layoffs. The stock has lost 58% of its value over the last 12 months—the tenth worst performer on the S&P 500 in that time.

Revelations at the “Meta Connect’’ conference starting Oct. 11 are unlikely to turn around that sentiment. The company is expected to use the event to introduce a new high-end VR headset; one that Mr. Zuckerberg previously described as being designed for “work use cases and eventually replacing your laptop or work setup."" And the company at least has some positive momentum to build on given strong sales of its Quest 2 VR headset that launched in late 2020. That device is designed mostly for videogaming and sold nearly 8.8 million units last year—more than the total number of headsets sold by Meta for the previous five years combined according to estimates by IDC.

But success in VR is a highly relative concept as even gamers have been lukewarm on the technology. Total revenue from VR games last year was $1.5 billion—less than 3% of the total revenue generated by console games for the year according to market research firm Newzoo. And while Meta now dominates VR with about 88% share of the global hardware market for the first half of this year according to IDC the Reality Labs business segment that includes VR made up just 2% of the company’s total revenue in that time. That unit also lost nearly $5.8 billion in the first half of this year.

Which means that Facebook’s transformation into a metaverse company still relies on ads. And that business is facing its most significant challenges to date. A global economic slump has come just as the company is dealing with the impact of privacy changes on Apple’s iOS platform and growing competition from TikTok. Meta reported its first-ever drop in advertising revenue for the second quarter on a year-over-year basis and Wall Street is expecting declines to persist for the second half of this year according to FactSet.

That has resulted in an unprecedented bout of belt-tightening. Mr. Zuckerberg told employees last week that the company will be implementing a hiring freeze which followed a report by The Wall Street Journal that the company is looking to cut expenses by about 10%. The company is also working to shrink its real estate footprint as more employees work from home though it hasn’t yet quantified how much.

Other tech giants are also taking actions to manage their costs providing a reminder that even the most powerful cash-rich businesses aren’t immune to recessionary forces. But Meta’s big tech peers are also not in the midst of an ambitious business shift. Mr. Zuckerberg’s vision to bring the metaverse to a billion people is an expensive one; the company has maintained its target of spending up to $34 billion in capital expenditures this year which is double what it has averaged over the past three years.

So having less money coming in the door is a problem. Meta is hardly about to dip into the red; Wall Street’s projection of 28% operating margins for the next three years is still about 5 percentage points above the S&P 500’s average according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. But that is from a company that has averaged annual operating margins of 40% since the year after it went public in 2012. And even if Mr. Zuckerberg succeeds in convincing the masses to try out its metaverse concept the business models there remain uncertain—especially with world governments now eyeing his company closely. The former Facebook’s real world will long haunt its virtual one."

But like candy corn or a fondant cake remote work isn’t always as good as it looks.

More than half (55%) of remote employees are highly anxious about their finances according to a recent survey conducted by MetLife which interviewed 1000 full-time workers. That’s more than fully in-person or hybrid employees 46% of whom feel similarly.

For remote workers the stress is becoming too much to handle. A slight majority (53%) predicted they’ll be at a financial “breaking point” soon. Only 41% of hybrid and in-person workers say the same.

Part of the issue is benefit selection when employees are deciding headache-inducing things like how much to contribute to their 401(k) plan and what health insurance plan has the best deductible. MetLife found that remote workers spend more time stressing about their benefits than their on-site or hybrid peers.

That might be because they’re dealing with enrollment by themselves without someone to talk to in person who can explain what such benefits mean. Such conversations could be more confusing over Zoom or Slack. Many noted to MetLife that if they understood the whole enrollment process they’d feel more financially secure.

“During open enrollment employees have to make decisions on a wide range of benefits yet on average people spend 17 or 18 minutes going through open enrollment” Mona Zielke senior operations and claim executive at Voya told Fortune in February pointing out that people usually take more time deciding what show to watch.

But they’re also worried about what will happen to them if the economy takes a turn for the worst. Rumblings of economic instability and continuous layoffs have sparked concerns that remote workers will be on the chopping block: 78% of workers in the U.S. fear that remote workers are more likely to lose their jobs if a recession comes according to GoodHire’s second annual State of Remote Work report.

Their concerns about being out of sight out of mind aren’t coming from nowhere in a workplace where proximity bias still exists; six in 10 managers told Beautiful.AI that they’ll lay off remote workers first in a recession. But it’s worth noting that while layoffs are playing out at big tech companies job openings are still high and despite the headlines there aren’t major signs of mass layoffs coming soon.

If a recession does hit remote workers will all be in different ships depending on what industry they work in. But even so many remote employees have the skills that are often in high demand these days making it slightly easier to find themselves back on their feet if their fears of layoffs are true.

“They have those digital skills as often because that’s what enables them to do their jobs remotely” Layla O’Kane senior economist at Lightcast told Fortune. “And they often have to work harder in communication and collaboration because they are working remotely.”

Even so whether it’s benefit selection or anxieties about impending layoffs remote workers are squirming a bit on their couches.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvZG9scGhpbnMvbmV3cy9taWFtaS1kb2xwaGlucy1uZXcteW9yay1qZXRzLXdlZWstNS1jb21wbGV0ZS1vYnNlcnZhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miami Dolphins-New York Jets Week 5 Complete Observations,"Checking out the key moments from the Miami Dolphins' 40-17 loss against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium

Here's what caught our eye in the Miami Dolphins' 41-17 loss against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

-- We'll start with the inactive list which provided a lot of good news for the offense with Tyreek Hill Jaylen Waddle and Terron Armstead all active but bad news for the defense with cornerback Xavien Howard having to sit out because of his groin issues.

-- Wide receiver Cedrick Wilson Jr. was back in the lineup after missing the Cincinnati game with injuries and 2020 first-round pick Noah Igbinoghene was active for the third time this season.

-- The biggest name on the Dolphins inactive list of course was quarterback Tua Tagovailoa who continues his recovery from the concussion that took him out of the Cincinnati game.

FIRST QUARTER

-- The first series of the game ended after the Jets gained only one first down thanks for Christian Wilkins batting down a Zach Wilson pass on third-and-2. This of course was Emmanuel Ogbah's forte in 2021.

-- What also was noteworthy about the first series was Noah Igbinoghene getting his first defensive snaps of the season.

-- The Dolphins' first drive started at their 8 after a good punt by Braden Mann and ended after one disastrous play.

-- The danger with calling for a naked bootleg always is leaving the quarterback exposed after the fake if defenders don't bite and that's what happened with ""Sauce"" Gardner who drilled Bridgewater after coming in free. With no chance to escape Bridgewater threw the ball as he was hit and after consultation the officials strangely ruled intentional grounding resulting in a safety since Bridgewater was in the end zone.

-- Oh and if that weren't bad enough Bridgewater was injured on the play and he left the game with an elbow injury and to be evaluated for a concussion.

-- The special teams continued their season-long struggle when they gave up a 42-yard return by Braxton Berrios on Thomas Morstead's free kick after the safety but the defense held.

-- Big plays on the drive were produced by cornerback Kader Kohou and linebacker Jerome Baker. Kohou's quick reaction helped him drop Berrios for a 1-yard loss after a completion and Baker then sacked Zach Wilson on third-and-10 to end the drive.

-- The Dolphins started their second drive in even worse field position at the 3 and now with rookie Skylar Thompson at quarterback.

-- Miami got a big play with a 34-yard pass interference penalty on Gardner but the drive stalled after Thompson's 13-yard scramble was negated by a holding penalty on Armstead.

-- And to make matters even worse Armstead left the field with an injury after the play.

-- The Jets' next possession ended with a field goal because Melvin Ingram and Raekwon Davis were flagged for facemask penalties on back-to-back plays giving the Jets a free 30 yards.

-- Not quite sure what kind of coverage were playing on the 17-yard completion from Zach Wilson to Corey Davis on third-and-7 at the start of the drive but it left Noah Igbinoghene in a tough spot.

-- The Dolphins' second drive with Skylar Thompson — and the first without Armstead — was a three-and-out after a short outside throw to Tyreek Hill ended in a 1-yard loss because of too much traffic at the line of scrimmage.

-- A forgettable first quarter ended about as poorly as it could for the Dolphins who lost running back Breece Hall down the field on a wheel route and couldn't bring him down until he gained 79 yards all the way to the 1-yard line to set up a first-and-goal to start the second quarter. Safety Eric Rowe appeared to be the closest to Hall though it doesn't necessarily mean he's the one to blame for the major lapse there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECOND QUARTER

-- And the Jets needed just one play to extend their lead to 12-0.

-- The Dolphins came back with a strong gotta-have-it drive for 75 yards and a touchdown that featured some really nice work by Skylar Thompson creative running plays and a questionable call that went in the Dolphins' favor this time.

-- We'll start with the 27-yard gain on a really weak DPI against Jets cornerback D.J. Reed on a play with minimal impact and doubt as to whether Hill could have caught the ball near the sideline.

-- Then there was a remarkable effort by Thompson who danced around in the pocket and threw the ball while falling backward for a 7-yard pick-up on third-and-2 with Jaylen Waddle completing the play by diving to catch the floater before it hit the ground. Great stuff all around.

-- Then we had a 10-yard gain by Hill on a double reverse followed by Raheem Mostert's 12-yard run to the outside after an inside handoff.

-- The Dolphins defense then got a three-and-out thanks to pressure by Melvin Ingram on first down and Zach Sieler on second down forcing incompletions.

-- The Dolphins' next drive started with a nifty 14-yard run by Mostert but on second down right tackle Greg Little was beaten on a pass rush by John Franklin-Myers who hit Thompson's arm as he was throwing. That caused the ball to float and allowed Gardner to step in front of River Cracraft for the easy pick.

-- The Jets then pounded the Dolphins with their running game with Breece Hall putting together gains of 7 12 9 and 5 yards before Zach Wilson capped the drive with a 5-yard scramble for a touchdown.

-- The Dolphins' final play before the two-minute warning was a 24-yard run by Mostert who took advantage of nice blocks downfield by both Waddle and Hill.

-- The Dolphins were very casual in their approach after the two-minute warning looking almost content to attempt a field goal.

-- Thompson did some nice work but it was disappointing to see Chase Edmonds drop a pass for a second time in the game.

-- Thompson came up with completions of 10 and 13 yards to Hill the first one courtesy of Hill stealing the ball from Reed who appeared ready to make an interception near the sideline. And this wasn't the first time this season Hill had done that.

-- And the Dolphins completed their remarkable two-minute when they had Durham Smythe take the direct snap and push forward for a 1-yard touchdown run.

-- So after all the craziness the Dolphins went into halftime trailing 19-14 but very much still in this game. Oh and the game doesn't look too big for Thompson.

THIRD QUARTER

-- The second half began with an impressive drive that reached the Jets 31 thanks most to the running of Mostert who ripped off gains of 9 and 20 yards.

-- The Dolphins looked like they had a throw-back play set up where Hill would throw an option pass to Thompson but the quarterback was bumped after given Hill the ball and that derailed the play.

-- The drive ended with a field goal to bring the Dolphins to within 19-17.

-- The next Jets possession featured a DPI against rookie Kader Kohou against fellow rookie Garrett Wilson.

-- The Dolphins stiffened with Christian Wilkins stuffing Breece Hall for no gain on third-and-2 and Nik Needham then providing good coverage downfield against Corey Davis to force a fourth-down incompletion.

-- This could have been a game-turning moment for the Dolphins taking over at their 45 but instead they went three-and-out when Thompson faced pressure on second down and was sacked on third down. The sack came as a result of a twist up front that left guard Liam Eichenberg was too late to pick up.

-- The Dolphins got another stop after Brandon Jones sacked Wilson for a 17-yard loss the third time in three games at MetLife Stadium where Jones got a sack.

FOURTH QUARTER

-- A 34-yard DPI on Michael Carter covering Jaylen Waddle put the Dolphins at the Jets 41-yard line the third time the Dolphins got a chunk of yardage off a DPI.

-- After a 5-yard run by Mostert on first down things started going sideways when Greg Little was flagged for a false start to make it second-and-10.

-- Then rookie free agent TE Tanner Conner who looked impressive in camp dropped a perfectly thrown ball over the middle that likely would have produced a first down.

-- On third-and-10 the Dolphins called for a wide receiver screen to Waddle but he could gain only 5 yards to set up Jason Sanders' 54-yard field goal attempt which sailed wide right.

-- And that was the start of the brutal collapse by the Dolphins.

-- On the very first play after that Zach Wilson found Corey Davis wide open down the right sideline for a 21-yard gain.

-- After another Jets first down Jerome Baker got picked off by teammate Noah Igbinoghene on a swing pass to Hall and Hall was able to take it 21 yards to the 1-yard line to set up Michael Carter's 1-yard run that made it 26-17.

-- Two plays later after a delay of game penalty on the Dolphins the Jets applied the clincher when Thompson held the ball too long in the pocket former Dolphins edge defender Shaq Lawson beat Mike Gesicki's block attempt and knocked the ball loose from the Dolphins quarterback. Big Quinnen Williams picked up the loose ball pushed Tyreek Hill out of the way and rumbled to the 5-yard line.

-- On the next play Hall scored on a 5-yard run and the game was over.

-- On their next possession the Dolphins were stopped on fourth-and-1 when Mostert was dropped for a 4-yard loss. The play call was very cool with fullback Alec Ingold taking an inside handoff and then pitching the ball to Mostert on the outside but linebacker Kwon Alexander was there and dropped Mostert.

-- The Jets took advantage of the short field after Hall converted a third-and-11 with a 15-yard line and Braxton Berrios ended the scoring with a 15-yard touchdown run on a jet sweep.

-- The Dolphins put themselves in scoring position on their final drive thanks to Thompson's 30-yard completion to Gesicki over the middle — Gesicki made a nice high grab — but the drive ended with two incompletions.

-- And with that the Dolphins had their second consecutive loss.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtqZXRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjItamV0cy1kb2xwaGlucy1nYW1lLWluYWN0aXZlcy13ZWVrLTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jets Again Aim for Home Win & an AFC East Victory vs. Banged-Up Dolphins,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbnQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9rYW5zYXMtc3RhdGUtd2lsZGNhdHMvc2t5bGFyLXRob21wc29uLW1ha2VzLW5mbC1kZWJ1dC1hZnRlci1pbmp1cmllcy10by1kb2xwaGlucy1xdWFydGVyYmFja3Mv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3NudC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2thbnNhcy1zdGF0ZS13aWxkY2F0cy9za3lsYXItdGhvbXBzb24tbWFrZXMtbmZsLWRlYnV0LWFmdGVyLWluanVyaWVzLXRvLWRvbHBoaW5zLXF1YXJ0ZXJiYWNrcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Skylar Thompson makes NFL debut after injuries to Dolphins’ quarterbacks,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.ksnt.com/sports/kansas-state-wildcats/skylar-thompson-makes-nfl-debut-after-injuries-to-dolphins-quarterbacks/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbnQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9rYW5zYXMtc3RhdGUtd2lsZGNhdHMvc2t5bGFyLXRob21wc29uLW1ha2VzLW5mbC1kZWJ1dC1hZnRlci1pbmp1cmllcy10by1kb2xwaGlucy1xdWFydGVyYmFja3Mv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3NudC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2thbnNhcy1zdGF0ZS13aWxkY2F0cy9za3lsYXItdGhvbXBzb24tbWFrZXMtbmZsLWRlYnV0LWFmdGVyLWluanVyaWVzLXRvLWRvbHBoaW5zLXF1YXJ0ZXJiYWNrcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

A new type of residency program on the Strip launched to elevate Black restaurateurs and chefs.

PepsiCo Inc.’s initiative Pepsi Dig In is bringing its first-ever Restaurant Royalty Residency program to Las Vegas in partnership with MGM Resorts International. The residency aims to bring national awareness to the next generation of Black chefs and restaurateurs.

Five restaurants were selected to bring signature dishes from their restaurants for a four-week limited edition menu at Luxor’s Public House and Mandalay Bay’s Libertine Social.

The program starts on Sunday with an offering from James Beard Award-winning Chef JJ Johnson who will introduce braised oxtails with jollof rice from his New York fast-casual dining concept FIELDTRIP.

“Bringing a selective group of restaurants to Las Vegas — it’s the kind of the place when you’re a chef that they say you made it” Johnson said. “Vegas and MGM has elevated hundreds of chefs in their careers to get to a level that they couldn’t have gotten to on their own. Hopefully one of these restaurants one day might have a restaurant in one of the hotels on the Strip.”

Scott Finlow chief marketing officer at PepsiCo Global Foodservice said Pepsi Dig In started in 2021 to help Black-owned businesses have access to capital technology growth strategies and more.

“All small restaurants suffered due to the pandemic and many struggled to get access to government relief grants and adapt to the changes they needed to grow like digital delivery” Finlow said in an email. “For Black-owned restaurants this was another headwind on top of the systemic barriers they’re already facing.”

The Dig In program attempts to address those issues by supporting access to new technology in point-of-sale and inventory systems website development coaching in social media and SEO tools and more. It also created a $10 million grant through the PepsiCo Foundation and National Urban League to establish a business accelerator program.

Restaurants chosen for the residency were nominated online and nominations are still being accepted.

“The Black community has been entrepreneurs for years” Johnson said. “We just haven’t had the capital to grow our businesses or to make it become something sustainable. Most of it is just ‘Let’s try to earn money put food on the table for the kids and put a roof over our head.’ Now with these last few years Pepsi has been bridging the gap.”

The full lineup of the Restaurant Royalty Residency at Libertine Social and Public House:

— October 9 to November 5 FIELDTRIP founder and Chef JJ Johnson

Top Attractions in Las Vegas for Families

Play create and learn at this amazing children's museum that spans three floors. Tinkerers will love inventing their own contraptions in the Patents Pending exhibit or building dams and making currents in the Water World room. There's also an art zone an eco-friendly mini city a kid's performance theater and a toddler town. The highlight for my daughters was the Summit a 70-foot tall tower with climbing structures slides and interactive science elements.

Daredevils and cautious kids alike will have fun at this five-acre indoor amusement park inside the Circus Circus Hotel. We screamed our heads off on the Canyon Blaster the world's only indoor double-loop double-corkscrew roller coaster. Next we toned it down for classic rides like the carousel and the mini Ferris wheel. The Adventuredome also has a 4-D theater and an arcade. Even in the heat of summer ride lines were never very long.

Got an Avengers fan? Take them to this interactive exhibit inside the Treasure Island Hotel which features original props and costumes from the Marvel Avengers movies. You'll see Captain America’s uniform and shield weapons and uniforms for Hawkeye and Black Widow and Bruce Banner's laboratory among other displays. Needless to say there are plenty of photo ops!

Get a 360-degree view of the Vegas Strip atop the STRAT Hotel. At 1149 feet the Skypod is the tallest freestanding observation tower in the United States (my kids think it looks similar to Seattle's Space Needle). Feeling daring? There are thrill rides at the top of the STRAT including the X-Scream roller coaster which propels riders headfirst 27 feet over the edge of the tower.

See sharks and other marine life up close at Shark Reef Aquarium.

Though not huge (we spent about 90 minutes inside) the Shark Reef Aquarium at the Mandalay Bay Resort is beautifully designed with large tanks and transparent walk-through tunnels. More than 2000 animals are on display including sharks stingrays green sea turtles jellyfish and a Komodo dragon. There is also a touch tank that's free with admission. Visitors can pay extra for feeding experiences too.

Take a ride on the largest observation wheel in North America soaring 550 feet above the Las Vegas Strip. The High Roller at the LINQ features 28 enclosed cabins where visitors can get a full view of the city. The ride lasts about 30 minutes doing one complete revolution. FYI: tickets are much cheaper if you ride in the daytime between 2pm and 7pm.

It gets hot in the Las Vegas desert. When it does cool down and splash around at the Cowabunga Vegas water parks. Thrill seekers love the Wild Surf at Cowabunga Bay in Henderson where they can ride a four-person raft atop the world’s largest man-made wave. At Cowabunga Canyon in Summerlin families can experience zero gravity on the Texas Tornado a four-person raft ride through a giant funnel. Both parks also feature wave pools lazy rivers and water playgrounds for toddlers.

Take a walk on the wild side with the white tigers lions and leopards at this zoo-like animal sanctuary at the Mirage Hotel. While the big cats are impressive visitors are charmed by the bottlenose dolphins that perform tricks and interact with guests. For an extra cost families can feed and take a photo with the dolphins.

Be wowed by the dancing Fountains of Bellagio.

Of all the things my family did in Las Vegas this is the one my kids talk about the most! View the iconic fountain show at the man-made lake in front of the Bellagio resort. As music plays water shoots into the sky as if it is dancing along to the song. At night lights add to the enchantment. And the best part? This attraction is entirely free! Fountain shows typically happen every 30 minutes during the afternoon and every 15 minutes after dark.

This steel roller coaster at the New York-New York Hotel pays tribute to the Empire City with cool replicas of the Statue of Liberty Little Italy and lots of Manhattan skyscrapers. Enjoy them as you whizz by at 67 miles per hour. The Big Apple makes several heart-pounding twists and drops; it is not for the faint of heart. Kids must be 54 inches tall to ride.

Pretend you're in Italy on a Venetian Resort gondola ride.

Las Vegas brings a little Italy to the Strip with indoor and outdoor gondola rides at the Venetian. During our indoor ride (about 20 minutes in length) we coasted down a canal through bridges and under balconies. All of it is designed to look as similar to the city of Venice as possible. Our favorite part was definitely our singing gondolier who belted out songs like ""That's Amore"" while guiding our boat. FYI: We waited only 15 minutes for our ride at 10am; by mid-afternoon the wait time was over an hour.

Best Las Vegas Museums and Exhibits for Kids

Learn about animals ancient cultures and rocks and minerals at this museum on Las Vegas Boulevard. Families love the dinosaurs on display in the prehistoric-life gallery as well as the live sharks and stingrays inside the marine-life exhibit. Kids can even try their hand at digging for fossils and peering through microscopes in the Young Scientist Center.

Become a pinball wizard at this Vegas play space which is half-museum half-arcade. You'll see recognizable games from the 1950s and 1960s all the way up to the present day. There are plenty of fun pop-culture references mixed in (I'm looking at you Austin Powers pinball). Admission is free—just make sure to bring plenty of quarters.

Recommended for ages 13 and older this museum explores the influence of organized crime and law enforcement's efforts to fight it. There are plenty of cool artifacts on display here including weapons and clothing belonging to well known Las Vegas gangsters. The Mob Museum also has a crime lab and a speakeasy so visitors can imagine what life was like during the Prohibition era.

Though not for the squeamish young scientists will be interested in this exhibit at the Luxor Hotel that explores the human form in all of its wonder. Thirteen real human bodies and 260 organs are on display so kids can see for themselves what a heart looks like and how the nervous system works. Be ready to answer questions; this exhibit definitely stimulates curiosity.

Also at the Luxor this exhibit explores the majesty—and the tragedy—of the Titanic. More than 350 artifacts recovered from the wreck site are housed inside. Visitors can see replicas of cabin rooms as well as the largest piece of the Titanic ever recovered—a 15-ton chunk of the ship’s hull. It's a bit haunting to view personal items like luggage tags and champagne bottles. At least you can shake it off by taking your own ""King of the World"" photo.

There's so much for kids to enjoy at Springs Preserve. Photo courtesy of the preserve

Discover Vegas' natural beauty at this 180-acre botanical garden that features a museum a playground and splash pad live animal exhibits and over three miles of walkable trails. A highlight of the park is its trackless train where visitors can learn a little Nevada history during a narrated eight-minute round-trip ride.

Often regarded as the best free attraction in Las Vegas this aquarium inside the Silverton Casino Hotel boasts a giant reef tank that's home to dozens of tropical fish. But the big draw to this attraction is its mermaid shows. Performers dressed as mermaids get in the tank and do twirls somersaults and other acrobatic moves alongside the fish. It's very magical! Plus there are three additional aquariums at the Bass Pro Shop inside the hotel so kids can also see freshwater fish like trout and catfish.

Young pop-culture fans will get a kick out of seeing the wax figures at this museum the first Madame Tussauds venue to open in the US. Sports heroes like Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali are on display here and there's a fun ""Viva Las Vegas"" section where famous figures with a connection to the city are immortalized in wax (including Elvis Celine Dion and members of the Rat Pack).

More Things To Do in Vegas with Kids Indoors

20. Indoor Playgrounds

It's not uncommon for the temperature in Las Vegas to hover around 100 degrees. On those days indoor playgrounds offer sweet relief for families. Lost Worlds Myth & Magic has climbing walls a laser-tag arena and a giant play structure. All ages will be entertained at this dragon-themed 30000 square-foot play space. There are super slides trampolines and zip lines at the Uptown Jungle Fun Park. For the under-6 crowd Kinderland Cafe features lots of pretend-play toys a ball pit and a train table.

21. Trampoline Parks

Trampoline parks are a great way for kids to get their wiggles out. Flip N Out Extreme has two locations in the Vegas area. Amenities include a dodgeball court a large playground for younger kids and a ladder-climbing challenge. At DEFY Las Vegas kids can joust one another perform acrobatics in the aerial silks or try their hand at parkour on a special obstacle course.Local families also love XPlozone which has a foam pit a climbing wall and a kids zone for those under 6.

22. Roller Rinks

Flash back to the 1980s at a Las Vegas roller rink. Crystal Palace has fun lighting great music and a snack bar. Skate mates (which resemble walkers) are available for beginners and you can rent skates or bring your own. Located in the former Crystal Palace building is Skate Rock City a 30000-square-foot space owned by boxing legend Floyd Mayweather. Both rinks hold regular family nights where you can get a good deal for your brood.

23. Ice Skating Rinks

If ice skating is more your thing take the kids to an open-skate sessions at one of the city's ice skating rinks.

They may be too young for the casino but they're not too young for the arcade!

24. Arcades

No surprise Las Vegas is home to dozens of great game rooms for families. Here are just two of our favorites: the 32000 square-foot Big Apple Arcade at the New York-New York Hotel and the Fun Dungeon at the Excalibur which boasts over 200 games with great prizes for winners (my kids were pining for the Squishmallows).

The Las Vegas Monorail is a great way to get from one part of the Strip to another without driving. It's also a fun ride where kids can see the unique Las Vegas skyline. The monorail makes seven stops including at the MGM Grand Caesars Palace and the Convention Center. Trains arrive every five minutes or so at the stations and run every day from 7am until the wee morning hours.

Touring a real-life chocolate factory? What a sweet idea! See how candy is made at the Ethel M Chocolate Factory in Henderson. Visitors can take a free self-guided tour and watch pecan brittle peanut brittle and caramels being made by hand. After your tour stop at the cafe and walk around the three-acre cactus garden the largest of its kind in the southwest United States.

Not just a candy shop this four-level 28000-square-foot space is a full-on experience. There are colorful displays everywhere M&M's merchandise and plenty of places to take pics. Plus you can take home a special Vegas souvenir—your own unique M&M's pack with personalized messages and 16 different colors to choose from. But buyer beware: it's hard to walk out of this store without spending $50 or more.

Should you desire even more candy Hershey offers up this shop on the Strip where visitors can customize their own chocolate bar find some of those rarer candies (Sweet and Sour Twizzlers anyone?) and take photos with a Statue of Liberty sculpture made out of 800 pounds of milk chocolate. Again expect prices to be more expensive than at your local grocery store. But it's all about the one-of-a-kind experience.



Seeing a live show such as the Tournament of Kings is one of the best things to do in Vegas with kids.

Family-Friendly Las Vegas Shows

My family and I loved this medieval-themed dinner show at the Excalibur Hotel. The 90-minute spectacle was action-packed with jousting horseback races pyrotechnics and sword fights along with some singing and dancing. Plus the dinner itself (roasted chicken corn on the cob and potatoes) was surprisingly very delicious.

Blue Man Group is part musical part artistic show featuring blue-painted actors. Sound strange? It is but in the greatest of ways. Families love the high energy of Blue Man Group plus there is a lot of audience participation. You may get a bit messy at this show so definitely wear washable clothes.

People aren't the only performers at this Vegas show that features house cats dogs parrots and even a miniature horse performing acrobatic stunts. Highlights include juggling tricks (done by the humans!) and a cat that pushes a dog around in a stroller. FYI: All performing pets were rescued from animal shelters.

If your kids are fans of classic slapstick comedy (a la Charlie Chaplin) they will probably enjoy Tape Face. As the name suggests Tape Face performs silently with a piece of duct tape covering his mouth. There's plenty of impressive physical comedy and some audience participation.

33. Cirque Du Soleil shows

There are many Cirque Du Soleil shows to choose from in Las Vegas. Some are more kid-friendly than others and many require that children be at least five years old to attend. That said families love the colorful costumes dancing and acrobatics of Mystere. Music-loving kids also enjoy The Beatles LOVE and Michael Jackson ONE. Both shows celebrate the musical catalogs of these incredible artists.

Top Outdoor Things To Do in Vegas with Kids

This wildlife center at the Flamingo Hotel is home to koi fish turtles brown pelicans and a flock of Chilean flamingoes among other exotic birds. Expect to spend about 30 minutes walking the grounds at this tranquil garden a relaxing attraction that's also free!

Celebrate the bright lights that make Las Vegas what it is at the Neon Museum. This outdoor museum houses restored signs from old casinos and other businesses including signage from the old Stardust Hotel and Hacienda Resort. Though the museum opens in the late afternoon for self-guided tours most people go at night. Advance ticket purchase is highly recommended. Bonus: Kids 6 and under are free.

You'll almost feel like you're at the real Eiffel Tower at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel.

My daughters are enamored with the romance of Paris yet a trip to France is not in our immediate future. We did the next best thing by visiting the Paris Las Vegas Hotel. It features many of the city's most famous landmarks like a mini Arc de Triomphe and a half-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower. There's a viewing deck at the top of the tower and seeing it lit up at night is almost as good as the real thing (well almost).

Visit the first non-native settlement in Las Vegas at the Old Mormon Fort state park. History buffs will love exploring the remains of an adobe fort built by Mormon missionaries in 1855. The on-site visitor's center also contains cool old photos and artifacts and there are some interactive elements that kids will particularly enjoy.

One of Vegas' best playgrounds comes courtesy of an open-air shopping center. Families love the Treehouse at Downtown Container Park a one-of-a-kind play structure with a 33-foot-tall twisty slide. There are also big foam blocks that kids can build with and a giant praying mantis sculpture that's fun to marvel at. The mall hosts regular family events and is home to several great restaurants and specialty stores.

Speaking of cool playgrounds Town Square Park has a great one where kids 10 and under can enjoy a climbing cube slides a trampoline and a splash pad. There's also a cute little train that rides around the mall and the center hosts lots of family-friendly events like G-rated movies and concerts.

Like an oasis in the desert this state park is the antithesis of the Vegas Strip. There's lush greenery serene lakes and plenty of wildlife. Visitors may see geese ducks rabbits and even some peacocks roaming around. Come for a picnic a hike or to see the historic Tule Springs Ranch which offers a look at early life in the region. Fossils of mammoths giant sloths and extinct camels have all been discovered on this property.

See Native American petroglyphs and bask in the beauty of red sandstone peaks at this conservation area located about 20 minutes outside downtown Las Vegas. There are several hiking trails to choose from some shorter and easier than others. A favorite feature is the quarter-mile hike to a petroglyph wall—the artwork is estimated to be at least 800 years old.

43. Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam

Up for a little road trip? Both the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead are just under an hour's drive from Las Vegas. At Lake Mead you can rent Jet Skis kayaks and fishing boats for a day or stick to dry land hiking and biking your heart out. This outdoor playground spreads across 1.5 million acres of mountains canyons valleys and two lakes. Meanwhile the Hoover Dam is a man-made American wonder. Built during the Great Depression the concrete dam currently provides water to 16 million people and controls the flooding of the Colorado River. It has come to symbolize innovation in engineering.



Eataly's candy corner will not disappoint.

Great Kid-Friendly Restaurants Las Vegas Has to Offer

44. Awesome Los Angeles Exports

Some of the best casual restaurants in Los Angeles have locations in Vegas. Like its sister store in LA Eataly Las Vegas is an upscale Italian food hall where you can feed your kids favorites like sandwiches and pizza while also picking up specialty groceries. My family got picnic items for the week at Eataly as well as treats from its immense candy corner. Got a hankering for Mexican food? Border Grill has a restaurant at Mandalay Bay. Its guacamole tacos and burritos are excellent and it has a nice kids' menu.

45. Fine Family Dining

Seeking something special with the kids but not too fancy? Buddy V's Ristorante located inside the Venetian is a great pick for families craving Italian food. The bambinos menu for kids 12 and under has fresh pasta and meat dishes and the offerings for adults are very tasty. My daughters and I also loved dining at Mon Ami Gabi a French restaurant at Paris Las Vegas. The steak frites (steak and fries) on the kids' menu were a big hit our salads and seafood were delicious and the table bread is downright addictive. Bonus: The restaurant is located across from the Bellagio fountain so you may catch a fountain show while dining!

46. Vegas Buffets

Go big at a Las Vegas buffet! The recently renovated Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace offers hundreds of food choices from around the world with 15 daily specials prepared in nine open kitchens (so your picky eater is bound to find something they like). Brunch-loving families enjoy the breakfast and lunch buffets at Wicked Spoon inside the Cosmopolitan. Along with its omelette and carving stations there's an extra-special dessert area where guests can indulge in cake pops cookies and gelato. Plus kids4 and under are free with a paying adult.

With a wave pool a lazy river and more Mandalay Bay is the perfect Las Vegas hotel for families.

Best Kid-Friendly Hotels in Las Vegas

Mandalay Bay is my go-to hotel when traveling to Las Vegas with my kids. Not only does it have great restaurants and entertainment but we always have a blast splashing in the hotel's lazy river and wave pool (though if you want a tube or floatie be prepared to bring your own or buy one). Rooms at Mandalay Bay are also very spacious and notably clean.

Speaking of great water play the MGM Grand has four swimming pools three whirlpools cascading waterfalls and its own lazy river where families can cool off and relax. Plus it's located on one of the busiest corners of the Strip (as well as a stop on the Vegas monorail) so visitors are in close proximity to many of the area's top attractions.

The Four Seasons is one of the few hotels on the Las Vegas Strip without a casino and that's a major reason why families love it and come away from their stay feeling refreshed. There are great restaurant options on site and small touches like high-end toiletries are always nice. Plus guests at the Four Seasons get access to Mandalay Bay including its pool complex.

Located 20 minutes from the Vegas Strip this hotel is set in the sandstone canyons with the Red Rock mountains as its backdrop. The decor at the Red Rock Resort is lovely and its pool complex is quite luxurious with nine pools spread across three stunning acres.

Gone are the days of a gambling hall lined with rows of small slot machines and players sitting shoulder-to-shoulder.

Now the casino floor allows for players to stretch out a bit as they play the tall vibrant slot machines with massive digital screens.

Changes to a casino floor’s layout started about 10 years ago and is now a common sight at Las Vegas casinos particularly in the post-pandemic era. Some operators are finding that focusing on player comfort and slot technology is paying off as gaming revenue reports show fewer machines on the floor are bringing in more money compared to 2019.

And with the start of the Global Gaming Expo Monday at The Venetian Expo industry leaders can expect to see the newest games that will likely shift casino floor layouts on the Strip.

Mike Gatten senior vice president of slot strategy at MGM Resorts International credits new technology as the driving force behind the changes. In the past both games and denomination options were limited. But the latest technology allows multi-game and multi-denomination functionality allowing less machines on the floor and maximizing the space to add other amenities.

“Our gaming floors are much different than what guests experienced five or 10 years ago” Gatten said in an email. “The advancements in technology that have allowed us to offer more games with less machines also have changed the slot machine’s profile. Guests will now see height and layers to a slot floor that feature video motion and color from a monitor — previously that was created by neon lights and a rotating sign over a slot bank.”

Gatten said the push from consumers for new dining and entertainment experiences has also required more space.

“So when the casino floor does not need as much of the space previously required guests have the opportunity to enjoy those amenities only steps away from their favorite machine” he said. “The physical shape of the floor not only changes but it also allows us to develop new pathways and sightlines to highlight and make those new amenities more visible to our guests.”

Fewer machines more money

Many casino operators’ new strategy can also be seen in the state’s gaming revenue numbers.

Clark County brought in $688.7 million in slot machine wins in August from 88375 slot machine units. In August 2019 slot machine wins were reported to be $478.4 million from 103260 slot machine units.

In the state slot handle in August was 40 percent higher compared to August 2019 even though there were 123300 units in August and 140600 units in August 2019.

Industry members say the numbers show it’s likely a combination of factors proving that “less is more.”

Rahmi Chaghouri director of operations at Circa the D Las Vegas and Golden Gate casinos points to advancements in slot technology from manufacturers — multiple lines of play more multipliers and other progressives. Players can also have higher average bets and more games played per minute on improved machines.

“Slots and the technology have advanced that it’s created more ways for people to essentially win and also lose and to play a lot faster” he said.

COVID-fueled changes

Charlie Lombardo a retired Las Vegas gaming executive who now works as a consultant for Seminole Gaming and Hard Rock International suspects the pandemic accelerated the casinos’ adoption of a new layout.

Faced with social-distancing requirements after reopening from state-mandated public health closures in 2020 many operators took games off the floor to allow for at least 6 feet of space between players. That led to an increased “pod” configuration where games are set up in a circle triangle or football-like shape.

“What they found is that it made the casino much more comfortable and players enjoyed being separated a little bit — which we always knew but most thought more was better” Lombardo said. “I thought more wasn’t always better. I think everyone found less machines were more productive.”

It’s something even gaming manufacturers have noticed.

Nick Khin IGT’s chief operating officer of gaming said the London-based company’s customers are sharing feedback that indicates a turn away from straight banks.

“We’ve definitely seen that. I’m a player too and when I go to a casino and play I don’t necessarily want to sit right next to somebody — especially if they’re smoking” Khin said. “I think players’ preferences have definitely changed and definitely have changed since the pandemic. People are a little more mindful about social distancing and what-not. We’ve seen a lot of success with different configurations.”

Khin believes the rising popularity of electronic table games also brought into the spotlight during the pandemic has added to the changes.

Guests looking for more space away from others can now choose a pod- or stadium-style setup instead of a table with a live dealer and possibly other players sitting next to them.

That’s led IGT to consider flexibility when doing research and development he said. Game and machine designers consider how a casino may position a game whether it be in a bank up against the wall in a pod or elsewhere.

Centering guest comfort

Despite the success of machines arranged in a pod-style post-pandemic some casinos were incorporating the format long before COVID-19 arrived in the U.S.

Chaghouri said casino floors are generally designed based on the building’s available space and the infrastructure’s age.

The old-school mentality was that more slots meant more money he said but things changed when people considered the psychology of a customer’s choice.

“When you’re in the car no one ever wants to sit in the middle” Chaghouri said. “It’s kind of the same at a slot machine.”

The D Las Vegas began podding about six years ago when the team reduced the floor count of slot machines by about 150 he said.

They found that fewer games still yielded strong play.

“Any chance we can get to give people a bit more elbow room we’re gonna do it” he said. “More slots isn’t always the answer. If you have 4000 slots on your floor and you’re only getting 100 people who play them then what do you really need 4000 slots for? It’s about getting the right utilization the right mix and knowing what your customers want what the hazards are and what slots they flock to.”

For MGM Resorts that same philosophy guided its configuration changes Gatten said.

If there are three machines in a row with the same game and the middle is receiving less play then floor operators will reconfigure it into a pod so each player can have an “end” spot.

Guests also feel more comfortable when there are increased sightlines Chaghouri said. As cabinets get taller they could crowd the casino floor’s space and make it difficult to see across the room.

“If you’re looking across the casino looking for a restaurant looking for a restroom looking for a store a bar as the slots get bigger it’s tougher to see those types of things” Chaghouri said. “By podding a slot up instead of making a wall of 10 of these things it helps visually to increase sightlines and make it a little easier to peer across the casino and see where you’re going.”

However industry leaders say the trend may be limited to Las Vegas. That’s because the area’s hypercompetitive market rarely results in full occupancy so reducing the number of games can have little impact. On the other hand tribal and regional casinos need to maximize utilization Lombardo said.

Gatten of MGM Resorts expects the strategy to stick around.

“Currently the floors’ layouts are much more open exciting and offer our players an opportunity that allows them to see and feel more activity around them during their gaming experience” he said in the email. “The feedback we’ve received has been overwhelmingly positive and this certainly was the push we needed to evolve our operations and adopt this new strategy at our properties.”

Ardy Sidhwa Ph.D. Pure Wafer vice president of operations in exclusive comments to Flagstaff Business News said the company is making a multimillion-dollar investment in finding better more efficient and faster ways to keep up with increasing national and international demands. The 50000-square-foot plant located at 2575 Melville Road on the east side of Prescott Regional Airport has been producing wafers and reclaimed wafers for microchip industries since 1998. Yet many local residents are unaware of the company’s operation even with rapid expansion.

Sidhwa and Pure Wafer CEO S. Mark Borowicz are excited about the opportunities now opening because of the growing semiconductor renaissance in Arizona.

Sidhwa cited the CHIPS and Science Acts of 2022 signed on Aug. 9 which is expected to add manufacturing jobs and allow American manufacturing supply chains and research and development throughout the U.S. to add $50 billion in investments to American semiconductor manufacturing.

Further the CHIPS Act legislation is expected to drive down chip costs further and should lower the costs for products in which chips and wafers are used.

Sidhwa emphasized that chips and semiconductors are “the tiny brains found in all sorts of contemporary products ranging from computers and automobiles to household appliances and weapons systems.”

Sidhwa was even more enthusiastic about Pure Wafer’s growing business in life sciences photonics and micro-electromagnetic systems when it acquired NOEL Technologies. It is a Silicon Valley foundry that serves as a developer of innovative semiconductor and biochips. The company fills the innovation gap often serving as an extension of research and development.

He said “More and more scientists and medical personnel are finding creative applications for microchips and biochips that can be then used to help people find remedies and tackle diseases that ultimately improve quality of life. Use of semiconductor technology applications through artificial intelligence applications are astounding. We’re generations ahead of where we were 10 years ago.”

He stressed that what’s really significant is that such applications are now more approved at the international level.

“What we want to do in Prescott is to expand our production even as much as 20 to 40%. At the same time we’re improving efficiency of production of what we are manufacturing For instance we’ve become more efficient in use of water. Same thing with chemicals. Same thing with electricity. We are reducing emissions and pollution dramatically. We take great pride in having absolute purified air and sterile water.”

Increased production will permit Pure Wafer to add to its already large customer base of 1600 integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

The company has a growing client base throughout North America Asia and Europe.

Arizona State University (ASU) President Michel Crow is also an advocate for expanding the semiconductor business in the state. He said that ASU is well positioned to provide the skilled talent needed with 30000 students currently enrolled in the engineering school.

Sidhwa admits that finding good labor is sometimes difficult. Because Pure Wafer operates 24 hours a day seven days a week and because it is expanding so rapidly recruiting reliable labor is a continual challenge. Additionally because Pure Wafer has its original plant in Prescott and another two fabrication plants in San Jose and Campbell California called Noel Technologies labor demands continue to increase Sidhwa said. Last month’s report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the creation of 528000 new jobs.

Pure Wafer is offering short- and long-term insurance plans disability plans medical insurance on-the-job training and professional advancement opportunities to attract skilled workers.

“Financial incentives now available are going to accelerate even further since Pure Wafer is the No. 1 most advanced wafer reclaim company in the nation” said Sidhwa. “We’re proud of that.” FBN

Micron a U.S.-based memory and storage manufacturer and the fourth-largest producer of semiconductors in the world will invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to construct the project with the first phase investment of $20 billion planned by the end of this decade creating nearly 50000 jobs statewide — 9000 new high-paying Micron jobs with an average annual salary of over $100000 and over 40000 community jobs — and create thousands and thousands of prevailing wage construction jobs. When complete the complex will include the nation’s largest clean room space at approximately 2.4 million square feet the size of nearly 40 football fields.

This is another step for Micron to establish leading-edge memory manufacturing in the U.S. to meet the demand of consumer industrial and business products such as automotive and mobile fueled by the adoption of artificial intelligence and 5G and make the United States more globally competitive.

Micron’s $100 billion investment in New York marks the start of something transformative in scale and possibility for our state’s economic future.-said hochul

This is our Erie Canal moment. Just as the original Erie Canal did centuries ago this 21st Century Erie Canal will flow through the heart of Central New York and redefine Upstate New York’s place in the global economy for generations to come. Micron’s investment will make New York’s semiconductor corridor into a major engine powering our economy and will supply ‘Made in New York’ microchips to everything from electric vehicles 5G and defense technology to personal computers and smartphones-said Schumer

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said “This historic announcement is a major win for Micron for New York and the United States. I am grateful for President Biden and his Administration for making the CHIPS and Science Act a priority to Leader Schumer and a bipartisan coalition in Congress for passing the legislation and to Governor Hochul and County Executive McMahon for their leadership and partnership. The combined efforts at the federal state and local level paved the way for Micron to realize the largest private investment ever made in New York state history. We are thrilled to make this significant investment in New York making the Empire State the location of the biggest leading-edge memory site in the U.S. We chose this location for many reasons but most importantly — Central New York offers a rich pool of diverse talent including communities that traditionally have been underrepresented in technology jobs. This historic leading-edge memory megafab will deliver benefits beyond the semiconductor industry by strengthening U.S. technology leadership as well as economic and national security driving American innovation and competitiveness for decades to come.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5cmFjdXNlLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzEwL2FzLW1pY3Jvbi1kZWFsLWxvb21lZC1vbm9uZGFnYS1jb3VudHktcmV2dmVkLXVwLWxhbmQtYnV5aW5nLXNwcmVlLWluLWNsYXktbGlzdC5odG1s0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5cmFjdXNlLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzEwL2FzLW1pY3Jvbi1kZWFsLWxvb21lZC1vbm9uZGFnYS1jb3VudHktcmV2dmVkLXVwLWxhbmQtYnV5aW5nLXNwcmVlLWluLWNsYXktbGlzdC5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Micron deal loomed Onondaga County revved up land-buying spree in Clay (list),"Clay N.Y. — Over the past two years Onondaga County embarked on a land-buying binge an essential part of wooing a major computer chip manufacturer to the town of Clay.

Micron Technology Inc. announced plans this week to invest as much as $100 billion to build a semiconductor-manufacturing campus in New York state the latest in what is being called “a wave” of chip production investments in the U.S. announced in the wake of CHIPS passage.

Texas Instruments also made public its own investment plans for a new plant in the Dallas area recently.

In January this year Intel first unveiled its plan to invest at least $20 billion in chip-making capacity in two plants outside Columbus employing some 3000 workers long-term in part to answer a global chip shortage that has affected more than one industry.

Intel last month broke ground for dual chip factories in Licking County. In that same week several federal and state officials made a medium-sized Beavercreek manufacturer Quality Quartz Engineering the temporary center of the universe all pointing to the company as an example of the commercial potential unleashed by Intel’s plans in Ohio.

Sen. Sherrod Brown visited Silfex Inc. in Springfield on Wednesday to discuss how the CHIPS Act is boosting Ohio businesses including businesses that hope to position themselves as Intel suppliers.

Just in construction the Intel project would mean some 5000 building trades workers working for 10 years and perhaps more Brown has said.

“We have seen for a generation large corporations lobby Congress for trade agreements like NAFTA … that move jobs offshore” Brown said in an interview Wednesday. “We’ve seen those same large corporations lobby Congress for tax breaks to move jobs in search of cheap labor.”

The CHIPS Act represented a “conscious decision” to “begin the work of reshoring these jobs” in America he said.

“So this is sort of the beginning the turnaround to reindustrialize America” the senator added. “That’s why I call it a new industrial policy — many of us have been calling for this for decades and now we’re finally doing it.”

Silfex a division of Lam Research Corp. makes the parts used in the equipment semiconductor manufacturers use to make chips.

“It’s clear that America’s reliance on foreign-made computer chips has become one of our nation’s most pressing national security concerns and it threatens the future competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers — in Ohio and every other state” said Ryan Augsburger president of the Ohio Manufacturing Association. “By enacting the CHIPS Act federal policymakers demonstrated they could set aside partisan differences to tackle the most serious economic and geopolitical challenges.”

“While the federal legislation is playing a valuable role in this new development it’s still just an incentive. The private sector — whether it’s Intel Micron or another company — is taking the risk and making the investment” he added.

Eaton-based Silfex has continued to grow its Springfield workforce since it first announced plans to expand into the area in 2017. By the end of 2021 it had surpassed its initial goal of having 400 people committed to the Springfield facility.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL29waW5pb24vZW5kb3JzZW1lbnRzL2NodWNrLXNjaHVtZXItam9lLXBpbmlvbi11cy1zZW5hdGUtbG9uZy1pc2xhbmQtbmV3LXlvcmstZWxlY3Rpb24tMjAyMi1qMm55Y3liNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chuck Schumer for U.S. Senate,"Sen. Chuck Schumer's stature and power has grown with the majority leader title that now precedes his name.

But he hasn't forgotten the communities that brought him to that place including those on Long Island and the ones that depend upon him for resources. The state and the region are better off with him in the U.S. Senate's leadership currently as majority leader and before that minority leader.

It's that mix combined with a dynamic and engaged presence even after more than four decades in Washington that has helped Schumer 71 mostly successfully navigate the choppy waters of a divided U.S. Senate while always looking for ways to get more for his home state.

It hasn't been easy but the wins have been significant including COVID-19 relief amounting to $10.5 billion for Long Island small businesses and nonprofits and more than $15 billion for public transit funds for theaters and municipalities and significant dollars for infrastructure technology and the environment.

Schumer's leadership is in part responsible for a milestone for New York this year: The state finally got more than it gave to the nation's capital — $1.59 came back to the state for every $1 that headed to Washington. That's partially because of the additional funds related to COVID that Schumer as majority leader was able to secure for state and local coffers.

Perhaps one of the biggest recent victories Schumer can claim is the siting of the world's first electron-ion collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. That $2 billion project will have an extraordinary impact on Long Island and on the science itself not to mention the jobs and economic benefits it will produce.

Also key to the state's economic future: the CHIPS and Science Act that Schumer championed which led to Micron Technology Inc.'s plan to invest up to $100 billion on a semiconductor manufacturing campus upstate.

Schumer has been particularly important to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority pushing forward and funding key projects from the East Side Access connection to Grand Central Terminal to the East River Tunnels rehab. His role will remain particularly important on upcoming items like congestion pricing and Penn Station's remake.

Schumer's opponent is Yonkers Republican Joe Pinion a former Newsmax television anchor who talks of building an ""uncommon coalition"" to focus on issues he said have long been ignored. Pinion who turns 39 on Oct. 11 is right to highlight several enormous challenges from crumbling and failing public schools to poverty. His passion is welcome but he lacks concrete ideas on how to fix the problems he cites and the skills needed to effectively serve New York in the U.S. Senate.

Schumer still has much to do and is capable of getting it done thanks to his flexibility and the relationships he has built. He pledges to hold a vote on the Respect for Marriage Act after the election likely during the lame-duck session. That's important to codify legal recognition of same-sex marriages. But he's also looking to January when he hopes Democrats will have more seats in the Senate and retain control of the House. If that happens Schumer told the editorial board there would be a lot on the table including getting done critical but unfinished elements of the Build Back Better and Inflation Reduction Act efforts such as funding early child care and universal pre-K.

If Schumer doesn't get the political edge he's hoping for he'll have to find a way forward through often-rocky bipartisan terrain. He rightly notes the importance of the Senate's power to confirm judges at all levels; there are about 40 to be confirmed during the upcoming lame duck session.

But he also says there are items he can get done even in a complicated political landscape. Among them: comprehensive immigration reform which Schumer hopes could be similar to the 2013 bill he and the late Sen. John McCain authored with a path to citizenship for the nation's 11 million immigrants here illegally additional border patrols and more. Schumer is right to try to line up the support of key business leaders who need workers and should recognize immigration's contribution to a healthy growing economy.

Also crucial: the restoration of the state and local tax deduction a promise he hasn't delivered on yet. Whether it's left to expire in 2025 or there's a way to unravel it sooner SALT must continue to be at the top of Schumer's list.

Schumer rightly worries about the future of democracy. But his response to the issue is telling: ""One of the best things that we can do is show people that it works for them.""

Schumer notes that his father who passed away last year left him with two key lessons — to always help those who need help and to ""persist and persist and persist"" when you know you're doing the right thing. If Schumer can continue to uphold those values while keeping New York and especially Long Island at the top of his mind there's still much for him to accomplish.

Right now multiple worldwide regulators are sifting through tons of games industry data. The massive Microsoft-Activision merger is looming and regulators have collected libraries of data figures testimonials and expert opinions as they try to determine if the mega-merger is good for consumers and the $198 billion video games market as a whole.

Some regulators like Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) have already approved the merger. CADE released a public document outlining its thought process on the approval and included a ton of data on Xbox PlayStation Nintendo and others.

One specific figure shows just how much Microsoft makes from Xbox Game Pass on consoles. According to the data Xbox Game Pass generated $2.9 billion from consoles in 2021. Based on data publicly available by Microsoft Xbox gaming generated a total of $16.28 billion in calendar year 2021.

This means Xbox Game Pass made up roughly 18% of Microsoft's total yearly Xbox revenues ($16.28 billion) and nearly 30% of its games and services revenues ($12.581 billion) for the period.

We can take that even further and align those values with subscribers as of that period. Microsoft has sporadically revealed Xbox Game Pass subscriber numbers so we can't be 100% accurate however between August 2021 and March 2022 Xbox Game Pass went from 15 million to 18 million subscribers. So we can pinpoint a range $2.9 billion revenues generated from 15-18 million subscribers across both PC and consoles.

Remember the revenue figure is just for consoles and does not include PC Game Pass earnings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzkvMjMzOTMyOTAvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN1cmZhY2UtbGF1bmNoLWFybS13aW5kb3dzLWxhcHRvcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The PC market needs another reinvention — is Microsoft's Surface up for it again?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzkvMjMzOTMyOTAvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN1cmZhY2UtbGF1bmNoLWFybS13aW5kb3dzLWxhcHRvcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA22AEC0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzkvMjMzOTMyOTAvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN1cmZhY2UtbGF1bmNoLWFybS13aW5kb3dzLWxhcHRvcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXdpLWZpLWRpcmVjdC12aXJ0dWFsLWFkYXB0ZXItcmVtb3ZlLWRpc2FibGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Remove and Disable the Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXdpLWZpLWRpcmVjdC12aXJ0dWFsLWFkYXB0ZXItcmVtb3ZlLWRpc2FibGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5kb3dzY2VudHJhbC5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0L21pY3Jvc29mdC1uZXdzLXJvdW5kdXAtZ2lhbnQtbnZpZGlhLXJ0eC00MDkwLXN1cmZhY2UtZHVvLXRvLWdldC13aW5kb3dzLTExLWxvb2stb3ZlcndhdGNoLTItYW5kLW1vcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft News Roundup: Giant NVIDIA RTX 4090 Surface Duo to get Windows 11 look Overwatch 2 and more,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5kb3dzY2VudHJhbC5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0L21pY3Jvc29mdC1uZXdzLXJvdW5kdXAtZ2lhbnQtbnZpZGlhLXJ0eC00MDkwLXN1cmZhY2UtZHVvLXRvLWdldC13aW5kb3dzLTExLWxvb2stb3ZlcndhdGNoLTItYW5kLW1vcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC9245900>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5kb3dzY2VudHJhbC5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0L21pY3Jvc29mdC1uZXdzLXJvdW5kdXAtZ2lhbnQtbnZpZGlhLXJ0eC00MDkwLXN1cmZhY2UtZHVvLXRvLWdldC13aW5kb3dzLTExLWxvb2stb3ZlcndhdGNoLTItYW5kLW1vcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS90cmF2ZWwtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1taWNyb3NvZnQtc3VyZmFjZS1sYXB0b3AtNC1ldm9sdXRpb24tb2YtYS1jbGFzc2ljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travel Technology - Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 - Evolution of a classic? - Economy Class & Beyond,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='economyclassandbeyond.boardingarea.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/10/09/travel-technology-microsoft-surface-laptop-4-evolution-of-a-classic/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC9245A50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wOS90cmF2ZWwtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1taWNyb3NvZnQtc3VyZmFjZS1sYXB0b3AtNC1ldm9sdXRpb24tb2YtYS1jbGFzc2ljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

“To keep up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination if you are 50 years old or older and have achieved minimum protection you should receive an additional dose within five months to one year of the last vaccine dose” he said.

Addressing concerns surrounding the updated bivalent dose that targets the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Omicron BA.1 variant Mr Ong said that clinical studies have proven that the dose has the same safety profile as the original Moderna/Spikevax mRNA vaccine.

The original vaccine has been administered more than three million times in Singapore he noted.

“Serious adverse events have been reported in about six in 100000 vaccinations and all have recovered or are recovering” Mr Ong said adding that the Health Sciences Authority has reported a declining rate of such events with subsequent shots.

This means that fewer people have adverse reactions after taking booster doses compared to taking it as part of the primary series.

Those who are considering of skipping their second booster shot and taking the bivalent dose instead should do so said Mr Ong.

""We have basically stopped counting boosters"" he added.

The Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine will be available at all joint testing and vaccination centres from Oct 17.

MODERNA/SPIKEVAX VACCINE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN

Separately Mr Ong assured the public that it is safe to vaccine children aged six months to five years with the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine which will be available to them as a primary vaccination.

He added that serious adverse effects are rare with no cases of anaphylaxis or pericarditis/myocarditis observed in the clinical trial.

“Common side effects (such as injection site pain fatigue headache) were observed less commonly than in adults and subside within two to three days” said the Health Minister.

Singapore will begin offering COVID-19 vaccinations for children between the ages of six months and four years starting on Oct 25 said MOH on Friday.

The recommended Moderna/Spikevax vaccine dosage for this age group is two doses of 25 micrograms each spaced eight weeks apart.

""The vaccine from Pfizer BioNTech/Comirnaty which is a three-dose vaccine for children aged six months to four years has also been approved and we are awaiting delivery. It should be available by the end of the year"" MOH added.

The Pfizer/Comirnaty bivalent vaccine is undergoing evaluation and is expected to be available by the end of this year said the ministry.

The Health Ministry also said in the news release that all COVID-19 vaccination-differentiated measures will be lifted from Oct 10 with restrictions no longer in place for dining in nightlife establishments and events with more than 500 participants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy52ZXJub25tb3JuaW5nc3Rhci5jb20vbmF0aW9uYWwtbmV3cy9iLWMtdG8tZ2V0LTEtNy1taWxsaW9uLWRvc2VzLW9mLW5ldy1wZml6ZXItYml2YWxlbnQtdmFjY2luZS1mcm9tLW5leHQtd2Vlay0zMzUwODcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B.C. to get 1.7 million doses of new Pfizer bivalent vaccine from next week,"Moderna’s equivalent bivalent shot is already available to those aged 18 and older

Provincial officials say shipments of Pfizer’s new COVID-19 vaccine targeting the Omicron variant are expected in British Columbia soon after Health Canada approved the shot.

A joint statement from B.C.’s provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix says the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine will be available to people aged 12 and older from next week.

They say B.C. is set to receive 1.7 million doses of the newly approved shot which will be available in health authority clinics and pharmacies across the province.

Approved last month Moderna’s equivalent bivalent shot is already available to those aged 18 and older with B.C. set to receive 1.4 million of 10.5 million doses in Canada.

The health officials say both bivalent vaccines induce a “stronger more robust immune response and provide better protection against the Omicron variant and subvariants.”

They say their recommendation that people get either bivalent vaccine as their fall COVID-19 booster is in line with that of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization.

The province notes influenza vaccines will be available starting next Tuesday.",,,,,,

What makes a beer popular? Nailing down the specific parameters can be tricky. Is it a simple measure of overall sales or the number of markets in which it's sold? Perhaps some more subjective assessments should be considered like the level of enthusiasm or loyalty displayed by its customer base. Whatever your preferred scale of measurement some beers are clearly extremely popular like the light and refreshing classic Blue Moon.

Blue Moon is a monumentally well-known and widely sought-after brand that has easily etched itself into the annals of U.S. brewing history. It was first brewed in 1995 at the Sandlot Brewery in Denver Colorado (via Blue Moon). This beer can be found and purchased (in-person or online) in virtually every corner of the U.S. as of 2022.

Frankly it's impossible to envision the modern craft beer landscape without Blue Moon's emergence in the mid-1990s. While some believe its status as a subsidiary of Molson Coors taints its craft brewing claims the high-brow snobbery of certain craft beer fanatics hasn't dimmed the public's overall appreciation for Blue Moon.

When you're standing alone without a dream in your heart Blue Moon will almost certainly be there for you. Of course even its most ardent fan may be unaware of the brewery's wholly unique and distinguished history or many details about the beer itself. There are so many fascinating details to know about this iconic beer.",,,,,,,,,

Mondelēz International has marked its 10th anniversary under its present branding through reaffirming its mission values of empowering consumers to enjoy confectionery and snacks responsibly writes Neill Barston.

The business which formerly changed its name from Kraft Foods in October 2012 arrived at its name after a survey from over 1000 employees as to the company’s future identity.

Consequently US-owned Mondelēz which is said to have derived from the French for ‘world’ and made-up ‘delez’ evoking a close association with ‘delicious’ was fashioned. The major move was sanctioned just two years after the business bought Cadbury in 2010 for £11.5 billion with the brand which has longstanding global recognition being retained under its original guise.

As the company noted its sustained progress across its chocolate biscuit and baked snacks enterprises which it has continued to expand with further acquisitions in recent years has cemented its market leading position.

“We have so much to be proud of since Mondelēz International was born in 2012” said Dirk Van de Put Chairman & CEO Mondelēz International. “We have delivered sustained growth and strong financial performance while continuously innovating to stay ahead of changing consumer tastes and navigating a dynamic external environment. As we recognise this important milestone in our company’s young history our 80000 talented ‘makers and bakers’ around the world are even more passionate about creating the right snacks for the right moments made the right way for many years to come.”

As the company added each October Mondelēz International celebrates its annual Purpose Day – encouraging employees to pause reflect and refocus on their roles in advancing the company’s Purpose. This year’s event features a wide range of community outreach volunteering mindfulness and wellness initiatives across the company’s global operations.

This includes its international’s Latin America team is working with a local NGO to donate trees to help restore the Amazon through an innovative employee matching program. Employees in Japan are sponsoring educational initiatives to promote consumer understanding of mindful snacking

In addition the business is also is rolling out an upgraded fully digitised employee volunteering platform that links colleagues around the world to local community organisations. The company’s celebration culminates with the ringing of the closing bell today on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange to mark Mondelēz International’s 10th year of listing.

As the business added it has devised four key strategic pillars including accelerating growth through achieving 90% of revenue from chocolate and biscuits including baked snacks.

Its second pillar remains delivering enhanced digital sales – with $1 billion invested into infrastructure aimed at gaining 20% of revenues from digital channels by 2030. Its third pillar is that of culture empowering employees promote a growth culture and continue building a team of deep and diverse talent.

Finally sustainability remains a key factor and delivering on a clear set of goals for its environmental social and governance priorities.

In terms of its sustainability gains it outlined its achievements against 2025 targets – by the end of 2021 75% of cocoa volume for chocolate brands was sourced through Cocoa Life; on track to reach goal of 100% by its target date in three years’ time.

On climate in 2021 32% of electricity used in manufacturing sites was renewable compared to 23% in 2020.

Their larger perception is that they help give users some 'energy' which might not always be the case as we are about to see. According to Allied Markets Research the world's energy drink market size was at $45.80 billion by 20220 and there was a projection that this might go up to $108.40 billion as we hit 2031.

When making energy drinks manufacturers use highly potent stimulants mainly guarana ginseng taurine and caffeine and others hoping to enhance mental alertness. They are common among people who work long hours such as truck drivers strained machine operators hotel attendants and medics. All manufacturers of energy drinks advance the idea that their drinks can generate instant Energy. Many people are unaware there could be serious negative implications if you use it for a long time. This article aims to enlighten you on the ten worst energy drinks in the world.

10. Redline

Redline is manufactured by Vital Pharmaceuticals the same company that produces Bang and it was released to the market in 2012. It sells under the tagline ""Fuel Your Destiny."" When introducing the drink the company said it was meant for weight loss. Users have reported that they experience shaking and shivering effects when taking it. The feeling has been attributed to the fact that it is meant to burn calories. However many do not understand that calories can only be burnt through exercise or with the help of natural diet supplements. You are straining your metabolic system when using the drink to burn calories.

It is also among the most caffeinated drinks with 300 mg of caffeine in every 2.5 ounces. You can't claim that you are taking a healthy drink when it has 500% value in Vitamin B12-this far away from the recommended levels. To recruit more female customers the company introduced the Redline Princes. It contains the ""love drug'"" chemical component that users believe enhances mood. All these chemical components affect how your body should function naturally.

9. Spike Shooter

One of the tricks used by the manufacturers of Spike Shooter is that they registered it as a supplement item which allows them not to display the exact components of its manufacturing formula. However independent studies have established that every can has 3000 mg of caffeine which is very high compared to the other drinks. Due to its status as a supplement since it is an energy drink it takes advantage of the legal loophole that it is not required to declare whether it is safe. Nevertheless this has not prevented the negative effects from getting out. In 2007 a high school in Colorado had to ban the drink after two students developed heart palpitations after using it.

8. Zoa

Sometimes celebrities take advantage of their fame and introduce products that have serious negative implications for their followers. Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson partnered with Dave Rienzi and Dany Garcia to produce the ZOA energy drink. According to ZOA's management the drink does not have preservatives additives and artificial ingredients. The dark side of the story is the answer to the question why is it sweet yet the company alleges that it is sugar-free? The answer is simple-they use Acesulfame Potassium and Sucralose to make it sweeter. In every 16 oz of the drink there is 160 mg of caffeine. It is not ranking among the worst because it contains 100% recommended levels of Niacin Vitamin B12 and Vitamin B6.

According to experts consulted by Food Network.com the suspicion on the claim by The Rock that the drink is ""clean and healthy"" began the moment it did not include the percentages of the contents in its can. The other problem was the claim by Johnson that it is a replacement for a healthy means which many health experts disagree with. The 160 mg of caffeine is equivalent to 2-3 cups of coffee which may overwhelm some people especially those who prefer drinks other than coffee or tea.

7. C4 Energy

The famous Cellucor company produces C4 Energy. It has been in the market since 2018. The drink is dominant in Canada Germany and the United States. Its producer and distributor Cellucor is one of the leading sports nutrition companies in the United States. You will probably get it there when you walk to the nearest gas station grocery store or gym. It is sold in 16 and 12 -ounce cans. When you visit the company's website they tell you to ""ignite your fire with the C4 Energy"" drink. They tell you the drink's specific components and quantities at no point. They attempt to say it is the fastest-growing energy drink in the United States. You are not reading that its caffeine content is 200 mg every 16 oz. It does not list whether it has Vitamin B6 but it contains 250% Vitamin B12 and Niacin at 190% in every 16 oz can. In addition they can't risk telling you that they add Acesulfame Potassium Sucralose and Stevia Leaf Extract to sweeten the drink for it contains zero industrial sugar.

6. Red Bull

Red Bull is the second largest energy drink in market share in the world/. It is manufactured by Rauch and distributed by Red Bull GmbH. The companies are in Australia and it has been in the market since 1987. Red Bull drinks include Red Bull Sugar-free Total Zero Zero Energy Short and Editions. The drink uses the ""Red Bull Gives You Wings'' advertisement to attract its customers. It has been in the top line to support energy-related events such as the Red Bull Air Race Reb Bull Cliff Diving World Series. Through Red Bull Records it has been supporting musicians. It invented the American market in 1996 and since then it has grown to be a fierce competitor of the Monster energy drink. Its caffeine content is 151 mg and its 16 oz sugar intake equivalent is 101%. It exceeds the recommended levels of Niacin by 190% Vitamin B12 BY 160% and Vitamin B6 by 470%. According to Healthline it joins other energy drinks to increase your blood pressure and heart rate damaging your teeth and possibly leading to diabetes (type 2).

5. Monster

To many it might be surprising why we have the Monster on this list. Monster is the leading producer of the Monster Beverage Corporation. Since its introduction on April 18 2002 it has dominated the energy drink market with some reports indicating that it will have more than 35 % of the drinks market by 2019. It has become famous for sponsoring sports events such as the NASCAR Cup Series BMX MotoGP and the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) among other activities.

It is also famous for sponsoring great concerts such as Strange Music Machine Gun Kelly Poppy and 21 Savage. Despite all this you may not be aware of the dark side of Monster. It contains 160 mg of caffeine and 54 grams of sugar equivalent to 108% percent over intake of the substance and it contains Vitamin B6 Vitamin B12 and Niacin at excesses of 240% 500% and 250 % respectively. Some of the negative effects of over intake of the Moster energy drink is that it causes heart rhythm disturbances besides causing high blood pressure due to increased heartbeats.

4. Bang

Many health institutions keep interchanging the ranking of Rockstar with Bang regarding how harmful they are. It is manufactured and distributed by Vital Pharmaceuticals. In total sales in the United States it only ranks following Red Bull and Monster. It is probably the energy drink whose adverts on social media are the most aggressive. It has been in the market since 2012 and comes with the tagline ""Fuel Your Destiny."" When it was introduced VPX said it was releasing an energy drink with 'high-quality nutritional supplements 'It argued that this assertion had been backed by scientific research. However they never told customers that the drink had 300 grams of caffeine and used Sucralose artificial sugar to sweeten the drinks.

The only truth they could have told us is that its components do not exceed the recommended values of Vitamin B6 (it is at 30 %) Vitamin B12 (it is at 60 %) and Niacin (which is at 30 %). Some of the most common negative effects of taking Bang are that it causes dizziness and insomnia for it has high caffeine content and increases heartbeat. It would help if you always controlled how you use it because its caffeine percentage is close to what the FDA has recommended.

3. Cocaine

Cocaine is one of the most caffeinated energy drinks. It was introduced in the market in 2006; Redux Beverages manufactured it. This has cherry and cinnamon flavors. It is marketed under the pretext that it is the ""legal alternative"" to cocaine. Per every can the drink contains 280 mg of caffeine with its manufacturer's chest-thumping that it is stronger than Red Bull by 350 times. It also contains 750 grams of taurine a high-level stimulant which has been used for marketing the drink in different locations. Cocaine is famous among the young. When you take you shall experience the ""throat-numbing"" effect cocaine users experience. In 2007 the FDA recommended the adverse negative effects which led it to be banned in the States.

Later the drink was allowed into the market with changes in the formula. For a long time social and moral institutions such as religious groups and leading parties in the acedia have condemned the drink for the:"" legal alternative"" slogan accusing it of playing a role in encouraging the use of the actual cocaine drug. You will commonly see it being taken by young people at parties and concerts whose performers have been accused of using performance enhancers.

2. Rockstar

One of the most cunning characteristics of energy drinks is their lies about their contents. When you open the Rockstar Website they introduce themselves as being ""the original"" energy drink and it goes ahead to persuade you by telling you that you are ""the Rockstar for every hustle. There cannot be a perfect life than this. The truth is that it contains some of the highest sugar levels among the drinks on this list. However compared to Bang and reign it has lower caffeine levels. If it is fun then be aware that you are overtaking sugar by 126%. The only benefit you get from the drink is that it has a 100% recommended amount of Vitamin B12 Vitamin B6 and Niacin. About Lawsuits.Com reported that the Food and Drunks Authority (FDA) of the United States had received 13 complaints about the adverse effects of using Rockstar. Rockstar's reported severe effects are that it can cause heart attacks stroke and acute hepatitis.

1. Reign

Reign got into the market in 2019 through its parent company Monster Beverage. The drink is packaged in more than ten flavors the most famous being the Orange Dreamsicle Razzle Berry Sour Apple Melon Mania and Lemon HDZ (Heads). After it was introduced VPX Sports launched a lawsuit against Monster Beverage Corporation because it had infringed on its trade dress by using the word ""reign."" The company m markets the drink having zero artificial colors and sugar. Independent parties have established that it contains 300 mg of caffeine.

Despite their adverts that it contains zero sugar they must use artificial sweeteners such as Sucralose. It exceeds the recommended Vitamin B12 by 250% Vitamin B6 by over 120% and Niacin by 130%. According to Reize Club the high levels of caffeine is overwhelming for new users and it may cause insomnia rapid heart rate and insomnia. The drink is also not suitable for those who undertake light duties daily.

In Conclusion

The Energy drink industry is one clear example of how governments compromise public safety or business existence. Indeed if it were to exist by merit many energy drinks would have been closed a long time ago. Governments and consumer protection agencies must take serious actions to punish any company not adhering to relevant health laws severely. Energy drinks have been crucial in developing sports and talents despite their dark sides. Lastly the government must compel all energy drink companies to provide the formula for manufacturing the drinks to the public.",,,,,,,,,

""The outlook remains negative"" the New York-based rating agency said amid the devastation floods in Pakistan Dawn reported.

Debt affordability a long-standing credit weakness for Pakistan will remain extremely weak for the foreseeable future.

The downgrade has pushed the country into the C-category after seven years (March 2015).

Pakistan strongly contested Moody's downgrade decision saying it was taken unilaterally was based on premature data and did not depict the true picture due to information gaps and contradictions.

In June Moody's also downgraded Pakistan's outlook to negative from stable amid a delay in a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic bailout.

""The decision to change the outlook to negative is driven by Pakistan's heightened external vulnerability risk and uncertainty around the sovereign's ability to secure additional external financing to meet its needs"" Dawn newspaper reported citing Moody's statement.

Meanwhile Pakistan's current account deficit widened to USD 13.8 billion during the first 10 months (July to April) of the current fiscal year compared to a deficit of USD 543 million a year earlier Dawn reported.

According to data from the IMF Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves have declined to USD 9.7 billion at the end of April which can only cover less than two months of imports. This compares with the USD 18.9 billion of reserves at the end of July last year.

Moody's projected the current account deficit to come in at 4.5-5 per cent of GDP for the ongoing fiscal year slightly wider than the government's expectations.

Moreover the next elections are due in Pakistan by the middle of 2023. In Moody's view political parties will find it difficult to continually enact significant revenue-raising measures in the run-up to the elections especially in a high inflation environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The banks led by Morgan Stanley and six others including Barclays and Bank of America committed six months ago to raise $13bn in debt to finance Musk’s purchase – an agreement that does not hinge on whether they are able to sell the debt on to investors.

According to Bloomberg calculations published on Saturday the banks’ losses would collectively amount “to $500m or more if the debt were to be sold now”.

Higher interest rates tied to efforts to bring down record inflation have led to a deterioration in the credit markets with returns on risky junk bonds and leveraged loans surging. When the Musk-Twitter deal was financed in April banks agreed to terms with lower yields than the market would now accept leading to potential write-downs.

About $400m of the $500m in losses that the banks are estimated to have on the Twitter debt are in unsecured high interest bonds and they exclude fees the banks would typically earn on the transaction.

“I think that those banks would like to get out of it I think the deal makes less sense for them now and that the debt will be harder to syndicate to investors” Howard Fischer a Moses Singler law firm partner told the outlet.

In a surprise turnaround last week Musk abandoned his three-month effort to terminate the Twitter deal through a US court in Delaware citing the large number of fake accounts on Twitter. By some estimates 20% of Twitter users are fake.

The billionaire boss of Tesla and SpaceX also cancelled negotiations to shave $10bn off the agreed $44bn price tag (Twitter shares have traded as much as $20 below the $54 a share agreed in April) and said he would accept the original terms of the deal.

Musk told the Financial Times on Saturday that his interest in the company has never been primarily financial.

“I’m not doing Twitter for the money. It’s not like I’m trying to buy some yacht and I can’t afford it. I don’t own any boats. But I think it’s important that people have a maximally trusted and inclusive means of exchanging ideas and that it should be as trusted and transparent as possible.”

Twitter however did not immediately drop the lawsuit it is pursuing in order to force Musk into compliance.

“There is no need for an expedited trial to order defendants to do what they are already doing” Musk’s attorneys wrote in a filing. “Yet Twitter will not take yes for an answer. Astonishingly they have insisted on proceeding with this litigation recklessly putting the deal at risk and gambling with their stockholders interests.”

Twitter said the attempt to halt the litigation was “an invitation to further mischief and delay”.

On Thursday the judge presiding over the case Kathaleen McCormick granted Musk’s request to delay a trial scheduled for 17 October. Musk’s attorney said they could get the deal could done by 28 October “pending receipt of the proceeds of the debt financing”.

But some warn that there are few ways for the banks to get out of providing financing for both legal and reputational reasons even if that means booking substantial losses. “Generally it would be hard to have deals go forward if they were contingent on bank financing and that bank financing was not rock solid” Fischer told the outlet.

But if the deal does not close later this month McCormick has said that she would schedule a trial for November.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL21vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV5LWxlZC1iYW5rcy1mYWNlLTUwMC1taWxsaW9uLWxvc3Mtb24tdHdpdHRlci1kZWJ0LXRvLW11c2stMTIyMTAwODAwMTAyXzEuaHRtbNIBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9tb3JnYW4tc3RhbmxleS1sZWQtYmFua3MtZmFjZS01MDAtbWlsbGlvbi1sb3NzLW9uLXR3aXR0ZXItZGVidC10by1tdXNrLTEyMjEwMDgwMDEwMl8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley-led banks face $500 million loss on Twitter debt to Musk,"When banks led by Morgan Stanley agreed in April to help finance Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter Inc. they were eager to aid an important client the richest person in the world.

That growth trajectory will continue this year too Mandell Crawley  global head of HR Morgan Stanley told ET.India is now the second largest location globally for the company after New York and it's a matter of months before two of the largest locations for Morgan Stanley will be in India - in Mumbai and Bengaluru - Crawley told ET on his first visit to the country. The majority of the additions will be at the firm's global capability centres in the country.""We have been compounding at 20% a year for the past couple of years. I anticipate that trend will continue...I don't see a real need for us to change course"" said Crawley who has been with the firm for nearly three decades.The news of job additions comes at a time when global macroeconomic uncertainties have prompted several companies across sectors to adopt a cautious approach in expanding staff rolls.The global firm's focus in India is around technology talent with 30% of the company's entire tech footprint being in India. That apart the company also has multiple business units based out of India like operations finance legal and compliance HR operations internal audit and firm risk management.Besides these Morgan Stanley also hires here for client businesses - investment banking and investment management.Morgan Stanley has global centers in 10 locations across the world with 22000 - 23000 employees and India is about 50% of that.""India is now larger than all of EMEA with 13% of the firm's employees based between the two locations in India - Mumbai and Bengaluru"" he said.

While we hire students from multiple domains STEM talent takes precedence in terms of volume and we believe the India talent landscape will continue to grow"" said Crawley.On the impact of the global macroeconomic uncertainty on talent acquisition plans of global companies in India Crawley said: ""I am not sure the slowdown of growth is going to translate into a substantial spike in unemployment and even if that is true in markets like the US and Europe  I think India is a little bit different.

Global financial services giant Morgan Stanley which already has over 10000 employees in India plans to increase its headcount in the country. This year the company wants to increase hiring across its global capacity centres in Mumbai and Bengaluru. It increased its workforce in India by 20% in the last two years and plans to recruit more people Mandell Crawley global head of HR Morgan Stanley told Economic Times. Most of the new hiring will be done across the firm’s global capacity centres in India.

Crawley said India is now the second-largest location after New York for the financial services giant and Mumbai and Bengaluru will soon emerge as the largest globally.

The New York-headquartered multinational’s plan to increase India headcount comes at a time when most large corporations are either sceptical of new hiring or mulling cutbacks due to a choppy macroeconomic environment.

Tech talent is the at core of Morgan Stanley’s hiring plans in India; as much as 30% of all tech positions at the company are currently based in India. Other major business units based in India are operations finance legal and compliance HR operations internal audit and firm risk management. The company also has robust client business investment banking and investment management teams in India the report added.

Crawley reportedly said Morgan Stanley has 22000-23000 employees in global centres across the world; out of this workforce 50% is in India. India is larger than all of EMEA with 13% of the company’s employees based in Mumbai and Bengaluru and 80% of these employees are millennials he added.

Over the last two years Morgan Stanley has doubled its intake of talent from India’s premier institutions such as IITs IIMs and NITs. While the company hires from multiple domains a bulk of new joinees are from STEM fields Crawley added.

Morgan Stanley’s top HR executive doesn’t see a major spike in unemployment due to a slowdown in global growth; however even it were to be true he added the magnitude would be far less in India as compared to other markets such as Europe and US as “India is a little bit different”."

Giant mosaics made using images of people who have experiences with cancer enjoying important milestones which could have been missed are to be showcased at an exhibit across October.

Around 750 people who have had experiences with cancer submitted images of themselves attending memorable events from weddings to graduations to charity Worldwide Cancer Research which used them to create a mosaic of a pioneering scientist.

Dr Christine Dufes has been studying how prostate cancer responds to treatment and the 2m-by-2m image of her pays homage to the ability for research to prolong the life of cancer patients and allow them to be with their loved ones for longer.

One of the people featured in the mosaic was Nick Summerfield who can be seen with his cocker spaniel Twiggy.

Cancer-free now he was diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer at the age of 33 and hopes his image will highlight that cancer can affect anyone.

Iyna Butt was also featured alongside her son enjoying a holiday in Paris.

As she underwent a series of “successful” treatments including chemotherapy and radiotherapy she was able to spend quality time with her son “soaking up the sights”.

The second mosaic of Adam Coulson – who has helped the organisation with fundraising following the loss of both his parents – has been composed of individual photographs from the charity’s Curestarter community – supporters fundraisers and scientists who have dedicated themselves to finding treatments and cures.

The charity’s CEO Dr Helen Rippon said the Curestarters have allowed Worldwide Cancer Research to be “one step closer to the next breakthrough which will ultimately save more lives.

“Every photo of a moment made possible by pioneering cancer research represents a life milestone which would otherwise have been missed and another day enjoyed with friends family or loved ones.

“Our Curestarters continue to be inspired by these achievements as well as those who are unfortunately no longer with us collectively working tirelessly towards our ambition of eradicating cancer once and for all.”

The charity currently funds nearly 80 research projects in 17 different countries.

The mosaics will be displayed as part of an exhibition in London’s Spitalfields Market between Monday October 10 and Monday October 24.

More information about the mosaics and becoming a Curestarter can be found at https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbXltb2Rlcm5tZXQuY29tL3J1ZG9sZi1udXJleWV2LXRvbWItc2FpbnRlLWdlbmV2aWV2ZS1kZXMtYm9pcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stunning Carpet-Drapped Tomb of Ballet Dancer Rudolf Nureyev,"As an avid collector of antiques and textiles it only makes sense that renowned ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev‘s tomb reflects his taste. Located in the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois cemetery in the suburbs of Paris Nureyev's tomb is draped with a realistic mosaic of an oriental kilim rug. Created by set designer Ezio Frigerio who often collaborated with Nureyev the tomb is a beautiful visual expression of the dancer's remarkable life.

Nureyev was born into a Tartar Muslim family in 1938 near Siberia. He fell in love with ballet at age six when his mother took him and his three older sisters to a performance of Song of the Crane. His love of dance was solidified in school where he performed folk dances. Teachers quickly noticed his abilities and encouraged him to train in a larger city. Though his father who belonged to the military forbade him from dancing his mother encouraged him to pursue his dreams.

While World War II disrupted his plans Nureyev went on to study at the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet of Leningrad. In the late 1950s Nureyev earned a reputation as one of the Soviet Union's top male ballet dancers. He quickly became known not only for his skill but his modern interpretations of classical ballets. This willingness to break boundaries made him popular but his non-conformist attitude also concerned the government.

In 1961 Nureyev was allowed to travel to Paris with his company the Kirov Ballet for their first international tour. Though government officials were nervous about allowing him to leave the country French tour organizers put pressure on them to bring their top dancer on the trip. Though he was closely monitored by the KGB Nureyev did defect during the Paris trip. In fact he was the first artist to defect during the Cold War causing a sensation. Eventually in 1982 he was granted Austrian citizenship putting to end two decades of statelessness.

By leaving the Soviet Union behind Nureyev was allowed the creative freedom to grow. He became the principal dancer at The Royal Ballet and worked extensively with the American Ballet and National Ballet of Canada. For most of the 1980s he was the director of the Paris Opera Ballet. He continued his work there until 1989 even as he became increasingly ill.

In 1984 Nureyev tested HIV positive. At the time medical treatment was limited and eventually he developed AIDS. Though he continued to work his diminished health would take a toll. In 1993 after several stays in the hospital he passed away from AIDS complications.

His tomb then became a visual representation of the opulence that the dancer surrounded himself with. Revealed in 1996 the memorial has become one of the most visited sites in the cemetery.

A beautiful tomb in a cemetery outside Paris has a realistic mosaic of a rug draped over it.

The memorial commemorates renowned ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev.

Nureyev was an avid collector of antiques and textiles making the grave a perfect way to honor his life.

Silhouette Stages’ production has a talented cast of both high school students and adults who know how to light up the stage.



It’s just an ordinary day for Percy Jackson (Reid Murphy) until his substitute teacher calls him over and transforms into a Fury. After Percy vaporizes the Fury with a pen that turns into a sword he’s expelled from school for failing to stay with the group. This is Percy’s first hint that things are not what they seem.

…a talented cast of both high school students and adults who know how to light up the stage.





Percy’s mother (Cheryl J. Campo) assures Percy that the things that make him different are the very things that make him strong. They run into Percy’s bestie Grover (Nick Thompson) when they’re on the beach talking about Percy’s absent father. The trio are attacked by a minotaur and Percy’s mom Sally sacrifices her life for Grover’s and Percy’s. Percy is knocked unconscious waking up in a place called Camp Half-Blood.



So what’s Camp Half-Blood? It’s a camp for demigods the kids of humans and Greek Gods. Dionysus (Ethan Kinstler) the God of wine and madness checks Percy into camp and looks truly miserable as he tells him ‘it’s just another terrible day.’ Kinstler plays his part well looking crazy and angry—someone who should definitely not be working at a summer camp. Luke (Otega Okurume) is Hermes’ son. Clarisse (Julia L. Williams) is the daughter of Ares the God of War. And Annabeth (Leah Freeman) is the daughter of Athena.



Williams as Clarisse shows that Capture the Flag isn’t your usual schoolyard game as she twirls swords like batons and attacks Percy when he’s on the toilet (thanks to fight choreographer Russell Rinker the show has some amazing fight scenes). Properties Designer Jessie Krupkin uses toilet paper to signify that Percy employs water to douse his enemies which brings some fun to the show.



Once Percy discovers he’s the son of Poseidon he’s told he has to go on a hero’s quest—and his pals Grover and Annabeth decide to join him. But will they be able to stop a war between the big three Gods?



With this fantastical world of monsters and demigods this is not an easy show to put together visually. Costume Designer Deana Cruz-Conner does a great job of creating the minotaurs the Furies the three headed beasts and yes even the talking squirrel. Apart from all the monsters there’s Mr. Brunner (Christopher Kabara) who’s a centaur and Grover who’s a satyr and both are believable in their roles. There are also plenty of other surprises from Cruz-Conner. The ferrywoman of the underworld is a diva in a glitzy costume and Hades the king of the underworld has a unique style all his own.



‘”The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical” is also surprisingly funny. When the trio encounter Medusa they box up her head and send it via the Hermes Messenger Service. When the Oracle tells Percy to go west he figures the underworld must be in Los Angeles. And when the trio (Percy Annabeth and Grover) get to the underworld at DOA Records they encounter Mozart James Brown and the Vienna Boys Choir.



“The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical” takes us to a magical place full of gods and monsters. And it teaches us a lesson too. Percy might have ADHD and dyslexia but he can still be a demigod who completes an important quest. The dyslexia shows Percy’s mind was hard-wired for ancient Greek and the ADHD that he would be ready for the battlefield. These are shown as strengths not obstacles. So bring on the monsters and bring on the real world.

Running time: Approximately two hours with one 15-minute intermission.



“The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical” runs through October 23 2022 at Silhouette Stages Slayton House Theater Wilde Lake Village Center 10400 Cross Fox Ln Columbia MD 21044. For tickets and more information click here. Masks and proof of vaccination are required.

Duncan Gates CEO and cofounder of cloud kitchen operator Three Guys and a Grill recalls that he and his employees used to rely on spreadsheet software as well as a pen and paper to manage data from their inventory and purchasing.

While his Parañaque-based delivery-only food business had been able to get by with these tools he eventually realized how “primitive and needlessly complicated” they were. This was after his beverage partner Bayani Brew introduced him to cloud-based Mosaic Solutions in 2020.

“It was like night and day” Gates says in an email interview comparing their old and new systems. “We moved from the relative ‘Dark Ages’ to the 21st century with a cloud-based and continually improving highly supported system in Mosaic.”

Even with just a smartphone or tablet restaurateurs like Gates can access Mosaic Solutions’ suite of products to help operate critical aspects of their businesses.

Mosaic Solutions offers software for inventory management purchasing and point of sale (POS) as well as data analytics in order to help owners forecast and plan for growth. Clients pay a monthly subscription fee depending on the functionality they require and the number of store locations. Because of its accessibility Mosaic Solutions can also cater to smaller food and beverage (F&B) retailers such as quick-service restaurants kiosks coffee carts stalls and food trucks.

“Think of us as the restaurant’s central nervous system” explains Brett Doyle CEO and founder of Mosaic Solution. “We have the front of the house which is the point of sale (POS) and any way you get orders. Then at the back of the house we marry that sales data with inventory management and purchasing. So we can tell you ‘hey you’re running low on ground beef and you need to reorder.’ We automate that part of the process.”

For his part Gates says after upgrading his business’ purchasing and inventory management with Mosaic Solutions cost of goods went down by 5 percent. The new system has also given his managers up-to-the-minute visibility on the volume revenue and margin performance of all their products saving employees a great deal of time by moving from manual to digital input.

Custom-fit

Compared with other systems the 49-year-old cloud kitchen owner testifies that Mosaic Solutions is better for his business because it is specifically tailored for the F&B industry. “This means that they understand the nuance and specific challenges F&B operators can face here while generalist retail systems can fall over with restaurant operations” Gates says.

Mosaic Solutions was founded in 2016 when Doyle along with his wife and then 15-month-old twins moved to the Philippines to start a business. Doyle was drawn to this country because it seemed like a good place to raise a family. He also saw the opportunity to serve the F&B space which was estimated to account for more than 30 percent of consumer spending in the country.

Coupled with improvements in technology infrastructure that can now support cloud technology Doyle says this opened up a local market for their services. The 48-year-old entrepreneur states that Mosaic Solutions is the first mover in the Philippines when it comes to providing a full suite of products connecting front and back-end operations of restaurants.

“Interestingly a lot of the pain points [in the F&B industry] are the same regardless of geography. You’re trying to get data in a way that’s easy to use. And a lot of it are very siloed so you have one place to look for sales data one place to look for cost data. A real chore! What you see in the US is this more holistic technology” Doyle says. He thus thought of bringing such all-in-one solution to the local F&B space.

Back in the United States Doyle was a Business Administration graduate with a master’s degree in general management. When he was still starting his career he worked for various startups. He also has had experience working in different industries such as media and technology and has worked for restaurant groups as well.

While Doyle faced challenges when he first started Mosaic Solutions such as having to use his own money to fund the company his experience as an investor in technology gave the business a much-needed head start. When it was launched the company initially offered a stock-taking app to make stock-taking more efficient. The product was licensed from a company based in Toronto Canada whose board of investors Doyle was a part of.

But after conducting a research to develop their own product suite they found out that one of the biggest pain points of the local F&B industry was purchasing. In 2017 they thus rolled out their purchasing system soon followed by their POS system in 2018 and analytics platform in 2019. Eventually they were able to establish their own system for inventory management completing the suite of products they offer today.

Recapitalized

Last July Mosaic Solutions raised $5 million in “series A” funding referring to the financing round after a startup has shown progress in building its business model and has demonstrated potential to grow and generate revenue. This round was led by Kickstart Ventures with the participation of Gentree Fund and Investible. Doyle says the new money will primarily be plowed into their engineering and product development teams in order to improve their systems. Currently Mosaic Solutions serves around 70 clients covering 1200 F&B locations all over the Philippines. While they can’t disclose their future plans just yet Doyle plans to expand outside Metro Manila and eventually reach the rest of Southeast Asia.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic Doyle says more and more restaurateurs have started to see the need to adopt technology to make their business more efficient. “I think that people in our sector have come to need technology in their business and they like the fact that they can run their business remotely” he says.

Overcoming hurdles

He acknowledges that COVID-19 had a “very human impact on everyone.” He and his company had even decided to help out their customers by offering free services from March to July 2020.

But while the pandemic had been challenging at first restaurateurs have to continue running their business. As the F&B industry starts to move back to prepandemic sales notwithstanding the rising costs of goods Doyle says restaurants need to be more efficient and sustainable using technology.

“I always tell people restaurant business is a combination of art and science. As a chef you want to create but you have to have part of that science because you need to make money as well” says Doyle. “So what we do is try to make that science part as easy as possible. Our goal is to give you that data at the right time. So you can make better decisions and have an overall better experience.”"

The debate surrounding the transparency and social agendas of sustainable investing,"ESG – environmental social and governance – is one of the hottest trends in the investing world but some investors are calling it a gimmick.

ESG is a new industry of funds launched by companies like BlackRock  Vanguard and Fidelity that are invested in companies that meet certain criteria. These ideals pertain to standards of diversity equity and inclusion pollution and carbon emissions and data security among others.

But attacks on ESGs have come from all over. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander recently sent a letter to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink demanding the company bolster its climate disclosures and publish a plan to establish a commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its portfolio.

Republican politicians on the other hand have accused BlackRock of boycotting energy stocks. On Wednesday Louisiana announced it would pull $794 million out of BlackRock's funds citing the firm's embrace of ESG investment strategies.

BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A recent New York Times op-ed by New York University Stern School of Business professor Hans Taparia said that while ESG investment can create incentives for companies to be more socially and environmentally cautious many investors falsely believe their portfolios are benefiting the world when ESG investing is designed mainly to maximize shareholder returns.

Nearly 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 are in an ESG fund that uses MSCI ratings.

The op-ed further argued that Wall Street needs more stringent rating systems especially when companies that have received high ESG scores have been criticized for contributing to environmental or social issues.

Arne Noack head of systematic investment solutions for the Americas at DWS told Bob Pisani on CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" that ESG investing is ""most definitely not a sham."" He believes that the idea behind the strategy is that companies generate profits in healthy and sustainable ways.

""What ESG investing is is very simply put an incorporation of publicly available data into investment processes"" Noack said. ""None of this is done opaquely. All of this is done very transparently.""

Small but controversial

Some investors like Noack have pointed out that debates surrounding ESG investing may be getting more attention than they deserve. ESG funds make up just 6% of exchange-traded funds by number and 1.5% by ETF assets. However grouping all ESG funds into one classification is too wide-ranging Todd Rosenbluth head of research at VettaFi said in the same segment.

Among large-cap ESG ETFs are the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU)  which tracks an index of companies with positive ESG characteristics. The SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF (EFIV) tracks an index designed to select S&P 500 companies meeting ESG criteria while the Xtrackers MSCI USA ESG Leaders Equity ETF (USSG) corresponds to the performance of its underlying index. And the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) invests 90% of its total assets in an index of solar energy companies.

Noack said there is still plenty of room to improve upon ESG scores. The Xtrackers S&P 500 ESG ETF (SNPE)  for instance doesn't target the 25% worst S&P 500 companies from an ESG perspective of each industry group. This excludes companies that manufacture or invest in tobacco and controversial weapons.

But some investors believe these ESG funds are pushing a social agenda. Vivek Ramaswamy executive chairman of Strive Asset Management said in the same segment that his firm has pushed back against ""woke capitalism"" in part through two ETFs: the Strive U.S. Energy ETF (DRLL) and the Strive 500 ETF (STRV) . He told Pisani that companies need more diverse perspectives and should leave politics to politicians.

Ramaswamy has focused on bringing attention to ""green smuggling"" the broader range of ETFs that are not marketed as ESG but use linked voting guidelines and shareholder engagement principles to engage with companies and vote their shares.

""If you're an owner of capital and you want with your money to tell companies to pursue environmental agendas or social agendas it is a free country and you are certainly free to invest your money accordingly"" Ramaswamy said.

""But the problem that I see is a different one"" he continued. ""Where large asset managers including the Big Three are using the money of everyday citizens to vote their shares and advocate for policies in corporate America's boardrooms that most of those owners of capital did not want to advance with their money.

ESG 'sleight of hand'

Leading figures in the stakeholder capitalism movement have argued that because society gives benefits to corporations and shareholders like limited liability corporations are obligated to take social interests into account. But recently asset managers have started saying that many corporations are instead trying to maximize long-run value.

Rosenbluth asserted that there are no purely sustainable firms so ""the fact that we have an anti-ESG couple of firms out there is ironic because there is no ESG-only firm of any size and scale.""

Ramaswamy said this claim was inaccurate since firms are using ESG principles to vote all of their shares even though just 2% of assets under management for firms like BlackRock are ESG funds.

""The heart of the problem in my opinion is that it's not just the 2% but the 100% that lives by this firm-wide commitment that some clients demanded but other clients didn't necessarily want"" Ramaswamy said.

He cited examples of Chevron 's Scope 3 emissions reduction proposal and the racial equity audit at Apple  both of which carried majority shareholder support that used capital of all funds they manage.

""I have a problem with using the money of somebody else who invested in funds with the expectation that the person who's voting those shares is only going to take pecuniary interest into account actually taking these other social factors into account instead"" Ramaswamy said. ""That's the sleight of hand.""

Sustainable environmental and social practices are being integrated across the bank’s business and operating model.

QNB is recognised as a regional leader in ESG and in 2021 was the first bank in the region to receive an AA rating for ESG from MSCI.

During 2022 the bank has recently won several sustainability related awards from Global Finance including awards for “Outstanding Leadership in Sustainable Finance” in the region and “Sustainable Finance leadership” in Qatar amongst others.

QNB was the first financial intuition in Qatar to develop a Green Social and Sustainability Bond (GSSB) framework aligned with international best practice and standards.

In 2020 the bank issued the first conventional green bond in Qatar and at $600mn it remains the largest conventional green bond from a bank in the region. The bank also issued the first green placement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in Turkey participated in the first green repurchase agreement in Qatar and pioneered green vehicle and green mortgage loans for its retail customers.

The bank’s sustainability framework and approach supports and aligns with the leading international and domestic Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) United Nations Global Compact (UNGC of which the bank is a signatory) Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030 and Qatar National Environment and Climate Change Strategy (QNE) amongst others.

The sustainability framework consists of three pillars: sustainable finance and sustainable operations and beyond banking. All three pillars support QNB’s goal of sustainable financial performance by reducing risks opening up new business opportunities and strengthening our brand.

In its own operations the bank has launched several green initiatives across its footprint to raise awareness among its employees and customers of environmental and climate challenges and to promote sustainable actions to reduce their impact.

In Qatar the bank has put in place measures to enhance energy consumption efficiency in all its offices and branches. This includes reducing cooling consumption and installing latest state-of-the-art new automated lighting control system across all its properties branches and facilities.

(NASDAQ:HOLO) A High Quality Stock To Own?,"One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of MicroCloud Hologram Inc. (NASDAQ:HOLO).

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

Check out our latest analysis for MicroCloud Hologram

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for return on equity is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for MicroCloud Hologram is:

72% = CN¥81m ÷ CN¥112m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).

The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity the company generated $0.72 in profit.

Does MicroCloud Hologram Have A Good Return On Equity?

Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly MicroCloud Hologram has a superior ROE than the average (14%) in the Electronic industry.

roe

That's clearly a positive. However bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for MicroCloud Hologram visit our risks dashboard for free.

Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE

Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings issuing new shares (equity) or debt. In the case of the first and second options the ROE will reflect this use of cash for growth. In the latter case the debt used for growth will improve returns but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather metaphorically speaking.

Combining MicroCloud Hologram's Debt And Its 72% Return On Equity

Shareholders will be pleased to learn that MicroCloud Hologram has not one iota of net debt! Its high ROE already points to a high quality business but the lack of debt is a cherry on top. After all when a company has a strong balance sheet it can often find ways to invest in growth even if it takes some time.

Summary

Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity and one has a higher ROE I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.

Having said that while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Here is what Kerrisdale Capital had to say about Paycom Software Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) in its July 2022 investor letter:

“We are short shares of Paycom Software Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) a $19 billion SaaS-based payroll services company that has been one of the best performing large capitalization software stocks since it went public in 2014. Even after the market turmoil of this year Paycom trades at more than 70x the consensus estimate for this year’s free cash flow a testament to the fact that while unprofitable tech companies and temporary pandemic winners have been justly punished in the markets there’s still plenty of froth left in allegedly higher quality fare. Paycom’s valuation in particular doesn’t come close to reflecting the near term headwinds of slowing employment growth meaningful TAM saturation and increasing competitive intensity. Paycom’s steady and robust growth over the past decade has come by way of taking market share from payroll industry behemoths ADP and Paychex. Paycom has been accompanied in this quest by high-tech peers Paylocity (PCTY) and closely held BambooHR and has been buttressed by secular job growth trends in the US small and medium business sector. But Paycom is no longer a $100 million annual revenue upstart and neither are its peers. At $1.4 billion of run-rate recurring revenue the company is a scaled business and combined with Paylocity Bamboo and other dynamic tech companies in the sector the group’s share of the SME payroll market is north of 40%. That’s a lot more than the blue-sky implications of Paycom’s 5% market share claim and it means that further market share gains will be a lot more difficult going forward. At the same time ADP is fighting back increasing its customer retention rate and growing its employee rolls. Rippling and Gusto two rapidly growing startups in the space have also recently raised capital at $10-billion-plus valuations and are actively fighting for market share. All this means that the competition faced by Paycom is about to get a lot tougher. If that weren’t enough US employment growth looks to be decelerating at a fairly significant clip which means that all the payroll players will be fighting in a smaller field. For a SaaS company with an astronomical valuation like Paycom’s price cutting is probably not something investors are accustomed to thinking about but they might soon have to…” (Click here to read the full text)

“Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a leading provider of innovative customizable team-collaboration software tools for over 200000 customers. Despite positive fundamental momentum—the company recently reported 30% revenue growth and 28% trailing twelve months FCF margins—shares traded lower during Q2 as investors rotated out of high-growth stocks with elevated multiples. The company’s highly efficient sales and marketing capability combined with substantial R&D investment points to sustained long-term revenue and FCF growth. Meanwhile we recognize a recession would likely have an impact on Atlassian via slowing growth metrics. However we believe its low priced mission critical cloud tools would prove relatively resilient in this scenario. For these reasons and shares trading at a very attractive valuation for a business with highly recurring revenues strong revenue growth prospects and attractive margins we added to our position.”

The stock is one of the best Motley Fool stocks to buy now.

Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Axon Enterprise Inc. (NYSE:AXON) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“Axon Enterprise Inc. (NYSE:AXON) is a public safety-oriented company that sells its products to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Its mission is to “…make the bullet obsolete” using non-lethal TASER® devices combined with digital cameras cloud-based software and virtual reality training. This array of technology aims to provide better relationships between law enforcement and its constituent communities and to reduce fatal outcomes dramatically when stressful confrontations occur. Axon takes its mission seriously and has an extensive ethics committee that includes members of law enforcement and activist communities. Axon claims that with usage of body cameras complaints against police departments are down 88% and use of force is down 58%. We believe the company is a premier part of the solution to prevent bad actors in law enforcement and the mistrust that has resulted from those bad actors. The company has three major product lines: first high-definition cameras (sensor division) worn on the body or mounted on vehicles (newer products incorporate live streaming and automated license plate readers); second subscription-based digital evidence software (evidence.com) that stores body camera and third-party video allowing for evidentiary chain of custody search and report writing (officer court time reduced by 70%); and third non-lethal TASER devices (that can temporarily incapacitate dangerous and violent actors using an electrical shock) that save lives by avoiding discharging firearms (the company claims 258000 lives have been saved so far). When used in combination its cameras provide GPS officer location and live streaming while its software can provide real-time operations mapping of active situations. In the future Axon seeks to add consumer safety products (launching in 2022) that will automatically notify 911 if deployed drone-based camera products more VR training and additional cloud-based software including evidence software usable by prosecutors and defense attorneys which could be a $1 billion market on its own. From a financial perspective the company is really built upon recurring revenue – it is not a one-time device sales company. Software made up 28.5% of 2021 revenues. And while hardware made up 43% of 2021 sales about two-thirds of that is now bundled under long-term deals so really only about 15% of the company’s total revenue is one time in nature. The remaining 27% of sales is warranty and cartridge consumables which are largely recurring as well. As software grows as a proportion of revenue (to what we believe will be over 40% by 2026) margins should expand. We believe that EBITDA margins can expand from 20% in 2021 to nearly 30% by 2026. Revenue growth which was nearly 27% in 2021 should continue at over 20% given that the company is less than 2% penetrated into its $52 billion addressable market. Finally the company has over $400 million of cash and no debt on its balance sheet. When combined with its significant free cash flow (about 75% of EBITDA converts to free cash flow) Axon has significant capital to grow its business complete accretive acquisitions and potentially return capital to shareholders.”

If you want to see some more of the most valuable internet companies today versus 2000 go directly to 5 Most Valuable Internet Companies in 2000 vs. Today.

The 10 most valuable internet companies have changed a lot since 22 years ago.

Back in 2000 the internet was much smaller than what it is today. Globally there were only around 413 million internet users.

It was also much slower with many people using dialup.

In 2000 most people also accessed the internet through either a PC or laptop. Popular apps like Facebook did not exist. The iPhone was not invented either. Cloud computing was mainly just a theory rather than reality.

80% of people used Internet Explorer and Google Chrome did not exist.

The 5 most popular sites back in 2000 included Yahoo.com AOL.com Geocities.com MSN.com and Lycos.com.

Today the internet is much larger with several billion more users.

The internet is also much faster for many given 5G.

Due to mobile phones internet companies also do a lot more than just internet now. With the internet people can work at home. They can do shopping or they can watch TV or even movies.

In terms of the 5 most popular sites Yahoo.com and MSN.com still have a lot of users and the other sites have not done very well.

The demographics of the people who use the internet have also changed. While many people in China weren't online in 2000 hundreds of millions of Chinese are online today. As a result of the demographic change some of the world's most valuable internet companies are Chinese while none were Chinese in 2000.

As a result of the huge growth of the internet as well as inflation the 10 most valuable internet companies today are collectively worth a lot more than what they were collectively worth in 2000.

The 10th most valuable company today is worth over $80 billion for example versus around $2.1 billion in 2000. Meanwhile the most valuable company today is worth almost $1.3 trillion versus $94.2 billion in 2000.

The composition of the most valuable companies in 2000 versus today has also changed substantially. Aside from Amazon every other company in the top 10 in 2000 isn't in the top 10 today. Some of the top internet companies back in 2000 did not do very well in terms of their stock performance also.

The change illustrates how quickly the internet has evolved over time and how successful Amazon has really been in terms of growing its businesses.

In terms of the future it is very likely that the internet will continue to evolve with potentially several new top ten companies. Companies in India which has a population that will be bigger than China soon could also potentially make it into the top ten sometime in the future.

The internet could also be more about virtual reality or augmented reality in the future. As a result some companies that offer entirely new services that don't even exist today could also be in the top 10.

If existing internet companies are well run their values could continue to increase. Companies like Amazon.com that were in the top 10 in 2000 and 2022 could still potentially be in the top 10 in 2042 if it continues to grow quickly and innovate.

Netflix's dramatization of the crimes of convicted serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer has in some ways been a huge success for the platform.

Since its release on September 21 it has been watched for nearly 300 million hours by subscribers and became the second-most viewed show on Netflix within a week of its release behind the fourth series of ""Stranger Things"" according to Deadline.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

But ""Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" has also caused controversy.

Dahmer murdered and dismembered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He was found guilty in 1992 and died in prison two years later.

Though the serial killer's life has been dramatized before most famously by Jeremy Renner in 2002 and Ross Lynch in 2017 Netflix's slick 10-episode drama produced by Ryan Murphy of ""Glee"" and ""American Horror Story"" fame has stoked huge backlash.

On social media the discourse surrounding the show has been fierce with many accusing it of being insensitive towards the families of Dahmer's victims and of romanticizing his crimes. It has also sparked debate among people using social platforms to react and respond to the show after watching.

Some users faced criticism for bragging about being 'unfazed' by the show

Unlike previous adaptations Netflix's ""Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" features several graphic scenes of murder sexual assault and cannibalism.

Viewers have called Netflix out for packaging real-life violence as entertainment particularly after Netflix tweeted ""Can't stop thinking about this disturbing scene from DAHMER where one of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims finally manages to escape... and the police actually bring him back inside the apartment. Now on Netflix""

Comments underneath the promotional tweet called it ""gross"" and suggested that the ""families of Dahmer's victims loathe this show for once again opening these old wounds and exploiting them for profit.""

Others questioned whether the victim's families consented to their stories being told in this format with one person writing that it was ""contemptible"" of Netflix to ""make money off of their pain.""

Rita Isbell the sister of Errol Lindsey who was one of Dahmer's victims told Insider she was not consulted by Netflix in advance of the show which included a depiction of the victim impact statement she delivered during Dahmer's sentencing and accused Netflix of "" just making money off of this tragedy.""

Despite the gruesome nature of the Netflix show several TikTok users have made videos stating that they were ""unfazed"" or ""unbothered"" by it and that they wished it had portrayed what they say were ""the actual morbid parts"" of Dahmer's murders suggesting the series did not delve deep enough into the brutality of the killings.

Many of these videos seen by Insider and screenshotted or screen recorded by other internet users and reposted to TikTok and Twitter have now been deleted.

It sparked debate on TikTok as other users responded saying that desensitization to violence against LGBTQ+ people and people of color who Dahmer targeted isn't something to be proud of.

One creator who goes by the name @nothaja and says she is from Milwaukee (where Dahmer committed many of his crimes) posted a video on October 1 in which she criticized people who were asking for ""more gore.""

She said ""You know as well as I know that these were real people with real lives. This 'gore' that you want is a gruesome depiction of the rape torture murder and the eating of children and men. You just want to consume their bodies even when they're long gone.""

People have been accused of minimizing Dahmer's crimes in response to the show

Netflix has released various shows movies and documentaries about convicted murderers including John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy. In the aftermath of each release viewers have accused the streaming service of glorifying violence.

One criticism is the choice of actors for these movies. When Zac Effron portrayed Ted Bundy in ""Extremely Wicked Shockingly Evil and Vile"" many called out the romanticization of the character who was considered to be extremely charming and attractive.

Similarly following the release of the Dahmer show TikTokers have edited clips together from the series to make it look like it's a romantic comedy with comments from users suggesting that Dahmer and his victim Anthony Hughes would have been a good couple. One such video which has since been deleted from TikTok was reposted to Twitter and viewed nearly 250000 times.

The tweet by user @liliandaisies said ""People are making romance tiktok edits about a serial killer and his victim. They didn't 'go from people you know to people you don't' this is about a murderer and a man he killed. My heart goes out to the families of jeffrey dahmer's victims.""

As VICE reported the show portrays Dahmer as a child with an absent father was tormented by bullies and is ""lonely"" and ""misunderstood"" leading to viewers creating videos on TikTok in which they sympathize with him.

Many TikTokers have also called people out for saying they ""feel sorry"" for Dahmer as he was ""failed by everyone who was supposed to help him"" according to one TikTok comment.

In response several tweets and TikTok videos have asked people not to ""romanticize"" Dahmer often sparking further debate in the comments.

TikTokers called out Netflix for its 'LGBTQ' labeling of the show

The controversy grew after some TikTok users noticed that one of the tags Netflix had initially used to label the series was ""LGBTQ.""

A video posted by TikToker user @lizthelezbo showed her filming the Netflix homepage and zooming in on the ""LGBTQ"" tag. She said ""Why the fuck did Netflix tag the Jeffrey Dahmer documentary LGBTQ? I know this is technically true but this is not the representation we're looking for.""

Her video received nearly 400000 views and led to other viewers on Twitter and TikTok calling Netflix out for the decision. Writer Frances Danger tweeted ""If I need to stay in my lane absolutely tell me but anyone else think it's pretty gross of @netflix to list Dahmer under #LGBTQ especially when the True Crime tag would have worked?""

Other tweets tagged Netflix and asked them to reconsider the tag especially as Dahmer perpetuated violence against LGBTQ+ people.

The tag which was seen by Insider on the day the series was released is no longer visible on the show.

Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

And it appears to have worked.

Named Mr. Harrigan’s Phone the spooky flick arrived on the streaming service earlier this week (Tuesday October 5) and it's already attracting plenty of subscriber interest as we head into the weekend — and we called it out as one of the 9 best new movies to watch this week.

After just a few days on the streaming service Mr. Harrigan's Phone has already rockted into the Netflix Top 10. The film just jumped to the No. 1 slot after sitting No. 2 position. It overtook Last Seen Alive a Gerard Butler-led action thriller that found a second-life via streaming.

With Halloween on the horizon we expect Mr. Harrigan's Phone to stick around in the top-performing charts. However it’s another Netflix film that has split opinions with viewers seemingly more impressed than critics.

What is Mr. Harrigan’s Phone about?

Mr. Harrigan’s Phone casts Jaeden Martell — no stranger to King adaptions he also starred in 2017’s It — as Craig a young boy living in a small town who befriends the reclusive billionaire Mr. Harrigan (Donald Sutherland).

The unlikely duo quickly strike up a close connection after bonding over their shared love of books and reading. Craig even gives Mr. Harrigan his first cell phone so the pair can stay in touch more easily. However when Mr. Harrigan sadly passes away Craig is shocked to discover he can still communicate with his friend via the phone that was buried with him.

Even more disturbing Craig’s real-world tormentors start to experience strange hauntings from a vengeful spirit that Craig suspects could be Mr. Harrigan. Part coming-of-age tale part horror flick Mr. Harrigan’s Phone is based on the popular short story from Stephen King’s If It Bleeds collection first released in 2020.

What do critics say about Mr. Harrigan’s Phone?

It’s fair to say that critics haven't been super impressed with Mr. Harrigan’s Phone. As of writing the movie has scored a fairly disappointing 39% on Rotten Tomatoes  but this number is slowly rising. In fact it's increased almost 10% in the last 24 hours and could increase further as more critics weigh in.

While the film's RT rating may be pretty underwhelming it is far from the lowest score a King adaptation has ever received. 2016’s Cell managed just 11% with 2017's heavily-criticized cinematic take on The Dark Tower not fairing much better scoring a woeful 16%.

Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com praised the performances of Sutherland and Martell but quipped that “you’re going to want to send this one to voicemail.” IndieWire ’s David Ehrlich was even more cutting declaring “such bottom-drawer source material proves to be an insurmountable disadvantage for John Lee Hancock’s Netflix adaptation of the same name a downcast and thoroughly dreadful supernatural drama.”

Benjamin Lee of the Guardian wasn’t particularly impressed either saying “It’s all rather unforgivably dull a call to be swiftly ignored."" And AV Club ’s Courtney Howard concluded their review by noting the film is “more akin to a stern lecture by a grownup than an eerie unsettling cautionary tale.”

Positives write-ups are currently in fairly short supply but Slashfilm did label the movie “an old-fashioned ghost story.” Furthermore this is already looking like another case of critics and viewers not seeing eye-to-eye as Mr. Harrigan’s Phone currently enjoys a much more positive 63% audience score.

Should you stream Mr. Harrigan’s Phone?

Many of the biggest new movies of Halloween 2022 are going theatrical only with the likes of Smile and Halloween Ends not currently available to stream (though we do know how to watch the Scream movies online). So if you’re looking to put together a horror marathon at home then it’s definitely worth considering giving Mr. Harrigan’s Phone a watch.

It’s probably unlikely to be the scariest horror film you’ve ever seen — it’s only rated PG-13 after all — but Sutherland and Martell appear to be on top form and the premise seems ripe for enjoyable spookiness. Critics aren’t particularly impressed but don’t write the movie off entirely as Netflix subscribers are clearly making a stronger connection with this one.

If you've just done a double take at the five stars sitting at the top of this review believe me when I say that nobody is more surprised than this reviewer to have arrived at that verdict. Sitting down to watch a six-part story about the creation of a music streaming service one without a larger-than-life Elon Musk-esque central character did not instinctively feel like event television. My instincts were wrong. The Playlist is 2022's best drama. The scripts are sharp pacy funny and cleverly structured to provide each key player in the story with a voice. The performances are great without straying into bluster or scenery chewing and there's a constant motion in the narrative that keeps you utterly captivated. Do not skip this one.

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

The Playlist: Key Information - Releases on Netflix on October 13 - Directed by Per-Olav Sørensen - Written by Silk's Christian Spurrier - Made by the same company as Young Wallander for Netflix - Six episodes - Swedish with subtitles and US dubbing available - Vikings' Edvin Endre and The Last Kingdom's Christian Hillborg take key roles

We're so used to seeing real-life sagas turned into prestige television now that whenever a political scandal shocking court case or the demise of a conglomerate plays out many of us are already casting the drama to come in our minds as the events unfold. The unspoken rule about waiting years for all sides of a story to be told no longer applies.

Elizabeth Holmes has yet to be sentenced for her crimes in the scandal about Theranos but she's already had her own miniseries with Hulu's The Dropout. Anna Delvey is still in prison for her widescale fraud but her infamy has already been put on screen with Inventing Anna. And Mark Zuckerberg is about to get his second prestige biopic as Showtime's Super Pumped focuses on Facebook having recently told Uber's origin story.

The fact that we're so used to seeing these stories also means our standards have gotten higher. For every brilliant retelling like David Fincher's masterful look at Zuckerberg in The Social Network you get Apple TV Plus' WeCrashed a glossy expensive but ultimately hollow drama that descended into caricature from its earliest scenes. Regardless of how irresistible the characters seem on paper however outlandish their exploits are and irrespective of the gigantic consequences of their actions you still need to get the basics right. The story needs to be concise intriguing and well-paced and you need impetus from the get-go.

All of which makes the achievements of the cast and creative team behind Netflix's new drama The Playlist about the creation of Spotify all the more remarkable because it's the best drama this writer has seen in 2022.

Hitting all the right notes

The Playlist is adapted from Spotify Untold a 2021 book by Swedish investigative journalists Sven Carlsson and Jonas Leijonhufvud or to give its full title The Spotify Play: How CEO and Founder Daniel Ek Beat Apple Google and Amazon in the Race for Audio Dominance. Set across six episodes the show chronicles the streaming service's journey from the mind of founder Daniel Ek to at the last count 433 million users including 188 million paying subscribers in 183 different countries with almost $10 billion in annual revenues.

In the 15 years since its launch the music service has become a byword for online streaming. Going to Spotify to listen to music is as common as opening Google to search for something online. Apple diehards may prefer Apple Music audiophiles may argue that Tidal has an elevated listening experience but in terms of numbers they're the scruffy record shop in a quiet back street and Spotify is the giant shopping mall where your parents grandparents and all their friends do all their shopping. It is a true behemoth. But how did it get there?

The Playlist which is keen to stress that it's a fictionalized account of what happened tracks Spotify's origins. At the start founder Daniel Ek is bored. The IT wunderkind who was earning $50000 per month by the time he was 18 such was his skill at building websites and had enough money to retire at 22 after selling Advertigo is spending his money and not doing much else.

In the background The Pirate Bay the Swedish site that allowed users to search download and upload whatever they wanted – meaning vast numbers of songs and movies were being shared – is being taken to court under pressure from senior figures in the Swedish music industry.

Ek sees an opportunity. Clean up the experience to make a fast easy-to-use and dynamic music player that doesn't need users to have files on their own devices. He presents the idea to entrepreneur Martin Lorentzon the man who bought his last business. Together they recruit a crack team of coders and designers and set about changing the world. Trouble is the music industry doesn't want to play ball and won't give them access to their songs which will render the service pretty much useless. We watch as the battle to win hearts and minds and open wallets commences.

A change in tempo

The instinct when writer Christian Spurrier whose credits include procedurals like Spooks and Silent Witness sat down to transform Carlsson and Leijonhufvud's book for the screen must have been to build everything around Ek. To dig into the character of the man who turned the music industry on its head to find his insecurities just as Aaron Sorkin did to Jesse Eisenberg's Zuckerberg when he left him alone in a meeting room sending a friend request to Rooney Mara's Erica Albright the ex-girlfriend whose dumping spurred him into action.

Wannabe tech billionaires are a gift to screenwriters. They're the rebel in a hoodie in a room full of suits yawning and throwing paper airplanes while the grown-ups talk about intellectual property a constant source of tantrums and outbursts of righteousness an endless source of conflict.

Ek who is now worth between two and three billion and made a bid to buy Arsenal Football Club last year does play that role to an extent. He's brash often unpleasant and very cutting with his staff members. His disdain for the larger music industry is played out in a number of explosive meetings but he's not the focus of everything.

Andreas Ehn tries to find the magic formula for Spotify (Image credit: Netflix)

That's the series' strength. We see the story of Spotify from six perspectives. We first follow Ek the surly tech genius with no people skills. We then see through the eyes of industry figures specifically Per Sundin the CEO of Sony Music and later Universal Music in Sweden and then episodes from Lorentzon key lawyer Petra Hansson coding whizzkid Andreas Ehn and singer Bobbi T.

Each episode ends with the passing of the baton to the next key player continuing the story's momentum. They all get the limelight they all get their lonely friend request and they all give their individual flavor to the show. It's a constant livener and a very clever trick from Spurrier who turns material so dry it'd spontaneously catch fire into a series of endless juicy morsels.

Get to the chorus

One of Spurrier and director Per-Olav Sørensen's key achievements with The Playlist is making sure the stakes remain high as the narrative unfolds. Time is ticking and money is running out and all the while the key players are wrestling with their demons. Ek is desperate for Spotify to rip control away from the music industry and democratize music itself. Hansson stakes her legal career on trying to get Spotify off the ground. And Lorentzon is just trying to get the biggest payday he can while keeping the rutting egos of young coders in check.

As a viewer it's hard to imagine why you'd care about Ehn's battle to stop the player buffering or Sundin's drive to stop Sony Music being run into the ground by illegal downloads but that's The Playlist's charm. It sweeps you along effortlessly.

Our verdict

In the build-up to The Social Network all the talk around the movie was that the only thing more boring than Facebook itself was the prospect of a movie about it. On the face of it The Playlist had the potential to be on a par with paint drying but its cast and creative team have crafted a tense clever and perfectly paced drama out of the driest subject matter.

Just as Spotify itself makes a great play in its marketing about discovering music you'd never have gone near in a record store The Playlist is the unfancied drama that deserves the widest possible audience. You'll be gripped from the opening scene and at the end of every episode you'll find yourself on Google looking up who these people are and where they are now. Then with that question answered you'll move onto the next episode and curse the fact that there are only six to enjoy.

The Playlist is released on Netflix on October 13."

Putin's move affecting Exxon's largest investment in Russia mimics a strategy he used to seize control of other energy properties in the country.

The decree gives the Russian government authority to decide whether foreign shareholders can retain stakes in the project.

Exxon holds a 30% operator stake in Sakhalin-1 with Russian company Rosneft India's ONGC Videsh and Japan's SODECO as partners.

Oil production at the Sakhalin-1 project fell to just 10000 barrels per day (bpd) in July from 220000 bpd before Russia invaded Ukraine.

Navigating an exit

Exxon has been trying to exit its Russia operations and transfer its role in Sakhalin-1 to a partner since March after international sanctions imposed on Moscow.

Russia's government and Exxon have clashed with the oil producer threatening to take the case to international arbitration.

Exxon declined to comment on Friday's decree.

Japan's SODECO was not immediately available to comment but an official of the industry ministry which owns a 50% stake in the firm said it was gathering information and talking with partners. Japan has stopped buying crude from Russia since June.

Exxon took an impairment charge of $4.6 billion in April for its Russian activities and said it was working with partners to transfer Sakhalin-1's operation. It also reduced energy production and moved staff out of the country.

In August Putin issued a decree that Exxon said made a secure and environmentally safe exit from Sakhalin-1 difficult. The U.S. producer then issued a ""note of difference"" a legal step prior to arbitration.

Friday's decree said the Russian government was establishing a Russian company managed by Rosneft subsidiary Sakhalinmorneftegaz-shelf that will own investors' rights in Sakhalin-1.

Foreign partners will have one month after the new company is created to ask the Russian government for shares in the new entity the decree said.

Putin used a similar strategy in a July decree to seize full control of Sakhalin-2 another gas and oil project in the Russian Far East with Shell and Japanese companies Mitsui & Co and Mitsubishi Corp as partners.

Russia has approved applications by the two Japanese trading houses seeking to transfer their stakes to a new operator.

The newly formed bookmaker will launch on Wednesday ahead of next weekend's coveted The Everest and Caulfield Cup race meetings.

Betr headed up by wagering mogul Matt Tripp and chief executive Andrew Menz is backed by an ownership group including News Corp Australia and Las Vegas-based Tekkorp Capital and is powered by Betmakers Technology Group.

In the countdown to Wednesday's highly anticipated launch Betr chief executive Andrew Menz said the start-up entered the always evolving market with ambitious objectives.

""We make no secret that our ambition is to grow market share rapidly in what's an extremely competitive market"" Menz said.

The Betr brand will launch next week.

""And we'll achieve that by putting the customer at the forefront of everything we do with the offering of compelling products and competitive odds.

""The brand we are building is one that stands for the punter. Racing is an industry but at heart it's a sport and we want to celebrate the broader racing community and the great stories it generates.""

To celebrate the launch of Betr Menz revealed the start-up would provide a special Melbourne Cup promotion for new customers.

Wagering pioneer Matt Tripp is behind the Betr brand.

""We will be offering $101 about every runner in the Cup right through until Victoria Derby day"" Menz said.

""It will be capped at $10 but what better way to announce your arrival into the market than by offering such a great market on our most famous race.

Betr CEO Andrew Menz. Picture: Jake Nowakowski

""And for the business it's really symbolic that we are launching the week of The Everest which has really resonated with the under-35 sports fan that enjoys a punt and a good time.

""To be in front of that younger more dynamic and forward thinking audience is really important to the brand we are building at Betr.""

The brand will disrupt the wagering market.

To be successful in the wagering ecosystem Menz reverts back to focussing on the levers of brand product and promotions which remain a constant in a rapidly changing market.

""Your product promotions and brand are critical"" Menz said.

""I'm hugely excited about our racing products and love the way we've been able to integrate content and tips and bring the punter along on the journey.

""Our sports offering is probably six months away from being where we want it but being in the heart of the racing season it has been our prime focus to get that right ahead of going to market."""

This story is a product of the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk an editorially independent reporting network based at the University of Missouri School of Journalism in partnership with Report For America and funded by the Walton Family Foundation. Wisconsin Watch is a member of the network. Sign up for our newsletter to get our news straight to your inbox.

Editor’s note: A previous version of this story included incorrect 2020 chemical discharge figures from NextEra Energy’s Point Beach Nuclear Plant after the company erred in its reporting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. NextEra submitted a correction to the EPA reporting that it discharged 326 pounds of hydrazine in 2020 rather than 15007 pounds a company spokesperson said. Wisconsin Watch has removed an information box that previously reported a calculation based upon the incorrect figure.

Nitrate compounds were the top toxic substances released into U.S. waterways in 2020 including the Mississippi River according to a recent study conducted by an environmental policy and advocacy group.

Industries — primarily petroleum refineries and meat and poultry processing facilities — discharged more than 175 million pounds of nitrates that year comprising 91% of all toxic chemicals released by weight in the U.S. according to the report’s analysis of federal data.

The findings pose particular relevance to the Mississippi River basin which drains a 31-state watershed and conveys nitrates and other chemicals to the Gulf of Mexico. Nitrates encourage algae blooms which contribute to the gulf’s hypoxic “dead zone” where oxygen-poor waters suffocate marine wildlife.

“We have huge flows of toxic pollution into our waterways across the country” said John Rumpler senior director of the Environment America Research and Policy Center’s clean water program who co-authored the report along with researchers from the Frontier Group and U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund.

Released in late September the report analyzed data collected in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxics Release Inventory. The agency requires certain industries to report toxic releases. That does not include runoff from farm fields and animal feeding operations which is most typically associated with nitrate pollution meaning that the report includes only a portion of toxic releases.

What is nitrate?

Nitrate is a naturally occurring nutrient found in food and human and animal waste. But exposure can pose health hazards to babies and pregnant women and nitrate is one of the most common groundwater contaminants in some states. Some studies suggest that it contaminates at least 10% of wells in Wisconsin for instance. People who consume water high in nitrate face increased risk of colon kidney and stomach cancers and thyroid disease. It also is associated with birth defects.

The Environment America report spotlights the vast flows of toxic compounds into the country’s waterways even under the 1972 Clean Water Act. The landmark legislation sought to make most waterways fishable and swimmable by 1983 while eliminating toxic discharges into navigable waters by 1985.

The Clean Water Act requires states territories and tribal governments to develop standards to protect water bodies within their borders based upon designated uses like recreating protecting wildlife or providing public drinking water. Waterways that fail to satisfy those standards become subject to a restoration plan which limits daily discharges of pollutants.

Polluters must comply with those limits until the water body can support its designated uses.

The law has increased the number of fishable waters across the U.S. but about half of U.S. water bodies remain impaired. Toxic substances continue to enter U.S. waterways in large volumes hindering restoration efforts the new report illustrates.

Regulated industries released about 94.5 million pounds of nitrates into the Mississippi River basin in 2020 accounting for nearly half of all reported toxic releases nationwide. More than 30 million pounds of that total originated in slaughterhouses and meat processing industries.

Nitrates and closely associated nitrites are utilized in meat curing an important process that increases the shelf life of meat products and reduces the transmission of foodborne pathogens.



“Things like hams and bacons those actually use a solution of nitrite” said University of Wisconsin-Madison animal science professor Jeffrey Sindelar. “And they would be injected or marinated…The excess and the stuff that isn’t used is typically run down into a drain and it’s diluted with all the other water and there are U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations to ensure that the levels of ingredients are not creating imbalance in the waste stream.”

Reporting loopholes

Some discharges of nitrates and other chemicals go unreported because of certain industry exemptions from EPA reporting requirements the September study notes. Likewise not all toxic substances must be reported and the EPA exempts reporting for facilities with fewer than 10 employees.

In addition to closing reporting loopholes the EPA could update permitting standards to reflect current pollution control technology Rumpler said to the benefit of public and environmental health.

“State and local and federal officials have the tools” he said. “Now it just takes the political will to implement those tools as the Clean Water Act intends.”

In an emailed statement an EPA spokesperson said that the agency is considering updates to pollution standards that would apply to meat and poultry processing plants power plants and industrial dischargers of PFAS chemicals.

The EPA is pursuing a rule to remove a reporting exemption for low concentrations of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS which have been linked to a range of health problems. President Donald Trump’s administration allowed PFAS releases to qualify for a “de minimis exemption” which excuses polluters from documenting discharges of toxic chemicals comprising less than 1% of a mixture — or .1% for carcinogens. The EPA is moving to rescind that loophole eligibility the spokesperson said.

Karly Pavlinac Blackburn had been laid off from her corporate job when she had the idea to print her résumé on a cake and send it to Nike.

""I was fully prepared to buy this cake and just have it sit some random place somewhere"" Blackburn 27 told Insider. But with the help of a friend a bakery and a dedicated Instacart driver her résumé cake would land in the hands of the operations specialist she'd connected with at Nike's Valiant Labs.

Blackburn who lives in Wilmington North Carolina and has been looking for a job in product marketing said Valiant Labs a startup incubator within Nike ""resonates"" with her background.

Blackburn said she learned more about Valiant Labs after speaking with an operations specialist named Mac Myers and though she discovered the company was not hiring she still wanted to put her name on its radar.

Blackburn had gotten the idea for a cake résumé from a former colleague who told her she had to think outside the box if she was going to get the company's attention.

After some research she said she discovered that a Nike publicity event was taking place in early September in Beaverton Oregon where Nike is headquartered. ""I was like what better a time to send a cake than to a party right?"" Blackburn said.

She ordered the cake and planned to have an Instacart driver pick it up to deliver to Nike's headquarters.

The driver Denise Baldwin told Insider she was ""extremely shocked"" when she saw the cake.

""I wasn't really expecting such a nice layout detailed résumé on a cake"" Baldwin said. ""I've never seen that before.""

Blackburn explained to Baldwin through the Instacart app that she had been laid off and was passionate about a job with Valiant Labs. She said Baldwin promised she'd get the cake into Myers' hands.

Baldwin was tasked with navigating the 286-acre Nike campus finding her way through a party and finding Myers — all with a cake and her 8-month-old son in tow.

""Not only was it amazing for me to be on the campus but to find out I was there that day when all that stuff was going on was even more like 'Wow I can't believe this is happening'"" Baldwin said.

She communicated with security while corresponding with Blackburn to make sure the cake made it to Myers. Baldwin said she was given a map and a ride around campus to locate Myers before she was told he was in the LeBron James building. Baldwin said security personnel told her she could leave the cake at the front desk where they would put Myers' name on it.

She declined. Wanting to make sure Blackburn's résumé made it to Myers personally she waited by the front desk with her son until Myers was called down.

Baldwin recalled that when Myers arrived he called the cake ""neat"" and said he didn't even want to cut into it.

She sent a picture to Blackburn to confirm that the mission had been accomplished.

""I sent it to Karly for a confirmation so that she knew that it got exactly to the person she needed it to be to and she could have peace of mind knowing that her effort was received"" Baldwin said.

""She waited for him to come up and she gave it to Mac and got the cake in the right place and all while holding her son in one arm and cake in the other"" Blackburn said. ""I don't know how she did that. She was amazing. It's crazy.""

Baldwin told Insider she treats every delivery with the same dedication and service because that's how she was raised.

""I was just doing what I normally do and making sure that it got there"" Baldwin said. ""But I think I put a little bit more because I knew it was a résumé and she really wanted this job. And I knew that if it was me and I wanted to go for Nike that I'd want somebody to take the time and put in the effort.""

While Baldwin and Blackburn have not met in person they've become long-distance friends. Baldwin a pregnant mother of three said Blackburn offered to mentor her.

""We talk every day send messages"" Baldwin said. ""She found out I don't have a computer and I do everything on my phone and so she's sending me a computer.""

Blackburn said that she's still searching for a job that resonates with her and that she's talked with several companies since posting about her cake on LinkedIn. She said that remaining confident in her job search had kept her resilient.

""I've had other people reach out saying messages of how this has inspired them"" Blackburn said adding that ""a really cool thing about LinkedIn"" is that other people could hear her story and know ""that they can go out and do whatever it is that they want to do.""

She added: ""Getting rejection after rejection is hard to see. But the thing is you just have to trust yourself and know that you're amazing and that you have great skills and qualities to offer to whatever company or job that you're applying for. And then the right fit will happen.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9mYW5uYXRpb24vc25lYWtlcnMvbmV3cy9jYWxlYi13aWxsaWFtcy13ZWFycy11bnJlbGVhc2VkLW5pa2UtZHVuay1sb3dz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caleb Williams Wears Cactus Plant Nike Dunk Lows,"Fans can always count on the west coast schools setting trends. On and off the field the PAC-12 is constantly pushing the envelope. While other college football teams arrive at games dressed alike the USC Trojans treat every game like a fashion show.

Similar to NFL teams the Trojans get their best pregame outfits off before taking the field. Yesterday the Trojans' social media team gave fans a glimpse of the best pregame fit pics.

It's no surprise that the Trojans defeated the Washington State Cougars 30-14. Deion Sanders tried to tell us many years ago if you look good you play good.

Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams is a prime example. The 19-year-old wore unreleased Nike shoes before leading his team to a victory. Below is everything fans need to know about Williams' expensive kicks.

Cactus Plant Flea Market x Nike Dunk Low 'Desert Moss'

Williams wore the Cactus Plant Flea Market x Nike Dunk Low in the 'Desert Moss' colorway. The shoes have not yet been unreleased and they already sale for over $2K on resale sites.

Every sneakerhead will tell you that the Nike Dunk Low is the most popular shoe on the market. However this is no normal pair of Dunks. The earthy-looking shoes were designed as part of a collaboration between Nike and Cactus Plant Flea Market.

There is a lot going on with these shoes. They feature a quilted suede upper. Oversized Swoosh logos appear on the lateral side. A Yin Yang logo is embroidered on the heel counter. And it is impossible to miss the mossy green midsole.

Williams easily gets FanNation Kicks' game ball of the week for the shoes he wore prior to Saturday's game. We can't wait to see what the Heisman candidate rocks next week before the Trojans play the Utah Utes. Stay locked into FanNationKicks.com for all your sneaker news.

Shares of Nike (NKE -2.10%) are down 52% since hitting an all-time high toward the end of last year. Weak results from major retailers meant investors had low expectations entering Nike's latest quarterly report but the swoosh still failed to deliver. Let's see why and what investors should make of it.

Nike reported decent revenue growth for the quarter but economic headwinds are presenting problems. Profits fell as inflationary costs in transportation and higher reliance on promotional sales and markdowns weighed on margins. The stock tumbled to new lows following the report.

Nike is a fantastic brand. It has one of the world's most iconic logos and the near-term uncertainty in the economy means investors can buy the stock at a cheaper valuation of 30 times this year's consensus earnings estimate which is down from over 40 earlier this year.

But before deciding to buy the stock investors should shop around to see if Nike really offers the best value relative to its underlying business growth.

Comparing Nike stock to alternatives

One way to determine if a stock is undervalued and worth buying is to compare its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to the average company in the S&P 500 index.

The S&P 500 index average forward P/E is currently 17. Is Nike worth its higher valuation? On the one hand its history of consistent growth brand strength and secular industry tailwinds justifies it. However Nike's long-term expectation for mid-to-high teens growth in earnings per share (EPS) compared to the median of 12% EPS growth for the average company in the S&P 500 index makes it difficult to justify paying almost twice as much for each share of Nike on a P/E basis.

Another way to gauge the value of a stock is to compare it to industry peers. Let's look at Lululemon Athletica. Lululemon reported revenue growth of 29% year over year in the most recent quarter which is blazing fast compared to Nike's 4% in its fiscal first quarter. On a constant-currency basis Nike is still growing the top line at only 10%.

Lululemon is also doing a better job of holding its profit margin up. It faces the same inflationary costs as other retailers right now but Lululemon still managed to grow earnings per share 33% year over year in the last quarter. Nike reported a 20% decline in EPS.

Overall Lululemon has navigated through supply chain issues during the pandemic and inflation far better than the world's largest athletic wear brand.

Analysts expect Lululemon to report full-year revenue growth of 26.7% with adjusted earnings per share up 27%. Lululemon reported ""robust"" guest traffic in stores last quarter in addition to strong growth in e-commerce.

By comparison analysts expect Nike to report full-year growth for its May-ending fiscal year of less than 5% on top of a 20% drop in earnings per share. Nike executives also pointed to ""strong demand"" in the marketplace in the last earnings report but that description should come with an asterisk since Nike had to rely on promotional sales to drive growth.

Promotional activity is increasing across the marketplace but Lululemon appears so far to be immune to this since it is positioned as a premium brand and is not known for discounting merchandise.

Nike stock is still too expensive

Despite growing much faster than Nike Lululemon stock trades at a forward P/E of 30.8 just slightly higher than Nike's 29.7 forward P/E.

Investors are getting substantially more growth with Lululemon for almost the same price. That makes Nike look relatively overvalued compared to its faster-growing industry peer.

Nike's premium to the S&P 500 and relatively low growth compared to Lululemon make it clear that Nike stock is still too expensive and should be avoided right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9zZXB0ZW1iZXItMjAyMi1lYXJuaW5ncy10b2RzLWZlcnJhZ2Ftby1uaWtl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tod's Returns To Profitability While Nike Feels The China Squeeze,"Only a handful of luxury and fashion lines announced their earnings results in September but those that did fared relatively well. Despite an array of challenges — from unfavorable foreign exchange rates to overstocked inventory due to shipping delays — Ferragamo Tod’s and Nike all managed to beat estimates. However this was largely thanks to consumers in Europe and North America; China the only major economy still enforcing strict COVID-19 measures remains a sore spot for sales.

The newly rebranded Ferragamo started September off strong by topping market forecasts. Group revenue in the first half of fiscal 2022 climbed 20 percent to €630 million (619 million or 4.4 billion RMB) while net profit surged 85 percent to €62 million (61 million or 434 million RMB) compared to the same period last year. Unsurprisingly net sales in the Asia Pacific region which made up one-third of total sales fell by 1.5 percent due to the ongoing lockdowns.

With disruptions beginning at the end of March China was the one area that slumped. But the house maintained some activities: for the Lunar New Year Ferragamo invited local artists Sun Yuan and Peng Yu to create unique prints for a special capsule strengthening its relationship with the creative community. In April it partnered with mega KOL Li Jiaqi and Tencent Huiju Luxury to promote its Spring 2022 collection and later participated in JD.com’s 618 which boosted sales by 150 percent during the 18-day shopping festival.

According to CEO Marco Gobbetti who joined the luxury firm in January Ferragamo will accelerate investment in the second half of the year to “build strength in platforms and regions” driven by a “transformational deal” with Farfetch. This combined with a revamp under its new creative director Maximilian Davis could help bring the brand closer to its goal of doubling 2021 revenues by 2026.

The parent company of Tod’s Roger Vivier and Hogan also reported solid first-half results. The Italian luxury group returned to profitability and reported a 17.4 percent increase in revenues to €465.7 million (458 million or 3.2 billion RMB) surpassing pre-pandemic levels. This was despite the fact that sales in Greater China tumbled 13 percent: “In China in the first half 88 percent of stores were opened but the ones that were closed were the biggest and the ones that had the most impact” explained CEO Emilio Macellari.

This impacted more than just brick-and-mortar foot traffic; online shrank to single digits as the “complete closure of the warehouse and logistics in Shanghai made it impossible to deliver” Macellari added. However the portfolio of labels maintained a steady stream of marketing activities in H1 especially with celebrities and KOLs: Hogan appointed Chinese actor Gong Jun as brand ambassador and Tod’s collaborated with brand ambassador Xiao Zhan on a capsule collection.

Despite beating analyst expectations Tod’s recovered slower than luxury outfits like Richemont and LVMH. And now with plans to delist the business after 22 years on the Italian stock exchange there are more concerns about its future than just tough competition.

In the quarter ended August 31  Nike’s revenue increased 4 percent to 12.7 billion (90 billion RMB) compared to the year prior led by double-digit growth in North America and Europe. Although revenue sank 13 percent on a currency-neutral basis in China the sneaker giant pointed out this decline was better than anticipated. In fact it noted two wins in the market: liquidating more units than planned and higher full-price realization.

Though still cautious about the near term the Swoosh is confident that its unique value proposition will fuel long-term growth in the mainland. “We continue to deepen connections with Chinese consumers in locally relevant ways from elevating the street dance community with hyperlocal product and storytelling to igniting youth basketball culture through the lens of the Chinese high school basketball league” CFO Matt Friend said in the earnings call. Driven by this “hyperlocalization” Gen Z demand grew more than 25 percent versus the year prior on digital platforms and the newly launched Nike app became the top brand shopping app in the country Friend observed.

Coming off this solid first quarter the sportswear maker expects currency-neutral revenue growth of low double digits in the next period. As CEO John Donahoe stated “what is clear is that the Chinese consumer is ready to come back into the market and what they're looking for is innovation quality and storytelling” — promising signs for Nike and the industry at large."

SANDUSKY Ohio — Update: As of Saturday Oct. 15 Columbus Ave. remains closed to pedestrian and vehicular traffic after a major train derailment the previous weekend where the train crosses over the road. Engineers with the city and Norfolk Southern railroad are continuing to assess and make repairs to the underpass and storm water system. This is despite the reopening of the rail line over the road which railroad engineers determined to be structurally sound.

A train derailment in Sandusky on Saturday afternoon closed a road in the city and knocked out power for those in the area.

The Norfolk Southern train derailed around 4 p.m. at the Columbus Ave. overpass.

Multiple rail cars overturned with some spilling over the side of the overpass and onto Columbus Ave.

Nobody was injured as a result of the derailment.

Crews began cleaning up the mess left by the derailment on Sunday morning in front of a large crowd of onlookers.

Heavy equipment was brought in to push some of the rail cars fully onto Columbus Ave. before they were hauled away.

A spokesman for Norfolk Southern says the train had 101 total cars and a preliminary count of the cars that derailed totaled approximately 10.

Norfolk Southern says the train was hauling paraffin wax which is non-toxic.

The city says there was a leak of the wax but it has since hardened and poses no danger.

The line on which the train derailed is a major east-west rail line for freight and passenger trains.

Amtrak announced delays and the rerouting of service for many of their trains due to the derailment throughout the evening on Saturday.

WTOL-TV reports the derailment occurred about 4 p.m. closing Columbus Avenue. The station was told by an NS spokesman that the derailed cars were carrying paraffin wax some of which spilled but posed no hazardous-material threat.

No injuries were reported. The derailment knocked down a power pole interrupting electrical service to about 1300 utility customers.

Amtrak announced on its Amtrak Alerts Twitter feed on Saturday evening that the Capitol Limited and Lake Shore Limited would be detoured between Elyria Ohio and Toledo on Sunday mornig bypassing their scheduled stops in Sandusky. (Those are scheduled at 12:40 a.m. for the eastbound Capitol 4:01 a.m. for the westbound Capitol 4:03 a.m. for the eastbound Lake Shore and 5:09 a.m. for the westbound Lake Shore). Passengers were advised to board in Elyria or Toledo.

The trains were combined at Toledo eastbound and Cleveland westbound switching off their former New York Central route to Norfolk Southern’s ex-Nickel Plate trackage at Oak Harbor west of Sandusky and at Vermillion Ohio east of the derailment. They operated as a single train in both directions through Bellevue the former center of many Nickel Plate’s operations.

The Capitol sustained the biggest delays because it was the earlier train to arrive and had to await the Lake Shore before both trains were coupled together. The combined trains lost about two hours in each direction on the detour and maintained that delay thereafter with arrivals in Chciago before noon and the eastbound Lake Shore two hours late at Utica N.Y. Because it had been held the longest at Toledo the eastbound Capitol departed Cumberland Md. 5 hours 46 minutes late.

Detour not repeated for Sunday trains

The detour was not repeated for Sunday departures. The Capitol Limited was cancelled entirely and the Lake Shore was set to run Chicago-Toledo eastbound Sunday and westbound Monday morning with the New York City-Toledo segment cancelled. The Lake Shore’s Boston section was scheduled westbound Sunday and eastbound Monday.

Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams tells Trains News Wire that the outright cancellations Sunday were “based on what Norfolk Southern can accommodate” on the detour route. However the westbound Lake Shore is scheduled to arrive into Cleveland at 3:53 a.m. with its eastbound counterpart departing at 5:50 a.m. so there has been no explanation why the train is not being operated to serve passengers at Cleveland Erie and upstate New York.

The incident occurred at approximately 4:20 p.m. when a conductor aboard a train traveling east reported engine issues which caused the derailment at the Columbus Avenue overpass.

The damaged train cars are leaking wax that is not hazardous the City of Sandusky said on Twitter.

The Columbus Avenue underpass and Campbell Street rail crossing remain closed due to the accident and Sundusky Police asked drivers to avoid the area.

There are no known injuries.

The derailed train also knocked out power for roughly 1200 customers living in the area Edison Power said.

Here's why,"New York Times

New York Times

New York Times









Job growth eased slightly in September but remained robust indicating that the economy was maintaining momentum despite higher interest rates. But the strong showing left many investors unhappy because they saw signs that the fight against inflation may become tougher and more prolonged.Employers added 263000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis the Labor Department said Friday a decline from 315000 in August. The number was the lowest since April 2021 but still strong by pre-pandemic standards. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5% equaling a five-decade low.“If I had just woken up from a really long nap and seen these numbers I would conclude that we still have one of the strongest job markets that we’ve ever enjoyed” said Carl Tannenbaum chief economist at Northern Trust.Officials at the Federal Reserve have been keeping a close eye on hiring and wages as they proceed with a series of rate increases meant to combat inflation. The job data indicates that for now they are doing so without tipping the economy into a recession that would throw millions out of work.But it also increases the prospect that the effort to subdue price increases will be more prolonged. For investors that came as bad news since higher interest rates raise costs for companies and weigh on stock prices.The S&P 500 recorded its worst one-day performance since mid-September falling 2.8% and eroding gains from earlier in the week. Fed officials have signaled in speeches this week that they remain resolute in trying to wrestle inflation lower and that they are waiting for clear evidence that the economy is headed back toward price stability before they pull back.Wage growth has subsided somewhat at least compared with the trend a year ago. Average hourly earnings climbed 5% from a year earlier roughly matching economists’ expectations but slowing down slightly from the prior annual reading.Although the rise in wages is not keeping up with inflation it has remained fast enough that Fed officials see it as a sign that they will need to take further steps to cool off the economy since employers are likely to continue raising prices to cover increasing labor costs.Beyond the central bank the report had political repercussions. With the midterm elections just weeks away both parties seized on the data to make the case that they are the best stewards of the economy.In a speech before factory workers at a Volvo plant in Hagerstown Maryland President Joe Biden said the numbers were a sign that the economy was making a transition to stable growth.“Our job market continues to show resilience as we navigate through this economic transition” he said. “The pace of job growth is cooling while still powering our recovery forward.”Republicans in turn pounced on indications that the job market was cooling to assail Biden for economic mismanagement.“The economy is shrinking inflation is raging and job growth is slowing” said Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee.Beyond the partisan spin it appears that after months of vigorous hiring that defied economists’ expectations the highflying labor market is coming back down to earth.There were some notable bright spots in the September report. Health care employers and leisure and hospitality businesses which were both battered by the pandemic continued to add jobs. Construction did likewise despite a slowdown in the housing market.But deeper cracks have started to show in other industries as consumers pull back on spending in the face of financial instability. Hiring in the retail industry was basically flat and jobs in trucking — a pandemic winner — dropped by more than 11000.In a move broadly consistent with this pullback Amazon recently announced a slowdown in hiring and said this week that it planned to hire 150000 workers this holiday season on a par with last year.There are other signs that the gap is narrowing between the supply of labor and the demand. The number of job openings decreased in August to 10.1 million from 11.2 million in July. Filings for unemployment benefits last week rose modestly.From the Fed’s perspective “we’ve had some incremental positive developments in the labor market — job openings are declining wage growth seems to be slowing a little bit at the margin” said Aneta Markowska chief financial economist at the investment bank Jefferies. “It’s a baby step in the right direction.”The labor force participation rate — a measure of how many people are working or actively looking for jobs — ticked down slightly in September to 62.3% from 62.4% in August though it was in line with the level it has hovered around for most of 2022.A less frenzied job market has been welcome relief for employers after months of intense competition for labor drove wages up precipitously and left many businesses grumbling that they could not fill open positions.Vision Hospitality Group a hotel ownership and management company based in Chattanooga Tennessee has struggled to hire workers despite raising wages 30% since 2019 and offering incentives like daily pay for employees said Mitch Patel the company’s founder and CEO.To compensate for the persistent labor shortage the company which has about 1500 employees has relied more on temporary contract workers than it had in the past. It has also learned how to operate more efficiently allowing guests to check in on their mobile phones for instance and providing housekeeping by request.But Patel said he had noticed that hiring had gotten a little easier more recently and that turnover was lower. Rather than operating at 70% of full staffing he said the company is at more like 90%.“It’s still challenging but it is getting better” he said.Yet what may be good for the economy writ large will inevitably hurt some workers particularly those in low-wage jobs who have been able to leverage the extraordinarily tight labor market in the pandemic era to demand higher pay better benefits and more flexible schedules. Even if the economy avoids a recession workers could still see their advantage — and their standard of living — slip away.“A slowdown could feel uncomfortable for some people” said Julia Pollak chief economist at ZipRecruiter. “If things go back to normal that will be pretty gloomy for them. But it doesn’t mean that we’re in a recession — it just means we’re back in that normal labor market environment where job-seeking is difficult.”Still some economists are forecasting that the economic slowdown will become more pronounced in the coming months. The possibility of job losses looms large.“Going forward we definitely expect a more significant moderation in hiring” said Nancy Vanden Houten an economist at Oxford Economics. “We think that corporate profits are going to weaken quite a bit as the economy slows and that will lead to some pullback in hiring and ultimately some layoffs.”Already some companies are tempering their hiring ambitions.Jeff Ohlemacher the owner and CEO of EMC Precision which manufactures precision machined parts such as shafts for blenders and shock absorbers for amusement park rides said he had increased his company’s head count this year to 143 from 105 because demand from customers was so strong.“Up until recently we pretty much if somebody had a high score on a mechanical aptitude test and it was a good cultural fit we would hire them” said Ohlemacher whose company has plants in Elyria Ohio and Sheridan Indiana.But while business conditions are still “extremely good” he said he was not looking to expand the company further at this point estimating that he would bring on only 10 employees for the remainder of the year to account for attrition and any new business.“We think right now we’re at full employment” he said. “And with the slowing of growth that we’ve seen we think we’re about right-sized.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbWVyaWNrbGVhZGVyLmllL25ld3MvaG9tZS85MzI2ODEvaW4tcGljdHVyZXMtc29kLXR1cm5lZC1vbi1uZXctMTltLXNjaG9vbC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1pbi1saW1lcmljay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Pictures: Sod turned on new €19m school development in Limerick,"Please allow ads as they help fund our trusted local news content.

The 100 percent Focus Movement a group of emerging young Northern leaders has urged all Nigerians to vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for power shift to the southern part of the country and for rapid national development.

National coordinator of the movement Labib Abdullahi Mahmood made the call in Abuja at a roundtable and launch as part of activities to garner support for Tinubu’s presidential aspiration. According to him it is in the interest of all Nigerians that Tinubu should be elected president in 2023 especially with his track-record in politics and business.

“It is a long journey that we started over time as social entrepreneurs we identify community problems and try to solve them. We realise that the challenging gap is leadership. This is why we focused on Asiwaju Tinubu having seen his capacity and what he can offer” he said.

He also said that Tinubu has the experience to tackle the challenges confronting the country.",,,,,,

Those visitors will be the first to attend an Edwards AFB Open House and Air Show since the once-annual event was twice suspended 13 years ago — first for security reasons after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and subsequent warfare in the Middle East and then by shutdowns during the pandemic.

This year’s restoration of the open house and air show coincides with historic anniversaries for Edwards and the U.S. Air Force most notably the 75th Anniversary of the first supersonic flight at Edwards in October 1947 and creation of the U.S. Air Force in the same year.

A base historian reports the first recorded air show at what is now Edwards took place on Army Day April 6 1945 on what was then Muroc Army Airfield. Attendance was set at 5000 and about 1500 of those paid to stand in line for Army chow.

Attendance blossomed in the 1950s as the Edwards mission profile expanded. And in subsequent decades appearance of legendary air and space programs including the X-15 XB-70 NASA Space Shuttle SR-71 Blackbird and B-1 and B-2 bombers propelled attendance to incredible heights. Two-day attendance at Edwards air shows totaled more than 100000 always spurred by appearance of the Thunderbirds.

Additionally this year base officials estimate about 10000 school children to be bused-in on Friday for a new Science Technology Engineering and Math Expo in massive Hangar 1600 and across a flightline ramp full of static aircraft. In another first young eyes will witness the full airshow on the Friday that was traditionally a closed rehearsal. The base will remain closed to the public on that day.

Whether flying by performing aerobatics or parked for closeup inspection things with wings are the starring attractions. And the Edwards AFB Open House is one of the few bases where such a large and comprehensive collection of military aircraft from all branches come together on rare occasions.

Many of the aircraft including the pioneering X-Planes and America’s fleet of Space Shuttle Orbiters first flew and landed at Edwards one of a few places in the world where such an extraordinary family reunion is possible.

Art Thompson Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Flight Test Historical Foundation remarked “While Kitty Hawk is revered for the first powered aircraft flight the first of everything else was started here” in the Aerospace Valley.

Visitors using the Rosamond Boulevard West Gate entry to Edwards from SR-14 (Antelope Valley Freeway) may get a first glimpse of the non-profit group’s steel walls rising from foundations poured alongside Rosamond Dry Lakebed. Ahead and just before reaching restricted base property at the guard post visitors will see the landmark Century Circle.

Lisa Brown director of education and community outreach said the museum’s educational center will be a worldwide crossroads bringing together and inspiring future generations of aerospace technologists engineers and research scientists.

Among the museum’s major attractions for researchers educators and historians will be the Bob Hoover Research Library and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) Archives. Brown concluded “Our mission is to elevate this Valley.”

Hands-on Simulators: Popular with young and older air show fans are flight simulators at least two of which are on schedule at Edwards. The General Atomics UAV Simulator lets the pilot replicate the missions of a real life drone pilot flying a mission from half-a-world away.

Also appearing for the Air Show and the STEM day will be the new flight simulator from AviNation Magazine a national media platform featuring stories for and about students aspiring to careers in aviation. In the words of founder and CEO Jack Peed “Our mission is to attract educate and empower youth in aviation.”

Early in the week the AviNation American Dream Tour will send aerospace speakers to high schools in Santa Monica Bakersfield and Palmdale’s Engineering Academy.

Chase Kohler chief of media operations for the 412th Test Wing at Edwards said the base located within the boundaries of three counties — Kern Los Angeles and San Bernardino — is a benefactor to the entire regional economy. It takes more than 1200 volunteers to operate the event.

Whether new in town or a local air show fan from way back each visitor may have a lot in common in figuring what to expect this entirely new Aerospace Valley Air Show.

Unofficial guidance for visitors falls under the traditional motto of Edwards AFB: Ad Inexplorato Latin for Toward the Unexplored. The motto could fit because this is the first air show at Edwards since 2009. Many things have changed. Needing to arrive early isn’t one of them.

The only two gates open to the public are West Gate on Rosamond Boulevard off SR-14 and North Gate off SR-58 north of Mojave. Gates originally scheduled to open at 8:30 a.m. are now reported online to open at 9 a.m. And both gates into the base will close 2 ½ hours later at precisely 11:30 a.m. no matter how many cars have entered or how many remain in line outside.

The old Edwards air show of old came to be known for traffic jams entering and leaving the base especially on State Route 14 where traffic was jammed for miles.

With time better technology communications and collaboration between military local and state law enforcement and transportation departments drivers may notice improved directional signs and receive important electronic messages on mobile devices.

Entry and exit traffic movement is expected to be improved by adding one extra inbound lane in the morning reversing that lane’s direction for exiting.

A non-official idea that might shorten waiting time at the gate for drivers coming from the south is to use the North Gate on Highway 58 which historically experienced shorter lines onto the base and a shorter drive from gate to parking.

For those unfortunate to be sitting in line when the gates to Edwards shut at 11:30 a.m. there is an alternative aerospace landmark destination to save the day and avoid a wasted trip.

The City of Palmdale’s 26-acre outdoor Joe Davies Heritage Airpark and the adjacent Blackbird Airpark operated by the Flight Test Historical Foundation are located in the shadow of Air Force Plant 42 where many of the nation’s military and civilian aircraft and missiles were produced and flight tested since World War II. From SR-14 travel east on East Avenue P (Rancho Vista Blvd.)

Heritage Airpark’s inventory lists 21 aircraft including a B-52 NASA’s 747 Shuttle Orbiter Transporter and a scale model B-2. Blackbird Airpark has the spy plane collection including the SR-71 YF-12A and the U-2.

Both museum sites are open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays. Parking and admission are free.

While there’s no charge for entry to the Air Show or for general area parking visitors must provide their own shade and place to sit. And with security rules limiting the size of containers a small bag and a folding chair are the maximum. Water is free and food and beverage concessions accept cash or major credit cards. But there are no ATM machines.

Those who can afford it may buy upgrades from several privately operated ticket vendors online. Advertised prices range from top-end VIP premium box seats just north of $700 a head to various levels on the creature comforts scale as low as $70 per person.

(AeroVironment)

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is poised to launch a competitive prototyping effort for a tactical drone after selecting AeroVironment’s Jump 20 earlier this year as an interim option. And according to Army aviation leaders the pool of competitors appears significantly larger than when competition began in 2019.

In 2018 the Army began considering requirements for a replacement for the Textron-made Shadow drone. The aircraft is widely used but is one of the most accident-prone unmanned aerial systems in the service’s inventory. It is also difficult to deploy and has a loud engine allowing for easy detection.

By 2019 the service narrowed the pool of competitors to two: a Martin UAV-Northrop Grumman team and Textron Systems’ AAI. Martin UAV supplied its V-Bat system while Textron offered its Aerosonde HQ.

Shortly after the Army added two more aircraft for evaluation: L3Harris Technologies’ FVR-90 and Arcturus UAV’s Jump 20. In 2021 AeroVironment acquired Arcturus for $405 million.

For about a year operational units evaluated the four different tactical drones culminating in a rodeo in spring 2021 at Fort Benning Georgia.

Two units received Arcturus’ offering while the other systems went to one unit each. That approach was based on the number of systems readily available and the service’s desire to get platforms to five units.

At the Fort Benning rodeo all five units tried each offering to compare them.

“Although the demonstrations were a critical portion of that to inform the requirements they weren’t necessarily going to be used as source selection” Maj. Gen. Robert Barrie the Army’s program executive officer for aviation told Defense News in a recent interview.

Demonstrations wrapped up in the first half of 2021 but it took until August 2022 for the Army to select one company to build an initial tranche of systems. The service was working through requirements an acquisition strategy and waiting for congressionally approved funding.

The Army in August awarded AeroVironment an $8 million contract to pay for one Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System which includes six air vehicles ground data terminals and ground control stations. The system will go to a single brigade combat team.

“Increment 1 ... really represents the current state of industry regarding performance capabilities that are going to get us rapidly deployable runway independent expeditionary [a] vertical takeoff [capability]” Barrie said ahead of the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference. “Increment 1 allows us to field a capability today that’s available.”

Increment 2 in which the Army prepares for a competitive prototyping phase “builds on that with all of those current demonstrated capabilities [but] it’s going to increase range [and] it’s going to incorporate a scalable control interface which [gives] the ability for multiple soldiers in multiple places to be able to control an Increment 2” Barrie said.

The second increment should also offer upgraded sensor capability — “specifically an enhanced laser designator” he added. The system is expected to offer more interoperability through manned-unmanned teaming for example and provide an improved controller interface.

Additionally he noted the second increment must enable organic maintenance of the system so the Army can “break ourselves of contractor logistics support.”

Following the Increment 2 competitive process which will involve multiple vendors the Army plans to choose a winner and buy its system in larger quantities than in Increment 1.

“It will be an incremental downselect [process] to maximize all of the competition” Barrie said.

Maj. Gen. Walter Rugen who manages the Army’s future vertical lift technology development said five units went through one of the longest soldier evaluations the Army has ever done and by the end were “pretty much demanding that technology.”

Because of that demand the Army decided to progress in an incremental fashion providing a unit immediate capability but then competing to pursue what the service considers to be a truly “transformational capability” Rugen said.

The incremental approach and a competition for a second increment are meant to help the Army get the best value for the best capability according to Barrie.

“One could argue: ‘OK [AeroVironment] won … therefore they have a leg up.’ The other side is we have well understood costs and capabilities and limitations with those systems” Barrie added. “So as we go into a competitive environment we will know very well what their system can do and we’ll be able to compare it against other systems.”

Asked whether to expect more industry participation this time around Barrie said: “100% yes. In fact I know we have a bigger pool.”

He wouldn’t provide a specific timeline on the Increment 2 prototyping effort but said decisions will come in fiscal 2023.

According to FY23 Army budget documents the service plans to enter FTUAS Increment 2 competitive prototyping in the first quarter of FY23 and wrap it up in the first quarter of FY25. The Army is slated to make a rapid fielding decision in the second quarter of FY25 and to hold an operational evaluation in the third quarter of FY25. The system is planned to then enter full-rate production in the second quarter of FY26.

Check back for more If you're like the countless people who silently wept when the Tomcat left American service you're no doubt fascinated with what it has rocking under the hood these days. It's bound to be some fascinating stuff. But if this doeshappen it would be a mere footnote in a landmark period in Iranian history. A period of profound change for so much more than curious aviation buffs but for all the people of Iran.Check back for more fighter jet profiles here on autoevolution.

Most of the time geopolitics are seldom newsworthy for our purposes here. But in this case the Iranian government's turmoil might one day reveal secrets about one of Iran's prized warplanes. As it happens they're American in origin.If you know anything about the current Iranian regime you'll understand the irony of it all. Iranian pilots love them and the U.S. Navy laments that the Iranians ever got their hands on them. But if the regime does fall western eyes may finally see the more intricate details of the Iranian Air Force's Grumman F-14 Tomcats.In the days before the Ayatollah during the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi the last Iranian Shah Iran was the sole export customer of the F-14. What was at the time the most advanced carrier-borne jet fighter in the history of aviation.At the time the U.S. had the luxury of being in the good graces of the Israeli and Iranian governments. Something that sounds absurd with modern sensibilities. As such both nations were allowed to pick which American jet fighter they wanted to order for their own Air Forces.The Israelis opted for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle  which they used to great effect in every war they fought for the rest of the 20th century. Meanwhile Iran was already taking delivery of the equally American McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and became the first in line to order the F-14. The first Iranian F-14 Tomcat left the Grumman factory in the Long Island New York neighborhood of Bethpage bound for Iran in December 1975.The Tomcats arrived in Iran in January of the following year with 79 delivered in total. From the accounts as told by Iranian pilots themselves a great many thought it was the greatest airplane they'd ever flown. The F-14's combat record post-Iranian Revolution is hard to quantify definitively. But it's safe to say the Iraqi Army grew to loathe the thing. Be it MiG-21s  MiG-23s Su-20s and 22s no Iraqi jet was safe during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.Rivaled in dominance only by their once allies turned enemies the Israelis and their F-15s against Lebanon and Syria The Tomcat proceeded to buzzsaw through its adversaries with the same ease. By 2002 Iranian F-14s were still toying around with its adversary's inferior airplanes.Most famously in July of that year Iranian Tomcats intercepted two Azerbaijani MiG-25 Foxbats and achieved missile lock without the MiGs ever being any the wiser. They were escorting Russian bombers over Syrian airspace as late as 2015.But interestingly enough Iranian Tomcats were delivered all those years ago with most of the US-Navy spec highly-classified avionics components removed. Therefore the avionics and engine package Iran's Tomcats have been using post-Revolution remains a debated topic in military intelligence circles. Iranian F-14 pilots have defected to both the Soviet Union and Iraq so the chances of an avionics package that's Soviet or Russian in origin isn't out of the question. It could also be in-house designed in origin.What is better known is the U.S.'s frigid and lifeless relationship with the current Islamic State government of Iran was a key factor in the F-14D's retirement from U.S. Navy service in 2006 . Grumman Aerospace had devised an upgrade path for the Tomcat platform before its merger into Northrop Grumman in 1994.But one can't help but think the chances of that technology falling into the hands of a nation openly hostile to American interests was a factor in the Super Tomcat 21 never coming to fruition. Should the near 45-year-long reign of the Islamic State end via another revolution at the hands of largely pro-western Iranian Millenials and Gen-Z the secrets of the Iranian Tomcats being uncovered could create a shock wave throughout global military aerospace. Whether for legitimate intel purposes on the part of the Pentagon or as a mere morbid curiosity it should be evident why this happening could be a huge deal."

Almost overnight demand eased up and caused graphics hardware prices to drop by almost half. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang admitted in August that the company made too many graphics cards that now it has to sell them for less money. But Nvidia isn’t alone in this mess.

Just last year the only story about chips was that manufacturers couldn’t make enough of them to meet the strong demand for consumer electronics cars and other products that require semiconductors. But even as shortages continue for certain types of semiconductors the story is becoming more nuanced especially for giants like Samsung and AMD who were flying high on revenues and profits in 2021 and into 2022.

Now they are being bowled over by a tide that similarly swept up Nvidia and Intel this summer. As reported by Bloomberg this week Samsung is reporting a 32 percent sales guidance cut while AMD warned investors it’s going to miss its previous forecast by about $1 billion.

Slumping PC sales provide an obvious explanation for why processors from AMD and Intel are not in as high demand as they were early in the pandemic. Everyone simultaneously had an incentive to upgrade their laptops gaming machines and work-from-home setups but now sales have slowed.

One way manufacturers would like to turn that around as Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger described on Decoder is “to enable the PC ecosystem to have better products than what is done by the Mac. Period.” But that hasn’t happened yet and for giants like Samsung it doesn’t even begin to address the slowdown in demand for cloud servers and other machines.

We emailed Gartner analysts Gaurav Gupta Joseph Unsworth and Jon Erensen who confirmed to The Verge that other OEMs are also facing high inventory and low demand. “OEMs had piled inventory in 2021 and first half of 2022 — during shortages — panic buying / double-triple ordering etc.” said the analysts. They also pointed out that these warnings from Samsung and AMD are due to the weak forecasts in PCs smartphones and consumer electronics even though other areas like automotive are strong comparatively.

Samsung’s memory and storage chip business made it the largest chipmaker over Intel in 2018 though the latter company primarily makes x86 processors. In July Intel suffered losses and reported a 22 percent decline in revenue driven by low PC sales and operating losses to get its Arc GPUs out the door.

Related All the factors that combined to create the chip shortage in 2021

Demand for chips of all kinds peaked at the turn of 2022 and companies like Samsung had record high revenue in 2021 with a 26 percent increase in profits (compared to its previous high in 2020) due to higher demand for consumer electronics like smartphones and TVs.

But now WSJ reports that contract prices for DRAM chips dropped 15 percent and 28 percent for NAND flash chips (the two main components Samsung makes) and cites a TrendForce prediction that those declines will continue to decline until nearly flattening by the end of 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ob3ctdG8tdXNlLWFtZC1zbWFydC1hY2Nlc3MtbWVtb3J5LWFuZC1udmlkaWEtcmVzaXphYmxlLWJhci_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9jb21wdXRpbmcvaG93LXRvLXVzZS1hbWQtc21hcnQtYWNjZXNzLW1lbW9yeS1hbmQtbnZpZGlhLXJlc2l6YWJsZS1iYXIvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to use AMD Smart Access Memory and Nvidia Resizable BAR,"We recently covered the technical background of Nvidia’s Resizable BAR (Base Address Register) and AMD’s Smart Access Memory so now it’s time to dig in and explain how you use these technologies.

Although they achieve the same sort of goal of giving the CPU far greater access to game assets for faster allocation the process for enabling these technologies is slightly different. Let's go over the AMD method and the Nvidia method along with what you should know.

Get the right components for AMD Smart Access Memory

To take advantage of Smart Access Memory (SAM) you need the following:

In other words you need AMD hardware from end to end and very recent hardware at that. Reports indicate that Intel Arc graphics cards support resizable BAR on Ryzen PCs and Intel recently confirmed it though it hasn't seen much real-world testing.

Enable AMD Smart Access Memory

Step 1: Update the BIOS on your motherboard to the latest version — download it from your manufacturer’s website.

Step 2: Install the latest graphics driver from AMD’s driver repository.

Get your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!

Step 3: Enter the UEFI/BIOS by pressing your board’s specific key during startup.

Step 4: Enable two settings for Above 4G decoding and Re-Size BAR support. In the BIOS of our Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus motherboard we found Asus had inserted a simple button that changed both settings together. Your motherboard may differ so if in doubt look up your board's manual to find the setting you need to change.

Step 5: Save your changes exit the BIOS and head into Windows 10.

Step 6: As an aside if you glance back to the AMD web page you will note it includes a BIOS screenshot that refers to Resizeable BAR Support so while we might prefer the name Smart Access Memory it may be that Resizable BAR is the more enduring terminology.

Enable Resizable BAR

Nvidia also provides full details to guide you through the process of enabling Resizable BAR but it is dealing with more permutations than AMD so you need to proceed with some caution. It is interesting to note that Nvidia supports older AMD 400 motherboards but not AMD 3000 CPUs.

To use Resizable BAR with a Nvidia GPU you need:

AMD 400 or 500 series motherboard with Ryzen 5000 CPU or an Intel 10th- 11th- or 12th-generation CPU and corresponding motherboard

Am Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 graphics card or Intel Arc graphics card

Step 1: Update the BIOS on your motherboard BIOS to the latest version — download it from the manufacturer’s website.

Step 2: Install the latest graphics driver from Nvidia’s website.

Step 3: Enter the UEFI/BIOS by pressing your board’s specific key during startup.

Step 4: If you're running an older RTX 3000 GPU you may need to update your GPU BIOS to get access to the ReBAR feature. Most recent GPU releases shouldn't have any trouble however. If you find that you can't enable ReBAR when having followed this guide consult your GPU manufacturer's website for instructions on how to update to the latest BIOS.

Step 5: Check your Nvidia or Intel drivers to confirm that Resizable BAR has been enabled.

Should I enable Resizable BAR?

If you have an Intel GPU the answer is most definitely yes. Our review showed that this is an absolute must-use feature — otherwise you are hamstringing your GPU performance.

For AMD and Nvidia graphics cards this isn't so important as the performance difference is often somewhere between 1% and 10%. It is however free performance so while you don't have to enable it you probably should as otherwise you're just leaving additional frames on the table.

Sporting Ada Lovelace's subtle redesigns the RTX 4070 Founders Edition is alleged to resemble a shorter RTX 3080 Founders Edition card.

NVIDIA is on the verge of releasing the GeForce RTX 4090 making it the first Ada Lovelace-based graphics card to reach the market. For context the company has also introduced the RTX 4080 12 GB and RTX 4080 16 GB as well as the RTX 6000 Ada Generation. However Moore's Law Is Dead (MLID) claims to have received information about the GeForce RTX 4070.

Focusing on the Founders Edition model the leaker asserts that the RTX 4070 will be a two-slot graphics card which should come as no surprise. Purportedly the RTX 4070 will be closer in size to the RTX 3080 than the RTX 3070 as the graphic below attempts to demonstrate. Currently MLID expects NVIDIA to base the RTX 4070 around the AD104 a GPU that the company already uses in the RTX 4080 12 GB.

In other words the RTX 4070 will be a cut-down RTX 4080 12 GB. Reputedly NVIDIA is targeting two sets of specifications. Conversely it may be informing people of conflicting information to determine the sources of leaks. Either way MLID speculates that NVIDIA will launch the RTX 4070 with 10 GB of GDDR6X VRAM running at 21 Gbps and a 250 W TGP if AMD has not released anything competitive. Alternatively NVIDIA will uprate the RTX 4070 to 12 GB of the same VRAM and a 285 W TGP if it needs to position the card more aggressively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDYwLXRpLWdkZHI2eC1tYXktb25seS1jb3N0LWRvbGxhcjEwLW1vcmUtdGhhbi10aGUtb3JpZ2luYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X May Only Cost $10 More Than The Original,"The rumor about Nvidia giving the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti a refresh seems true. U.K. retailer Scan Computers (via VideoCardz) has listed Nvidia's unannounced GeForce RTX 3060 Ti with upgraded GDDR6X memory.

Nvidia launched the original GeForce RTX 3060 Ti in 2020 but the chipmaker would introduce a second variant earlier this year. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti leveraged the GA104 silicon whereas the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GA103 as its unofficial name implies used the GA103 silicon. It was a die-swap on Nvidia's part since the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GA103 retained the exact specifications as the vanilla model. However the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X flaunts a substantial upgrade in the memory subsystem.

The funny thing about the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X is that Nvidia U.K. doesn't list it on the company's website yet. Instead the chipmaker still lists the regular GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. Adding the GA104-based graphics card to your basket changes to the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X. Apparently Scan Computers is the retailer selling the new variant; however it's not on the U.K. store's website either. But the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X appears in stock and allows you to checkout.

*Specifications are unconfirmed.

Whether the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X utilizes the GA104 or GA103 silicon is unknown. The shopping basket shows the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X with a 1410 MHz base clock and 1670 MHz boost clock. The base clock is the same as the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti; however the boost clock is 5 MHz higher. It's not a big deal since the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X's FP32 performance still maxes out at 16.2 TFLOPs.

The memory quota between the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X remains unchanged at 8GB. Both models still conform to a 256-bit memory bus. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X features faster memory though. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti sports 14 Gbps GDDR6 while the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X has 19 Gbps GDDR6X. The extra firepower will push the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X's memory bandwidth to 608 GBps a massive 36% uplift over the normal version.

The GeForce RTX 3060 and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GA103 adhere to a 200W TDP but the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X model probably has a higher rating. GDDR6X consumes less power per transferred bit in comparison to GDDR6. Despite that total power consumption is higher on GDDR6X because it operates at a faster frequency.

Nvidia U.K. lists the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X for £369 which translates to $409. It's even cheaper than some of the custom models. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X only has a $10 higher price tag than the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti's $399 MSRP. It's good to see that the GDDR6X premium only raised the price by 3%.

It's funny to see Nvidia launch a third variant of the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti this late in the game. True Intel recently launched the Arc A770 but we've already seen that the Arc Alchemist graphics card doesn't pose a threat to the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. Although the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti received a fat memory upgrade it won't magically catch up to the GeForce RTX 3070 either because there's a 21% CUDA separation between the two and not even GDDR6X memory can close that performance gap.

As an appetizer a handful of new stories came out last week. NVIDIA's new RTX 4090 was mocked for its massive size Microsoft released a website about its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard and we exclusively reported that Microsoft will bring design elements from Windows 11 to the Android 12L update for Surface Duo.

When people said that the NVIDIA RTX 4090 would be one of the biggest pieces of tech this year they must have meant it literally. NVIDIA's latest and greatest graphics card made the news rounds this week due to the fact that it's bigger than an Xbox Series S.

Of course the RTX 4090 is significantly more powerful than the Xbox Series S but that fact didn't stop people from picking on the chunky GPU.

The large form factor of the RTX 4090 may require some people to choose different PC cases. Those that do fit the GPU into a system will have one of the best graphics cards on the market easily capable of handling 4K resolution at 100 FPS.

The only thing about the RTX 4090 bigger than its size is its price. The graphics card starts at $1600.

Microsoft's planned acquisition of Activision Blizard has faced some pushback since the agreement was first announced. The European Commission is currently looking at the deal and has a deadline of November 8 2022 to make a decision. Microsoft launched a dedicated website last week to argue why the tech giant purchasing Activision Blizzard is good for the gaming industry.

Earlier this year Microsoft announced an agreement to purchase Activision Blizard for $68.7 billion. Several major franchises will become part of Microsoft if the deal is approved including World of Warcraft Candy Crush and Call of Duty. Unsurprisingly Sony has been one of the biggest opponents of the deal.

Android 12L to feature Windows 11 design

(Image credit: Daniel Rubino)

Android 12L is a version of Android optimized for devices with large screens or multiple displays. That includes the Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2 which are set to receive the Android 12L update in the near future. Last week our senior editor Zac Bowden exclusively reported that Windows 11-inspired design elements will make their way to the Surface Duo line of products.

Blur effects fluid animations and notification boxes will all make the Surface Duo look more like an extension of a PC running Microsoft's latest operating system. The Surface Duo will also have a new pen menu that's similar to the one seen on Windows 11.

Enterprise customers will be able to extend their Duo to a monitor through a feature called ""Duo Connect."" The tool is somewhat similar to Continuum which was seen on Windows 10 Mobile though Duo Connect is powered by Windows 365. It's worth noting that Duo Connect may not ship on the same day as Android 12L.

Overwatch 2 rolls out

Overwatch 2 came out this week earning critical acclaim from several outlets. Our Overwatch 2 review gave the shooter a 4.5 out of 5 for its progression system smooth gameplay and shift to being free-to-play.

While the game has earned solid reviews the launch of Overwatch 2 hasn't been smooth. Blizzard had to take the game's servers down for maintenance several times this week.

We have a guide on Overwatch 2 known bugs launch issues and how to fix them that includes bug fixes and a schedule for server maintenance.

Ex-Windows chief gives a glimpse of early Windows 8

(Image credit: Hardcore Software)

Windows 11 may be all the rage these days but we recently saw a throwback to the early days of Windows 8. Former head of Windows Steven Sinofsky shared a video from the early days of Microsoft's controversial OS. The presentation was shown to Microsoft employees in 2010 to illustrate the concept of Windows 8 which later went on to ship in 2012.

There aren't any shocking elements shown off in the video especially to those that followed the development of Windows 8 back in the day. One tiny tidbit was the fact that the early concept of Windows 8 had a side panel that appeared somewhat similar to the Windows 11 Widgets panel.

Even though the Bradford football team had beaten Tremper eight consecutive times dating back to 2014 Zalokar the current Tremper head coach and former assistant to Tremper coaching legend Frank Matrise was actually the head coach the last time Tremper beat Bradford.

Interim head coach that is.

Zalokar was the interim head coach in 2014 when the Trojans won 21-14 in a game played at Bradford High School.

Fast forward to Friday night and Zalokar really wanted this one a Southeast Conference showdown with the Red Devils at the friendly confines of Ameche Field and his defense made sure coach would have a big smile on his face on his ride back home late Friday night.

Joey Stone intercepted a 4th-down-and-goal pass from Devin Wheaton to seal a dramatic 27-21 victory for Tremper in a back-and-forth instant classic.

Tremper improved to 3-5 and 2-4 in the SEC and holds a flicker of hope for a playoff berth if it can beat first-place Oak Creek Friday night.

Bradford dropped to 1-7 and 1-5 in conference.

“That last drive that was the epitome of the way this game went” Zalokar said after the game. “It was two sides fighting it out the whole way just clawing and scratching it was close they had the ball on about the 3-inch line.”

“You know what he definitely didn’t score but sometimes...we’re going into chess-level math about when to call a timeout. We called a timeout to preserve some time and in close games sometimes the ball’s gotta bounce your way. In that one specific instance the ball bounced our way we got lucky and I’m not going to complain about it.”

Red Devils break down on last drive Bradford had a first-and-goal inside the Tremper but a run fell short just inches from the goal before a huge penalty thwarted momentun.

On 3rd-and-1 from the 1 a false start pushed it back to the 6 then a reverse was immediately snuffed by a swarming Tremper defense.

That’s when Zalokar regrouped with a timeout.

The ensuing 4th-and-9 with around 40 seconds on the clock saw Wheaton attempt a quick slant over the middle to either Keany Parks or freshman receiver Brandon Walton but it seems Parks was knocked down by senior Tremper linebacker (no pass interference called) as the ball was in the air and Walton was too deep in the end zone.

Stone who was beaten on the play by Walton took advantage of the underthrow/broken route by Parks and leaped up and picked off the football to seal the victory.

Ballgame folks.

“It was a simple press coverage press cover zero we had guys going off the edge I was playing inside leverage I see him (Walton) run that slant I just jumped it when I saw the ball coming” Stone said.

“Bradford competed but we practiced hard all week and we knew we wanted this one. This was a big one. I give all credit to our coaches offense and defense.”

Tremper ran out the clock and improved to 3-5 overall with its second consecutive win.

Don’t call him William it’s JaydenAfter being down 21-14 Tremper rallied thanks to strong quarterback play by backup quarterback William Wright at the end of the first half and Jacob Schulte’s short touchdown run tied things at 21-21 at intermission.

Wright who goes by Jayden with his teammates had an impressive first varsity start under center completing 11-of-17 passes for 233 yards two touchdowns and one interception.

Wright benefitted from big plays by his receivers—an 86-yard touchdown catch by Jordan Parker and 57-yard score from Logan Archie—but what really stood out was Wright’s ability to hang in the pocket take big hits from the pass rush and still complete passes thanks to accurate timely throws.

“We call him Jayden I think that’s his middle name it was his first varsity start” Archie said. “We played magnificent. Our second-string quarterback coming in he played well.”

“Jayden played phenomenally” Zalokar added. “All year he’s been playing JV quarterback and gotten better and better all year. When his opportunity came he was ready. One thing in his favor is his personality. He’s stone-cold unflappable nothing fazes him. When he found out he had to play he was like ‘I gotcha coach don’t worry.’”

Wright replaced Mason Prozanski who injured his collarbone late in the Trojans’ 27-7 victory over Racine Park last Friday.

Wright hit Parker for a long score to give Tremper a 14-7 lead but Bradford quickly answered with two straight rushing scores to take a 21-14 lead.

The Red Devils had inside runs working all first half and they racked up 287 rushing yards for the game.

Parks and Childers each finished with 129 yards on the ground.

But Tremper clamped down in the second half.

Bradford thanks to several nice Parks runs and multiple first-down conversions through the air from Wheaton to Nolan Shiplett enjoyed a seven-minute drive all the way down inside the Tremper 20 toward the end of the third quarter but much like the entire second half could not finish.

Costly fake field goalOn fourth and long from the Tremper 16 the Red Devils appeared to line up for a 33-yard field to take a 24-21 lead but the holder got up for a fake scurried to his right and eventually just lofted a ball deep downfield.

Dez White was waiting for it at the Tremper 10 and his interception gave the Trojans life to start the final quarter.

After two first-down runs by White the offense broke down around midfield when Zalokar called a simple deep out to Archie.

Archie ran a route just shy of first-down yardage and caught the ball and when two Bradford defenders attempted a sandwich-like tackle they collided and fell down and all Archie could see was one defender left Colin Freitag.

The 6-foot-3 sophomore Archie juked Freitag toward the sideline and cut it back up breaking free and looking back at him before gliding down the field 40 more yards for the long touchdown before chest-bumping and celebrating with two teammates.

“I thought I was just gonna get a first down but when I looked up and I was still up I was just running...it was very exciting and it was one of my first touchdowns too. My first varsity touchdown” Archie added.

Wheaton showed plenty of grit and determination leading the Red Devils down the field on the next possession often finding Shiplett on third down and allowing Parks to break off a few nice runs and catch the ball out of the backfield.

But things would always break down in the end.

Bradford head coach Gazmend Osmani proved to have an effective game plan but he admitted it was tough to lose. He may have regretted the timing of the fake field goal too.

“The fake field goal was a miscommunication” Osmani said. “It’s a play we worked on all week and we liked the mismatch but it was just called at the wrong time.”

“The last play of the game was there their defense made a great play. This is tough because I feel we did very well up front on the line of scrimmage. Our lines played tough. We did not change too much offensively in the second half but the story of our season has been turnovers penalties and not taking advantage of our opportunity.”

Parker finished with 110 receiving yards on four catches and White led the Trojans with 74 yards on five carries.

Wheaton was held to 57 yards passing 42 going to Shiplett.

Bradford future bright Tremper thinking playoffsOsmani likes where his team is headed.

“We have a long way to go but I know when my kids buy into the weight room this offseason they’ll be ready to beat the teams we lost to this year” he added. “The future is bright on the North side and our kids will get after it this offseason because they know how special they can be.”

For Tremper it’s one more game at Oak Creek with a potential playoff berth on the line.

At 2-4 in the Southeast Zalokar knows a 4-3 is usually required to make the WIAA postseason but he believes a huge win over a solid team like the 6-2 Knights could leapfrog his guys into the playoffs.

“We’re trending in the right direction” Zalokar said. “One of our leaders Carson Nye told everyone he loves them right after halftime we love each other we are a family. We learned how to stop a fullback dive in the second half but credit to them. If something’s working why go away from it?”

“It was a really great game and I’m excited for our kids. If there’s open slots beating a really good team like Oak Creek boosts your tiebreaker. They’re a good team but we’ve been in every game this year because we’re good too. We just gotta play like it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9mY25ld3MvbmFtZS93aWxsaWFtLWdyaWVzZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY3NTA0MDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William Grieser Obituary (2022) - Wauseon OH - Fulton County Expositor and Swanton Enterprise,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9mY25ld3MvbmFtZS93aWxsaWFtLWdyaWVzZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY3NTA0MDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC8CF55A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9mY25ld3MvbmFtZS93aWxsaWFtLWdyaWVzZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY3NTA0MDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

The second step is to stop using the drug. The same steps apply to the world’s addiction to fossil fuels. The overwhelming majority of the world’s “climate doctors” have diagnosed our addiction but they are less certain about the prognosis.

But end-state fossil fuel addiction is a global catastrophe and even human extinction according to a new report by a research team from the UK’s Universities of Cambridge and Exeter.

The final prognosis depends on how rapidly and completely we end the addiction. But “there are ample reasons to suspect that climate change could result in a global catastrophe” the team concludes. “It’s time for the scientific community to grapple with the challenge of better understanding catastrophic climate change.”

That time has come because the still-powerful fossil energy sector does not acknowledge that it’s a drug dealer feeding the world’s addiction and despite promises to the contrary nations don’t seem anxious to kick the habit. Oil coal and gas producers aren’t eager either.

Research published in 2021 warned that to have a 50-50 chance to comply with the Paris goals 60 percent of oil and methane plus 90 percent of coal would have to remain in the ground. Instead eight of the biggest oil companies plan 200 expansion projects over the next three years according to Oil Change International and their carbon-cutting plans are grossly insufficient compared to the aspirations of the Paris climate accord.

But the world's largest banks have financed nearly $4.6 trillion in fossil energy projects since the adoption of the Paris agreement. The IEA expected the industry to make $200 billion in capital investments this year and to double its net earnings to a record $4 trillion.

As climate-action activists in the United States celebrated their Congress’s long-awaited approval of a major clean energy investment ($370 billion) oil and gas companies were busy building more than 4000 miles of new pipelines and preparing to build 17800 miles more.

The world’s transition to clean energy has been called the biggest new market opportunity in history but big oil companies have made only token investments in renewable fuels. A study cited by S&P Global found BP invested a little over 2 percent of its capital expenditures on renewable fuels between 2010 and 2018. Shell invested only 1.3 percent.

America’s oil and gas producers hold leases to drill on 40 million acres of public onshore and offshore lands but they want more. Congress couldn’t get the votes to pass the big clean-energy investment until the bill’s sponsors agreed to allow oil and gas production on another 62 million acres of federal property.

Analysts expected a record year for investment in clean energy but Fatih Briol executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) says it’s not enough. “A massive surge in investment to accelerate clean energy transitions is the only lasting solution” he says “and that calls for “a much faster increase.” Meantime two recent analyses cited by S&P Global concluded that current investments in clean energy are too low to achieve a net-zero-carbon energy economy by mid-century.

Rather than betting on carbon-free energy the fossil fuel sector is lobbying for policies and technologies that will allow it to keep in business even in a decarbonized world. Occidental Petroleum ExxonMobil Chevron and Shell have adopted variations of the popular net-zero carbon by 2050 goal according to the New York Times. As it’s presently conceived however the net-zero pledge invites greenwashing. It allows oil coal and gas companies to keep producing their traditional products by paying others to deal with carbon.

Climate capture and sequestration (CCS) is a technology still in the demonstration stage. It would allow power plants to burn fossil fuels by separating carbon dioxide from the plant’s flue gases compressing it and sending it to a burial site. CCS is widely considered indispensable to achieving the Paris accord’s goals. But objective analysis shows CCS makes no sense.

It requires bigger power plants parasitic energy losses demands for cooling water in a thirsty world new pipelines environmental damages associated with extraction methane leaks property rights controversies at sequestration sites and the need for CCS operations to stay above water by selling their captured gas for enhanced oil recovery. All of which undermines the presumed climate benefits of CCS. It will raise the consumer cost of electricity and will be unable to compete economically with power from solar and wind systems and other renewable resources.

The IEA’s Briol said earlier this year “If governments are serious about the climate crisis there can be no new investments in oil gas and coal” from that point forward. Instead the world should triple its energy efficiency and quadruple its investment in solar and wind power by 2030 he said.

The IEA says the path to a net-zero carbon economy ""calls for nothing less than a complete transformation of how we produce transport and consume energy."" There are no new oil and gas fields or coal mines on the path. Yet despite the enormous body of evidence about how bad for us they are the world apparently is not ready to give up fossil fuels.

There’s a point at which doctors tell us that addiction will kill us. The UK team says it’s time to think about that outcome in regard to fossil fuels because climate change has reached the stage where the extinction of humanity is plausible.

An onslaught of tragic scenarios like this can cause “apocalypse fatigue” in which we become numb to such predictions. It’s helpful to pause and imagine what a nice world it would be if we stopped using fossil fuels right now.

Chandigarh October 7

The proposed $20-billion Vedanta-Foxconn semiconductor fabrication facility at Ahmedabad hogged the limelight but not many would be aware that India’s dream of becoming global semiconductor leader was conceived way back in 1976 and it has a Punjab connection.

The goal Semiconductor Complex Limited’s goal was to eventually design and manufacture leading-edge circuits and electronics. Their vision was that the company could be the foundation for a native Indian electronics industry. What the probe report said The SCL employees’ union felt the fire could not be controlled due to mismanagement besides lack of initiative on the part of CISF unit

The Mohile panel headed by the retd Major General of the Defence Fire Research Institute blamed the mgmt for its failure to control the fire

The panel ruled out the possibility of any external sabotage and said the fire could be the result of an accident or short circuit

It found serious lapses in the firefighting arrangements at the complexes which were completely engulfed in fire. It also completely cleared the CISF

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi approved the formation of a semiconductor complex to drive India’s ambitions to manufacture semiconductors and the time was appropriate as Taiwan Israel Korea and even China were nowhere near being the semiconductor powerhouses that they have become.

Things got off to a promising start when Mohali was selected and a 100 per cent state-owned enterprise Semiconductor Complex Ltd (SCL) started production in 1984 to achieve India’s dream of becoming a global semiconductor manufacturer. SCL in the early 1980s had the advantage in that everyone else in the rest of the world was not too far ahead of them.

However the dream was shattered in a mysterious fire that broke out at the SCL in Mohali on February 7 1989 causing heavy losses to imported equipment and facilities estimated to be worth Rs 60 crore.

It was reported that officials of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) visited the SCL to assess the reasons behind the devastating fire. According to reports nothing conclusive came out regarding the cause of the fire.

MS Bitta the then president of the Punjab Youth Congress (I) had then demanded a judicial inquiry into the fire as a result of which Punjab had lost its prestigious unit.

The SCL employee’s union in a memorandum submitted to the ministry ruled out the possibility of any internal sabotage in the devastating fire that rocked the unit on night of February 7. The union however felt that the fire could not be controlled due to mismanagement besides lack of initiative on the part of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) unit.

After the incident the then Minister of State for Science & Technology KR Narayanan said the SCL would go back to production soon. Putting an end

to speculations he added that new technology would be introduced and assured the employees that there would be no retrenchment. However it took eight years and finally in 1997 it was restarted.

Trying to make up for lost ground the government even wanted to sell a part of SCL’s equity in 2000 but potential private investors could not come to an

agreement with the Indian government on terms according to experts. According to insiders the inordinate delays by the successive government stalled India’s dream.

Then finally in 2006 the company was restructured as a research & development centre within the Department of Space. SCL was renamed to “Semiconductor Lab”.

The US government on Friday released a broad set of technology export controls including what said to be the ""harshest"" ban on shipment of certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with US equipment to China further intensifying its so-called tech decoupling push and threatening to wreak havoc in the highly globalized chip supply chain.While the raft of measures is widely regarded as the biggest shift in US policy toward shipping technology to China since the 1990s Chinese market watchers and industry insiders said that the move further demonstrated that the US' multi-year crackdown campaign against China's tech sector has failed to achieve its goal of strangling China's tech rise.Moreover the move while aimed at further cutting China off from foreign chips will hurt multinationals from around the world including chip giants in the US which have benefited greatly from the vast Chinese market experts noted warning that disruptions posed by the US could stall development in the global chip industry for years.Commenting on the US' move Mao Ning a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that the US' new export controls will hinder international tech exchanges and economic cooperation and undermine the stability of global industrial and supply chains and the recovery of the world economy.The US' politicization and weaponization of technology economic and trade issues will not stop China's development but will only hurt the US itself the spokesperson added.The US' export control measures on Friday if effective could hobble China's chip manufacturing industry by forcing US and foreign companies that use US technology to cut off support for some of China's leading factories and chip designers according to Reuters.Also on Friday the US added China's top memory chipmaker YMTC and 30 other Chinese entities to a so-called ""unverified"" trade list.Since the Trump administration the US has never given up the suppression of China's chip industry but the escalating crackdown shows that the previous crackdown campaign has not worked Ma Jihua a veteran telecommunication industry analyst told the Global Times on Saturday.The Biden administration is well aware that the marginal effect of the chip crackdown gets smaller but it has no better options Ma added.""It's extremely hard for the Biden administration to cut global chip industrial and supply chains and exclude China with simply a handful of policies"" Fu Liang an independent tech analyst told the Global Times on Saturday.He said that the US' reckless move will hurt the interests of many countries involved and may wind up weakening its own leading position in the international technology venue and excluding itself from the global industrial and supply chains.""Out of considerations for their own interests tech companies across the world may not thoroughly follow the US policies"" Fu said noting that foreign suppliers are worried that the US' chip export restrictions may directly reduce their profits from the world's largest chip consumer and that China's swift domestic replacement will mean no more orders for them.One example cited by market watchers is US allies' shifting attitude toward the so-called Chip 4 alliance. While major chip producers like South Korea and Japan initially showed a cooperative attitude toward the move but they slowly shifted toward being cautious. There has been no major update on the alliance other than some meetings.""The resistance is getting bigger and their willingness is getting lower"" Ma said.As the Biden administration intensifies its tech decoupling push more and more US and global businesses will see increasing losses. For example after the US government prohibited US semiconductor firm Nvidia from selling sophisticated chips to China at the end of August the company estimated that it may lose approximately $400 million in potential sales to China in the third quarter and actively engaged with the US government in seeking exemptions.If the new measures are strictly implemented it could put as much as 30 percent of some US and global chip industry giants' total revenue at risk because China's revenue accounts for one-third of their total revenue Han Xiaomin general manager of Jiwei Insights in Beijing told the Global Times on Saturday.Global chip companies are already starting to consider ways to overcome the impact of the new US export controls.""SK Hynix is prepared to do its best to obtain a license from the US government and will work closely with the South Korean government to this end"" the company said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Saturday. ""We are also prepared to operate our manufacturing plants in China smoothly under the premise of abiding by international rules.""The US' move will also cause the most harm to its own R&D. ""As it costs vast financial and human resources investment in the R&D of cutting-edge chips US companies will unlikely see much returns without chip exports to China and could barely re-invest in future R&D"" said Gao Lingyun an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.The Semiconductor Industry Association which represents 99 percent of the US semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-US chip firms on Friday urged the US government to implement the rules in a targeted way - and in collaboration with international partners - to help level the playing field and mitigate unintended harm to US innovation.As for China the US' latest measures will unlikely cause any significant additional impact on the Chinese chip industry which has withstood the US' multi-year crackdown campaign and has actually seen great development in recent years experts noted.Several leading semiconductor companies in China including major producers and component suppliers reported strong results in the first half of 2022 despite the US' relentless crackdown against China's chip industry.One of these winners is China's largest chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) which reported better-than-expected revenue of $1.903 billion in the second quarter of this year up by 3.3 percent from the previous quarter and up 41.6 percent year-on-year. Bloomberg also reported in July that SMIC started shipping 7nm chips.The Chinese government also gives full play to China's socialist system's advantages which allows the nation to concentrate its strength and efforts on major things in the country's chip industry.""It is expected that the chip industry will see some breakthrough in one or two years"" Ma said.Gao Shiwang a director with the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products said that the latest US curb could only slow not strangle China's tech rise."

Two years after a failed attempt by former US president Donald Trump to force ByteDance to sell the app to American investors the administration of President Joe Biden is working on a modified plan to address what it perceives as national security threats from the app.

The development of TikTok remains under the influence directly and indirectly of multiple people and governments across several countries according to interviews with multiple employees and analysts by the South China Morning Post. As a result one of the most widely used apps in the world with more than 1 billion users has become caught up in a complicated web of technology money and power as its corporate parent seeks to maintain ownership of its prized jewel.

TikTok the most successful Chinese app outside the country where it was founded has been unable to allay concerns from the US and its allies about access to user data owing to an ambiguous corporate structure that suggests at least some top decisions are still being handled in Beijing.

“The current discussions appear to be a continuation of what we saw during the Trump administration although the fact that European countries are also expressing concern now is a newer development” said Emily Weinstein research fellow at Georgetown University’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology.

With 1 billion users TikTok is by far the most globally successful internet platform to come out of China. Tencent’s WeChat eclipses TikTok in user count but the vast majority of its users are concentrated in China.

Scrutiny is rising in other countries as well. In one extreme example India blocked TikTok from operating in the country along with many other Chinese apps after a 2020 border clash between the two countries illustrating the high stakes for ByteDance.

Concerns about TikTok have also been raised in Australia the European Union and the UK.

James Paterson the Australian opposition’s shadow minister of cybersecurity and countering foreign interference told local newspaper The Australian last month that “a ban should be on the table” if the government can’t solve national security concerns related to the app. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss said in July before she was elected that she would crack down on Chinese businesses like TikTok. Italy’s data protection authority said the app may have breached European Union rules by delivering targeted advertising without user consent.

Distrust of TikTok stems largely from fear about the Chinese government having access to data from the app through ByteDance. Chinese national security laws would require data to be handed over on request but ByteDance has said repeatedly that it has never given TikTok user data to Beijing.

Despite ByteDance’s assurances that US user data is stored outside China and therefore not subject to Chinese law a review by BuzzFeed News of leaked audio from internal meetings found that employees in China had repeatedly accessed such data.

There also remains a significant amount of ambiguity around who is responsible for what at TikTok which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. On the surface the top decision maker is CEO Chew Shou Zi a “Singaporean based in Singapore” as he referred to himself in a June letter to US lawmakers.

ByteDance chairman Liang Rubo has kept a low profile as the nominal leader of China’s most valuable unicorn. Liang has not made any public speeches or accepted any interviews since taking over corporate roles from Zhang Yiming the 39-year-old entrepreneur who started ByteDance in a Beijing flat in 2012.

Liang who was Zhang’s roommate at Nankai University is seen as a long-time aide to Zhang. In a video celebrating ByteDance’s seventh anniversary the two executives returned to the flat where they started the business.

While Zhang gave up his most high-profile company roles last year it is tacitly acknowledged among ByteDance executives and investors that Zhang maintains the final say on big decisions about TikTok including a change of ownership according to an early investor in ByteDance who declined to be named as the matter is private. “There’s a basic recognition of who’s the hired hand and who’s the real boss” the source said.

In his letter to US lawmakers Chew also acknowledged that ByteDance “plays a role in the hiring of key personnel at TikTok”.

The four other board members are from major investors in ByteDance: Bill Ford of General Atlantic Arthur Dantchik of Susquehanna International Group Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management and Neil Shen of Sequoia China. None have spoken publicly about ByteDance or TikTok.

The Chinese government and the ruling Communist Party also remain important players in decisions around TikTok. This became the subject of questions asked of TikTok chief operating officer Vanessa Pappas last month during a US Senate hearing . Pappas said the Chinese government does not influence TikTok’s behaviour or policies.

However a deal that would have seen TikTok’s US operations taken over by Oracle and Walmart in 2020 was scuttled by a regulation from Beijing that required government approval for the export of key technologies which included the algorithm that powers TikTok’s recommendation system.

TikTok is developed from the same core technology as Douyin its Chinese version. Chew said in his letter that both apps share “underlying basic technology building blocks” but that TikTok’s “business logic algorithm integration and deployment of systems” are “separate from Douyin”.

The Chinese government has also influenced ByteDance’s development in other ways. In 2018 the Chinese National Radio and Television Administration ordered the company to shut down Neihan Duanzi  an app for memes and funny videos that was targeted over “vulgar content”.

Zhang later published a self-criticism to “apologise and rethink”. The big lesson for ByteDance according to Zhang’s letter was that it had been “overemphasising the role of technology and failed to recognise that technology must be guided by the core values of socialism to promote positive energy”.

Under similar logic TikTok has been accused of censoring content according to Beijing’s political preferences which ByteDance denies.

Paul Triolo senior vice-president for consultancy Dentons Global Advisors-Albright Stonebridge Group’s China and technology policy lead said the Biden administration “is pursuing a methodical process of trying to find a solution to the issue” regarding the security of US consumer data.

TikTok has promised that US user data will be stored on servers owned by Austin Texas-based Oracle Corp and any access of TikTok data by ByteDance executives must go through a rigid internal process.

TikTok completed migrating data to Oracle’s servers this year. Backups are still stored on its own servers in Singapore and the US.

In 2020 TikTok’s global chief security officer Roland Cloutier addressed concerns over the company’s use of data centre space leased from China Unicom Americas. The Chinese telecoms company does not pose a security risk he said because it does not have unauthorised access to ByteDance’s servers. TikTok did not respond to inquiries about the status of the lease.

There has so far been no evidence that Chinese authorities have requested TikTok user data from ByteDance.

But there are Chinese laws and regulations that authorise the state to demand data from businesses. Douyin was one of the first batch of Chinese technology firms to hand its algorithm code over to the Cyberspace Administration of China this summer.

ByteDance has also reportedly looked into listing in Hong Kong although the company denies having such plans. An initial public offering outside mainland China would require authorisation from Beijing under a regulation that requires any company with the data of more than 1 million Chinese citizens to go through a cybersecurity review for an overseas listing.

Despite political headwinds the US remains TikTok’s largest market.

TikTok’s China links are “what people are going to continue to feel very uneasy about if [they do not have] really clear answers of who is really calling the shots” said Katie Harbath a non-resident senior fellow at the think tank Atlantic Council and former public policy director at Facebook.

What influences ByteDance and TikTok is “not just the Chinese government” but “other governments [in other countries] as well” she added.

TikTok’s efforts have so far failed to soothe concerns from American lawmakers and officials. Brendan Carr a member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has publicly called on both Apple and Google to delete TikTok from their app stores alleging the app is a “sophisticated surveillance tool”.

Despite TikTok now using servers from Oracle Harbath said that deal was unlikely to assuage concerns from Western countries.

“If TikTok starts getting to a place where they need to have their data localised in every country that’s actually quite hard and something the internet industry as a whole has really been trying to push back on because you’ll get a very fragmented internet versus a global one without borders” she said. “There’s still a lot of unanswered questions of exactly what role ByteDance still plays.”

In TikTok’s early days after it was created in 2017 ByteDance often sent a management team to local markets to help grow the platform. The business unit did not get its own CEO until 2020 when ByteDance hired Walt Disney’s Kevin Mayer for the role while pressure from the Trump administration was at its highest.

Mayer wound up staying just three months . Pappas acted as interim CEO until Chew took over.

“ByteDance is led by its technology-oriented founders and has likely gotten good advice on management and global expansion from its venture capital and private equity partners” said Albright’s Triolo.

Triolo said that if TikTok’s “US solution to the user data access issue can be resolved this may serve as a model for other markets and this would boost the global expansion prospects for ByteDance”.

ByteDance does not have any precedent to refer to as it is the first Chinese internet firm to find global success on this scale. Chew said in a March interview with Bloomberg that it was “challenging to build a global company” because “you need to be global and local at the same time”.

“The Chinese government’s monitoring of ByteDance and its business operations falls under the broader technology regulatory rectification campaign launched in 2021 in response to growing concerns about how large tech companies were engaging in behaviour that was damaging consumer interests” said Triolo.

“The Chinese government’s influence on the company is primarily regulatory and indirect.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jdXJyZW50LWFmZmFpcnMvcmFpbHdheXMtbWluaXN0cnktbGF1bmNoZXMtcHJvYmUtaW50by1vcmFjbGUtaW5kaWEtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLTEyMjEwMDgwMDg5N18xLmh0bWzSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2N1cnJlbnQtYWZmYWlycy9yYWlsd2F5cy1taW5pc3RyeS1sYXVuY2hlcy1wcm9iZS1pbnRvLW9yYWNsZS1pbmRpYS1jb3JydXB0aW9uLWNhc2UtMTIyMTAwODAwODk3XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Railways ministry launches probe into Oracle India corruption case,"The ministry of railways has launched an investigation into allegations of technology firm Oracle’s Indian arm creating slush funds to pay bribes worth approximately $400000 to officials of a railways public sector undertaking (PSU) in 2019.

One month after the BlackCat/ALPHV intrusion on Suffolk networks was discovered and the county was forced to stop it with measures as blunt as physically pulling network cables from their sockets only parts of the vast system of police court health department and real estate systems are back online some in limited form. Email and phone systems were widely affected and a source with knowledge of the situation said there are questions about whether years of email records can be restored.

“You have to make a determination on how to wall off your network” said Mike Balboni of the Manhattan consulting firm Redland Strategies which has been a computer security contractor to the county. He declined to discuss specifics of the attack.

Suffolk's main vendor for firewalls PaloAlto Networks also declined to discuss what happened.

""For this story we're not going to be able to assist with your questions but I appreciate you reaching out"" Kelly Kane PaloAlto senior manager for threat communications said in an email.

The Sept. 8 attack infiltrated departments across the sprawling county system from the Department of Health to the county clerk affecting the ability of the police to write tickets and the government to make payments to vendors and local governments and provide certain real estate records searches. The hackers are seeking an unspecified ""small reward"" for identifying vulnerabilities in the system which the county is not paying.

Industry protocol suggests that a massive forensic investigation is underway even as the county works to methodically restore critical parts of the network. The investigation is a crucial part of helping the county understand not only how the intruders breached the network but also to map the depth of the intrusion and hunt for lurking threats according to experts from academic institutions government and the computer industry. There are likely hundreds of ""compromised"" locations on the county's network they said.

Attack may have lasted 4 hours

Now experts and a public official said the county likely has begun the process of installing scores of new computer servers the core of its network while examining massive backup files to make sure they haven't been corrupted.

The fact that many services are not yet back online or have been moved to new domains is indicative of the depth of the intrusion experts said suggesting that there may not yet be a level of certainty that all known “back doors” for intrusion and corrupted files capable of relaunching an attack have been identified and removed.

It's still unclear how much time elapsed between the discovery of the ransomware and when computer staff started pulling network connections. One person familiar with the attack suggested it was around four hours.

Worse said one expert the intruders may have been lurking on the county's system far longer.

“The breach could have been going on for days maybe weeks. They could have been pulling data for a long time"" said Michael Nizich director of the Entrepreneurship and Technology Innovation Center and computer science faculty member at New York Institute of Technology.

Suffolk said it has begun a ""rolling restoration"" of its computer operations starting with a portion of the 911 emergency dispatch system followed by its property title search capabilities but officials offered no timeline for when all systems will be back online.

“The fact that it’s taking longer to get back up and running is indicative of another problem” Nizich said. “They might do all that work and the same thing might happen” a scenario the county is working to avoid.

“They could be vulnerable to a new group that knows the same vulnerabilities” he added.

Ransomware attacks cost organizations $4.54 million on average not including the ransom itself between March 2021 and March 2022 according to a 2022 annual IBM study examining data breaches among 550 large organizations in the public and private sectors. It took entities on average 326 days to identify and contain a ransomware threat according to the report.

Critical data may be for sale

Worse for Suffolk is the notion that the ransomware group or likely several groups may be offering critical data taken during the attack for sale to other bad actors threatening waves of cascading intrusions and impacts. A copy of the ransomware letter sent to Suffolk indicates the group changed the names of certain Suffolk data files and encrypted them meaning Suffolk could no longer access them unless it paid the demanded ransom and received a special “key” from the attackers to unlock them. The group already has selectively published some county records and experts said much worse could be in store.

""Another layer we’ve seen particularly with ransomware is that attackers don't just stop at system level with encryption and extortion but in almost every case they exfiltrate data off the network"" said TJ Sayers cyberthreat intelligence manager at the Center for Internet Security a multistate information sharing and analysis nonprofit. ""They want to sell it to make extra cash and they try to double extort you. … Now you're under the threat that all property and patient information legal criminal records even will get leaked to the public.""

BlackCat/ALPHV has gained notoriety by not only locking up data but destroying it as well putting a high reliance on Suffolk’s backups to rebuild.

“There is a heavy fog about the attacks of the Black Cat group and the reason for this is the profile of the victims” Ido Cohen founder of DarkFeed which tracks ransomware intrusions said in an email. “In the last month this group [reported] that they managed to encrypt and steal information of very sensitive companies related to the military and government sectors.”

The implications aren’t lost on firms that closely monitor county government. On Wednesday after Newsday sent a series of questions to Fitch Ratings concerning implications of the attack the Wall Street firm published a statement noting that while Suffolk believes costs tied to the attack could be absorbed in its current operating budget “More significant costs could weaken the county’s recently improved liquidity and reserve positions.”

“The breach of confidential information could also trigger legal and political risks regarding data privacy and confidentiality” Fitch senior director Shannon McCue wrote.

Suffolk spokeswoman Marykate Guilfoyle said the county ""believes it is well positioned to absorb any costs associated with this cyber intrusion. Lost revenues remain minimal and as part of the restoration process the county will be implementing several new security measures.""

New York State is said to be absorbing part of the costs including new work stations for title searches that recently went online according to a source with knowledge of the situation. Gov. Kathy Hochul's office didn't respond to questions about the help.

Guilfoyle said with the county's continuity plan ""Additional services continue to be brought back online. The county’s team of cybersecurity experts is continuing their assessment to test and verify all systems.""

Experts say the county appears to have taken the approach of replacing vital computer servers — potentially hundreds of them — and slowly relaunching thoroughly vetted platforms and data as soon as it can be assured it’s safe.

Costs can add up

The process is exhaustive and time-consuming and “just so expensive” Nizich said. “It’s going to cost us a fortune.” Teams of tech consultants alone rack up costs quickly often working overtime and overnight. Pay can top $500 an hour he said.

“The safe bet is to replace the entire system” said Victor Congionti chief executive of Proven Data a Manhattan-based computer security firm that helps companies recover files and in some cases negotiate and pay ransom. Restoring a network as vast as Suffolk’s is a “pretty daunting task” he said.

For affected systems it’s “essentially starting from scratch. Do they have backups that are older so they at least have some data? They’d have to reimport all that data” after careful scrubbing to make sure it isn’t compromised.

“That’s why the majority of companies opt to pay the ransom just to get back up and running as soon as possible” Congionti said “especially if that data is not replaceable.”

For that reason questions about how well protected the Suffolk systems were at the time of the attack are certain to be raised anew.

For example the Suffolk County Budget Review Office's 2022 report reviewing the proposed capital budget for 2023 noted that $1277579 out of a total of $2707000 that had been appropriated for the IT Department — to acquire equipment and system upgrades for a disaster recovery program — remained unspent. The report did not offer an explanation why.

Also earlier this year the county clerk’s office was repeatedly rebuffed in its attempts to upgrade its computer system according to minutes of the county legislature’s Ways & Means Committee which tabled the request several times.

Legis. Bridget Fleming (D-Noyack) was among those who advocated for approval.

“We can’t be vigilant enough about bad actors who want to jeopardize the work of government and I felt the clerk’s request to upgrade her system was critically important” said Fleming a candidate for the House of Representatives. “I have been asking questions about security around computer systems for some time.”

Fleming a former federal prosecutor said the county is now “doing the careful job of migrating people back to a clean system to ensure they won’t be affected” while her staff is being asked to “add back in profiles one by one into a system that’s new so it’s cleaned and being scanned regularly.”

“It’s important to exercise caution as we get things moving again” she said.

While the pair of bugs won't top the list of security flaws Beijing-backed spies hope to exploit to steal government secrets or wreak havoc on high-value targets the vulnerabilities could provide some mildly disruptive entertainment for say an annoying next-door neighbor looking for some spooky-month hi-jinx.

Jonathan Knudsen head of global research at Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center led a team that discovered the vulnerabilities by fuzzing Ikea's Tradfri bulbs and their gateway via Zigbee Light Link the wireless protocol the devices use to communicate and receive commands.

In a couple write-ups about the bugs the researchers described how CVE-2022-39064 the vulnerability in the Tradfri smart bulbs could be exploited by sending a single malformed Zigbee frame over the air that makes the light blink. Resending the frame multiple times forces the bulb to perform a factory reset which erases its configuration and other information such as brightness level.

""After this attack all lights are on with full brightness and a user cannot control the bulbs with either the Ikea Home Smart app or the Tradfri remote control"" the team noted.

This bug received a CVSS severity score of 7.1 out of 10 and it affects all versions of the lightbulb. There's also no full fix available from Ikea and because the malformed Zigbee frame is an unauthenticated broadcast message all vulnerable devices within radio range are affected.

""To recover from this attack a user could add each bulb manually back to the network"" according to the alert. ""However an attacker could reproduce the attack at any time.""

CVE-2022-39064 is related to a second vulnerability CVE-2022-39065 that affects the Ikea Tradfri smart lighting gateway which controls the lights. Similar to the bulb bug a malformed Zigbee frame renders the gateway unresponsive so that it can't control the connected lights and other devices via the Ikea Home Smart app.

However the lighting gateway vulnerability which earned a 6.5 CVSS rating does have a fix: upgrading the gateway software to version 1.19.26 or later. Synopsys disclosed both bugs to Ikea in June 2021 and four months later the mega retailer confirmed it would fix them. In February this year it did release a fix for the lighting gateway flaw and in June it issued a partial fix for the bulb.

When asked about the vulnerabilities an Ikea spokesperson told The Register: ""We continue our work to improve the safety and functionality of our smart devices.""

""It is not currently possible to gain access to sensitive information inside Tradfri Gateway or other Ikea smart devices"" the spokesperon continued. ""Most importantly the identified issue is not jeopardizing the safety of our customers. The issue can be replicated in other already known ways due to the design of the Zigbee protocol.""

While the blinking and lost connection with the gateway device are ""a nuisance"" by themselves they ""don't pose any serious risks such as safety concerns or loss of sensitive information"" Knudsen admitted in an email to The Register.

Not just fun and games

But there's a catch. ""A deeper analysis of exploitability could reveal a chance for an attacker to take control of a bulb or a gateway which would pose a more serious risk"" he added.

""We haven't performed (and won't perform) this deeper analysis; our interest is improving the software ecosystem by working with vendors to fix security vulnerabilities.""

There's also the potential issue that other smart home devices that use the same wireless protocol could be vulnerable and we're told fuzzing may uncover similar bugs across other product lines.

Knudsen suggests that manufactures test their devices earlier in the development phase. ""Organizations that build such devices should be making security part of every phase of software development including testing such as static analysis software composition analysis fuzzing and more"" he said.

This is especially true when as with Ikea lights it's relatively cheap and easy to pull off an annoying albeit not dangerous cyberattack he warned.

""An attacker with low-cost hardware (a laptop and a $25 radio device) can exploit this vulnerability with no prior knowledge of a victim"" Knudsen said. ""Furthermore the attack can be launched from a distance typically 10 meters to 100 meters.""

It's also important to remember that flickering lights aren't necessarily an indication of a cyberattack. There's also the possibility that someone trapped in the Upside Down is desperately trying to communicate. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9idXNpbmVzcy9waW5uYWNsZS1oZWFsdGgtaGFjay1zZW5zaXRpdmUtZmlsZXMtcG9zdGVkLXRvLXRoZS1kYXJrLXdlYi1pbmNsdWRlLWNvbmZpZGVudGlhbC1yZXBvcnQvNkZCVE9HTUpBTlFCU0YyUUFVRTRaVlBIVEUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pinnacle Health hack: Sensitive files posted to the dark web,"Sensitive files posted to the dark web Auckland’s new mayor gets to work and police on the scene in Wattle Downs in the latest NZ Herald headlines. Video / NZ Herald

Sensitive patient files and high-level data stolen in a cyber attack on a major primary health provider have been posted to the dark web by a ransomware group with Russian links the Herald can reveal.

In a statement last night Pinnacle Midlands Health Network — which operates dozens of North Island GP practices — confirmed the upload of stolen material to the net following a ""cyber incident"" last week.

While the number of affected patients has not been made public initial reports suggested hackers may have had access to as many as 450000 people's information.

Justin Butcher CEO of Pinnacle Incorporated told the Herald information illegally obtained was uploaded to the internet by ""malicious actors"".

The information and data related to past and present patients and customers of the Pinnacle group in the Waikato Lakes Taranaki and Tairawhiti districts. It also includes Primary Health Care Ltd (PHCL) practices from across Taranaki Rotorua Taupō-Tūrangi Thames-Coromandel and Waikato.

The information in the breach includes high-level data related to the use of hospital services claiming information related to services that Pinnacle provides and information sent to practices around immunisation and screening status of individual patients.

""Over the past 24 hours we were notified by our security experts that the data taken from our IT platform had been released by malicious actors"" Butcher confirmed.

""We acknowledge that this will be concerning to our patients and their whānau and we are taking this seriously our immediate focus is on supporting people who may have been impacted and working with the authorities to ensure we are doing everything we need to be.""

Pinnacle chief executive Justin Butcher said investigations were still under way but he believed attackers accessed information that could include commercial and personal details. Photo / Supplied

While Pinnacle does not hold GP notes and consultation records Butcher said the company ""now have a much clearer understanding of the breadth of stolen data"".

""This is extremely unfortunate and we are gutted as this impacts our whānau also. Cyber incidents like this are a constant threat and while they are the doing of malicious actors we feel for everyone who may have been affected.""

Pinnacle has been in contact with police and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Police would not comment yesterday.

Sources have told the Herald that a ransomware gang called ALPHV also known as Black Cat published a patient assessment marked ""confidential"" from a clinic in the Pinnacle group.

It also published a financial memo about budget goals a spreadsheet and a scan of a passport which appeared to be taken from Pinnacle's system among other files.

The Herald did not access Pinnacle files posted online by ALPHV but was shown screen grabs by a source in the cybersecurity industry.

""Like other ransomware operations ALPHV uses the threat of releasing data as additional leverage to extort payment"" Brett Callow a threat analyst with NZ-based cybersecurity firm Emisoft told the Herald.

""Healthcare sectors the world over have been increasingly targeted by for-profit cybercriminals in recent years.""

Groups like ALPHV often offer a ""taster"" of data on the dark web either to pressure a victim into paying a cyber-ransom or in some cases to solicit bids for data.

Offshore there have been cases of hackers trying to blackmail individual patients as well as to extort a payment from a healthcare provider.

ALPHV hit headlines in August for its attacks on energy companies and has pioneered searchable online databases of stolen data as a method of turning the screws on victims.

Unit 42 a division of Nasdaq-listed cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks whose board includes former Prime Minister Sir John Key has linked ALPHV members to Russia saying the group communicates to its members or affiliates in the Russian language and is known to operate on Russian cybercrime forums.

In May GCSB director-general Andrew Hampton warned New Zealand could be targeted by pro-Putin hackers.

If the first leak gets no response it is typically followed by more sensitive data being spilled online.

The information is offered to cybercriminals in the know. The Pinnacle files were posted to the dark web which is not searchable by Google or even accessible via a regular web browser. Special software is required.

On October 4 Pinnacle which runs a network of 87 GP practices said a ""cyber incident"" affected some IT services at offices and practices in Taranaki Rotorua Taupō-Tūrangi Thames-Coromandel and Waikato.

The breach took place on September 28.

At an October 4 press conference Pinnacle would not say whether it was negotiating with the hackers.

Butcher then said he believed the stolen information could include commercial and personal details.

Later the same day he told RNZ's Checkpoint the hacked system did not contain clinical notes.

The patient file posted by ALPHV is labelled ""Confidential neuropsychological report"".

It is from a provider outside the Pinnacle group and details assessments related to a person's ACC claim.

It was for a patient in the Waikato and part of a collection of files ALPHV said were from Pinnacle.

Cybersecurity expert Alastair Millar from Aura Information Security told RNZ the potential for identity theft was a worry for the people affected but Pinnacle had been open about it and was pointing people towards support service ID Care and tools available to try protect their identity.

But Millar said it was possible the hackers could be seeking a large financial sum in exchange or to sell the data on the dark web as was done in a hack on Waikato District Health Board last year.

With people's NHI number and contact information hackers could obtain credit cards take out loans or buy gift cards he said.

Police advise against paying cyber ransoms.

They say there is no guarantee stolen data will be destroyed or returned (or frozen systems unlocked) and that payments both fund and incentivise such crimes.

However in New Zealand it is not illegal to pay a cyber-ransom.

The Government says taking such a step would criminalise victims.

Pinnacle is also working with the Ministry of Justice-backed ID Care which offers assistance to those worried they have been the victim of identity theft and can walk people through the process of freezing credit records Butcher said.

ID Care has set up a page dedicated to the Pinnacle cyber breach.

The weekend gross was $17.5M in 61 markets for a $40M offshore cume and $89.9M global to date.

The overseas increase is quite literally gobsmacking — even this year’s mega-holder Top Gun: Maverick also from Paramount eased (though very slightly) in its sophomore frame. We’re hearing word of mouth is propelling this pic not a particular holiday/weather scenario.

The only new opening market this frame was Korea where Smile debuted at No. 5 with $335K at 355K locations. In Mexico the second session was good for $2M a 26% increase on opening at No. 1 for a local cume is $4.2M.

The UK likewise grossed $2M in the sophomore frame; up 25% from the opening and at No. 1. Local cume is $5.4M.

Germany is perhaps the biggest standout doubling the first weekend. Running total there is $3.4M.

Other markets smiling on Smile include France ($3.2M cume/+8% from last weekend); Australia ($2.3M cume/+43%) and Spain ($2.2M/+51%).

Elsewhere and as reported earlier Universal/Working Title’s Ticket to Paradise had a strong fifth frame with $10.6M. It is currently tracking ahead of The Lost City House of Gucci and Last Christmas and has an offshore cume of $60.6M before domestic opens on October 21.

France opened this weekend with $1M. Mexico too above comps. Italy was a clear No. 1 at $800K. Hungary delivered the market’s best opening for any film starring Roberts or Clooney with a No.1 start of $200K.

In holds the UK has grossed $7.5M Germany is at the same cume and Australia has surpassed the lifetime of Last Christmas and House of Gucci with $8.6M through Sunday.

In other news New Line/Warner Bros’ Don’t Worry Darling conjured $6.1M in 66 markets this session. It had a 45% drop in holdovers and saw a No. 1 $2.2M debut in Australia (including previews).

Meanwhile TriStar Pictures/eOne’s The Woman King expanded its overseas rollout this session with $5.4M. The international cume to date is $10M with global at $64.1M.

In December of 2020 Roberts’ family home in Lexington Kentucky was targeted with aggressive gunfire. While sleeping near his mother and younger brother five-year-old Malakai was shot in the head. The bullet missed his brain by two centimetres leaving him permanently blind and destroying his senses of smell and taste.

Drawing from his personal experiences Roberts’ book Adventures With Malakai will be about overcoming adversity. The book was debuted at a YMCA in the child’s home state on Wednesday (October 5) where he was joined by Master P.

In an interview with WLKY News (via Billboard) the rapper said: “This book is going to be special because Malakai is special. I mean this kid has never given up with all the adversity he went through so this book is gonna be special. And it’s all about kids so we’re gonna be able to teach kids and help Malakai keep his adventures going.

“It’s going to be incredible for the kids. I mean ‘cause we want kids to know how to overcome adversity and by him losing his eyesight with the tragedies he’s been through this has been incredible to be able to write a book with Malakai.”

A release date for Adventures With Malakai is yet to be revealed however Master P has confirmed that it’ll be available in the early months of 2023.

“An AUP notice recently went out in error that included incorrect information. PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy. Our teams are working to correct our policy pages. We’re sorry for the confusion this has caused” a spokesperson told National Review in a written statement.

The course reversal comes after the policy changes had started to attract media scrutiny as well as criticism on Twitter. Former PayPal president David Marcus even blasted the company over the implication that it could seize customers’ money for finding their views objectionable.

“It’s hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to. But @PayPal’s new AUP goes against everything I believe in” the cryptocurrency entrepreneur said Saturday. “A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with. Insanity.”

Tech titan Elon Musk replied “Agreed” in a comment that got thousands of likes.



The policy update had appeared to authorize the company to pull a significant sum of money from the accounts of users who spread “misinformation” among other newly listed offenses.

The new conditions were scheduled to be added to the restricted activity section of the PayPal User agreement effective November 3 the Daily Wire first reported. Changes included prohibitions on “the sending posting or publication of any messages content or materials” that “promote misinformation.” While the prior policy already forbade “hate” “intolerance” and discrimination the new one would have explicitly applied to specific “protected groups” and “individuals or groups based on protected characteristics.” Identities under this umbrella included race religion gender or gender identity and sexual orientation.

The firm’s current rulebook doesn’t list these terms. It’s unclear whether PayPal will also pull back these specific prohibitions on “discriminatory” language or if it is only scrubbing the “misinformation” clause.

Breaking the rule against misinformation and hate speech “may subject you to damages including liquidated damages of $2500.00 U.S. dollars per violation which may be debited directly from your PayPal account” the company had originally warned. In a user agreement account holders accept and attest that the penalty is “presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal’s actual damages” due to the expense the firm incurs by accounting for the violations as well as damage to its reputation.



PayPal was founded by Peter Thiel who has invested in a number of GOP rising stars and “conservative” business ventures. Ebay acquired the company in 2002 and has managed it since. In recent years PayPal has been known to censor or deplatform organizations or individuals for certain political commentary particularly that which is considered right-wing.

It recently banned Gays Against Groomers a group composed of LGBT-identifying people that claims to call attention to the sexualization and medicalization of children via gender ideology and the transgender movement. Minutes later PayPal’s subsidiary Venmo reportedly barred the organization from access. Evolutionary biologist Colin Wright and journalist Ian Miles Cheong who regularly expose the dangers of transgenderism for minors have also been removed.

According to the updated PayPal user agreement the company states that each violation could result in ""liquidated damages of $2500.00"" per violation which would be withdrawn directly from their account.

One of the violations listed according to the agreement is that users ""may not"" use PayPal to promote misinformation.

The new policy which was put out in ""error"" comes after Gays Against Groomers said on Sept. 20 that it had been banned from both PayPal and Venmo.

Venmo is owned by PayPal.

Gays Against Groomers Founder Jaimee Mitchell said on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that the company didn't inform them what it did to violate its user agreement.

At least two of the company’s former leaders — including founder Elon Musk — had taken the proposal from the famously woke corporation seriously and pushed back on Twitter.

“It’s hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to” tweeted former company president David Marcus. “PayPal ’s new AUP goes against everything I believe in. A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with. Insanity.”

“Agreed” Musk commented in the replies.

Its interest in semi-trucks that do not burn fossil fuels goes as far back as 2015. But things took a serious turn in 2017 when the food and beverage company was confirmed as one of the first customers of the Tesla Semi. Now PepsiCo let everyone know that it will test a hydrogen-powered semi-truck through a partnership with an Australian company. Here’s what’s going on.

HP

PepsiCo recently learned that Tesla will finally deliver the all-electric Semi that’s being touted as the next big thing for freight shipping. The first units will reach the company in December and both parties anticipate a reduction in operational costs. Moreover this would help PepsiCo with its green ambitions.But going on the battery-electric route isn’t the only thing PepsiCo intends on doing for its global fleet of vehicles. Given that it is the largest food and beverage company in North America and the second-largest in the world it must take the necessary steps to ensure that its global operations will continue to have a lowering impact on the environment.PepsiCo signed an agreement with Pure Hydrogen to test a semi-truck that uses fuel-cell technology. The test is scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2023 according to PV Magazine . The vehicle will be used at a PepsiCo manufacturing base in Brisbane.Pure Hydrogen will provide PepsiCo with the zero-emission semi for AUD 10500 (USD 6710) per month and in exchange Pure will make sure hydrogen refueling repair and maintenance will all be done accordingly.“This trial will further showcase the potential of Australia ’s hydrogen energy markets – particularly for commercial trucking which currently relies heavily on the use of diesel fuel” said PepsiCo’s Sustainability Manager for Australia and New Zealand.If the trial will be successful then PepsiCo might order fuel-cell semi-trucks in 2024 and 2025.It’s not clear what semi-truck will be used for this trial. The only image supplied by Pure Hydrogen is a virtual rendering. However what is known is that the Australian company will convert an existing semi-truck to run on fuel-cell technology. The power unit is expected to develop around 850(862 PS).Fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) do not need recharging as long as hydrogen is found in the pressurized tank. Hydrogen is combined with oxygen from the air in the fuel cell stack. After a chemical reaction electricity is produced. This powers the motor and the only emission is water.Shipping goods is one of the transport activities that have a major contribution to air pollution. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) poor air quality leads to many health issues for humans enhances global warming and creates smog.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZm9vZC9uZXctY2hlZi1yZXNpZGVuY3ktYnJpbmdzLWJsYWNrLXJlc3RhdXJhdGV1cnMtdG8tdGhlLXN0cmlwLTI2NTQwNjMv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9mb29kL25ldy1jaGVmLXJlc2lkZW5jeS1icmluZ3MtYmxhY2stcmVzdGF1cmF0ZXVycy10by10aGUtc3RyaXAtMjY1NDA2My9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New chef ‘residency’ brings Black restaurateurs to the Strip,"PepsiCo Inc.’s initiative Pepsi Dig In is bringing its first-ever Restaurant Royalty Residency program to Las Vegas in partnership with MGM Resorts International.

A new type of residency program on the Strip launched to elevate Black restaurateurs and chefs.

PepsiCo Inc.’s initiative Pepsi Dig In is bringing its first-ever Restaurant Royalty Residency program to Las Vegas in partnership with MGM Resorts International. The residency aims to bring national awareness to the next generation of Black chefs and restaurateurs.

Five restaurants were selected to bring signature dishes from their restaurants for a four-week limited edition menu at Luxor’s Public House and Mandalay Bay’s Libertine Social.

The program starts on Sunday with an offering from James Beard Award-winning Chef JJ Johnson who will introduce braised oxtails with jollof rice from his New York fast-casual dining concept FIELDTRIP.

“Bringing a selective group of restaurants to Las Vegas — it’s the kind of the place when you’re a chef that they say you made it” Johnson said. “Vegas and MGM has elevated hundreds of chefs in their careers to get to a level that they couldn’t have gotten to on their own. Hopefully one of these restaurants one day might have a restaurant in one of the hotels on the Strip.”

Scott Finlow chief marketing officer at PepsiCo Global Foodservice said Pepsi Dig In started in 2021 to help Black-owned businesses have access to capital technology growth strategies and more.

“All small restaurants suffered due to the pandemic and many struggled to get access to government relief grants and adapt to the changes they needed to grow like digital delivery” Finlow said in an email. “For Black-owned restaurants this was another headwind on top of the systemic barriers they’re already facing.”

The Dig In program attempts to address those issues by supporting access to new technology in point-of-sale and inventory systems website development coaching in social media and SEO tools and more. It also created a $10 million grant through the PepsiCo Foundation and National Urban League to establish a business accelerator program.

Restaurants chosen for the residency were nominated online and nominations are still being accepted.

“The Black community has been entrepreneurs for years” Johnson said. “We just haven’t had the capital to grow our businesses or to make it become something sustainable. Most of it is just ‘Let’s try to earn money put food on the table for the kids and put a roof over our head.’ Now with these last few years Pepsi has been bridging the gap.”

The health ministry is urging the public to get the shots to stem a potential surge of infections during the year-end holidays and to ensure that through widespread vaccination it will not coincide with the seasonal flu.

The vaccine for children aged 6 months to 4 years also to be provided by Pfizer is the first COVID-19 shot available in Japan for that age group. It targets the original strain discovered in Wuhan China in 2019.

The bivalent vaccine is available next Thursday for people aged 12 and over who have received two previous shots. The panel will discuss the interval between vaccinations on Oct. 19. However another person familiar with the matter has said that it may be shortened to three months from the current five months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvOTY3MzE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latest Version of ChemAIRS an AI platform by Chemical.AI to boost successful rate in synthesis route design,"Chemical.AI has released a new version of ChemAIRS on Sep.30th. ChemAIRS is an artificial intelligence empowered chemical synthesis route design system based on AI+ big data trained from chemists to support chemists’ daily research works. There are four modules: retrosynthesis SA score forward synthetic and process chemistry. With enhanced algorithm the overall performance of ChemAIRS’ has been greatly improved and the key takeaways are:

ChemAIRS can perform like a senior experienced chemist. ChemAIRS can do route searching more efficient and route prediction more feasible. ChemAIRS can work together with chemists with “Manual Search” function. ChemAIRS can integrate with internal ELN and BB data and show in the routes. A dry lab and wet lab fully integrated system with a user-friendly interface. A free trial is on the air.

Details are stated in the following aspects:

By optimizing the stereochemistry filter model ChemAIRS can identify reactions that present a risk of introducing chirality. Further optimization of chiral molecular route prediction has been reflected in the prediction of the synthetic route for Pfizer's new drug Paxlovid where the algorithm gives a route that is almost same as the chemist's design. The new ""Low-Risk"" mode which uses a stricter filter and a new algorithm can detect the potential regioselectivity issues with an enhanced aromatic nucleophilic and electrophilic reaction model. The new ""Reaction Analysis"" mode can provide additional references based on reaction similarity chemoselectivity and potential side reactions. Adding functional group conversion module makes route search more efficient. By optimizing “Protection steps/Protecting groups” ChemAIRS can recognize protection bases in the route and users can easily change specific functional groups for the protecting groups. The compatibility filter has been optimized to improve feasibility. The performance of single-step reaction prediction and condition optimization module has been improved in this version. Based on “Manual Search” function ChemAIRS shortens the intermediates route generation time by more than half eliminates long waiting times and enables chemists to design routes independently and quickly. With the collaboration of experienced algorithms and development teams ChemAIRS has significantly improved the front-end user experience by improving the clarity of the interface chemistry increasing the loading response speed by 120% and upgrading the drawing board. The ChemAIRS system integrates local deployment with ELN data and implements a complete ELN data import solution by importing massive ELN simulation data into internal validation testing as well as multiple validations by domestic and international customers and the success rate of ELN response retrieval can reach over 99%. According to the requirements of different project data permission control scenarios the local deployment of ELN databases with PBAC (Project Based Access Control) import technology can dynamically configure access rights to ELN data. Equipped with the ChemAI Lab built by Chemical.AI ChemAIRS can integrate the intermediate “Quotation Request” module and users only need to fill in the information online the system will give a professional synthesis feasibility reply within 24 hours users will no longer need to brainstorm for intermediate synthesis ChemAIRS will provide it. ChemAIRS has added the function of editing reaction conditions increasing the interactivity between AI and chemists. And the modified reaction conditions can be saved by chemists’ experience judgments with one click.

Back in September XuanZhu BioPharm and Chemical.AI has announced collaboration focusing on cancer metabolism digestion and other fields jointly to develop new drugs with proprietary intellectual property rights. The CEO of Shangdong Xuanzhu a subsidiary of Xuanzhu Biopharma—Dr. Jiakui Li has commented: “the partnership with Chemical.AI could help to speed up drug discovery process. With ChemAIRS it provides efficient and feasible routes to improve chemical synthesis efficiency.” https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/964504

Prior to XuanZhu BioPharm Chemical.ai also works with Pharmas like Livzon Medicine top pharma in China top leading pharma in Europe and in the United States as well. In addition several integration efforts have been done with Scilligence NovAlix Chemaxon.

Provincial officials say shipments of Pfizer’s new COVID-19 vaccine targeting the Omicron variant are expected in British Columbia soon after Health Canada approved the shot.

A joint statement from B.C.’s provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix says the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine will be available to people aged 12 and older from next week.

They say B.C. is set to receive 1.7 million doses of the newly approved shot which will be available in health authority clinics and pharmacies across the province.

Approved last month Moderna’s equivalent bivalent shot is already available to those aged 18 and older with B.C. set to receive 1.4 million of 10.5 million doses in Canada.

The health officials say both bivalent vaccines induce a “stronger more robust immune response and provide better protection against the Omicron variant and subvariants.”

They say their recommendation that people get either bivalent vaccine as their fall COVID-19 booster is in line with that of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization.

The province notes influenza vaccines will be available starting next Tuesday.",,,

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

The plan set to be carried out by the end of this year would have the agency focus more on regulating unfair practices they said.

Currently the KFTc consists of a committee and a secretariat. The committee is the decision-making body that has nine commissioners who make decisions on competition and consumer protection issues. The secretariat is a working body in charge of drafting market competition policies and also investigating antitrust issues.

Han Ki-jeong chairman of FTC told lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing session on Friday that the reform is about separating the investigative and policy drafting roles within the secretariat while keeping the division physically unchanged.

Such workload division however is expected to speed up investigations into businesses’ criminal allegations according to the KFTC.

“Sometimes investigations are put aside when a policy-related issue pops up. Also when investigating antitrust issues we must follow established rules but having officers working on the investigation also establishing those rules could break the check-and-balance system” an KFTC official explained.

The KFTC is currently studying the EU model of managing its regulatory body which has separate departments for policy drafting and investigation for different industries. It is also looking into the Japanese and Singaporean models that have the secretariat as a separate organization.

Brian Fallon and Gaslight Anthem played a hometown show Saturday Oct 9 at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel wrapping up a reunion tour with a steady and spirited set of career-spanning songs.

“I like other places but there's no place like here” said Fallon adding that his parents took him to the venue to see Depeche Mode for his first concert. “I was trying to go see Motley Crue but they got canceled because the album sucked with the new singer so that wasn't happening.”

The Gaslight Anthem show was happening — with all four original members. The band formed in New Brunswick in the late '90s returned to “full-time status” in the spring after an eight-year hiatus. They played across the U.S. and in Europe since getting back together at a surprise show at Crossroads in Garwood.

On Saturday the first part of the band's hour and 45 minute set eschewed the upbeat rockers for the group's mid-tempo moody songs. It was a brisk night and a spark was initially absent.

Fallon wearing a bomber jacket with a fur collar then paused to reflect on the moment in front of approximately 12000 fans.

“I was up there in row 472 and I said to myself 'I can get there' and now look — thank you very much!” Fallon said. The show was the band's second at the venue. “If the five us six of us can be up here playing there's nothing you can't do.”

That seemed to do the trick. The band went into “Mulholland Drive” from “Handwritten” which sparked the audience and Fallon let out a decidedly demonic rock 'n' roll scream on the next song “Too Much Bood.” Fallon and guitarist Alex Rosamilia next summoned the guitar gods on “Blue Dhalia” and the heat was on for the rest of the show.

Alex Levine played bass and Benny Horowitz was on drums. The lineup was augmented by Ian Perkins on guitar and Asbury Park player Bryan Haring a newcomer to the Gaslight fold on keys.

Haring along with Horowtiz delivered some really nice jazzy undertones on the song “Halloween.” Here's hoping Haring has a hand in future recordings by Gaslight as there seems to be potential for some interesting musical directions.

Songwriter Fallon crafts compelling Kerouac-ian tomes of characters on the fringe of society and the edge of heartbreak. An expanded musical palette for Gaslight would add to the experience.

The next chapter is around the corner.

“We love you — see you again soon” Fallon said. “Time to make a new record.”

Standing center stage at PNC Bank Arts Center Saturday night — his band’s largest local gig since they played the amphitheater eight years ago — the singer was quick to anoint New Jersey as “the best place in the world … the greatest state in the whole nation.”

The scruffy frontman from Red Bank rambled on about how the president should be moved to the Garden State then recounted his first-ever show at PNC — Depeche Mode in 1994 only because a Motley Crue tour got canceled — and spurred the crowd to consider whether their beloved breakfast meat was indeed Taylor Ham or pork roll.

The response to the latter wasn’t exactly cheering as it was a cacophony of charged declarations like an 18th Century town hall over who remained a loyalist to King George III.

Fallon grinned widely at the shouts of pig-disc fervor — again he knows his people.

And New Jersey rock fans know the Gaslight Anthem the band born from New Brunswick basements and the stuffy Court Tavern who rose to fame in 2008 with nostalgia-laden “The ‘59 Sound” LP and have remained the state’s most popular homegrown alt-rock band pretty much ever since.

With that around 10000 bundled-up fans braved the October cold Saturday (a brisk 47 degrees when the band hit the stage) for the Holmdel venue’s final show of the 2022 season and Gaslight’s first New Jersey show in four years since its trio of reunion shows at the Stone Pony Summer Stage in 2018.

After a couple nebulous hiatuses since 2015 the band announced in March their return to full-time status and that they’d begun to write their sixth studio album. While no new songs have come just yet fans were plenty pleased to run through the group’s well-traveled catalog Saturday belting to favorites “Great Expectations” “45” and the 2007 oldie “We Came to Dance” where Fallon made a point to emphasize the “Central Jersey skies” lyric.

For this new U.S. tour which kicked off last month in Portland Gaslight is touring as a six-piece: Fallon and core members Alex Rosamilia (lead guitar) Alex Levine (bass) and Benny Horowitz (drums) plus touring guitarist and (Fallon’s longtime collaborator) Ian Perkins and keyboardist Bryan Haring the latest edition. Haring’s extra vocal harmonies and piano plinks were welcome additions to fill out the band’s crunchy sound which frankly is better suited for clubs and theaters than cavernous outdoor spaces like this.

To that point the mix at PNC was subpar as it often is; Levine’s bass was mush the rest was too undefined not exactly a fair representation of the records.

The band remained taut and vibrant however with Fallon’s requisite gravel tearing through on the pumping “Mulholland Drive” and serrated “Howl.” The 2014 tune “Stay Vicious” slammed hard with its exceedingly heavy blues. The singer’s softer touch on the traipsing opener “Have Mercy” and pensive “Halloween” was poignant and certainly improved from the band’s early days — part and parcel of Fallon’s generally more subdued (and largely excellent) trio of solo records released since 2016.

Joyful bordering on eccentric Fallon 42 led the show with boyish enthusiasm and ease quick with a joke — “I hope you like metal this one’s called ‘Raining Blood’ by Slayer” he quipped before the very-not-metal “Mae” — and encouraging fans that it’s never too late to do what they want with their lives.

”If us six idiots can play up here you can do anything …we worked at a deli where a guy sold drugs out the back I showed up to work afraid I was gonna die” Fallon laughed.

The 95-minute set was about what fans should expect anchored primarily by cuts from “‘59 Sound” and 2012′s crowd-pleasing “Handwritten.” For the local crew an extra jam or two off ‘07′s debut “Sink or Swim” which was forged on and around the Rutgers campus would’ve been a nice homecoming touch.

But all in all it was an exciting return for the band and its devout gaggle of flannel and denim-clad supporters all of whom seem ready for the next chapter.

Sapienza and Rennard open today’s show with their rendition of Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond’s “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers.” Accompanied by a quartet of musicians on piano guitar bass and drums Rennard’s sweet soprano and Sapienzo’s smooth baritone warm the crowd as the couple sings while gazing into each other’s eyes.

We make our way out to the PNC Bank Arts Center amphitheater where Garden State Arts Foundation VP Ron Gravino welcomes a crowd of several thousand music lovers to this afternoon’s performance. After thanking the sponsors of this season’s GSAF series of free concert events Gravino introduces The Soundtrack of Our Lives’ Al Sapienza and Deborah Rennard to the stage.

“People started asking ‘Where are you guys performing?’ and we’d say ‘We don’t really have a show’ but we looked at each other and said ‘Hmm… maybe we should get one?’” reveals Rennard explaining “So we figured out how we could sing all the songs we love and we turned that into a show. It’s gotten bigger and bigger over the years and I can’t believe we’re actually here right now!”

“At first we started singing together in karaoke rooms. So we were sitting there singing and Al looked over at me and said ‘Deb I’ve been on Broadway and I can tell you — you’re really good!’ Then he started dragging me around to various charity events and I’m telling you I was petrified! The whole time we would be driving I would be trying to get out of it. I gave him every excuse in the book and he just ignored me but every time we sang people would come up and say ‘Wow! You’re amazing!’”

“In 2010 I moved to New York City which is where I reconnected with Al” recalls Rennard. “We had originally met back in 1984 so I hadn’t seen him in 26 years but when I reconnected with him he said ‘I always get invited to sing at charity events. Why don’t you come sing with me?’ I was actually terrified because I hadn’t sung in front of people in years but Al said ‘Oh stop it!’”

Known primarily for her long-running role as JR Ewing’s secretary Sly on TV’s Dallas Rennard says about her early musical experiences “I studied for years as a singer and a dancer. I had aspirations to be on Broadway but then I got on Dallas — which ran for ten years — and then I wanted to get married and have kids. I married a director who won a few Oscars while we were together and then I stopped acting. That’s when I started producing and writing.”

“In 1984 I met Deborah in acting school. She was already a star on one of the biggest shows on TV but everyone else in the class was struggling” recalls Sapienza who reveals “Later on I heard her voice and said ‘Come sing with me!’ We started doing songs from Phantom and I said ‘Let’s do an act. We’ll both love it.’”

“I’d been playing the drums my whole life and became a mentee of the famous disc jockey Murray the K. He took a liking to me and became like a father to me. He said ‘You’ve got it and I’m gonna help you!’ and he helped me audition for Beatlemania on Broadway. Although I wasn’t in the original cast I was selected for the next cast and I ended up playing the role of Ringo on Broadway for five years.”

“When I was in the second grade I saw The Beatles on the Ed Sullivan TV show and begged my father for a drum set. He got me drums the very next day and for my communion he got me a full set” recalls Sapienza. “I played the drums every day from 1964 to 1982. I guess it was my way of getting out stress — [laughs] I can even remember making my Italian father watch me play the ‘B side’ of The Beatles’ Abbey Road album in 1969 when I was in the eighth grade!”

Best known for his performances on TV's The Sopranos House of Cards and Suits Sapienza — who grew up just over the NJ border in Monsey NY — explains “Ever since I was a kid I've loved music. I can even remember listening to songs like 'Volare' and 'Sealed with a Kiss' when I was just four years old.”

As we make our way backstage before the show we catch up with Al Sapienza and Deborah Rennard and ask the two movie and TV stars to talk about their early musical experiences and to tell us about the genesis of their live stage act The Soundtrack of Our Lives.

It’s a gorgeous fall afternoon this Tuesday September 27 2022 at Holmdel NJ’s PNC Bank Arts Center. It’s the perfect setting for a free concert by singer Michael Amante and The Soundtrack of Our Lives featuring stage and screen performers Al Sapienza and Deborah Rennard.

Rennard gets the crowd clapping and swaying their arms back and forth in the air as Sapienza croons Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline” with style energy and dynamics. Rennard sings harmony to Sapienza’s vocal as the crowd spontaneously adds the popular “So good so good so good” refrain to the arrangement.

Rennard impresses with her rendition of “I Dreamed A Dream” from Les Miserables as the breeze picks up and adds even more drama to the song. The crowd cheers and Rennard announces “This show is a celebration of the incredible power of music — of how a song can transport you in just three minutes.”

Here the pair launches into an upbeat interpretation of The Beatles’ “She Loves You” where Sapienza accompanies the duo on guitar as the crowd joins in on the infectious “She loves you/Yeah yeah yeah” chorus.

A highlight of the duo’s set is Rennard’s interpretation of “Downtown” where her vocal channels Petula Clark she dances on the instrumental interlude and the audience joins in on the catchy “Downtown” refrain.

Following a duet version of “Somewhere” from West Side Story Rennard performs a sparkling rendition of the title song from Cabaret.

The audience clearly enjoys experiencing the excitement of a Broadway-caliber performance here in the PNC Bank Arts Center’s breezy outdoor arena.

The duo performs a haunting rendition of Simon and Garfunkel’s “The Sound of Silence” and follows up with another highlight performance of today’s set — Al Sapienza’s soulful and powerful rendition of Neil Diamond’s “Holly Holy” — which brings avid cheers from the audience.

Not to be outdone Rennard performs an effervescent rendition of Barbra Streisand’s “Don’t Rain on my Parade” which brings hoots and hollers from the crowd.

Sapienza’s performance of Billy Joel’s “Piano Man” has concertgoers singing along on the tune’s famous “Play us a song/You’re the piano man” refrain.

Holding hands the couple sings directly to one another on “All I Ask of You” from Phantom of the Opera and Deborah dedicates “The Prayer” “to all the people we lost” including her beloved father.

Music lovers in the crowd happily “start spreading the news” as they joyfully sing along to Al Sapienza’s dynamic rendition of Frank Sinatra’s “New York New York.”

Finally Sapienza and Rennard conclude their set with a upbeat rendition of The Beatles’ “Twist and Shout” which has audience members standing and twisting along at their seats.

During a short intermission we chat with concertgoers who share their opinions of The Soundtrack of Our Lives. Declares Pattie from Brick “This was the best show I’ve ever seen!” Rita from Monroe Twp. agrees calling Sapienza and Rennard’s performance “Absolutely fabulous!” explaining “They sang perfectly in tandem and they’re easy on the eyes too — they’re both very attractive and handsome!”

Marie from Old Bridge exclaims “Al Sapienza can sing Neil Diamond anytime anywhere! He’s really good — I enjoyed every song!”

Amanda from Point Pleasant concurs adding “I especially loved it when he sang “Holly Holy” — it was wonderful — and when Deborah sang ‘Downtown’ she sounded just like Petula Clark!”

Lastly we chat with Esther and Linda from Old Bridge. Whereas Esther reveals “There wasn’t a song they did that I didn’t like — all of their music brought me back to my youth” Linda confesses “We came today to see Michael Amante but this guy and gal were fabulous” before concluding “Bring them back again next year!”

A seven-piece orchestra takes the stage and begins to play as Michael Amante’s dynamic voice fills the amphitheater. Looking handsome in his black velvet jacket with elaborate gold brocade Amante makes his entrance his powerful tenor soaring as he croons “Core ‘ngrato (Ungrateful Heart)” in Italian.

After telling the audience to “Grab someone near you for this next song” Amante sings “More.” Accompanied by piano keyboard bass trumpet trombone drums and percussion Amante holds out an extremely long note on the song’s coda impressing music lovers in the crowd who burst into applause.

Asking “Any Italian ladies here?” Amante announces “If your name is Maria this is for you!” prior to capturing the hearts of all of the “Marias” in the audience with his rendition of “Maria” from West Side Story.

Amante introduces singer Marissa Famiglietti who joins him on West Side Story’s “Tonight.”

The singers’ voices meld into one as they transform into WSS lovers Tony and Maria with their tender interpretation of this classic Bernstein/Sondheim composition.

Showing his sensitive side Amante performs the Eagles’ “Desperado” and follows up with Elvis Presley’s “I Can’t Help Falling in Love With You” the arrangement building to a crescendo which elicits hoots and hollers from concertgoers in the house.

Announcing “We all need a lot more love. Grab someone and tell them you love them” Amante performs “Love Changes Everything” from Broadway’s Aspects of Love. This march-like ballad brings cheers and applause along with calls of “Bravo!” from music lovers in the crowd.

Marissa Famiglietti returns to sing “Think of Me” from Phantom of the Opera. Amante joins her mid-song and Famiglietti sings operatic runs in her lovely soprano voice bringing cheers from the audience.

The vocalists follow up with another selection from Phantom “All I Ask of You” their operatic voices soaring with round tones.

A highlight of Amante’s set is his and Famiglietti’s rendition of “Music of the Night.” Amante’s voice floats out over the crowd as he sings to Famiglietti who as Christine is intoxicated by the sound of his voice.

When Amante’s tenor rests complete silence fills the amphitheater as the audience savors the glorious power of his voice drinking in the emotion carried by the vibrations of his instrument as it envelopes members of the crowd who stand with calls of “Bravo!”

Showing his versatility Amante performs Blood Sweat and Tears’ “You’ve Made Me So Very Happy” before dueting with Famiglietti on a touching rendition of “The Prayer.”

Music lovers in the crowd sing along on the “Why why why” refrain of Tom Jones’ “Delilah.” Amante talks to the audience about his being a current resident of Florida before performing another highlight of his set “Nessun Dorma (Let No One Sleep) from Puccini’s Turandot.

Round tones waft over concertgoers who sit with rapt attention to this talented singer whose performance ends with a standing ovation and cries for “More!” from the audience.

To conclude today’s program Amante serenades his fans with his rendition of “Till” — a perfect ending to a dynamic performance where he sings “You are my reason to live/All I own I would give/Just to have you adore me/Till the rivers flow upstream/Till lovers cease to dream/Till then I’m yours be mine.”

As music lovers make their way out of the amphitheater we chat with several who share their thoughts on today’s show by Michael Amante and Soundtrack of Our Lives. Whereas Joe from Middletown exclaims “This concert was unbelievable — this is a show I would have happily paid for!” Cathy from Waretown remarks “I totally enjoyed this performance” and Sal from Waretown exclaims “I loved it — I just absolutely loved it!”

Angela from Lakewood calls today’s program “Absolutely fabulous — magnificent!” and Arlene from Stockholm insists “The show was great!” Al from Stockholm concurs adding “Such beautiful voices — we’re so glad we came” while Joan from Stockholm reveals “‘The Prayer’ was beautiful” and Cathy from Old Bridge agrees noting “It was excellent — ‘The Prayer’ was my favorite.”

Jean from Lakewood remarks “Today’s show was just wonderful” explaining “Michael Amante is just magnificent and Marissa Famiglietti is a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice — she’s fantastic!”

Lillian from Lakewood agrees contending “Michael Amante is wonderful — he has such a powerful voice” and Rita from Bergen asserts “Michael Amante’s voice came right from the soles of his feet straight into my heart!”

John from Manchester calls today’s performance “Excellent” declaring “Michael Amante’s voice — I can’t even describe it!” Carmella from Manchester concurs recalling “It brings me back to my childhood. I grew up surrounded by opera singers and I just love it!”

Finally Denise from Massachusetts confesses “I was invited to today’s show at the last minute and I was just blown away by the talent on this stage. Michael Amante and Marissa Famiglietti’s voices are beyond beautiful and hearing the two of them together was like being in heaven!”

As we exit the PNC Bank amphitheater and make our way backstage we take a moment to chat with singer Marissa Famiglietti who reveals “It’s always a treat to sing with Michael Amante — we have so much fun together!” before acknowledging “When we’re performing we are so connected in the moment.”

Lastly we chat with Michael Amante who exclaims “I love working with Marissa! She’s so talented and flexible. I’ve been singing with her ever since 2007.” Recalling “I’ve been all over the world and the audience here is like my family — I would sing for them all day long” Amante concludes by asserting “This is my home!”

These lists have become the most anticipated thing we do. Every year I’ve intended these lists to highlight the beauty of the diversity across our state. I want kids here in Wisconsin to see role models of people who are succeeding to know that it’s possible for people of color to achieve great things here.

This week we shine a statewide spotlight on the dedicated leaders of Wisconsin’s Latino communtiies. These are richly diverse communities with roots that represent a massive geographic area. The people we highlight this week are elected leaders business leaders and community leaders doing difficult important work often in the face of discrimination and literally generations of oppression.

We are also aware that this list like every other is not comprehensive. There are without a doubt more than 46 influential Latino leaders doing good work in Wisconsin. We hope you will let us know about people in your community who we can include on future lists. For now though we just want to introduce you to a few of the people doing the work often behind the scenes and without the accolades across Wisconsin.

You might know a few of these names but there’s a good chance that most of them will be new to you. I urge you to get to know them. Reach out to those living and working in your communities. Learn from them network create partnerships. And spread the word — let others in your network know that we have people of all ethnicities living and working across Wisconsin to make this state a good and prosperous place for all.

And one more note: Many of the people on this list — and on previous lists — will gather next week October 10 and 11 at the fifth annual Wisconsin Leadership Summit. You’re welcome to come too to meet network with and learn from this dynamic group!

At this pivotal moment we find that the state CISO position has continued to gain strength and authority. As noted in the last biennial study during the early days of the pandemic CISOs performed the herculean task of migrating state government operations services and employees to a virtual environment nearly overnight. They enhanced safeguards such as multifactor identification risk monitoring and incident readiness to secure a remote workforce. As a result of these measures and the dedication of state employees state agencies continued operating and providing services in the face of immense challenges.

Now CISOs have a chance to build on that momentum to chart strategies for the postpandemic era. To meet the needs of an even more hyperconnected age they must tackle some longstanding challenges while laying the groundwork for the adoption of newer technologies on the horizon. From this year’s survey results we identified three key takeaways critical to enhancing the CISO’s role in the future.

Dealing with the talent gap. Attracting retaining and continually training a cybersecurity workforce primed for the future has become more difficult. It is encouraging to see an increasing trend to effectively embrace the delivery of cyber services but states must reposition state employment to compete effectively with private sector and federal employers for millennial and Generation Z workers whose workplace ideals differ from those of previous generations. For example the ability to work remotely in part or in full is now a basic expectation.

Embracing the entire state. In the ongoing effort to fortify resilience across their states CISOs must extend their leadership to all levels of government including the local level. Due to the many interactions that take place between local and state agencies local government presents a threat vector. CISOs should increase their cooperation with higher education institutions to act as a bridge between state and local government and to also create a pipeline of cybersecurity professionals to address the talent gap.

Setting a new course. The postpandemic world brings new challenges and opportunities. CISOs need to have the foresight both in terms of budgets and new technologies to keep pace with the expectations of the increasingly digitized environment.

We thank the 53 states and territories that participated in our detailed survey. We salute your dedication to safeguarding citizen data and to securing the business of your state.",,,,,,,,,

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins.

ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

Delhi’s New Education Policy: What School Students Need To Know On Latest Promotion Rules

Delhi’s New Education Policy: What School Students Need To Know On Latest Promotion Rules

The Delhi government amended the 'no detention' policy and announced that students from Class 5 to Class 8 need to clear annual examinations for promotion to the next class.

Delhi's new education policy: Students of classes 5 and 8 ""will not be promoted to the next class"" if they ""do not pass"" the yearly examination. (File Photo)

New Delhi: There is an important update for students studying in Delhi’s state board schools. For those who have welcomed the AAP-led government’s ‘no detention’ policy for state board schools in Delhi you should know that the same rules will not apply from the next academic session 2023-24. The Delhi government issued a new promotion policy for students of classes 5 and 8 and fresh examination guidelines for classes 3-8 which will be implemented from the academic session 2023-24.

WHAT STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW ON DELHI’S NEW EDUCATION POLICY

As per Delhi government’s new education policy students need to clear Class 5 and Class 8 annual examinations for promotion. This means students of classes 5 and 8 “will not be promoted to the next class” if they “do not pass” the yearly examination.

According to the guidelines assessment of children’s learning in classes 5 and 8 will include mid-term and annual examinations as well as co-curricular activities. The co-curricular activities include project-based activities portfolio child’s participation in the classroom participation in activities like theatre dance music sports and child’s attendance.

Under SCERT’s new assessment guidelines if a child is unable to pass class 5 or 8 he/she will get another chance to improve the performance within two months through re-examination. “No child shall be expelled from school till the completion of elementary education. There shall be a regular examination in classes 5 and 8 at the end of every academic year” the guidelines said. It further said that he assessment of classes 3 4 6 and 7 will be done on the same examination pattern as of classes 5 and 8. The students of classes 3 4 6 and 7 will not be held back in the same class.

For classes 5 and 8 in order to be declared “Pass” at the end of the session for promotion to the next higher class a student must secure at least 33 per cent marks in each subject during the session according to the guidelines. “The promotion to the next higher class is also subject to the condition that a minimum of 25 per cent of marks must be scored in mid term plus annual examination” the guidelines said.

It further said that in order to be declared “Pass” in re-examination a student will have to secure at least 25 per cent marks in the subject(s) and if a student does not secure at least 25 per cent the student will be placed in the category of “essential repeat” — which means the student in this case will be held back in the same class during the next session.

The new assessment and promotion guidelines prepared by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) Delhi were released by the Directorate of Education (DoE) for all government local bodies and private schools in Delhi on Friday.

WHY DELHI GOVT MADE NEW CHANGES IN EDUCATION POLICY

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the no detention policy was “very progressive” but the education system could not take full advantage of it “due to lack of preparation”.

“The ‘no detention policy’ was very progressive but due to lack of preparation the education system could not take full advantage of it. But we need to prepare such a system to lay a strong foundation at the elementary level” Manish Sisodia said was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.

Sisodia further stated that keeping the “holistic development of children” in mind SCERT Delhi has released new assessment guidelines. “Through these guidelines our aim is not to stop any student from getting promoted to the next class. Our real aim is to bring the same degree of seriousness in elementary grades as for class 10 and 12” Sisodia said.

Important Note: The guidelines will be implemented in all the government government-aided Municipal Corporation of Delhi New Delhi Municipal Corporation Delhi Cantonment Board and recognised unaided schools within NCT of Delhi from the Academic session 2023-24.

This pressure on smaller banks is only set to increase once Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.'s A$4.9 billion purchase of Suncorp Group Ltd.'s banking arm goes through. The acquisition announced in July will be the country's biggest banking deal in more than a decade.

The combined assets of Australia's biggest banks — Australia and New Zealand Banking Group or ANZ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia or CBA; Westpac Banking Corp.; and National Australia Bank Ltd. or NAB — ballooned to A$4.291 trillion as of June 22 from A$3.928 trillion in the prior-year period according to data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. This makes up more than 72% of the A$5.951 trillion assets of the country's banking sector. Assets of all the other local banks added up to A$796.71 billion putting them at a competitive disadvantage.

""The ability to leverage operating costs and access cheaper funding is key in a bank being able to generate attractive returns"" Nathan Zaia equity analyst at Morningstar told S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Scale is important.""

The bigger banks can generate returns on equity above their cost of capital ""but for smaller banks it's tough given they have a funding and operating cost disadvantage"" Zaia said.

Big getting bigger

Although the big four still compete among themselves the high market concentration has been a concern for the Australian banking system. In recommending changes to the industry the Royal Commission which investigated misconduct in the nation's financial services industry between 2017 and 2019 stopped short of top-to-bottom reform though it found irregularities and illegal practices by banks.

After the commission submitted its final report in 2019 the then chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Rod Sims said ""a cosy banking oligopoly is surely at the heart of recent problems so we must and will find ways to get more effective competition in banking."" The competition watchdog declined to comment when contacted by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

ANZ's announced deal is expected to push it into third place among the country's banks in terms of mortgages and retail deposits The Australian Financial Review reported July 18.

Shayne Elliott ANZ's chief executive said at the time that the deal will ""improve competition"" in Australia's Queensland state a claim rebuffed by the chief of a smaller lender that operates in Queensland and New South Wales.

Elliott told the Australian Financial Review that the deal would help it better compete with the big players in the market adding that ""just as Suncorp probably feels dwarfed by ANZ we feel dwarfed by CBA."" ANZ's market share in the home loans market stood at 13.9% at the end of fiscal 2021 according to the bank's results. In comparison CBA's market share in home lending stood at 25.1% as of June 2022 according to its full-year results. ANZ had been working on building up its market share in the important mortgage market after it missed the housing boom.

Nothing for competition

The deal however ""will do nothing to promote competition and will further entrench the Sydney/Melbourne myopia in the banking sector"" Heritage Bank CEO Peter Lock said in a July 18 statement. ""The takeover of Suncorp by ANZ will simply increase the power of the major banks in Australia. It's even worse that we're losing a Queensland-based bank and the different perspective that brings.""

Heritage Bank referred to prior comments by their chief when asked for comment while CBA Westpac and NAB did not comment.

""The concentrated banking system in Australia affords material business and funding stability advantages to the four major banks including in relation to their pricing flexibility franchise distribution and diversity"" said Sharad Jain an analyst at S&P Global Ratings. ""We reflect these advantages in our assessment that each of the major banks' business positions and funding profiles are better than those of the regional and other smaller lending institutions.""

Lacking heft

Smaller regional banks lack the heft to compete with the big four mostly because they can only access more expensive funding and have smaller marketing budgets.

For example smaller banks lack the scale to access securitization funding said Martin North principal at Digital Finance Analytics. These banks do not have the ""critical mass for securitization deals to fly"" North said adding that these lenders are also limited by ordinary bond offerings as they need to offer higher coupons to offset risks.

Efforts by the regulators to foster new entrants to the banking industry have met with mixed results. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced rules in 2018 to allow online-only neobanks to start. Volt Bank was the first fully digital bank to be granted a restricted license in May 2018 and was followed by Xinja Bank 86 400 and Judo Bank.

The neobanks were supposed to use technology and compete with the four majors but only Judo from among the four survives. Xinja exited in 2020 after failing to control its spending while 86 400 was bought by NAB in early 2021. Volt returned its banking license and shut down in June after it failed to raise sufficient funds.

Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Chair Wayne Byres said during a speech in May at the Financial Review Banking Summit that competition in the financial sector brings innovation and enhanced outcomes for customers. Byres noted that the ""longer-term growth in the share of banking assets held by non-major banks — which was severely set back by acquisitions related to the global financial crisis the associated flight to quality — has recommenced in recent years as smaller players again attract a larger share of new business.""

The prudential regulator did not offer a fresh comment when contacted by Market Intelligence.

""Smaller players and new entrants may continue to pursue specialties in niche areas or focus on offering new products as a means to differentiate themselves from heightened industry competition"" said Darcy Gannon analyst at IBISWorld an industry and market research database firm. ""Alternatively smaller players may consider mergers with one another as a means of expanding in the industry without losing larger amounts of autonomy.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYXUuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oZWFsdGgtaW5zdXJhbmNlLXNhdmUtMTgwMC1wZXIteWVhci0yMjMwMDQ3MjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health insurance: The simple way Aussies can save $1800 per year,"CHOICE research found many Aussies were paying for more health insurance than they needed. (Source: Getty)

If you're paying for top-tier private health insurance but you rarely or never use it you're likely spending thousands more than you have to.

New research from consumer group CHOICE found a single person could save more than $1800 a year by downgrading their cover to a silver or silver-plus policy.

With cost-of-living pressures biting and the price of health insurance for HCF NIB Bupa and Medibank customers going up on November 1 there's no time like the present to take stock of your cover and see if you can make some savings.

Do you know what your policy actually covers?

According to the latest figures from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) more than 11.5 million Australians have health insurance policies covering hospital admission.

Of those 11.5 million people a massive 38 per cent are paying for top-level policies which offer the maximum level of cover and no exclusions.

CHOICE said that in some cases these top-level gold policies cost nearly double the cheapest silver policy offered by the same insurer.

That means you could be paying a huge premium for a handful of extra services you may never need such as cover for pregnancy and birth (including IVF) cataract eye surgery hip or knee replacement pain-management devices sleep studies insulin pumps gastric-banding surgery psychiatry palliative care and rehabilitation.

CHOICE pointed out that some silver plans also covered some of these extras.

It encouraged people to assess their level of cover and consider whether they could save money downgrading while still maintaining an acceptable level of cover.

How much could you save?

The cost of health cover varied between insurers and from state to state but CHOICE said a single person with Hospital Premium Gold cover with HCF could save a massive $1823 a year by downgrading to the company's silver plan.

Story continues

For reference someone in NSW on the same plan would still save close to $1700 per year (and would likely be already paying slightly less for their cover).

Time to shop around?

This comes as the technology services company continues to implement its strategic plan as part of its next phase of growth and embeds purpose into its company structure.

HCLTech joins a growing list of companies repositioning their brands in 2022 as they find their branding no longer represents their purpose values and direction.

Take AirAsia Group which recently rebranded to Capital A to reflect its transformation from an airline into a one-stop digital travel and lifestyle services group; or UAE’s Etisalat Group whose rebrand to e& better reflects the group’s positioning as a technology and investment conglomerate.

From HCL Technologies to HCLTech – how the company is repositioning

It’s a similar story for HCLTech whose rebrand new brand positioning of ‘Supercharging Progress’ reflects its new purpose of bringing together the best of technology and best people to supercharge progress for all.

The rebranding is part of the three-decade-long strategic plan geared at embarking on its next phase of growth as the Noida-headquartered company (active in 50+ countries) nears the US$12 billion revenue mark.

According to C Vijayakumar CEO and Managing Director at HCLTech supercharging progress captures the essence of what the company does today and its aspiration of what they want to do more of – at scale at speed for its clients people communities and planet.

“Our purpose accelerates our journey to be the digital partner of choice for global enterprises through differentiated services and products and being an employer of choice for top talent” says Vijayakumar. “It also underscores our responsibility to continue contributing toward inclusive growth of communities where we operate and a sustainable planet for the generations to come.”

HCLTech which boasts more than 200000 employees worldwide also has a new employee value proposition that aims to help the firm position itself as a top employer of choice.

“Our employee value proposition emphasises our commitment to help both current and prospective employees maximise their career potential and ambitions” says Vijayakumar.

In the US where HCLTech has operated for more than 30 years and boasts a workforce of 22000 the company was recently certified Great Place to Work.

“Our people are the foundation of the company and our firm belief is that when they are provided an environment in which they feel included confident and empowered not only does our company benefit but so do our clients around the globe” says Ramachandran Sundarajan EVP HCL Technologies.

HCLTech takes a Google cloud-first approach in key industry segments

HCL Technologies was originally a technology research and development division of HCL spinning off as an independent business in 1991. Over the last three decades the company has grown from a specialist in software solutions to an end-to-end player in the technology services landscape with a focus on digital engineering and cloud.

HCLTech works mainly for clients in financial services manufacturing life sciences and healthcare technology business services telecom media retail consumer goods and public services.

The company takes a Google Cloud-first approach for data analytics and AI projects in key industry segments including retail and consumer packaged goods financial services healthcare and life sciences.

A strategic partner of Google Cloud HCLTech formed the dedicated Google Cloud Ecosystem Unit in 2019 to accelerate enterprise cloud adoption by helping enterprise customers plan and execute large-scale migrations.

The two companies are now expanding the partnership to significantly scale HCLTech’s capacity to support digital transformation with HCLTech training up to 18000 technology and consulting professionals on GoogleCloud infrastructure products and solutions.

“The majority of enterprises today are investing aggressively in cloud technology to build responsive scalable and resilient digital-first business models” says Vijayakumar. “Our collaboration with Google Cloud has helped us address this market with compelling joint propositions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvbGxlY3Rvci5jb20vYnJpdGlzaC1lYXN0LWluZGlhLWNvbXBhbnktZnJvbS1jb21tZXJjaWFsLXRvLXRlcnJpdG9yaWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the British East India Company Went from Commercial to Territorial,"Blessed with the authority of conducting and protecting itself in the name of the Crown the British East India Company had amassed wealth previously unimaginable. Its monopoly of the Asian and the Pacific Trade generated vast profits for London culminating in the influx of lucrative commodities like tea and spices. But exactly how and when did a chartered company go beyond just the conduct of business and begin exerting political influence at the same time? What does it mean for its employees its patrons as well as the empire? This article explores the British East India Company’s meteoric rise and fall in detail. It will also shed light on how the Company’s eventual control over India from the 18th century blurred the lines between its commercial and territorial nature.

How the British East India Company Came to Be

The Armada Portrait by Unknown Artist c.a. 1588 via National Portrait Gallery London

It all started on the last day of the year 1600. British monarch Queen Elizabeth I granted a charter in what would be an unprecedented privilege to a group of London merchants. The historic charter bestowed exclusive overseas trading rights with the East Indies on these men who would form the British East India Company. This privilege accounted for a massive land area stretching eastwards from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa to Cape Horn in South America. What this fundamentally meant was that the British East India Company would be able to exert considerable influence over the Asian and Pacific Trade.

Further cementing British seafaring prowess the state-sanctioned charter came after the British had defeated the Spanish Armada in the most epic and dramatic manner. In the summer of 1588 the Spanish Armada which commanded 130 ships consisting of some 8000 seamen and 18000 soldiers was preparing to invade England. The result of years of Anglo-Spanish tensions the naval face-off was originally tipped in favor of the Spanish forces who had outnumbered their English counterparts. However an ingenious plan to send blazing English ships toward the Spanish Armada later forced the Spaniards to flee in chaos and panic. A combination of bad weather and not-so-strategic naval engagements culminated in the defeat of the almighty Spanish Armada. It had lost 60 of its 130 ships and reported some 15000 deaths by autumn.

In what was considered a spectacular military victory the defeat of the Spanish Armada had without a doubt boosted Britain’s foray into the seas. Like the Dutch and the Portuguese the British had desired to set sail to the East Indies and exploit the vast resources nestled within these land masses. In India China as well as Persia and beyond laid precious spices textiles jewelry and tea widely sought after by the western powers. The ongoing European rivalry as well as competition for control over these regions would thrust the British East India Company into a chaotic period characterized by power struggle exploitation and violence.

The Key “Factor” to Success: A Factory System

The British East India Company functioned primarily based on a “factory” system. Designated representatives or “factors” were tasked to set up trading posts to source and negotiate with the locals. These factors would usually be liaising with local merchants to take stock of the voyage for the current and following year. While employment with the British East India Company was as coveted as having secured a position in Google today there were many risks involved. Particularly for those sent abroad one sea expedition could easily take two years and potentially end in tragedy for many. It was estimated that over half of the British East India Company’s employees sent to Asia had lost their lives while in service. The high mortality rates were usually a result of storms shipwrecks piracy and diseases among others.

Back in London a central administration oversaw the massive mercantile machine. Responsible for the timely reporting of the British East India Company’s operations the Court of Directors consisted of 24 elected members and designated committees. The Court was also in charge of sending political administrative and commercial instructions to councils set up in the major trading settlements overseas. With a systematic highly efficient workflow the British East India Company was able to capitalize on the advantageous monopoly it had over the East Indies and consistently reap handsome profits.

The Obstacles: Escalating Tensions with Competing Powers

An efficient system laid the foundations for the British East India Company’s maritime ventures abroad. However the emerging maritime power soon found itself battling the increasing influences of its European competitors. Just two years after the Company’s formation they were met with the news of the birth of the Dutch East India Company which was also granted a monopoly over the Asian trade by the Dutch government. The Dutch East India Company wasted no time demonstrating its prowess and asserting its dominance over Asian waters. In February 1603 it seized Santa Catarina a well-laden Portuguese merchant ship off the coast of Singapore effectively gaining leverage over the Iberian power. In the same year it also established a permanent trading post in Banten modern-day Indonesia.

As tensions between the two competing Companies rose it escalated into an open naval conflict in 1618. This culminated in a series of military entanglements later between the two empires from 1652 to 1673 which would later extend into the 18th century. Among other motivations for warfare was Britain’s desire to seize the spice trade in Asia which had always been a Dutch stronghold. But when it became clear that Dutch dominance in the region was unsurpassable the British reconfigured their game plan looking to India and China instead.

The Opportunity: Securing the “India” in the East India Company

For the British India was a good option to establish dominance for a variety of reasons. First it provided commodities that were comparable to the lucrative spice trade such as indigo cotton tea and exotic animals. This was connected to the thriving demand for Indian textiles in the Euro-Asian trade. Secondly it functioned as a viable access point where the trading communities could converge. It was also a strategic port for stopover restocking and shelter. Finally and more importantly India presented itself as a promising location to project English dominance to counter the other European powers in the region.

Britain’s initial forays in India began with establishing agreements with the Mughal Empire. As the latter expressed interest in enhancing trade and was relatively open to foreign cultures the British East India Company could kick-start its commercial activities in India. It all began with the first Company factory being constructed in Surat then the most prosperous port in India in 1612. This was followed by the establishment of several fortified settlements in various parts of India such as Madras Calcutta and Bombay. As garrisons and residences of the officials and soldiers sprouted quickly in these settlements they soon became a microcosm of the British East India Company.

Expansion of British East India Company in India

As it progressed into the 18th century the British East India Company began to expand its control over India owing to a variety of factors. First the Mughal Empire was declining due to its increasingly decentralized system. A network of complex marriage alliances created a highly volatile political climate with numerous princely states. Due to their “virtual autonomy” from central authority the leaders of the princely states like Bengal and Hyderabad began forging their own agreements with foreigners. By the 1750s the Mughal Empire was confronted with the reality of its own decline. It faced the dual threats of the emerging social classes such as zamindars (landowners) and powerful merchants as well as the Hindu Marathas a warrior group from the western Deccan Plateau (present-day Maharashtra).

Secondly the British East India Company was consolidating its power in India through the expansion of its trade networks. Apart from the growth of its fortified settlements the Company was wielding much influence through local traders and credit systems. At the height of its power it could even loan money to the state. Similarly its burgeoning army was also posing a threat to the Mughal rule. Originally meant to protect the factories and defend British commercial interests from other European powers the British East India Company’s army was commanding over 48000 men by 1783. At its height it was 260000-strong almost twice that of Britain’s standing armed forces.

The Turning Point: The Battle of Plassey 1757

Clive at Plassey 1757 by William Heath 1821 via National Army Museum London

As the winds of change beckoned the British East India Company to have a more direct stake in India a major turning point that would transform it into an empire occurred in 1757. Widely regarded as the start of over two centuries of British rule in India the Battle of Plassey took place in June 1757. A military confrontation that took place in north-eastern India pitted the Company’s troops led by Colonel Robert Clive against the forces of Siraj-ud-Daulah the last Nawab (sovereign ruler) of Bengal and his French allies. While the former had 3000 men and the latter a whopping 50000 it was a decisive victory for Robert Clive and the British East India Company.

Later it was revealed that the victory was a result of a backroom deal with Indian bankers to convince the bulk of the Indian army not to fight at Plassey. Nonetheless the victory greatly boosted the Company’s powers and influence in India as it secured broad taxation powers in Bengal one of India’s richest provinces. Capitalizing on the success at Plassey the Company went on to annex other parts of the subcontinent using force. It also established key alliances with rulers of regions that it had difficulty conquering.

The Crown and the Company: Consolidating Power

Despite the civil strife and unrest at home the Asian trade became a matter of national importance for the British empire by the mid-17th century. As the British East India Company was managing a colossal amount of trade and budget the British government back in London had to intervene on multiple occasions to put the Company into accountability. In 1784 the historic India Act was passed in the British Parliament which formalized the state involvement in governing the Company’s land holdings in India. Widely regarded as the moment “the proper British empire took hold” a government-appointed Board of Control kept the Company in check.

Warren Hastings by William Nutter 1801 via National Portrait Gallery London

Between the 1780s to the 1840s the British East India Company’s engines of expansion knew no limits. Under the stewardship of several key “men on the spot” like Richard Wellesley and Warren Hastings the Company’s mission hinged on pro-expansionist tendencies. It also subscribed to the belief of paramountcy where commercial interests surpassed everything else. This saw the hardening of attitudes toward Indian states culminating in several border conflicts and increasingly forceful annexations of territories.

The Decline and End of the British East India Company

The East India House the Company’s Headquarters in Leadenhall Street London by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd 1817 via British Library

By the start of the 19th century there had been increasing concerns over the Company’s monopoly against the emerging ideas of Free Trade. In 1813 a Charter Act was passed which resulted in the loss of the Indian monopoly for the Company as agency houses and traders scurried to capitalize on the winds of change. With public sentiments questioning the value of a chartered Company returning Company men were also regarded as a public nuisance due to their reputations of greed.

It would take another Charter Act in 1833 to put the Monopoly vs. Free Trade argument to rest as the Parliament proceeded to wind up the Company. While the Company retained its symbolic imperial role until 1858 it was officially dissolved in June 1874 and with it over two centuries of glory and monumental milestones. Once a source of pride for the British Empire the last days of the British East India Company were abysmal to say the least. Be that as it may its unprecedented scale and influence at the height of its power bear key lessons for many multinational conglomerates of today’s global economy.",,,,,,,,,

Presiding judge Masauko Msungama has also ordered that the official receiver should act as a provisional liquidator and shall act as such until such time that another person becomes a liquidator and is capable of acting as such.

Msungama made the judgment in a case where one of company’s new directors Lloyd Laxton Enos Malola applied for an order of company reorganization on the ground that PTC is unable to settle its debts or that it is liable to be wound up unless it is granted an order to reorganize itself to settle the debts.

Malola prayed to the court that in the prevailing circumstances PTC should reorganize itself and fully resume trading in order to generate revenue to be used to settle its debts and remain solvent.

Furthermore the concerned parties asked the court to appoint Hastings Bofomo Nyirenda to be the administrator of PTC and grant the company a moratorium of up to 12 months or such other duration as the court would consider to be just proper and equitable for the company to settle its current liabilities and make such other order as the court considers just proper or equitable to prevent the company from becoming insolvent and liable to be wound up.

But in is ruling delivered on Friday Msungama declined to grant the company the order of reorganization.

“Consequently there is no need for the appointment of an administrator of the Company. Like my brother judge in Cotton Ginners I exercise my power under S.19(c) of the Insolvency Act and treat the application as if it was a winding up petition of the Company.

“I order that the company be wound up. It is pertinent to mention at this stage that by virtue of the provisions of S.27 of the Insolvency Act an automatic moratorium kicked into effect the moment the Company filed its papers in respect of the application for an order of reorganization” said the judge in his ruling.

“There is therefore as we speak a stay of proceedings against the Company which will continue to be in effect until the determination by the court of this application. If at the end of the day it is the court’s decision to throw out this application it will be in order for the court to consider if it is appropriate in the circumstances to order a winding up of the Company.

“On the other hand if the court decides to grant the application it will be necessary to make an ancillary order appointing someone to be the administrator of the Company for an initial period of 6 months.

“In the course of hearing the application it came out clearly that as opposed to the debts of over MK6 billion the Company has assets worth just around MKl.6 billion. There is therefore absolutely no doubt at all that the Company as it is now is not capable of paying its debts” he added.

PTC was incorporated as a limited liability company on 2nd May 1973 and was wholly owned by Press Corporation Limited (PCL).

Earlier this year PTC was sold to Tafika Holdings Limited. At a time the company was being sold it was neck deep in debts in excess of MK18 billion.

The news was on the minds of locals as the Knox County Scenic Drive passed through the town of about 200 people 17 miles southeast of Galesburg.

""It's quite a shock"" Toni Jurgensen said on Saturday.

Jurgensen 58 has lived about 500 feet from the storage unit for 30 years.

""You wouldn't think it would happen in a small town like Maquon.""

Josh Treadway of Maquon echoed those sentiments.

""It's very unusual and not what you expect to go on in a small town because you just see it on TV and it happened in a small town near me"" Treadway said. The 19-year-old Treadway has lived three houses down from the storage units.

Police have not released the identity of the person found or the person who owned the storage unit.

According to a release from the Knox County Sheriff’s Department Saturday morning the remains were located inside a large box in the storage unit at 105 E. 3rd St. after a complaint of a suspicious odor.

Upon arriving at the storage unit at 6 p.m. Friday deputies spoke with the storage facility manager at Roberts Self Storage and the owner of the particular storage unit from which the smell was coming. The owner said the smell was coming from an opossum that had died in the unit.

When the owner was asked to open a large box within the unit the owner advised police there was a body in the box.

Illinois State Police Crime Scene investigations were called to the scene. After a search warrant was obtained the unit was entered and the box opened. Inside the box was decomposed human remains. Identification was not able to be made on the scene due to the condition of the body.

KNOX COUNTY Ill. — Authorities are still investigating Monday after an odor complaint led to the discovery of human remains in a Maquon storage unit on Saturday.

An autopsy was conducted Monday morning on the remains however the Knox County Sheriff's Office said they won't be able to identify them until DNA results or dental records can be confirmed.

""It'll be quite a while before we get all of the results back from that autopsy"" Sgt. Brad Davis with the Knox County Sheriff's Office said. ""But as for now ... we're just still doing the backgrounds and just working on beginning the investigation.""

Around 6 p.m. Friday Oct. 7 Knox County deputies responded to Robert Self Storage on 105 East 3rd St. in Maquon for a complaint of a suspicious odor.

Responding deputies met with the manager of the storage facility and also the renter of the storage unit where the smell was coming from. The renter of the unit unlocked and opened the unit for deputies and claimed that the smell was from an opossum that had previously died in the unit.

Deputies asked the renter to open a large box that was sitting in the unit. The renter did not open the box but informed deputies that there was a body inside of it.

The renter of the storage unit was detained then taken to a local hospital for medical reasons. Due to medical conditions no charges have been filed at this time but are pending further investigation.

The deceased individual has not yet been identified pending notification of the family.

For this reason 17 special refrigerators have been provided to Montenegrin health institutions with UNICEF support.

“I am very grateful to UNICEF for continuously providing support and assistance to the health system of Montenegro. And this type of assistance which enables the safe storage of vaccines is of great importance for their safety and further use” said the Minister of Health of Montenegro Dragoslav Šćekić.

Globally UNICEF and its partners are harnessing solar power mobile technology and telemetrics to ensure that vaccines reach every child without losing their effectiveness from exposure to extreme heat or cold weather conditions. UNICEF procures more than $100 million worth of cold chain equipment annually helping to deliver vaccines safely to the communities that need them most all over the world.

“Vaccines are the world’s safest method of protecting children from life-threatening diseases. For them to work they need to be stored properly. UNICEF will continue supporting the Montenegrin health system to further improve vaccine management” said UNICEF Montenegro Representative Juan Santander.

New special refrigerators with voltage stabilizers provide optimal conditions as they function without significant changes in the storage temperature even when they are opened and closed several times a day. In the case of a power outage the refrigerators allow the inside temperature to remain stable for a prolonged period of time thus securing the utmost quality of the vaccines.

“I would like to use this opportunity to thank UNICEF for cooperation that has resulted in numerous extremely significant donations both to Montepharm and to the entire public health sector in Montenegro especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The support we have had through the valuable donation of the chamber for storage preservation and distribution of vaccines as well as the accompanying modern equipment has improved and expanded the existing ‘cold chain’ system in Montepharm” said the director of Montepharm Goran Marinović.

During the last two years UNICEF has contributed with equipment drugs and other COVID- and immunization-related consumables worth more than €1.2 million. In the coming period UNICEF will continue providing this kind of support to Montenegro including through its partnership with the EU.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL21hcnlsYW5kLWRldmVsb3BlcnMtYXJlLXRyeWluZy10by1kZXNlY3JhdGUtYS1ibGFjay1jZW1ldGVyeWFnYWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maryland Developers Are Trying to Desecrate a Black Cemetery—Again,"In Bethesda Maryland—one of America’s most affluent communities—some of its residents live atop and park their cars on a Black American cemetery that has existed for more than a century.

For decades the white residents of the area were largely unaware of the cemetery. Yet despite its existence being known today the city government seems to prefer the truth to remain buried so that it can sell the land including the remains of Black Americans to developers for more than $50 million.

A cemetery that was more than a cemetery

In 1911 the descendants of formerly enslaved Marylanders built Moses Macedonia African Cemetery and ever since it had been a vital piece in Bethesda’s predominantly Black community along River Road.

“The community was a great place to live during this time. We were a big happy community. Everybody loving everybody” said Harvey Matthews who grew up on River Road in the 1950s.

Matthews has fond memories playing hide and seek at Moses Macedonia African Cemetery which neighbored his childhood home and was not far from Macedonia Baptist Church where he is still a member. But the threat of racial violence and terror was never far away.

For River Road’s Black community the cemetery had also become its playground because the segregated public parks were off limits. Yet by the late 1950s and early 1960s the Black community’s tranquility had been shattered by the growing presence of the Ku Klux Klan and in just over a decade almost all traces of the Black community had been erased.

In response to the civil rights movement the 1950s witnessed the third iteration of the KKK but unlike the previous two iterations this version of the KKK was decentralized and hyperlocal. Racist white Americans wore KKK hoods and robes and terrorized Black communities without the need of a centralized organization. Despite the collapse of the KKK in the 1940s it was reborn a decade later because its racist philosophy of terror still burned bright within segregationist Americans.

Matthews’ family moved away from River Road in 1959 to escape the KKK.

“Some of the same Montgomery County police officers who were supposed to protect you were the same people you saw when you got a peak at the Klansmen at night. We had no one to turn to for help” said Matthews to The Daily Beast. “It was pure hell. You just had to live through it and pray that you would not lose your life.”

In the 1960s after the intimidation from the KKK various government policies that priced out Black residents and unscrupulous developers that tricked Black people into giving up their land the Black community on River Road had disappeared. Soon thereafter white Marylanders moved in and built Westwood Towers apartments upon Moses Macedonia African Cemetery.

During construction all of the gravestones were bulldozed and then as the foundation for the apartment complex was being dug body parts were discovered.

Since the developers had always known that they were building upon a cemetery the discovery of deceased Black bodies was more of an inevitable nuisance rather than a deterrent or justification to stop construction. Instead of relocating the bodies or engaging in countless other humane actions the developers decided to encapsulate the bodies in asphalt and build a parking lot upon them.

For more than 50 years residents in a luxurious apartment complex—where rent can exceed $5000 a month—have been parking their cars and living on top of a Black cemetery.

Fighting for their ancestors

“Right now every day. Cars are parking on top of those bodies” Steven Lieberman a partner at the law firm Rothwell Figg told The Daily Beast. “I think most people would agree that that’s a desecration.”

Lieberman is representing the descendants of those buried in the Moses Macedonia African Cemetery and other community leaders (including Matthews) in a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission (HOC) over control of the land.

Additionally his clients have also created a nonprofit called the Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition (BACC) that has been raising awareness of this American atrocity and fighting to preserve the bodies of their ancestors.

“ ...after the intimidation from the KKK various government policies that priced out Black residents and unscrupulous developers that tricked Black people into giving up their land the Black community on River Road had disappeared. ”

In August 2021 on behalf of his plaintiffs Lieberman filed a complaint in the Maryland circuit court to compel the HOC to comply with Maryland laws and not sell Westwood Towers to developers. Those Maryland laws require land owners—prior to selling the land of a cemetery or burial ground—must get approval from the court to do so. This approval process normally constitutes hearing the perspectives of the representatives of the deceased and then the court determines a fair remedy—which can include blocking the sale.

In this case the HOC attempted to ignore the statute and sell the cemetery to the highest bidder. In the summer of 2021 the HOC accepted a bid of $51 million from Charger Ventures LLC and expected to complete the sale as early September 2021 prior to Lieberman and BACC’s intervention.

On Oct. 25 2021 Circuit Court Judge Karla N. Smith upheld the preliminary injunction to stop the sale but the HOC appealed the decision and on Oct. 6 2022 the HOC presented its case before a three-judge panel at the Maryland Court of Special Appeals for overturning the judge’s decision and selling the property. A decision is expected to be announced in the coming months.

“For us justice is that the land is transferred back to the descendent community and that the land would be used to build a museum and sacred space” Marsha Coleman-Adebayo the president of the Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition told The Daily Beast. “[The museum and sacred space] would be used for teaching future generations about both the genocide and erasure of the community and its culture and the theft of land on River Road; and also the culture history accomplishments and significance of the River Road community.”

In her 2021 decision Judge Smith stated that “The Court cannot ignore that the Plaintiffs African Americans are seeking to preserve the memory of their relatives and those with whom they share a cultural affiliation. Nor can the Court ignore that as early as the 1930s when construction began in the River Road community the deceased have been forgotten forsaken and their final resting places destroyed or at a minimum desecrated.”

Following Judge Smith’s decision Charger Ventures LLC canceled its plans to purchase Westwood Towers because the deal could not be completed at the agreed upon time. However they told the Bethesda Beat in November 2021 that “Charger continues to express its strong interest in resuming negotiations to purchase the property.”

According to Lieberman the HOC is making an “incredibly cruel” argument in this case because they are claiming that due to the lack of gravestones or other documentation the descendants cannot prove that their ancestors are buried there.

Yet even if the descendants could prove that their ancestors are in the cemetery the HOC is also arguing that the descendants cannot prove that they are buried on the parcel of land that became the parking lot for Westwood Towers and instead their remains could reside on the adjacent properties that include a Starbucks a Giant Food grocery store a shopping mall and a Whole Foods.

In essence the HOC is attempting to use the desecration of Black bodies and graves from the past as a justification for desecrating them in the present.

Based on this barbarous argument it is possible that this year a Maryland court may approve the sale of land housing the remains of hundreds of Black Americans in the name of economic growth gentrification and profit at the expense of Maryland’s Black residents and their ancestors.

But this court case only tells a fraction of the story of the Black residents of River Road and the generational erasure of Black life in the name of white wealth.

Maryland still won’t reckon with its slavery shame

In the 1800s River Road was mostly plantations and the land was worked by enslaved Africans. By 1860 nearly 13 percent of Maryland’s population was enslaved.

Despite being a slaveholding state Maryland sided with the Union during the Civil War while continuing to practice slavery. In fact since the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 specifically referred to the Confederate states the law did not take effect in Maryland. In 1864 Maryland held a constitutional convention and abolished slavery in their new constitution.

During the 1800s the plantation owners along River Road created a mass grave where all of them would dispose of the bodies of enslaved Africans. The location of this mass grave is not far from Westwood Towers and in 2020 it was sold to a developer to create a self-storage facility. Currently it is a large open pit next to a McDonald’s and both the government and developers claim to have not found any human remains. But BACC members insist they have proof that their ancestors are buried there and that many of the remains that have been found in this mass grave are those of children.

River Road continues to tell the story of the normalized displacement terror desecration and erasure that often befalls America’s Black community in the name of white wealth.

From chattel slavery to Jim Crow and into the present the struggle to preserve Black life and culture when confronted by white wealth and business development continues to plague American society. River Road’s Black community tells the story of this struggle and the terror inflicted upon Black Americans yet still today some Marylanders would prefer to erase this history—and keep business going as usual while Black families are re-traumatized.

“My mom my dad my grandparents and the ones who have gone on to glory before me they can’t stand up there. They fought their fight back then. I’m still here. I’m still alive. I have my health and strength” said Matthews. “I will fight like hell as long as I have breath in my body until this situation is resolved.”

The Daily Beast has reached out to both Charter Ventures LLC and the Maryland HOC for comment. As of publication neither party has responded."

In a research note on Friday Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu said he expects iPhone models released in 2024 to use Qualcomm's as-yet-unannounced Snapdragon X75 modem. Like the Snapdragon X70 the X75 is expected to be manufactured based on TSMC's 4nm process contributing to power efficiency improvements.

In June TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicated that Qualcomm would remain the exclusive supplier of 5G modems for new iPhone models in 2023 given that Apple failed to complete development of its own replacement chip. At the time Kuo said he believed that Apple would continue to develop its own 5G chip but he did not provide a timeframe for when the chip would be ready for use in iPhones.

All four iPhone 15 models are expected to be equipped with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X70 modem announced in February. Like the Snapdragon X65 modem in iPhone 14 models the X70 theoretically supports up to 10 Gbps download speeds with newly added artificial intelligence capabilities for faster average speeds improved coverage better signal quality lower latency and up to 60% improved power efficiency.

All in all while initial reports claimed that Apple's own 5G modem could debut in iPhones as early as 2023 the switchover might take at least a few years longer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2FwcGxlLWluLWhvdXNlLTVnLW1vZGVtLW5vdC1yZWFkeS11bnRpbC0yMDI1L9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2FwcGxlLWluLWhvdXNlLTVnLW1vZGVtLW5vdC1yZWFkeS11bnRpbC0yMDI1L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple’s in-House 5G Modem Will Not Be Ready Until 2025 Allowing Qualcomm to Reap the Benefits of Being the Sole Supplier,"Qualcomm was earlier reported to be Apple’s exclusive 5G modem supplier for the iPhone 15 series launching in 2023. With an in-house modem expected to debut several years from now the San Diego chip maker will likely cover all of iPhone 16’s 5G modem shipments according to the latest report. When it comes to TSMC and Qualcomm Apple will have little choice but to agree to their terms.

Apple’s in-House 5G Modem Will Not Be Ready Until 2025 According to Analyst iPhone 16 to Use Unannounced Qualcomm Chips in 2024

Qualcomm’s latest and greatest 5G modem to date is the Snapdragon X70 and it will likely be found in upcoming flagships. The company will reportedly be preparing its successor the Snapdragon X75 in the near future for a list of clients including Apple according to Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu.

MacRumors states that just like the Snapdragon X70 the Snapdragon X75 will be mass-produced on TSMC’s 4nm architecture meaning it will be highly power efficient will deliver maximum throughput and possibly take up less space when found inside all iPhone 16 models.

Unfortunately it will be costly to produce since it is reported to be made on TSMC’s 4nm architecture meaning either Apple will have to pass those increases to customers or absorb the component costs which will eat into the company’s profit margins.

Apple has been rumored to develop its in-house 5G modem for many years. This move will allow Apple to reduce its dependency on Qualcomm while also giving the technology giant greater control over the component allowing it to integrate the baseband chip on a deeper software level resulting in additional optimizations such as battery conservation and maximum performance.

Sadly developing this chip is not the same as mass producing an A-series or M-series SoC which is why Apple has to rely on Qualcomm’s expertise for a couple more years. Pu argues that Apple’s 5G modem will not be ready until 2025 and even when it does debut it is not like the company will completely terminate its business relationship with Qualcomm.

It should take a few more years after the launch of the in-house solution before Apple becomes completely self-sufficient in producing this component in massive quantities so until then Qualcomm will keep banking on this partnership.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9pcGhvbmUtMTUtdGlwcGVkLXRvLWNvbWUtd2l0aC1hbi11cGdyYWRlZC01Zy1jaGlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iPhone 15 tipped to come with an upgraded 5G chip,"It's still very early days for iPhone 15 rumors – what with the iPhone 14 only launching last month – but we are starting to hear a few whispers about what to expect next year. The latest prediction of note concerns the 5G modem inside the iPhone 15.

According to industry analyst Jeff Pu (via MacRumors) Apple is set to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon X70 to power its 5G capabilities up from the Snapdragon X65 that sits in the current iPhone 14 line-up.

The upgraded chip offers lower latency and draws less power and comes with a suite of artificial intelligence optimizations that should mean better speeds and more reliable coverage no matter the location of a phone.

Apple's modem plans

There is a subplot here which is that Apple is known to be developing its own 5G modem in the same way that it's been developing its own processors for the iPhone. Pu reckons that an Apple 5G chip is still some way off.

Apple will also stick with Qualcomm for its 5G modem needs in the iPhone 16 scheduled for 2024 Pu says. That should be the Snapdragon X75 though we haven't heard anything about it at the moment.

After that we might see a handset in 2025 with a full set of Apple-made chips inside it – so consider this the very first rumor about the iPhone 17 as well. We will of course keep you posted on all the iPhone leaks and rumors in the meantime.

Analysis: Apple wants full control

Apple clearly likes to have as much control as possible over the hardware components that go in its devices: having made chipsets for the iPhone and iPad for years it has now switched its Macs over to Apple-made silicon as well.

The 5G modem inside the iPhone is one of the few components that's still manufactured by a third party but there's no doubt Apple wants to change that – that's why it spend so much money buying Intel's 5G modem business in 2019.

For whatever reason the process of switching is taking longer than was perhaps anticipated. There had been some speculation that an Apple 5G chip could appear in 2023 but that now looks less likely.

It's going to happen eventually though and Apple will be hoping that by being in charge of all of its own hardware and software development it can make products that run even more efficiently and smoothly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzA5L2FwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS0xNS1hbmQtMTYtdG8tdXNlLXNuYXBkcmFnb24taW5zdGVhZC1vZi1hcHBsZXMtb3duLWNoaXAv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2l6Y2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDkvYXBwbGUtaXBob25lLTE1LWFuZC0xNi10by11c2Utc25hcGRyYWdvbi1pbnN0ZWFkLW9mLWFwcGxlcy1vd24tY2hpcC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple iPhone 15 And 16 To Use Snapdragon Instead Of Apple’s Own Chip,"Right from day one Apple has been the kind of tech company that always tries to do things differently. In a Microsoft dominated world they took the risk of going the other way. Both in their softwares and hardwares.

At the time when Microsoft windows was the only choice available Apple introduced the Macintosh. A computer with a whole different Operating system that no one knew how to use. But they were determined to get their own share of the operating system market. Even though Microsoft still dominate the market at large Apple’s Mac OS has taken a sizeable part of the market and still counting.

From First iPhone To iPhone 15

Also with their iPhone Apple is doing everything possible to make it as different as possible from the rest. When Andoid’s dominance began there were other great mobile phone softwares such as the Symbian and Blackberry OS by Research In Motion. Their dominance in the mobile phone industry was so huge that it was a very high risk for any manufacturer to introduce anything new.

When Android stepped into the game everything changed completely and swiftly. No manufacturer was able to control the speed of Android’s growth. Those who were smart enough quickly joined the trend. Those who tried fighting back were completely beaten. Nokia used to dominate the world by quite a larger proportion. But they were forced to sell their business to Microsoft. This is because they fought against Android.

After acquiring Nokia Microsoft with their Windows Mobile tried everything. But they eventually gave up. The almighty Blackberry fought Android with all they had. But we all know how it ended right? They fell completely flat. In fact no one even talks about them now.

But then there was Apple too. They stood strong and went through it all. From day one they have always stuck with their iOS. While others were falling the iOS kept growing stronger. Today the iOS happens to be the only mobile phone operating system that stands with Android. As a matter of fact the iOS is a threat to the Android OS now.

IPhone 15 Will Use A Snapdragon Modem

Apple is a company that likes to do everything all by themselves. They use their own operating system they design their own phones and even have their own chipset which is the Bionic Chips. But that is not completely so. For example the screens they use in manufacturing their smartphones are not made by them. Companies such as Chinese manufacturer BOE or LG Electronics and sometimes even Samsung supply them with screens.

Apart from screens components such as the 5G chips that they use are also from Qualcomm. Apple’s latest iPhone lineup the iPhone 14 series uses a Qualcomm chip to access 5G Connectivity. Currently the iPhone 14 series use the Snapdragon X65 modem from Qualcomm.

As a company that likes to do everything on their own you should know that sooner or later they will move away from these Qualcomm modems. There has been rumors that Apple has already started working on their own 5G chips.

Apple anticipated their 5G modem to be ready as early as this year. But it looks like there is more work to it than they expected. This means Qualcomm will still remain the supplier of 5G chips to Apple. As it stands now Apple will keep using the Snapdragon 5G modems for at least 2 more years.

Haitong international security analyst Jeff Pu stated that Qualcomm is already working on a new 5G modem. This 5G modem will be the Snapdragon X75. Since Apple has failed to launch their own 5G chips he expects that in 2024 Apple will be part of the companies that will use this 4nm energy efficient 5G modem.

Apple Is Still Working On Their 5G Chip

In mid 2022 TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also stated that all models of the iPhone 15 series will use Qualcomm’s 5G chips. However he emphasized that despite the failure Apple will keep working on their own 5G chips.

Per these two statements we can conclude that Apple will keep using the Snapdragon 5G Modems for at least 2 more years. This also explains that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 will still use a Snapdragon 5G modem from Qualcomm.

The upcoming CPU with model number ‘SM7475’ is likely to have a tri-cluster design with one prime three gold and four silver cores reports Gizmochina.

The gold is expected to peak at a frequency close to that of the prime core which will operate at 2.4GHz whereas the silver core will operate at 1.8GHz.

As per the report the new chipset is expected to come with new core designs that mean Cortex A715 for Prime and Gold cores and A510 for Silver cores.

The chipset might come with a small performance bump but with improvement in efficiency the report said.

The SM7475 might provide 5-10 per cent higher performance than its predecessor while also being marginally more efficient the report said.

Next month the company is likely to launch the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 might be based on TSMC’s 4nm manufacturing process.

As per reports the chip consists of one X3 super core two A720 large cores two A710 large cores and three A510 high-efficiency cores.

This time a kid ran onto the field at Raymond James Field on Sunday while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were playing the Atlanta Falcons.

They ran onto the field in the second quarter when the Bucs were lining up for the extra point which came after Leonard Fournette's 1-yard touchdown run. The kid didn't appear to get far before they were slammed into the turf by an adult security guard about twice their size. It was not shown on the broadcast (like last week's incident with a fan running onto the field at Levi's Stadium) but a fan at the game caught the very end of the incident on video and posted it on Twitter (there are a couple of salty words used).

What kind of parent lets their kid run on to the field? Smh… #gobucs pic.twitter.com/S3GkCu2vuT — 𝗭𝗮𝗰 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗻𝗲𝗿🎙 (@ZacOnTheMic) October 9 2022

The fan's name and age has not been released because they're a juvenile. Their mother told the Associated Press that they're 10 years old which was later refuted by police who said that they're older than 10. Apparently she had several kids with her at the game and was confused about which one had run onto the field.

A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department confirmed to the AP that an incident involving a juvenile happened at the stadium Sunday but said that no charges have been or will be filed and no arrest will be made.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGtpY2suY29tL25mbC9yb2d1ZS1mYW4tZ2V0cy1wdWx2ZXJpemVkLWJ5LXNlY3VyaXR5LWFmdGVyLXJ1bm5pbmctb250by10aGUtZmllbGQtbWlkLXBhdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buccaneers Fan Gets PULVERIZED By Security After Running Onto Field,"Sunday's Buccaneers game saw a brief delay as a fan ran onto the field. He got absolutely crushed.

Unlike recent events of similar nature the fan was not a protester. It also may not have been an adult.

Video from Raymond-James Stadium in Tampa Bay shows the fan sprinting down the sideline at about the 20-yard-line. He was wearing a Tom Brady jersey and is either a child or an extremely small adult.

Either way his fate was unfortunate though well-deserved. If you play stupid games you're going to win stupid prizes.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers Fan Gets PULVERIZED

From seemingly out of nowhere a team staffer wearing a green shirt emerged and stepped out onto the field in front of the rogue fan. The fan tried his best to get loose and hit the staffer with a shimmy-shake.

It didn't work. At all. Not even a little bit.

The staffer stayed locked on the fan's hips kept a wide base with his feet under him stepped into the tackle and laid him out. It wasn't just a big hit— it was a full-on pile-driver.

The fan got lit up and the staffer drove him into the ground. At that point the security officer that was getting out-run by the fan caught up and took him into custody before escorting him out.

There are very few outcomes that could have come from this fan's on-field effort. Only one of them could have ended well but there was no way that he was getting away and he didn't.

The biggest takeaway here is on the tackle. Whomever it was that wore the green sweatshirt and laid the lumber needs an NFL contract. If there is a team out there looking for a linebacker he is your guy. That man saw his moment to be a hero dialed-in and made it happen. BOOM!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnVjcy8yMDIyLzEwLzA5L2J1Y3MtdG9tLWJyYWR5LXJvZ2VyLXN0YXViYWNoLWRhbGxhcy1jb3dib3lzLXFiLWNvbXBhcmlzb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,QBs for the ages: How does Tom Brady compare to Roger Staubach?,"Yes Tom Brady is the NFL’s all-time leader in passing yards. And touchdowns. And almost every other passing statistic. But what is remarkable — what sets him apart from most athletes in most sports — is that he is still playing at age 45 and still performing at an elite level.

To put that in perspective we’ve come up with a list of history’s greatest quarterbacks as a comparison. Each week we’ll look at the final three seasons of a different quarterback versus what Brady has done with the Bucs in presumably his final three seasons.

It’s not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison because there are differences in eras and most quarterbacks are retired long before 45. But it does give you an idea of how rare it is to see a player still dominating while holding off middle age.

Brady vs. Staubach

The set-up: He was 29 before he won the starting job in Dallas having lost five years to military commitments and two years as Craig Morton’s backup. Yet in his eight seasons as a full-time starter Staubach went to six Pro Bowls won two Super Bowls became a master of the two-minute offense and retired with the highest passer rating at that time in NFL history.

The end: He didn’t go out on top but he was pretty darned close. Staubach won the Super Bowl at age 35 and then finished in the top-five of MVP voting at 36 and 37. In his final regular-season game he threw for 336 yards and two touchdowns in the final 2:20 to beat Washington 35-34. He led the NFL in passer rating in each of his final two seasons.

Staubach

Years: 1977-79

Ages: 35-37

Completed 708 of 1235 passes with 70 touchdowns and 36 interceptions for 9396 yards and an 88.3 passer rating. Was 34-11 as a starter.

Brady

Brady in Week 5: Still missing some receivers but still getting the job done. (And still getting all the best referee’s calls.) Brady threw for a season-high 351 yards and one touchdown in a 21-15 victory against the Falcons a performance that included a highly questionable roughing-the-passer penalty on a third-down sack of Brady that allowed the Bucs to hold on to the ball in the final minutes.

U.K. retailer Scan Computers (via VideoCardz) has listed Nvidia's unannounced GeForce RTX 3060 Ti with upgraded GDDR6X memory.

Nvidia launched the original GeForce RTX 3060 Ti in 2020 but the chipmaker would introduce a second variant earlier this year. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti leveraged the GA104 silicon whereas the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GA103 as its unofficial name implies used the GA103 silicon. It was a die-swap on Nvidia's part since the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GA103 retained the exact specifications as the vanilla model. However the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X flaunts a substantial upgrade in the memory subsystem.

The funny thing about the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X is that Nvidia U.K. doesn't list it on the company's website yet. Instead the chipmaker still lists the regular GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. Adding the GA104-based graphics card to your basket changes to the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X. Apparently Scan Computers is the retailer selling the new variant; however it's not on the U.K. store's website either. But the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X appears in stock and allows you to checkout.

GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X Specifications*

*Specifications are unconfirmed.

Whether the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X utilizes the GA104 or GA103 silicon is unknown. The shopping basket shows the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X with a 1410 MHz base clock and 1670 MHz boost clock. The base clock is the same as the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti; however the boost clock is 5 MHz higher. It's not a big deal since the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X's FP32 performance still maxes out at 16.2 TFLOPs.

The memory quota between the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X remains unchanged at 8GB. Both models still conform to a 256-bit memory bus. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X features faster memory though. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti sports 14 Gbps GDDR6 while the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X has 19 Gbps GDDR6X. The extra firepower will push the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X's memory bandwidth to 608 GBps a massive 36% uplift over the normal version.

The GeForce RTX 3060 and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GA103 adhere to a 200W TDP but the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X model probably has a higher rating. GDDR6X consumes less power per transferred bit in comparison to GDDR6. Despite that total power consumption is higher on GDDR6X because it operates at a faster frequency.

Nvidia U.K. lists the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X for £369 which translates to $409. It's even cheaper than some of the custom models. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X only has a $10 higher price tag than the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti's $399 MSRP. It's good to see that the GDDR6X premium only raised the price by 3%.

It's funny to see Nvidia launch a third variant of the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti this late in the game. True Intel recently launched the Arc A770 but we've already seen that the Arc Alchemist graphics card doesn't pose a threat to the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. Although the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti received a fat memory upgrade it won't magically catch up to the GeForce RTX 3070 either because there's a 21% CUDA separation between the two and not even GDDR6X memory can close that performance gap. Therefore the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X is likely just Nvidia's way of dumping Ampere inventory. Now that the cryptocurrency mining fiasco is over Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3060 series are starting to climb the Steam charts. What better way to keep the momentum than injecting another model into the market?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3J0eC1yZW1peC1xYS13aXRoLXNreWJsaXZpb24tbGVhZC1kZXYtaG9wZXMtZHJlYW1zLWFuZC13b3JyaWVzL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3J0eC1yZW1peC1xYS13aXRoLXNreWJsaXZpb24tbGVhZC1kZXYtaG9wZXMtZHJlYW1zLWFuZC13b3JyaWVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RTX Remix Q&A with Skyblivion Lead Dev – Hopes Dreams and Worries,"NVIDIA's GeForce Beyond GTC event featured some expected announcements (the new GeForce RTX 4000 Series graphics cards and DLSS 3) and a completely unexpected reveal: RTX Remix.

Out of the proverbial left field NVIDIA unveiled a free modding platform capable of remastering DirectX8 and DirectX9 games to include AI-upscaled textures ray traced effects (even highly advanced ones) and support for technologies like DLSS 3 and Reflex. To demonstrate the potential of RTX Remix they showed the RPG classic The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind looking almost like a modern game.

The game choice was likely no coincidence as Bethesda's titles are the most popular on modding communities like Nexus Mods. Following this mindblowing reveal we reached out to some of the most prominent modders to get their perspective on RTX Remix.

Today we're publishing an extensive conversation with Rebelzize the lead developer behind Skyblivion the unofficial remake of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in Skyrim's engine. We talked at length about his take on RTX Remix and also got an update on the total conversion mod project which is now closing in on the final stage of development (volunteers can still apply here). Enjoy!

What did you first think when seeing the RTX Remix announcement from NVIDIA? Did you already speak to your team from Skyblivion about it?

Funnily enough we were actually in Discord hanging out we made it like a group viewing thing. We were watching the event as it was happening live with a good few people from the team.

We were a little bit shocked to be honest. I don't think anyone was expecting NVIDIA to come up with modding tools. Especially the demo from Morrowind it was really really cool and exciting and just kind of mindblowing to see what this tech would allow us to do. Although it's still at least to me a little bit unclear how this will exactly work. I haven't really had time to read up on what these tools will actually do for us but at least from a marketing perspective they clearly did a good job at blowing people's minds.

Everyone from my team was really really at least excited or intrigued by the software and by the pretty impressive visual overhaul that RTX brought to Morrowind in lighting the AI upscaling of textures and of course the remeshing of assets. Or at least they're replacing assets with similar counterparts which was very cool to see in real time.

From my perspective the ability to capture all of the assets directly from the original game seemed the most impressive RTX Remix feature. Do you agree?

Yeah this is definitely the feature that intrigued me the most as well. It looks like you were basically exporting your scene from Morrowind importing it into RTX Remix and then it would allow you to export the new assets basically to replace them in your game. If you look at a project like Skyblivion remaking the assets has been the biggest time sink. For many reasons it's probably one of the biggest aspects of the project. There's tens of thousands of assets that need to be remade. Some are small like a little pot or a table and some are really big like a castle or a house. Seeing RTX Remix at least for a lot of the smaller objects pulling that out of whatever resource it's using behind the scenes was very impressive. It makes you think about how it could impact mods like Skyblivion.

At the same time to a certain extent I do think that AI will have certain limits when it comes to artistic styles. Especially when you look at things like architecture it's important that everything feels like it's part of one cohesive whole. When you let AI run loose.... with the Morrowind example I did personally see assets that I thought didn't quite fit into the scene. Some things were pretty much a perfect replacement while other things just looked a bit out of place. With a small pot or a candle it's hard to go wrong but when you work on more intricate assets it might still be required for someone to do the work themselves.

And I think on top of that something that's very powerful within video game development is to try and optimize your game as well as you possibly can. For a project like Skyblivion this means that we have certain texture materials like standard texture materials that we have in the game. For instance we have ten different wood textures ranking from exterior to interior lower class middle class upper class and a few mismatches that can be used in between. We do the same with bricks mortar and cloth materials and you try to reuse those as much as you can especially for smaller assets that don't need unique textures to save on texture space. I'm not sure with RTX Remix if the AI is able to take that into account because as far as I know it really needs a manual touch to put all the assets on the same trim sheets. But again it's hard to know how the software and how the AI will develop.

Maybe at some point they will actually be able to take that over. What was potentially done in the RTX Remix demo is that they were just taking the original textures and AI upscaling them so that might also just be how the results were achieved and I think that that is how they did it. But that for me raises another question. For instance Bethesda I've been in touch with them about Skyblivion quite recently. I asked them if it would be possible for me to take some Oblivion textures and use AI upscaling to essentially remake them; I asked if that was allowed or not and they told me then that this was not something that they would allow us to do. It's up to them. But that also raised the question of if this was the response to my request to AI upscale textures from Oblivion to use for our own mods and that was not allowed will it be possible for other modders to use RTX Remix to AI upscale Skyrim or Oblivion or the next Elder Scrolls game's textures en masse and upload them? I'm not sure legally how that would work but that raises an interesting question at the very least.

Interestingly I've been in one of the RTX Remix press presentations where someone actually did ask about potential copyright issues and what developers would think about this. Well NVIDIA said they already talked to many studios and as far as the reaction goes it was really good. It didn't sound like they had any issues with RTX Remix so far. That was interesting to hear but of course the AI upscaling textures tool seems to be pretty central to RTX Remix. If it was true that Bethesda won't allow it then that would be very disappointing as their games are a big part of the mod community. Maybe NVIDIA can get them to relent on this topic.

Yeah or maybe it's also just a matter of in this case a bigger brand a bigger company approaching them and asking the same question; maybe that also makes a difference. We don't know what the politics are behind the scenes. Whatever the case is I accept that it's not a problem. I love Bethesda all the same. It's not a deal breaker for me in any case.

Another key goal of RTX Remix according to NVIDIA is to simplify things. Once captured the assets will be converted to the USD format. That allows them to be tweaked in many tools including NVIDIA's Omniverse. They've said it will be possible for one modder to be working in Blender while another is working in Adobe Substance and their work can then be synchronized pretty much in real time. That sounded like it would be really good for huge projects like yours.

Yeah. I think a big part of modding any game is that oftentimes we don't have a lot of tools at our disposal or at least we don't have the tools that the studios had internally to make the games. Oftentimes these tools are then made by community members which can sometimes take years and often also don't work as well as they should. So any help you can get to make it easier to export models and remake them in the case of Skyblivion I think that that would be a huge help. On top of that I work with modding tools but the definition of what modding is really depends on the actual mod. I don't remake assets I'm not a 3D artist. When I mod I make maps I make interesting locations I make quests and other content within the game. While other people take it upon themselves to remake all the assets of Skyrim for instance because they were very low resolution or the meshes themselves were very very undetailed which is a completely different skill set.

For instance using these RTX remix tools to help me replace some meshes or maybe even make new ones for my own mods. I think would allow a lot more modders to potentially enter aspects of modeling that have previously been very difficult for them to get into. I mean even now you can get free assets on something like Sketchfab to use in your mods because there are some resources out there. But again RTX Remix might simplify that process by a whole lot and give you a lot more freedom to experiment. At least that's what it looks like. But time I guess will tell.

We'll have to wait for its release to know all the details. Coming to the next question do you fear that projects like Skyblivion Skywind or Beyond Skyrim might be rendered obsolete by NVIDIA's RTX Remix?

Luckily I don't think so. There's one thing that RTX Remix can do that we cannot which is the fantastic lighting. That's been its strength so far. We've seen that with Minecraft as well for instance and that's really cool. But other than that I think projects like Skywind Skyblivion and Beyond Skyrim are more than just a coat of paint which I think RTX Remix is to some extent. It allows you to really spruce up the older DX8 and DX9 games. It allows you to AI upscale your textures improve the lighting and replace or move models within the game world. And that's great. But I think the strength of projects like Skyblivion and Skywind is that they go a step further than that; they actually take the old games and put them in a new engine. With that you get improved mechanics and a much more enjoyable player experience. Even with the best mods Morrowind still plays like Morrowind. It doesn't change the game or the mechanics. It's easier to try and remake mechanics in a newer game. Skywind has an armor system for instance which allows you to separate your armor sets into all the different pieces that you're familiar with from Morrowind. Skyblivion has the armor degradation system from Oblivion remade as well. We also have spellcrafting in both Skyblivion and Skywind so all the mechanics that people love from the original games are there.

It's just the experience of playing it is a whole lot more comfortable and more modern than Morrowind can ever be even after an RTX Remix remaster. Because of that I don't think that these mods or modern projects will ever be obsolete. If anything it might help more people get into the original game and then as a result also make some of those new people hyped for the project that we are working on. I don't think that we're threatening one or the other. I think we can coexist and maybe in some ways help each other a little bit.

That's true. RTX Remix is mostly a remastering tool whereas in your case you are remaking Oblivion but in a newer engine that can do a lot more things than the original one. So that's obviously going to be a better experience in many ways. As you said unfortunately RTX Remix is currently limited to DX8 and DX9 games that use fixed graphics pipelines. During the press Q&A I mentioned earlier NVIDIA said that they are researching the possibility of expanding compatibility to more recent APIs. Let's say that they find a way to support even newer games like Skyrim. Would you want to use it to speed up the process of making assets improving lighting etc.?

Hell yeah if it's available I would want to use it 100%. I think though that the problem is for one thing the lighting that comes with RTX is only compatible with RTX GPUs. The problem there is that you're locking features away for certain users which I think is fine as long as it's optional and you don't force people to own an RTX card which would be a bit sad. Other than that in terms of the assets unfortunately or maybe fortunately with the current state of the project the only assets we really have left to do are clothing architecture and the occasional weapon. From what I've seen RTX Remix is not able to create these assets. We try and make as I mentioned earlier cohesive weapons and armor and clothing. They require good concept art and certain rules to ensure that the clothing feels like it's all part of the same game world. We want the people of Cyrodiil to have a very distinct look and not look anything like Skyrim for instance.

Cyrodiil needs to feel warm and colorful and multicultural whereas Skyrim is more for the Nords by the Nords; it's more gray and cold etc. So I think it's hard to portray the art style in the more intricate and difficult assets. If the RTX Remix tools could make architecture that I would 100% be excited for. While it's pretty easy to make architecture for a product like Skyblivion since the architecture in Oblivion itself was already really good giving the perfect cheat sheet it still needs to be done. And because they're bigger parts and not as interesting as a weapon it's very hard to find artists to do them. If for those kinds of assets you could use a tool to help remake them that would be fantastic. I would 100% love to use that. But again until we actually use the tools we won't know their limits and how powerful they are. But yeah should it be possible especially for the tedious things I would love to try and use some AI to assist.

That makes sense. With regards to the RTX tidbits the good news is that while you actually need to own an RTX graphics card to make mods with RTX Remix to actually play them you just need a graphics card that supports Vulkan ray tracing so one of the latest from AMD or Intel work as well. We've talked at length about RTX Remix but what can you tell me about Skyblivion today? It's pretty far along now isn't it?

Honestly it's come a really long way especially in the last year year and a half I'd say we've gotten a lot of milestones checked off. Recently we finished the last creatures for the project we have been able to do at least half of the architecture that needs to be done which doesn't sound so exciting but as I mentioned earlier architectures are really really really big 3D workloads that not a whole lot of people are interested in so that's been really good and pretty much all the clutter has been finished for instance which was also a really big 3D task. In terms of quests I think we have around 2/3 of quests implemented at this point which is also really huge.

When we go into the game these days to test things out it looks and feels like a proper game. A lot of things are final and actually playable. The biggest problem that we have and every project like us has is that generally people stick around for a limited time. It's a volunteer project so there's very few people who have been here from the start and are still here. I'm a bit of a loner in that regard as a lot of the people that I used to work with when we just started have since moved on. That's their right I'm not upset about that. I'm super glad that they've been able to do what they have done. But as the project grows older some senior people who have been helping out with it at some point move on. Perhaps they move to a new country they get a very high-end job they get married they have kids stuff like that which makes it sometimes a bit difficult to keep the momentum up and to keep the project moving forwards at the pace that's been moving forward. Because of that we try and work on developer diaries we try to give people an update. We're currently working on a new video project that we hope will be a bit more mainstream; with a bit of luck it might go a little viral and we'll bring in the last volunteers for this.

But I really think this is the last piece of Skyblivion's development cycle. The amount of work that actually is left at this point is actually manageable whereas two years ago it still felt like we were reaching for the stars and that the whole project as a releasable product was still kind of a bit dicey and uncertain. We're in a really good spot now where the last few quests just need to get implemented into the game by the talented team that's currently in charge of that the last assets need to be made and then the last stage of the project will really be to stitch everything together make sure it all gets in the game and works as it should. I think that that last stage will be interesting but also very time-consuming but very exciting at the same time.

Game developers usually say the last 10% of game development is as intensive as the previous 90% because they have to as you said stitch everything together and polish it up. Still I've been following and covering Skyblivion for quite a while so I'm glad to see it progressing well. We can say it will be released before The Elder Scrolls VI right? Because that's quite far away.

I should hope so. It's difficult because on one hand I'm a really big Bethesda and Elder Scrolls fan and on the other hand this project needs to be released before The Elder Scrolls VI for it to actually stay relevant. If Bethesda was to announce tomorrow out of nowhere that TES VI will be coming out this holiday season I would be very conflicted. I would be ecstatic and stressed and sad because there's no way we can wrap up Skyblivion in the next two or three months. That's not gonna be possible but yeah hopefully we do come out on top before TES VI; I think we can do that. I never want to make promises but I think we can do it.

By my reckoning The Elder Scrolls VI won't be released before 2026 or 2027 so you have time.

That's definitely more than enough time. I really hope we don't have to wait that long though. That would suck.

On that note I remember covering a statement of yours pleading to Bethesda to improve their engine before The Elder Scrolls VI.

That's funny the statement blew up; I got contacted about it a lot. I didn't expect it to get as much traction as it did. What we've seen with the new Creation Engine looks very exciting. I saw a documentary from NoClip where someone was working with the engine. One of the things I noticed is that it uses very similar markers I'm familiar with from Skyrim. It's still Creation Engine but the big difference is that it looks very good. I think from a tech perspective there are also a lot more tools at their disposal. They have mentioned that the planets are procedurally generated which I think is insane. From the Starfield gameplay demo I noticed that the terrain is part of the land mesh. In Skyrim if we wanted to create a mountain you take a land mesh and drag it up and place rocks against it. Here it was one seamless landmesh from the looks of it which means that the tools have taken a really big leap. Maybe it'll be easier for someone like myself to start working on a planet and terraform it and make it into the biome we have in mind without spending hundreds or even thousands of hours. The lighting looks really good as well.

Indeed Todd Howard from Bethesda said it's the biggest technological leap from game to game for the Creation Engine. Also there was a bit of a controversy when they announced the total number of planets. Some felt that they would be useless since they were procedurally generated but as Todd hinted later Bethesda may have done it to make Starfield a modder's paradise.

Possibly. We've discussed it internally with the Skyblivion team and there's already a couple who are very excited to take one of those planets and turn it into something else entirely. It seems like they know what they're doing. They've always given us modders the credit we deserve we're a really big part of Bethesda games. They've seemingly thought about us when it comes to giving us the space and playgrounds to do our own things and that's cool. Hopefully as with Fallout and Elder Scrolls the Starfield modding community will take off and have its own place.

Would you want to participate in Starfield modding or do you plan to focus on Skyblivion?

I kind of have to focus on Skyblivion. I won't lie though I will certainly play Starfield because it's a game I've been looking forward to for a very long time. I will definitely also give the modding tools a look to see what's changed. But when it comes to actually making mods for Starfield I think I'll let that one slide and leave it to my fellow modders who are currently not tied up with larger projects.

Thank you so much for your time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9OVklESUEtR2VGb3JjZS1SVFgtNDA3MC1QdXJwb3J0ZWQtRm91bmRlcnMtRWRpdGlvbi1kZXNpZ24tc3VyZmFjZXMtYmVhcmluZy1zaW1pbGFyaXRpZXMtd2l0aC1SVFgtMzA4MC42NjA1NTkuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070: Purported Founders Edition design surfaces bearing similarities with RTX 3080,"According to reports NVIDIA is preparing the RTX 4070 an AD104-based graphics card with 10 GB or 12 GB of GDDR6X VRAM. Sporting Ada Lovelace's subtle redesigns the RTX 4070 Founders Edition is alleged to resemble a shorter RTX 3080 Founders Edition card.

4 Reviews

NVIDIA is on the verge of releasing the GeForce RTX 4090 making it the first Ada Lovelace-based graphics card to reach the market. For context the company has also introduced the RTX 4080 12 GB and RTX 4080 16 GB as well as the RTX 6000 Ada Generation. However Moore's Law Is Dead (MLID) claims to have received information about the GeForce RTX 4070.

Focusing on the Founders Edition model the leaker asserts that the RTX 4070 will be a two-slot graphics card which should come as no surprise. Purportedly the RTX 4070 will be closer in size to the RTX 3080 than the RTX 3070 as the graphic below attempts to demonstrate. Currently MLID expects NVIDIA to base the RTX 4070 around the AD104 a GPU that the company already uses in the RTX 4080 12 GB.

In other words the RTX 4070 will be a cut-down RTX 4080 12 GB. Reputedly NVIDIA is targeting two sets of specifications. Conversely it may be informing people of conflicting information to determine the sources of leaks. Either way MLID speculates that NVIDIA will launch the RTX 4070 with 10 GB of GDDR6X VRAM running at 21 Gbps and a 250 W TGP if AMD has not released anything competitive. Alternatively NVIDIA will uprate the RTX 4070 to 12 GB of the same VRAM and a 285 W TGP if it needs to position the card more aggressively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtNDA5MC1nb2VzLXVwLXRvLTMxMzUtbWh6LXdpdGgtNDkzdy1wZWFrLXBvd2VyLWNvbnN1bXB0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 goes up to 3135 MHz with 493W peak power consumption,"NVIDIA RTX 40 GPU can reach 3.135 GHz clock shows newly leaked screenshot

According to the screenshots shared by hardware leaker wnxod the RTX 4090 may easily reach high frequencies with relatively small power increase.

There are two screenshots shared by the leaker both showing TechPowerUP GPU-Z Sensor tab with details on the undisclosed graphics card. However given that there is only one gaming card that has a TDP of 450W it is relatively easy to guess it’s RTX 4090 GPU.

The first screenshot shows a default clock of 2730 MHz which from what we gathered so far is a typical clock to be seen in most synthetic tests and gaming. However the clock speed will vary depending on the intensity of the graphics settings and resolutions so it may still go lower or higher. Unfortunately wnxod did not confirm what was being tested in this particular example.

What is confirmed though is that the card reached 65.6°C with a hot spot reaching 73.4°C and that’s with a current power reading of 446.9W. This means we are looking at stock settings with default TDP of 450W. The fan speed reading for two fans shows 1652/1653 RPM which is a 40% of maximum fan speed.

The second screenshot is a bit more interesting because it shows a peak GPU clock of 3135 MHz thus far the highest frequency shown in any leak regarding the RTX 4090. The temperature has only slightly increased to a peak at 68.2°C. Furthermore it shows that the peak power consumption of the whole card was 492.8W so less than 50W more than in the previous screenshots.

There are a few things to note however. First we do not know what workload was used it could just as well be some ancient gaming benchmark that has very low GPU use. Second the real-time values are not shown here so we can only see peak. Also keep in mind that 50.6 MHz memory clock and hot spot temperature of 40.3°C are minimum values not the maximum.

Margot Robbie is more than happy to be passing the torch for one of her most iconic roles.

The 32-year-old actress said in an interview with MTV posted Thursday that she is ""so happy"" to see other actresses stepping into the role of Harley Quinn specifically Lady Gaga who is rumored to be playing the part in the upcoming Joker: Folie à Deux.

""It makes me so happy because I said from the very beginning all I want is for Harley Quinn to be one of those characters the way Macbeth or Batman always gets passed from great actor to great actor"" Robbie said.

She continued by saying that there is an opportunity for a performer to make an iconic role their own.

""And I feel like in not so many cases are they female characters"" she explained. ""Queen Elizabeth I but like beyond that — which I got to have a crack at as well which I was honored to do. I was like 'Wow Cate Blanchett did Queen Elizabeth I. Now I get to.'""

She added of Gaga: ""It's such an honor to have built a foundation strong enough that Harley can now be one of those characters who other actors get to have a go at playing. And I think she'll do something incredible with it.""

Lady Gaga confirmed her casting in director Todd Phillips' Joker: Folie à Deux on social media in August posting an animated video of her and Joaquin Phoenix's silhouettes set to old-timey music.

The 36-year-old superstar actress and musician is set to star alongside Phoenix 47 in the upcoming musical sequel to 2019's Joker though her role has not been announced.

PEOPLE confirmed Gaga's involvement in the film — specifically that she was in talks to play Harley Quinn — back in June.

Folie à Deux which references a delusion or mental illness shared by two people suggests that Joker may also team up with another supervillain — possibly his sometimes-girlfriend Harley.

While plot and character details are still unknown Harley — originally known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel — is villain Joker's love interest/sidekick in several iterations of the Batman story and met the sinister prankster while serving as his psychiatrist at Gotham City's Arkham Asylum.

Rolland Wormley later described alternately as Price's boyfriend and fiancé was behind the wheel that night and recalled the shooting as a burst of chaos during their drive back from Compton Calif. to Price's half-a-million dollar home in Corona some 40 miles to the east.

""I'm trying to get through this. I'm trying to get away I'm trying to get her to safety"" Wormley told the Los Angeles Times in 2003. ""Once I get to Long Beach Boulevard I see the back window is shattered. I look to the right and said 'Baby are you all right?' I look at [Price] and there was blood everywhere.""

Frantic Wormley took Price to his mother's house not far away where she called 911. Price was pronounced dead at an area hospital not long after. She was 31.

She was the oldest sister of Serena and Venus Williams. She'd been shot about a mile and a half from the tennis courts where her younger sisters learned to play the sport that made them stars.

""When [Venus and Serena] received the calls from all of us here they were saying 'Are you sure this is correct?' They couldn't believe it"" a spokeswoman for the family told PEOPLE in the days after Price died.

This account of Price's slaying and its subsequent investigation — a 15-year-old homicide thrust again into the spotlight by the release of her killer according to authorities — is based on previous PEOPLE reporting as well as articles from the Associated Press the L.A. Times and the New York Times.

The Williams' sister's sudden death sent shockwaves through the close-knit family. Venus got the news in New York City where she was visiting for Fashion Week. Serena was in Toronto filming for the cable series Street Time and by one account became visibly distraught when she learned her sister had been fatally shot. Both flew to L.A. where they were joined by mom Oracene (who had Price in a previous relationship) and their dad Richard.

In those first hours and days afterward however it remained unclear exactly what happened with witnesses giving differing accounts that suggested there had been an altercation before the shooting that involved Price and Wormley.

In fact investigators would learn the gunman had opened fire on their vehicle as they drove down the boulevard by a suspected drug house. Wormley maintained the attack was unprovoked though prosecutors argued the shooting was revenge against another gang.

Apprehension of the accused was no less fraught: While one of the alleged shooters was taken into custody within hours the second Robert Edward Maxfield was not caught until January 2004 following months of tracking by law enforcement.

Maxfield whom police said was a member of the Southside Crips was arrested in a raid in Athens Calif. He was unsuccessfully tried twice for murder before pleading no contest to a lesser charge just before the start of his third trial. (A no-contest plea essentially has the same effect as a guilty plea but the defendant does not admit the accusations against them.)

In April 2006 nearly three years after Price was shot Maxfield was sentenced to 15 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter with credit for the time he had already served behind bars.

In March 2018 he was released on parole. Then he was arrested again in Compton for allegedly violating his parole. Efforts to reach him directly or a previous attorney in his case were unsuccessful.

Speaking generally a spokesman for the state's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told PEOPLE that someone who violates their parole then goes before a judge could have their parole revoked at which point they would be sent back to jail.

The DOC's Luis Patiño confirmed that the possible parole violation was being investigated.

Meanwhile in the wake of Price's killing the Williams family grieved and healed — slowly. ""She was a wonderful person"" Serena said in 2004. ""We're dealing with it however we can. Some days are better than others.""

Serena appeared at Maxfield's court hearings for the first time when he was sentenced in 2006. According to the Times she told him that while she hadn't planned to speak ""because it's too hard for me"" she felt it was more important to say how ""unfair"" Price's killing had been ""to our family.""

""Our family has always been positive and we always try to help people"" she said.

In an interview with PEOPLE in 2007 Serena said it was ""still hard"" for her to talk about.

""Yetunde and I were so close; she changed my diapers"" Serena said. ""But I finally came to an acceptance of things.""

‘She Meant a Lot to Us’

Price a nurse mother of three and part owner of a modest hair salon also worked as a personal assistant to Serena and Venus keeping track of their appointments and the like even joining them at Wimbledon. But she also led a largely independent life in California.

In an interview with PEOPLE in August 2003 shortly before she died Price seemed to have no regrets about steering clear of the slipstream of her famous kin. ""They're still my sisters"" she said. ""We don't get into the fame thing too much when we're all together as a family.""

Price lived in a comfortable home in an upscale neighborhood in Corona. According to locals she doted on her three kids two boys and a girl all of whom were under the age of 12 when she was killed. On the evening before the shooting Price and her children visited with friends across the street. She watched part of the Oscar De La Hoya boxing match before making sure the kids would be taken care of and heading off with Wormley on her fatal trip.

Wormley told the L.A. Times that he had been at a picnic and she came to pick him up after he lost track of time that night.

Years later Price's spirit remains strong both in her family and the community where they grew up. Serena and Venus opened the Yetunde Price Resource Center in Compton in late 2016.

""We definitely wanted to honor our sister's memory because she was a great sister; she was our oldest sister and obviously she meant a lot to us"" Serena said then according to The Root. ""And it meant a lot to us to myself and to Venus and my other sisters as well Isha and Lyndrea that we've been wanting to do something for years in memory of her especially the way it happened a violent crime.""

""Basically how does the family react? If her kids didn't have my mom and us it could be really devastating"" Serena said. ""But we had such a great system that they're doing pretty good. We just felt like people that didn't have that opportunity to fall back on; what could they do? And that's kind of how this resource center came about.""

Redding Police were made aware of a possible burglary in progress at the 99 Cents Only Store in Redding.

A man later identified to be 51-year-old Rafael Zendejas was reportedly smashing the store's front windows with rocks.





Upon arrival officers saw several smashed windows at the front of the store. Zendejas then reportedly threw additional rocks at the front windows of the Ross Dress For Less Store causing several of them to shatter as well.







Officers immediately gave verbal commands telling him to stop so they could take him into custody. However officials say Zendejas refused to comply and walked away from officers while carrying a dark object in his hand.

Officers then made several attempts to communicate with him and to de-escalate the situation. Still he continued to be uncooperative and yelled at police officers while walking past several other stores to the south end of the shopping center.

According to police officers proceeded to use non-lethal force including bean bag rounds and K9 unit 'Otto' to make him comply and take him into custody. After a brief struggle Zendejas was safely taken into custody.





The officer's investigations revealed that Zendejas shattered or damaged six storefront windows at the 99 Cents Only Store and three storefront windows at the Ross Dress For Less Store.

Zendejas was reportedly taken to a local hospital for medical treatment and was booked into Shasta County Jail for Attempted Burglary Felony Vandalism and Resisting Arrest.

You’re long overdue for a vacation but there are so many options for how to spend your precious PTO! With getaways ranging from unique vacation home rentals across the country cruises across the globe and even luxurious all-inclusive resorts the decision can be tough but let’s be honest here - nothing quite rivals the care-free thrilling experience that you can only get on a cruise ship.

Once that you’ve decided you’re ready to hit the high seas the next decision you have to make is a tricky one – choosing the right cruise.

While any cruise is better than no cruise you can’t go wrong with the cruise industry’s two prominent leaders – Royal Caribbean and Disney Cruise Line. While Disney is a brand that everyone knows and loves renowned for world-class guest service and creating magical family-friendly memories Royal Caribbean has become synonymous with epic adventures and mind-blowing experiences.

Earlier this summer I sailed on the Disney Wish and Mariner of the Seas the same week which gave me the opportunity to compare and contrast the two lines in quick succession.

To help you figure out which cruise is best for you here are five major things to consider when picking your cruise line.

Wallet economics

For most budget is the big deciding factor when making most of your vacation decisions.

If you’ve ever been to one of the Disney parks it should come as no surprise that Disney cruises often come at a premium cost. Until the most recent Disney+ subscriber promotion discounted rates are extremely limited almost exclusively to military members and Florida residents.

With that in mind once you’ve locked in your Disney Cruise Line stateroom if you do manage to see a better rate you have to cancel and rebook in most cases. Luckily you can save money on your Disney cruise with Disney Visa rewards dollars using your Disney Visa credit card or by purchasing discounted Disney gift cards from places like Sam’s Club or Costco.

Alternatively Royal Caribbean is known for offering great sales during the year ranging from $550 off + 30% off guests kids sail free and more. With that in mind Royal Caribbean also runs sales on their cruise add-ons like drink packages wi-fi and more.

Often cruisers get the option to bid on upgrading to a better category room close to the departure date with Royal Caribbean’s Royal Up program. Just like Disney Royal Caribbean has their own Visa card that offers rewards ranging from onboard credits and stateroom upgrades to cruises.

To put this in full perspective looking at two similar cruises out of Miami Royal Caribbean offers a 4-night cruise starting at $896 for two adults whereas Disney is offering a 3-night cruise for two adults starting at $1734.

When it comes to counting dollars and cents the undeniable winner is Royal Caribbean.

Sleeping arrangements

One major consideration that often goes overlooked is your stateroom.

The common misconception is that all cruise staterooms are tiny hole-in-the-walls akin to a can of sardines where you all pack in just to sleep.

Wrong!

With the right stateroom you can create a home on the high seas that keeps everyone happy and most importantly comfy!

Cruise staterooms range from budget-friendly space-efficient inside staterooms some with virtual portholes to create a faux window to the seas outside to luxurious suites like the fun-tastic Royal Caribbean Ultimate Family Suite or the extra-magical Disney Cruise Line Funnel Tower Suite.

While actual staterooms available vary ship to ship on average Disney Cruise Line takes the win when comparing the size of the most common stateroom types.

For example an inside stateroom on most Royal Caribbean ships is around 150 square feet while on most Disney ships inside staterooms are closer to 170 square feet.

Similarly ocean view rooms on Royal Caribbean start at 180 square feet compared to Disney’s 204 square feet with ocean view balcony rooms on Royal Caribbean starting at 188 square feet and Disney’s verandah rooms starting at a stunning 246 square feet.

Although Disney Cruise Line undisputedly boasts the larger rooms Royal Caribbean is not to be overlooked with its wide variety of room types including staterooms with a view of their Promenade or Boardwalk area (perfect for people-watching and observing onboard fun right from your interior balcony) a variety of suite class staterooms with upgraded amenities and the favorite for larger groups – the ultra spacious rooms.

On many Royal Caribbean ships the ultra spacious ocean view or ocean view balcony staterooms offer a larger stateroom with a separated bunk bed area that’s ideal for adding some privacy and extra space when you’re traveling with a larger crew. The closest option to this on Disney Cruise Line is the deluxe family staterooms. These rooms are slightly larger to accommodate up to five and have a curtain you can pull out to create a partition.

Another great accommodation for bigger parties is the connecting balcony stateroom category on Royal Caribbean which allows two staterooms to share a balcony and even a connecting door inside as well if you’d like. This creates a spacious option for larger parties. With this in mind both cruise lines offer swanky one- and two- bedroom suites that come with concierge service and extra perks for when you want both space and to treat yourself to luxury on the high seas.

Obviously your options for staterooms are plentiful on both cruise lines and any stateroom is better than being stuck on dry land. That said there’s no clear winner in this category so it’s up to you to pick which one better suits your sailing needs.

Forktastic dining options

The food on a cruise is truly the best part. Did you know the average cruiser gains upwards of seven pounds on a cruise? If you go hungry while cruising that’s truly your own fault. That said there are some big differences between the dining experience on Royal Caribbean and that of Disney Cruise Line.

Dinner is where Disney Cruise Line truly shines as they bring the magic and performance art you’re used to seeing at the parks straight into the main dining room.

Once onboard you’ll receive a dining rotation to let you know which dining room to report to each night for your decadent dinner show. Disney Cruise Line’s dinner is an event in itself as each dining room and menu is heavily themed along with some form of entertainment you’ll enjoy while you please your tastebuds.

These shows range anywhere from musical performances like New Orleans-style jazz to singing along with the your favorite Frozen moments to interactive conversations with digital Disney characters like Crush from Finding Nemo and Olaf or watching Ant-Man and The Wasp showcase their latest and greatest technology.

While Disney truly does dinner like no one else at sea Royal Caribbean still satisfies your palette with a diverse list of specialty options that varies from ship to ship.

Each night you can choose to enjoy your evening meal at the Windjammer buffet sit down to a divine three-course meal in one of the main dining halls or you can take it up a notch with the heat of hibachi of Izumi or the mind-boggling wonders of molecular gastronomy found in Wonderland among a myriad of other options depending on the ship you’re on.

However when considering dietary options like vegan and gluten-free for instance Royal Caribbean doesn’t quite keep up with Disney in this category. All of Disney’s destinations cruise ships included truly shine when it comes to special dietary needs. They don’t just give you a few run-of-the-mill dietary friendly options they craft delicious culinary creations that are on par with everything else they serve.

That’s not to say that you can’t have your dietary needs met on Royal Caribbean as they also do a great job making sure all diners eat incredibly well but there truly isn’t a major cruise line that offers the specialty food options that Disney does.

For this particular category it’s a close call as Disney wins in the dinner and dietary needs arena but Royal Caribbean takes the cake for overall dining variety across the ship.

Entertain me!

When choosing a cruise it’s important to think about what you ideally would like to actually do once you get on the ship.

Are you in need of some intensive rest and relaxation? Maybe you need some dedicated time to really burn some calories or you want to release your inner dare devil? Have you always wanted to try your hand at a blackjack table? Has it been too long since your last live theater show?

With so many things to experience on cruise ships and with the vast array of options you can find on different ships knowing what activities and entertainment options you would like can help solidify which cruise line and even which specific ships are perfect for you.

If you’re looking for rest and relaxation Disney Cruise Line surprisingly boasts one of the most unique spa experiences at sea – the Rain Forest Room by Senses Spa.

This is a private area with a limited number entries (purchased separately) offering guests a number of ways to unwind from steam rooms to hot tubs (on most ships) heated tile loungers rain showers and more. This is also the most quiet zen space you’ll ever find on a cruise ship.

If you don’t want to pay extra for the Rain Forest Room but are still looking for a kid-free place to relax have no fear there are adult-only pool and hot tub areas across all Disney ships.

While Disney ships do specialize in rest and relaxation they also have a lot to do on their ships. Every ship has a gym with great equipment including treadmills overlooking the water and a variety of fitness classes (some included some cost extra). There are also sports courts jogging tracks pools and hot tubs water slides and so much more.

There’s also incredible entertainment for all ages ranging from first run movies in a relaxed movie theater setting to stellar entertainment akin to the amazing shows you see in the parks. Depending on the ship there are classics like Aladdin and The Little Mermaid as well as unique shows like The Golden Mickeys and Seas the Adventure.

Of course don’t forget about the character experiences across the ship and the infamous Pirate Night on select cruises where you’ll celebrate your inner scalawag with pirate activities and even fireworks at sea.

If you’re ready for some blood-pumping thrills at sea Royal Caribbean has dedicated their entire fleet to creating a bolder experience at sea that you’d never even think was possible.

Over the past few years Royal Caribbean has taken cruising to a whole new level by “amplifying” their fleet of ships with a bevy of new experiences from dining and Broadway-style entertainment to never-before-seen activities. For those who can’t sit still this ranges from ice skating rock climbing Flow Rider simulated surfing and laser tag to RipCord by iFly simulated skydiving SkyPad bungee trampoline escape rooms and so much more.

If you’re looking to be entertained the unique Aqua Theater brings you water shows with spectacular stunts and incredible feats of athleticism like you’ve never seen. Once you’ve dried off you can head to the indoor theater for classic performances like Grease and Mama Mia! many ships also feature ice skating shows or you can check out any number of musical acts at venues across the ship. If you’re looking to test your luck with cards or slots each ship also boasts a casino with your choice of games to try.

If you’ve never gambled before don’t worry at the start of each cruise there are classes to teach you how to play.

While there might be a ton of things on the itinerary there are also great ways to unwind from adult pool and hot tub areas to booking your very own spa mani/pedi or hair appointment at the Senses Spa which is the exact same spa you’ll find on Disney Cruise Line as well.

This particular category is tough one to choose a winner for depending on what kind of cruise you’re really looking for but ultimately if you’re looking to find some zen Disney Cruise Line takes the gold but if you’re in the market for thrills and shenanigans Royal Caribbean is the undisputed champion in that arena.

Private islands & destinations

While a big part of what makes a cruise special is what happens on the ship the destination ports are a hugely important consideration as this is a great way to get a bite-sized taste of places and cultures you’ve never experienced.

Disney Cruise Line boasts 5 very lovely ships with itineraries heavy in the Caribbean as well as Alaska the Mexican Riviera the Mediterranean and a few other locations depending on the time of year with new itineraries being added on a regular basis.

The tricky part for Disney Cruise Line is that with such a small fleet in comparison to other cruise lines they are mildly limited on the variety of available ports and destination options. That said there are still plenty of options to choose from including their magical private island Disney’s Castaway Cay.

Castaway Cay is an intimate Bahamian escape with some really special unique experiences you won’t find anywhere else. For the runners and walkers looking to get some extra steps in there’s a complimentary steamy hot 5k course complete with a finisher’s medal upon crossing the finish line.

There’s also a beautiful bike route that cruises by a lookout tower multiple cabana areas (including the adults-only Serenity Bay) and a massive snorkeling area with special sunken treasures ready for you to come and find them. In the works for 2024 is a brand new Bahamian private island Disney’s Lighthouse Point. Little has been released about what should be expected at this new location but it’s sure to be spectacular.

On the other side Royal Caribbean boasts an astonishing fleet of 25 ships in varying sizes that offer itineraries visiting over 240 destinations in 61 countries ranging from the Caribbean and Alaska to Asia and Australia even the upcoming 274-night Ultimate World Cruise as well as two fabulous private islands – Labadee Haiti and Perfect Day at Coco Cay Bahamas.

Labadee is absolutely picturesque with lush green mountains overlooking a crystalline sea. The coastline is dotted with experiences of all types from relaxing private cabanas to epic water slides and aquatic fun even a roller coaster that will take you on a scenic journey across this totally Instagram-able escape.

Not too far away is the new Perfect Day at Coco Cay which is no lie there’s a perfect day awaiting for everyone no matter your interests. If you’re into high-speed water park fun there’s Thrill Waterpark featuring Daredevil’s Peak – the tallest water slide in North America. Looking for to soak up some rays in your own private cabana? Check out Coco Beach Club or Chill Island with incredible snorkeling private cabanas and delicious food options.

There’s also Oasis Lagoon for those looking for a party – with the largest freshwater pool in the Caribbean a swim up bar and live DJ. There’s truly a little something for everyone at Perfect Day at Coco Cay.

Comparing Disney Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean when it comes to destinations and private islands is a tough call as they both will take you to amazing places across the world and both offer fun-tastic private locales Royal Caribbean has more ships departing from more ports with more itineraries across the world giving you more options to explore on your cruise-cation.

While there are a lot of things to consider when selecting your perfect cruise any cruise is better than no cruise! Whether it’s the magic of Disney Cruise Line with their classic character experiences and delicious dining room rotation or the epic adventure of Royal Caribbean featuring giant thrills and endless activities you’re in for the vacation of a lifetime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL25vcndlZ2lhbi1kcm9wcy1kcmluay1wYWNrYWdlLWVkZ2UtaXQtaGVsZC1vdmVyLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jYXJuaXZhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norwegian Drops Drink Package Edge it Held Over Royal Caribbean Carnival,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/norwegian-drops-drink-package-edge-it-held-over-royal-caribbean-carnival on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL25vcndlZ2lhbi1kcm9wcy1kcmluay1wYWNrYWdlLWVkZ2UtaXQtaGVsZC1vdmVyLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jYXJuaXZhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFnZXdlc3QuY29tL1RyYXZlbC9DYXJpYmJlYW4vY2FyaWJiZWFuLWZvb2QtdG91cnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Must-Try Food Tours and Experiences in the Caribbean,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFnZXdlc3QuY29tL1RyYXZlbC9DYXJpYmJlYW4vY2FyaWJiZWFuLWZvb2QtdG91cnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7BCAF80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFnZXdlc3QuY29tL1RyYXZlbC9DYXJpYmJlYW4vY2FyaWJiZWFuLWZvb2QtdG91cnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYmFyYmFkb3N0b2RheS5iYi8yMDIyLzEwLzA4Lzg2Mi1iYXJiYWRpYW5zLWdldC1jcnVpc2Utam9icy1tb3JlLWNvbWluZy_SAVNodHRwczovL2JhcmJhZG9zdG9kYXkuYmIvMjAyMi8xMC8wOC84NjItYmFyYmFkaWFucy1nZXQtY3J1aXNlLWpvYnMtbW9yZS1jb21pbmcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,862 Barbadians get cruise jobs more coming,"Out of the recent Royal Caribbean Group job fair and the Princess Cruises recruitment sessions Barbados Tourism Marketing Inc’s (BTMI) Senior Business Development Officer in the Cruise Department Tia Broomes announced that a total of 862 persons have received job assignments onboard.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

But what viewers may be more struck by or even insulted by are the heavily accented caricatures the young scion used to dramatize his points.

Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

Whether it be on an online server such as iCloud DropBox Google Files etc many of us often forget the more portable offline solutions for cases when Wi-Fi or internet is not always available. That’s where the Seagate FireCuda External Hard Drive: Ghost-Spider Special Edition comes into play.

The Seagate FireCuda external hard drive is one of many external drives on the market. I had the opportunity to test out the Seagate FireCuda External Hard Drive: Ghost-Spider Special Edition with 2 TB of storage. With it comes a braided data transfer cable and some special edition Spider-Man and Marvel stickers.

Unlike most drives on the market the Seagate FireCuda external hard drive has a built-in RGB light strip a feature gamers will certainly enjoy. The RGB strip can also be configured to the user’s liking and programmed with different flash or light patterns. I found the colour wave was my personal favourite but everyone has their own preference.

“The speed of the Seagate FireCuda External Hard Drive: Ghost-Spider Special Edition copies at USB 3.2 speeds and is able to quickly transfer files between the drive itself and your computer…”

The speed of the Seagate FireCuda External Hard Drive: Ghost-Spider Special Edition copies at USB 3.2 speeds and is able to quickly transfer files between the drive itself and your computer whether it be Mac Windows or Linux. I regularly transferred large movie files between my MacBook and Windows laptop and was able to transfer several gigabytes worth of data in a matter of minutes. On average speeds reached about 120-150MB/s which while small compared to some solid state external drives is still respectable in my book.

In terms of portability the Seagate FireCuda External Hard Drive: Ghost-Spider Special Edition is about the same size as my iPhone 13 Mini so taking the drive on the go should be a reasonably easy task. It can easily slip into my pocket or laptop bag without adding too much unnecessary bulk even with the data cord.

While not the fastest drive on the market in terms of transfer speeds Seagate has produced a flashy-looking storage drive that any Spider-Man or Marvel fan can appreciate. The RGB strip and decals give the Seagate FireCuda External Hard Drive: Ghost-Spider Special Edition an added custom touch over standard external drives making customization that little bit more fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PPG announced its 2023 Color of the Year Vining Ivy. Color experts at the company say the “bluish-greenish-something-in-betweenish” hue is as adaptable as its botanical namesake and intertwines bold blue and refined green to create a captivating color symbolic of deep water.

“Consumers are seeking to simplify in this post-COVID era as the past two years have shed a new light on the importance of serenity and little moments” says Ashley McCollum Glidden color expert. “Vining Ivy embodies this vibe perfectly. It is energizing yet grounding and it works in literally any space.”

The new teal tone can be used to set a calming mood in spaces as its blue communicates feelings of tranquility while the emerald evokes feelings of balance. When paired together these two undertones create an ultra-rich color that has us “in our feels” as we cautiously emerge from the pandemic.

In a residential setting the color can be used for an interior or an exterior. For an interior the experts see it used on full wall settings for a dramatic yet calming space or as an accent wall to add personality. It can be dressed up with gold accents and white trim for a more glamorous look.

As an exterior it adds plenty of curb appeal and personality to the body of a home or as a front door color to compliment colorful landscaping.

“Those who love this moody hue but are still feeling in-betweenish on how to bring it into their space can treat themselves to the understated elegance of a teal accent wall or serve up a statement by featuring Vining Ivy on their kitchen cabinetry” adds McCollum. “Even the most modest spaces can benefit from the teal treatment. For those short on square footage but big on style we recommend using this rich hue as bold contrast to a neutral palette making a petite room feel plush.”

GREENWOOD Ind. — Three people have been banned for one year from the Greenwood Park Mall after police say they were caught carrying guns inside the mall.

The incident happened Saturday in the mall's food court. Police said all three people were carrying guns. One of the people was wearing a backpack and he had a high-capacity magazine in it along with a gun.

While they were standing in line to order food the magazine fell and hit the floor. When the magazine hit the floor bullets fell out.

This caused some chaos police said. A woman who saw what happened kicked the magazine across the floor and the man who dropped the magazine scrambled to grab it police said.

The man then ran to the women's bathroom and shoved the ammunition into his backpack.

Police were called to the scene and interviewed all three people none of whom were prior felons.

The Greenwood Police Department said all three people were lawfully carrying guns under Indiana law and ""at no time did the individuals display a weapon and no threats were made.""

However Simon Property Group specifies in its Code of Conduct that weapons are prohibited at the mall.

Police said the Greenwood Park Mall has issued a one-year ban to the three individuals involved. Initially police said it was a lifetime ban. However Simon Property Group clarified by telling police it was a one-year ban.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL2luZGlhbmEtbmV3cy90cmlvLWNhcnJ5aW5nLWd1bnMtYXQtZ3JlZW53b29kLXBhcmstbWFsbC1yZWNlaXZlLWxpZmV0aW1lLWJhbi_SAWJodHRwczovL2ZveDU5LmNvbS9pbmRpYW5hLW5ld3MvdHJpby1jYXJyeWluZy1ndW5zLWF0LWdyZWVud29vZC1wYXJrLW1hbGwtcmVjZWl2ZS1saWZldGltZS1iYW4vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trio carrying guns at Greenwood Park Mall receives 1-year ban,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox59.com/indiana-news/trio-carrying-guns-at-greenwood-park-mall-receive-lifetime-ban/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL2luZGlhbmEtbmV3cy90cmlvLWNhcnJ5aW5nLWd1bnMtYXQtZ3JlZW53b29kLXBhcmstbWFsbC1yZWNlaXZlLWxpZmV0aW1lLWJhbi_SAWJodHRwczovL2ZveDU5LmNvbS9pbmRpYW5hLW5ld3MvdHJpby1jYXJyeWluZy1ndW5zLWF0LWdyZWVud29vZC1wYXJrLW1hbGwtcmVjZWl2ZS1saWZldGltZS1iYW4vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vcHJvcGVydHkvY29tbWVyY2lhbC9mdW5kLW1hbmFnZXJzLXNuYXAtdXAtMTUwbS1vZi1udC1xbGQtY2F0dGxlLXN0YXRpb25zLTIwMjIxMDA3LXA1Ym8xetIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fund managers snap up $150m of NT Qld cattle stations,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vcHJvcGVydHkvY29tbWVyY2lhbC9mdW5kLW1hbmFnZXJzLXNuYXAtdXAtMTUwbS1vZi1udC1xbGQtY2F0dGxlLXN0YXRpb25zLTIwMjIxMDA3LXA1Ym8xetIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7E07D30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vcHJvcGVydHkvY29tbWVyY2lhbC9mdW5kLW1hbmFnZXJzLXNuYXAtdXAtMTUwbS1vZi1udC1xbGQtY2F0dGxlLXN0YXRpb25zLTIwMjIxMDA3LXA1Ym8xetIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Kirk Cousins scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak with 2:26 remaining on Minnesota’s fifth third-down conversion of its go-ahead drive and the Vikings snapped out of their mid-game slump just in time to beat the Chicago Bears 29-22 on Sunday.

Cameron Dantzler sealed the victory that put the Vikings (4-1) alone in first place in the NFC North by ripping the ball away from former teammate Ihmir Smith-Marsette near the one-minute mark after a pass from Justin Fields to the Minnesota 39.

Fields went 15 for 21 for a season-high 208 yards and his first touchdown pass in 15 quarters and rushed eight times for 47 yards but the Bears (2-3) didn’t have enough defense to pull it out.

Justin Jefferson finished with a career-high 12 catches for 154 yards and caught a 2-point conversion pass from Cousins to push the lead to seven and Dalvin Cook rushed for 94 yards and two scores.

Cousins set a franchise record with 17 consecutive completions to start the game and coach Kevin O’Connell put on a play-calling clinic as the Vikings reached the end zone on their first three possessions for a 21-3 lead midway through the second quarter. Three times last week against New Orleans they had to settle for field goals after crossing the 20.

After a punt two missed field goals and an interception threatened to ruin Minnesota’s stellar start the Vikings had one more commanding drive.

David Montgomery scored Chicago’s’ first touchdown on a 9-yard run. Fields hit Velus Jones Jr. from 9 yards out on the first possession of the third quarter get the Bears back into it.

Early in the fourth Kindle Vildor picked off Cousins as he rolled right on first down and tried to connect with Adam Thielen at the 30 and the return gave the Bears the ball near midfield. Two plays later Fields got loose for what would’ve been a 52-yard touchdown run but Smith-Marsette was called for an illegal block above the waist to wipe that out.

Cairo Santos instead made his third field goal of the game to give the Bears for a 22-21 lead with 9:31 to go. The Vikings responded with a 17-play 80-yard march that drained an even 7 minutes off the clock. That drive included a 5-yard run with less than three minutes left by the pocket-preferring Cousins on third-and-5 from the Chicago 20.

PREGAME

With division rival Green Bay playing early in London much of the broadcast was shown on the videoboards as fans filed in and sunlight streamed through the west-facing windows.

When the Giants took the lead for good in the 29-22 victory over the Packers the Vikings’ game operations crew sounded the celebratory Gjallarhorn. The crowd roared as Green Bay fell to 3-2 and put Minnesota ahead in the division standings.

STILL SPECIAL?

The Vikings under new special teams coordinator Matt Daniels had been stellar in nearly every facet of the kicking game over the first four games but there were some hiccups Sunday.

Greg Joseph who was the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week after going 5 for 5 on field goals to beat the Saints had a 53-yard try go wide right at the halftime gun and a 51-yard attempt blocked by Dominique Robinson on Minnesota’s only possession of the third quarter.

Jalen Reagor who had his first Vikings touchdown on a jet-motion shovel pass from Cousins fumbled a punt return that he recovered around midfield in the second quarter.

INJURY REPORT

Chicago: CB Jaylon Johnson (quadriceps) sat out for the second straight game. … LB Matthew Adams (calf) was hurt in the third quarter.

Minnesota: Rookie RB Ty Chandler left the game with a hand injury on special teams. … Rookie CB Akayleb Evans was being evaluated for a concussion in the fourth quarter.

'I ...,"Yorkville’s Ben Alvarez being in the right place at the right time is not a big shocker.

The talented 6-foot-2 220-pound junior seldom leaves the field for the Foxes starting at outside linebacker and fullback. And he stepped into the spotlight Friday on special teams.

Alvarez gave Yorkville a spark in the defensive struggle recovering a fumble in the end zone after an off-target snap over the head of Oswego East punter Owen Valek.

“I didn’t know what happened” Alvarez said of the second-quarter sequence. “I just played football saw the ball on the ground hopped on it and got a touchdown for the team.”

Yorkville’s Andrew Laurich (9) congratulates Ben Alvarez (13) on his fumble recovery in the end zone for a touchdown during a Southwest Prairie West game in Oswego on Friday Oct. 7 2022.

It was the only TD of the first half for Yorkville which then came alive in the second half behind the running of Josh Gettemy for a 28-14 Southwest Prairie West victory.

The Foxes (6-1 2-1) had been held without a score on offense in their previous two games but helped clinch a fourth straight playoff spot under the guidance of coach Dan McGuire.

Oswego East (4-2 1-2) trying to make the playoffs a seventh straight time under coach Tyson LeBlanc now has a challenging road in the next two weeks.

The Wolves need at least one win to become playoff eligible and have to play archrival Oswego (3-4 1-2) and undefeated conference leader Plainfield North (7-0 3-0).

Sophomore defensive back Luke Zook whose pick-six was the only TD for Yorkville in last week’s 10-0 win at West Aurora also had a hand in the score by Alvarez.

Valek retrieved the errant snap and ran to his left trying to get the punt off but Zook wrapped him up as the ball dropped allowing it to roll free for Alvarez.

Yorkville’s Joshua Gettemy (3) dives into the end zone for his second touchdown while being tackled by Oswego East’s Nick Morrison (35) during a Southwest Prairie West game in Oswego on Friday Oct. 7 2022.

“We felt like we could win the game on special teams alone” McGuire said. “We didn’t play very well offensively the last couple weeks.

“Getting things done and maintaining good field position which I thought we did in the first half allows us to be a little more two-dimensional in what we call offensively.”

Mostly those calls went to the No. 3 of Gettemy who finished with 31 carries for 254 yards. He produced TDs runs of 24 and 15 yards in the second half.

“I’ll take that all day” Gettemy said. “We could really feel like our conditioning was above theirs later in the game. We’ve worked hard this year.”

Gettemy has been a blessing for the Foxes filling in for the third time this season for starter Gio Zeman who was sidelined by the flare-up of an earlier foot injury.

Yorkville’s Josh Gettemy (3) dives for extra yards as Ben Alvarez (13) works to keep the defense at bay during a Southwest Prairie West game in Oswego on Friday Oct. 7 2022.

“I gotta give it to the O-line” Alvarez said. “They were getting the job done in the trenches and Josh was just running his butt off.”

The O-line for Yorkville features center Sam Tholen guards Logan Brasfield and Andrew Zook and a rotation of tackles Jake Davies Roary Mezger and Ryan Stribiak.

Andrew Zook and Davies who also play key roles on the defensive line have been getting more action on offense.

“Davies at tackle was a little bit of a difference” LeBlanc said. “We got in a situation where our defense was on the field for a little while.”

Alvarez played a key role in that running game as Gettemy’s lead blocker.

Oswego East’s Tre Jones (9) passes the ball against the Yorkville during a Southwest Prairie West game in Oswego on Friday Oct. 7 2022.

“We throw a lot at Ben” McGuire said. “The fullback position is the toughest on our team in terms of things to remember — knowing what’s going on with alignment when to block where to block. There’s a lot of mental to it.

“He’s really getting better and better at that as the weeks have gone by.”

The Wolves’ offense meanwhile struggled. They were limited to 34 yards in the first half and 79 for the game.

Senior cornerback Michael Parrott scored on a 100-yard kickoff return for Oswego East to cut the deficit to 14-7 but the damage was done.

“Six of the teams Yorkville has played have been in the same situation” LeBlanc said. “Their front seven is probably one of the strongest front sevens I’ve seen in my 16 years coaching high school football.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlaXJ0b25kYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbG9jYWwtc3BvcnRzLzIwMjIvMTAvYmlnLXJlZC1ib3VuY2VzLWJhY2staW4tYmlnLXdheS1vbi1ob21lY29taW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Red bounces back in big way on homecoming,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.weirtondailytimes.com/sports/local-sports/2022/10/big-red-bounces-back-in-big-way-on-homecoming/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlaXJ0b25kYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbG9jYWwtc3BvcnRzLzIwMjIvMTAvYmlnLXJlZC1ib3VuY2VzLWJhY2staW4tYmlnLXdheS1vbi1ob21lY29taW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTEyOTc2NTMvSGlsYXJpYS1CYWxkd2luLXNoYXJlcy1zbmFwLWRhdWdodGVyLUlsYXJpYS1odXNiYW5kLUFsZWMtQmFsZHdpbi1jdWRkbGUtYmFieS5odG1s0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTI5NzY1My9hbXAvSGlsYXJpYS1CYWxkd2luLXNoYXJlcy1zbmFwLWRhdWdodGVyLUlsYXJpYS1odXNiYW5kLUFsZWMtQmFsZHdpbi1jdWRkbGUtYmFieS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilaria Baldwin shares snap of daughter Ilaria as she and husband Alec Baldwin cuddle up to the baby,"Hilaria Baldwin gushed with joy on Sunday as she shared a photo of her and husband Alec Baldwin's newest addition to the family.

His former bandmate Keith and ex Westlife singer Brian McFadden are currently touring as BoyzLife.

And yesterday after their show in Edinburgh Keith posed with Stephen's younger brother Tony and his children Josh 19 and Harry Stephen 10.

Keith wrote: ""Always Good to get The Gately Boys down to the show in Edinburgh! #steo #family @officialboyzlife #reminisce.""

Fans and friends flocked to his comment section shocked by their resemblance to Stephen.

One person wrote: ""That’s just great. So nice that they get to see you.""

Lorraine said: ""My heart actually hit the floor. I got shivers honestly can defo see Stephen in them all this is such a lovely photo.""

Val added: ""Was at the show last night in Edinburgh and my mum got to shake Stephen's brother's hand. What a awesome show last night guys xx.""

Somebody else commented: ""How genuinely lovely!""

This comes after Keith 47 recently opened up about his friendship with Westlife star Brian McFadden 42.

The two Irish singers have just kicked off their much-anticipated Old School tour which sees the duo performing Westlife and Boyzone classics as well as hits from their debut album of original music.

FALLING OUT

Discussing his bond with Brian Keith said the pair will have “full on arguments” and “row” while being in each other’s pockets.

In an exclusive chat with The Sun Keith explained: “We’ll have a proper argument and a row – we’d never be aggressive with each other we’re not children – but we’ll certainly let it be known that we’re unhappy and we’re having a little fall out.

“We don’t brush things under the carpet or pretend things didn’t happen.”

Despite sometimes not seeing eye to eye Keith continued to say that the pair will “make up ten minutes later.”

'VERY CLOSE'

He added: “People will see us after a row having a pint in the pub next door and they’ll go ‘how are those still talking?’”

Both Keith and Brian forged hugely successful careers as part of the ‘90s and ‘00s boybands they were in.

Keith who opened up on surprises in the tour said he and Brian are as close as brothers as a result.

“We’re very close” he explained adding: “I have two brothers but my relationship with Brian is closer than that.

“There has to be an air of understanding and we can’t always get on well and you’re not going to be on good form every day. You’re going to do things that upset each other.

“We tour together we laugh together we go out together but if something isn’t quite right we’ll have a row.”"

The 38-year-old Mexican immigrant's mom moved her and her two siblings to southern California when Sigala was 7 years old. An honors student in high school ""My No. 1 dream in life was to be the most educated person"" possible she says. But she didn't quite know how to get there. ""My mother and all my aunts and uncles never did go to college"" she says. With help from the guidance counselor in her school Sigala ultimately attended Pomona College for Latin American studies and later the Harvard Kennedy School for a master's in public policy. Thus setting goals she wasn't quite sure how to reach and figuring out how to reach them became her M.O. ""One of my superpowers is having the capacity to be very comfortable wading through uncertainty collecting facts and making decisions"" she says. Ultimately this superpower led her to co-found HoneyBook a tech platform for financial management for small businesses. HoneyBook was valued at more than $2 billion in 2021. Here's how Sigala built her career and her advice for anyone keen to find their own successful career path.

'I'm a builder'

After getting her master's Sigala was hired to do project management at health insurance company Aetna. ""I was getting paid annually more money than any of my family members could ever dream to make"" she says of her $80000 annual salary. Still she adds she knew within the first week that ""I'm going to be so depressed here."" She didn't like feeling like just a small cog in a big machine. She stayed in the company for two years all-the-while saving up and considering her next move. During her tenure at Aetna she started learning about entrepreneurship and realized ""I'm a builder"" she says. Starting her own company seemed like the best route. Building on her love of cooking that started with her mom teaching her as a child Sigala ended up founding a personal chef business in 2010 tapping her Pomona College alumni network for well-to-do alum willing to pay someone to cook their meals. ""And I paid my bills for about a year that way"" she says.

'Why not digitize all these crappy tasks'

As a young business owner Sigala learned that she could be self-sufficient. But she realized cooking wasn't for her. ""My time doesn't scale"" she says. Plus it was a low margins business. Sigala's then-husband ultimately moved the two to San Francisco in 2012 and it was there that she discovered the world of tech. She began booking informational interviews with anyone in the industry who would talk to her and asked questions like ""Do you work at a startup? What does that mean? What is tech? What is software? What is hardware? What's consumer? What's marketplace?"" As she learned that entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley build tech in part to solve problems she realized the problem she herself would want to solve is one she'd encountered as a business owner: There was no streamlined way to deal with backend logistics like emails payments and invoices.

When she met three Israeli entrepreneurs tackling the same problem they realized ""Why not digitize all these crappy tasks that micro small businesses have to get out of the way so they can actually focus on doing what they love?"" That idea would turn into HoneyBook founded in 2013 and where Sigala would spend five years in lead sales and HR roles. The company now boasts more than 200 employees according to LinkedIn.

Dirty bathrooms make customers of most establishments which have them less likely to be repeat customers almost certainly. For gas stations this may not be as much of a problem. People don’t eat or drink gas. Restaurants and fast food establishments are another matter. Dirty bathrooms threaten repeat visits and damage brands. Starbucks has a dirty bathroom problem.



Starbucks has over 15000 locations in the U.S. The company owns about 9000. The balance of stores are licensed. Starbucks might argue that it does not have much control over the licensed stores. If so in terms of sanitary operations that is a shame.

Starbucks may also argue that an occasional dirty bathroom is a small problem. Management may also say it cannot police every location every hour and even every day. However a customer lost may be a customer who goes to McDonald’s or the local coffee shop.

One would think Starbucks has enough problems. It chews through CEOs. Current interim CEO Howard Schulz has cycled in and out three times since 1986. Likely he is the one who pushes for the board to force out people who are not up to his standards. Schulz has had a rough ride this time. Labor problems have plagued Starbucks. Schulz also claims the stores could operate and begin installing new coffee-making machines and “improving” training. Regardless of his plans shares have dropped about 20% since he returned.



Starbucks needs to decide whether minor problems make the public believe it does not care about the essentials of making and serving food to the public. If it believes the problem of dirty bathrooms is too hard to address then the Starbucks brand faces a problem — which it may already have.

CJ Miller a former Starbucks employee says he was fired after an investigation by Starbucks.

Miller says he was investigated for solicitation after posting flyers in the Starbucks lobby in what he says he believes are protected areas by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

NLRB rights allow employees to post solicitations during non-work hours in non-work areas like break rooms. Miller claims that because the Starbucks did not have a break room he believed the lobby was a protected area because it is where employees take their breaks.

Miller also says he was investigated for defacement for writing messages like ""protect Starbucks laborers"" on a chalkboard.

He says he was later pulled off the floor and told he had been fired for not clocking out on a meal break which he claims was false.

""I do believe this is a targeted attack on me"" Miller said. ""This is Starbucks targeting union leadership in Kansas City.""

A Starbucks spokesperson tells KSHB 41 News that in addition to failing to record a meal break properly Miller received three warnings for attendance violations. The spokesperson also says that Miller did not account for clocking out early and participated in non-work conduct six minutes after clocking into work.

Miller also had a discovery conversation where he had the opportunity to explain himself per the Starbucks spokesperson.

Sunday's strike featured full participation of the store with around 20 employees in attendance according to Miller. The goal was to meet in bargaining stop unjust firings and investigations and fully respect the Weingarten Rights of the employees.

Miller says he hopes to be reinstated.

""We want to let management know that we're not OK with this"" he said.

The employees picketed from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday at the location at 18710 E. 39th St.

""We respect our partners’ right to engage in lawful protest activity and appreciate their unconditional commitment to return for opening shifts tomorrow. We remain committed to our partners and will continue to work together side-by-side to make Starbucks a company that works for everyone"" a Starbucks spokesperson said in a statement.

Maybe some Starbucks locations change out the pastry display case every day but this particular barista has noticed a two or three-day turnover rate for the pastries.

A TikTok video by kaylakosmic seems to emphasize the sour odors that pastries take on after sitting out in the display case which probably isn't something anyone would want in their food. The video shows the barista cleaning out the pastry case but sometimes as the former source noted some baristas may nibble on a pastry that seems passable.

One Starbucks employee also chimed in the comment section stating that foods in the display window get donated but this certainly doesn't seem to be the case for all Starbucks locations. Many other commenters were surprised that the food was even real to begin with.

So next time you're at a Starbucks feel free to stare in amazement at the pastry case but try not to ask the barista for any of the display items for your own health and safety."

This primer from State Street Global Advisors provides an overview of the key metrics what they mean and how they are employed.

Understanding environmental risk

Environment-related risks can largely be divided into physical risks and transition risks from climate change.

Physical risks: Tangible risks of climate change that could manifest through a rise in sea levels water stress droughts flooding extreme temperatures and increased frequency of extreme weather events inter alia.

These phenomena could damage infrastructure cause supply-chain disruption result in raw materials scarcity or harm human health and more. In addition climate models also predict that the impacts above are distributed unevenly and will affect certain regions or peoples disproportionately.

Transition risks: Risks to economic and business models that are associated with new carbon pricing or emissions trading schemes as well as the risk that higher costs of carbon may lead to stranded assets. Transition risks include changing consumer habits and labour market shifts as well as investment allocation decisions in companies and sectors better suited to a low-carbon economy.

Risk interaction and impact

These two risks frequently interact and companies can often be affected by either to varying degrees depending on their business models geographic locations pricing power etc.

To inform our analysis of environmental risks in portfolios we employ a number of datasets from data vendors. Below we provide an overview of the data that underlies today’s climate-related investing landscape.

""Our drivers probably get about five of these things a day. Just Kias and Hyundais getting stolen"" tow truck driver Mark Hartmann told KMOV last week of thefts in the city.

Auto thefts in St. Louis have doubled this year according to KMOV. In July alone the city averaged about 21 Kia and Hyundai theft incidents each day. That number increased to 23 thefts each day in August the St. Louis Post-Dispatch previously reported.

In August St. Louis leaders threatened to sue Hyundai and Kia demanding the car companies address a defect that allegedly makes stealing vehicles made before 2021 easier to steal. KMOV reported last week that plans to sue the carmakers over the city's spike in auto thefts are still in the works.

NEW ORLEANS BECOMES MURDER CAPITAL OF AMERICA OVERTAKING ST. LOUIS

""With this letter the city demands that Kia and Hyundai mitigate the defective conditions providing thieves – including teenagers as young as 13 – the instrumentalities by which they are destroying property endangering city drivers and themselves and in some cases committing violent felonies"" according to the letter written Aug. 19 by City Counselor Sheena Hamilton.

Hyundai is Kia’s parent company but the two automakers operate independently.

""Another stolen recovery we got"" Hartmann added to KMOV of picking up the remains of a stolen car in the city. ""It’s good for business but it’s bad for a lot of things. Customers are out of their car for weeks.""

A spokesperson for St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on the planned lawsuits.

Hyundai Motor America spokesperson Ira Gabriel told Fox News Digital this week that the company ""received the letter from the City of St. Louis and provided a formal response.""

""Our vehicles are not defective and comply with all applicable safety regulations. Notwithstanding this we have been working cooperatively with the St. Louis Police Department and the police departments in other communities to provide our assistance in responding to these thefts. We have provided the St. Louis Police Department and police departments elsewhere with steering wheel locks so that they can distribute them to our customers affected by these criminal acts. We continue looking for meaningful ways to support law enforcement efforts"" he continued. Gabriel also noted that a security kit that helps shield cars from the thefts is available at Hyundai dealers and authorized installers.

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt pushed back against St. Louis leaders' plans to sue the automakers over the crimes in August.

""St. Louis has a violent crime problem. What’s causing crime in the city? The Mayor’s war against the police? The prosecutor letting criminals run wild? Evidently city ‘leaders’ think it’s….the cars. Yes—car manufacturers are to blame not criminals You can’t make this stuff up"" he tweeted on Aug. 30.

POLICE SAY TIKTOK-LED KIA HYUNDAI CAR THEFTS INCREASING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS LAWSUITS MOUNT

St. Louis was considered the murder capital of the United States but was unseated this year by New Orleans. As of Sept. 17 St. Louis recorded 45 homicides per 100000 residents compared to New Orleans' 52 homicides per 100000 residents as of Sept. 11.

Thefts of Kias and Hyundais have skyrocketed across the country in recent months as a TikTok challenge using the hashtag ""Kia Boys"" grew in popularity. The social media trend challenged people to steal certain models of Kias and Hyundais made between 2010-2021 that are not equipped with an electric anti-theft security device called an immobilizer. The cars can be stolen with just a USB cable and a screwdriver according to the social media trend.

TIKTOK CAR THEFT CHALLENGE: CHICAGO AREA SEES 767% INCREASE IN HYUNDAI KIA THEFTS

""Kia and Hyundai’s defective vehicles have caused a public safety crisis in the city endangering the health safety and peace of all those who live work or visit the city"" Hamilton continued in the letter to the car companies. ""Your companies bear the responsibility to mitigate the public nuisance your negligence has created for the city and its residents.""

The car companies have also faced a handful of class action lawsuits filed this year over the vehicles not having immobilizers.

A law firm in Ohio reported last week that more than 3600 people in the state have inquired about joining the proposed suit. Another class action suit was filed in California last month against the car companies over the vehicles lacking immobilizers. A similar class action suit was filed in Illinois at the beginning of September and another one was filed in Minnesota later that same month.

HYUNDAIS AND KIAS STOLEN NEARLY TWICE AS OFTEN AS OTHER VEHICLES NATIONAL STUDY FINDS

Hyundai Motor America spokesperson Gabriel added in the statement to Fox News Digital that the company remains ""concerned about the increase in thefts of certain Hyundai vehicles that have been targeted in a coordinated social media campaign."" Hyundai also provides steering wheel locks to police departments in areas seeing an increase in the thefts and is developing software to further prevent the crimes in addition to releasing a glass break sensor security kit available at dealerships and approved installers.

""All Hyundai vehicles meet or exceed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Some earlier models without a push-button ignition do not have engine immobilizers. In November 2021 engine immobilizers became standard on all Hyundai vehicles produced"" Gabriel said.

A representative for Kia America also told Fox News Digital later Sunday that the company is ""is concerned with the rise in vehicle thefts.""

""While no car can be made completely theft-proof criminals are targeting vehicles equipped with a steel key and ""turn-to-start"" ignition system as opposed to those equipped with a key fob and ""push-button to-start"" system. Kia America continues to work closely with local law enforcement in affected areas to provide steering wheel lock devices at no cost to concerned owners of steel key operated Kia vehicles not originally equipped with an immobilizer"" the statement states.

""All 2022 models and trims have an immobilizer applied either at the beginning of the year or as a running change and all Kia vehicles meet or exceed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards."" The company is also testing software updates to ""further secure these targeted vehicles and will share more information as it becomes available."""

The projects — essentially siblings — are known as the Terrestrial Layer System-Brigade Combat Team TLS-BCT; the Terrestrial Layer System-Echelons Above Brigade TLS-EAB; and the Multi-Function Electronic Warfare-Air Large or MFEW-AL.

Each serves its own purpose and is in its own stage of development. But what Army and industry officials emphasize is their future synergy: how each piece fits neatly into the puzzle of electromagnetic spectrum domination.

“We don’t expect these systems to do their own mission; they have to be used in tandem whether we’re using an MFEW-Air Large in the air to get range [or] looking at long-range precision fires with [TLS-EAB]” William Utroska who works with the Army’s Program Executive Office Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors told reporters in August at Aberdeen Proving Ground Maryland.

“That’s one of the points I wanted to make upfront” he said. “We foresee these systems being mutual used in tandem in order to provide the commander the best effects.”

Electronic warfare is a fight for control of the spectrum which militaries use for situational awareness communications weapons guidance and more. This contest is increasingly important as more advanced technologies are deployed on the battlefield and troops try to minimize their signatures to avoid detection.

The Army in July awarded Lockheed Martin a $58.8 million contract for TLS-BCT. The other transaction authority agreement runs through October 2023. The company is expected to provide prototypes mounted to Stryker combat vehicles that are ready for operational assessment and issuance to an initial unit.

“It’s really an exciting time for TLS-BCT” Maj. Derek Vanino an assistant product manager with the terrestrial spectrum warfare portfolio at PEO IEW&S said during an August roundtable. “We’ve made a lot of progress with our industry partner.”

The service in August inked separate deals with Lockheed and General Dynamics Mission Systems for TLS-EAB concepts and demonstrations. The first phase is valued at $15 million over 11 months.

Compared to its TLS-BCT relative TLS-EAB is meant to reach farther and interface with larger footprints and formations.

“We’re going to be designed to deliver long-range sense and effect integrated SIGINT EW and radio frequency-enabled cyber. But we’re going to do it at longer range and at echelons that do not have that capability organically at this time: division corps and theater” Maj. Joseph Fink also an assistant product manager with the terrestrial spectrum warfare portfolio said at the same event. “We also have different target sets. We have different signals of interest at each echelon. And those are being developed in real time.”

The self-contained MFEW-AL pod is also produced by Lockheed. It was intended for mounting on an MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone. The pod garnered the applause of Army Under Secretary Gabe Camarillo who observed a prototype in the field this summer courtesy of PEO IEW&S.

Together the three systems are expected to boost soldier situational awareness and efficacy in future fights potentially against technologically savvy opponents such as China and Russia.

“What’s important about this is all three programs have been architected to cooperate” Deon Viergutz vice president of spectrum convergence at Lockheed said in a Sept. 26 interview. “Think about it on a battlefield: They’re part of an integrated networked family of systems.”

Among other factors Viergutz credits a shared approach for the success of each endeavor thus far. Rapidly upgradable and flexible equipment is important to the Army according to service officials.

“What has enabled it is a common architecture hardware and software” Viergutz said. “And that’s what really lays the groundwork for the Army to be able to actually achieve these programs as part of a family of systems.”

Yonhap



The U.S. military on Saturday released footage showing a Stryker armored fighting vehicle arriving in a port city south of Seoul as part of a new American rotational force to operate here for nine months.



The Eighth Army disclosed the video clip in which the vehicle was seen disembarking at the port in Pyeongtaek 70 kilometers south of Seoul to work as a key asset of the 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT).



The SBCT will replace the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) ― a transition that the U.S. military said would enable ""greater mobility and concentration of combat power.""



The ABCT operates M-1 Abrams tanks and M-2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles while the Stryker team uses the eight-wheeled armored vehicle which the U.S. Army says combines firepower battlefield mobility survivability and versatility with reduced logistics requirements.



The shift comes as Seoul and Washington are striving to strengthen deterrence against Pyongyang's evolving nuclear and missile threats. (Yonhap)

The new supermicro needle holder and dilator were recently used in clinical procedures in Zürich Florence and Salzburg with successful patient outcomes.

Simon Enzinger MD DDS surgeon at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University Hospital Salzburg used the new instruments on a procedure called a partial glossectomy where he raised a lateral arm free flap to replace a large section of a patient’s tongue which required removal due to cancer.

To return blood flow to the transferred tissue Dr Enzinger needed to connect the branch of the radial collateral artery to a side brand of the superior thyroid artery that was only 0.8 mm in diameter and in a difficult location to access.

Dr Enzinger says: “We’ve already seen the benefits of Symani and the NanoWrist instruments in improving dexterity and control.

“The new supermicro instrument tips are even smaller and more refined making it significantly easier to precisely connect vessels under one millimeter in diameter. I believe this will expand the ability to use perforator-to-perforator flaps which makes free-flap surgeries shorter and less invasive.”

MMI’s Supermicro NanoWrist instruments are commercially available in the European Union. The tips of the new instruments are half the width of MMI’s standard microinstruments with a tapered design optimized to connect vessels under one millimeter in diameter and delicately hold 10-0 to 12-0 sutures.

Microsurgery is the manipulation or suturing of very small anatomy such as arteries veins ducts or nerves. These procedures require high visual magnification and specialized precision instruments as well as advanced fine motor skills.

Supermicrosurgery is microsurgery on an even smaller scale. Symani has enabled lymphatic surgery by adding precision that not every surgeon can achieve even with extensive training when manually suturing extremely small vessels.

Mark Toland CEO of MMI says: “The launch of our new supermicro instruments is a significant milestone as we push the boundaries of robotic surgery to address even smaller vessels that few surgeons are able to connect by hand.

“We’re excited that our innovative solutions will allow more surgeons to perform microsurgical techniques and help expand patient access to supermicrosurgeries for chronic illnesses like lymphedema a burdensome condition that affects 250 million people around the world.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Attention food shoppers! The recent steep surge in U.S. food prices will end soon predicts Kevin Hourican chief executive of Sysco a food-distribution giant. “I expect food inflation to decrease over the next year at both the grocery store and in our business of food away from home’’ as product availability improves he says.

Hourican should know.

The 49-year-old veteran retailer leads the nation’s biggest distributor of food and related items to restaurants schools and other food-service operations. Sysco delivers food to more than 700000 locations worldwide.

Hourican who has been CEO since early 2020 has devised a sweeping strategy focused on the expansion of team-based sales technology investments and a revamped supply chain. One result: Sysco resumed growing its market share reversing declines between fiscal 2010 and 2020. The Houston company saw sales soar nearly 34% to $68.6 billion during the fiscal year ended July 2 2022.

The 6 ft. 8 in. Hourican played on the 1994 national championship volleyball team for Pennsylvania State University. Equipped with an economics undergraduate degree he pursued a master’s there in supply chain management partly because he enjoyed learning to manage inventory during his summer job in a hotel kitchen supplied by Sysco. Hourican began his full-time career running the overnight shift at a Sears warehouse. He went on to become an executive for Sears Macy’s and CVS Health. He was overseeing CVS’s $85 billion retail business when Sysco hired him.

TIME recently spoke with Hourican about supply-chain crisis aftershocks his transformational strategy that’s dubbed “Recipe for Growth” Sysco’s possible diversification and how an executive coach strengthens his effectiveness.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

How does your supply chain management graduate degree help you cope with Sysco’s latest supply chain headaches?

We’re one of the largest supply chains on the planet [with] a mostly blue-collar workforce. Having deep supply chain experience as the leader of Sysco allows me to be credible up and down the spectrum of our associates.

Our business has been steadily recovering from the COVID disruption. We’ve had a shortage of people and product when consumer demand has been robust. In August 2021 we found ourselves understaffed versus the volume we were doing and hiring at a much faster rate than normal. One outcome is that roughly 50% of our employees in supply chain positions have been in their jobs for under a year. That’s pretty extraordinary. Productivity for that group is below normal. That shows up in the speed with which we can get product out and higher costs.

[Meanwhile] product shortages made it difficult to ship on time and in full. That is our metric of success. Product availability has been hurt due to factors such as China shutdowns during strict COVID-19 restrictions. Some protein suppliers have had meaningful staffing challenges. You couldn’t get chicken wings for a period last year.

We are now sufficiently staffed and our suppliers’ ability to ship has steadily improved. We [still] need to improve productivity. Our new folks will get more productive over time as we provide training coaching and support to do their roles.

The downturn triggered by COVID-19 forced you to permanently lay off or furlough about 33% of your employees. As a novice CEO why did you consider the pandemic an opportunity to revamp Sysco through a radical shakeup called Recipe for Growth?

The global pandemic is a terrible tragedy. What’s the overused expression? Don’t let a crisis go to waste. We leveraged the moment to move faster on a customer facing strategic transformation we wanted to do. Sysco is the largest and most profitable company in our space. But we had not grown faster than the market for years. I was recruited to create a growth platform. We needed to make some changes. Recipe for Growth is a five-part plan.

At profitable big companies there’s reluctance to change things that have worked for a long time and [instead do] things like converting to a more digital method of interacting with customers. The COVID crisis had such a dramatic impact on our business that resistance to change [was] meaningfully reduced. Associates understood we needed to move fast and why the changes would help us better serve customers. We regionalized our business changed our compensation program meaningfully advanced our customer-facing technology tools and made bold supply chain changes. As an example we eliminated order minimums. We’re the only company in our industry of restaurant food delivery to have done that.

The transformation is ahead of schedule. We had a goal this past [fiscal] year to grow 1.2 times the industry. We grew [more than] 1.3 times. We’ve created an efficient large company that’s more customer focused agile and growth oriented. We still have substantial runway in front of us on the Recipe for Growth however.

Twenty-five chief executives you approached during your first 90 days suggested developing your team faster than you thought you should. Is that why you hired a chief financial officer and three other executives during your first year who today are among your 11 direct reports?

I took sound advice from my CEO peers to be candid in the assessment of talent then make timely decisions. I moved pretty quickly. Now my best advice to someone coming into the CEO job is “Don’t do it all at once. Prioritize.” If you change too many top jobs at the same time you can lose the company and the trust of tenured associates. I’ve seen CEOs come into companies and not have sufficient respect for tenure history or culture.

As your industry’s dominant player Sysco could afford to swallow a sizable competitor. But in 2015 a court blocked its proposed takeover of big player US Foods. Will you again pursue a major rival? Or will you stick to buying relatively small firms like the three acquired since 2021?

We don’t need to buy a big competitor to drive growth. Our strategy for growth externally is about making us a more capable organization. The most attractive acquisitions domestically fill needs such as geographic white spaces where we’re not sufficiently competitive and there are product voids in our assortment. Internationally we’re more successful and mature in select geographies. Those would be higher on my priority list for future acquisitions. We need to prove through our international results that we will be successful. As we do the appetite for international acquisitions will go up.

Might Sysco also diversify into related areas? Some think your huge fleet could make home food deliveries.

Home delivery is a tough business. So I don’t believe Sysco will be in any hurry to [deliver] food to the average consumer’s home. But we are reviewing options to diversify. We’re uniquely qualified to provide restaurants with a lot of support. Adjacent businesses are interesting. For example there’s a very large supplies and equipment space. Restaurants use things like cups cutlery plates and cookware. We’re in that through our very small Supplies on the Fly business. Would we want to go into supplies and equipment full way?

What else do restaurants want? Many don’t like back-office stuff. Could we provide restaurants with things like HR services? It’s [another] area to think about though we’re not actively pursuing it.

Your college volleyball team lost the national title the year after winning it. What’s the best lesson you’ve gleaned from such failures?

I remember the title loss more than the win. In a moment of challenge difficulty and defeat you learn even more about what to do better and differently next time. That’s applicable in sports or business. Where can we improve? How do we need to improve? Those are all capability builds.

In my career I have found leadership behaviors tend to decline when the going gets the toughest. The complete opposite needs to happen. I try to be my best version of myself when challenges are the most substantial. I’m getting better 1% every day and never declare victory.

Do you keep getting better because you’ve worked with an executive coach since taking Sysco’s highest job?

Everyone should have a coach especially a CEO. You need to make some tough calls. You can’t manage through consensus. On the most substantial decisions I talk to my coach and share my perspective on where I’m leaning. My coach has worked with hundreds of other CEOs. I ask “What have others like me considered? Are there constituents I need to engage so I make the right decision?’

Describe one situation where your coach assisted you in handling a complicated issue as a first-time CEO.

Board interactions are an example of where he was most useful early in my tenure. My coach helped me bucketize decision making into three tiers. What topics should a CEO bring to the board? What topics are purely managerial decisions and you don’t even need to notify [board members]? Tier three is a decision that has meaningful repercussions. You should engage the board evaluate their input and align on a decision. A big part of the reason why I’ve got a good rapport with our board is that we found a nice rhythm. And we leverage their strengths and expertise.

You recently said your challenge for Sysco’s business team is “How do we push each other to take our game to the next level?” What will that level look like?

Our next level is to be even more customer centric. If [customers] want deliveries seven days a week we’re there. The challenge for a company like ours is “How do you have flexibility and efficiency?” In the past in our industry it’s been perceived that those are contrarian points. You could be productive or customer agile. We want to be both.

What steps will you take to make sure your colleagues up their game so Sysco reaches that next level?

Listen to our frontline associates. Ask them “What can we do better to help you do your jobs better? What customer needs aren’t being met?” Then we should get inspiration from new hires. We can apply other industries’ best practices to Sysco.

Seidl held a private roundtable discussion with unidentified executives who are likely to be affected by the state’s restrictive law on independent contractors as well as an attorney. After the roundtable Seidl published his report backing the brokerage model in which a trucking company transitions to being mostly a brokerage and brokers freight into independent owner-operators. But those independent owner-operators would need to get their own authority and insurance if they are now driving under the banner of a company providing those necessities.

The other most likely option for complying with AB5 Seidl wrote is making drivers employees a step that was most visible in a recent decision by Universal Logistics (NASDAQ: ULH).

Going to the brokerage model isn’t easy if a company is smaller Seidl wrote. “Panelists pointed out that smaller carriers with less legal and financial wherewithal are likely to remain non-compliant and face penalties or move to other states altogether creating an opportunity for larger carriers to take share” he wrote.

The two-check model under which a driver becomes an employee of a third party (like TransForce) and leases a truck to the carrier was described by Seidl as “less popular.” The business to business exception that is part of AB5 was said to be “difficult to qualify for.”

AB5’s primary hurdle for trucking is its B prong which says a worker can be defined as an independent contractor if he or she “performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business.” A trucking company hiring an independent owner-operator to move freight runs the risk of not complying with the B prong.

The issue has loomed for the state’s trucking sector after a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June effectively ended an injunction that had kept the law away from California trucking. AB5 is now fully in place for the state’s truck companies.

But the Cowen panel also revealed that the California industry in the short term is more concerned with new regulations from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) that will hit the drayage community.





The transition to cleaner drayage trucks to take effect at the start of 2023 has a potentially greater impact than AB5 according to the panel. The most pressing change is the rule that drayage vehicles must be model year 2017 or later as of 2023. It’s a follow-up to a 2018 rule that vehicles needed to be 2014 models or later.

“Panelists shared that the [CARB] rule … is the largest regulatory burden on the horizon” the report published by Seidl after the roundtable said. “While used truck prices are starting to decelerate our panelists stated that truck pricing is still up more than 30%. This will likely put more pressure on the truck market in California” the assumption being that owners of trucks who are seeing their trucks move into the banned category will look to the used truck market for replacements.

In a follow-up interview with FreightWaves Seidl talked about the fallout from the enormous backup at the Southern California ports that took months to ease. “What we’ve seen over the last 18 to 24 months combined with AB5 and CARB is that shippers are just sort of fed up with the West Coast ports and freight that already has been diverted will not likely divert back” he said.

As a result the one stock-related comment in his report is that the loss of freight moving into the Southern California ports might be negative “for someone like Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP).” He added that “we remain cautious on the magnitude of the shift with ocean rates to the West Coast slipping rapidly and the potential resolution of labor issues on the horizon.” But what he referred to as “alternative energy points” can be boosted by new infrastructure development elsewhere as well as lower warehousing costs.

On AB5 Seidl told FreightWaves that the rule will “weigh a little heavier on the smaller drayage-type carrier. The large ones are going to have the wherewithal and the knowledge to meet compliance.”

In his report Seidl laid out numbers on what AB5 compliance will cost the drayage community. “Complying with AB5 will entail increased costs for drayage carriers that will be ultimately passed on to shippers given the EBITDA margin structure of a drayage business is already only 8-10%” he wrote. “Drayage carriers cannot absorb significant cost increases.”

But Seidl told FreightWaves that many drayage companies already are in compliance with AB5 because much of their workforce is already made up of employees not independent contractors. “A lot of the bigger drayage carriers already have a company driver mode built in” he said. And he added that one of the participants said AB5 may make companies “turn more to company drivers.”

Such a step has costs. The Seidl report said moving a contractor to an employee and moving them to a dedicated service would result in a roughly 20% increase in costs before administrative costs are figured largely because older vehicles driven by independent contractors would be replaced by newer trucks.





The end result for the bigger companies though will be compliance. “Enforcement will prove tricky but larger carriers will comply nonetheless” Seidl wrote. He added a somewhat surprising possibility: The Private Attorney Generals Act which has been seen as a way of enforcing AB5 against trucking companies might be used by drivers “to dispute AB5 enforcement on behalf of the whole group.”

The bottom-line conclusion for Seidl’s group chat: “Panelists expect some loss of transportation capacity in California and freight moving to other entry points in the country.”

He made TikToks showing how he sold watches to slightly difficult customers. He made videos about how he handles difficult customers who say things like: ""T-Mobile is such a ripoff."" He even made videos about difficult customers who walk in just as the store is closing.

In each of the videos he played himself and the difficult customer. And each of them seemed to entertain his many thousands of followers.

I fear you may have anticipated what comes next.

Also: Verizon customers are more miserable than T-Mobile's (or even AT&T's)

The end of PrimeTime?



Recently PrimeTimeJon posted another video in which he said it was all over.

Entitled The End of PrimeTimeJon it began: ""I've given T-Mobile and Sprint years of my life man.""

He explained he's worked 12-plus hour shifts missed special occasions and worked hard to close deals so that the store made a profit. He said he'd sometimes gone months without bonus. He'd used TikTok he said ""to express my creativity with my work.""

And now well he said he'd come into work and things had turned uncreatively sour.

""The first thing I get is a phone call that says 'Yeah you have to delete all your TikTok videos and you can't make any videos going further.""

PrimeTime insisted all his videos were made off the clock.

""I get so much support from all phone providers Verizon Cricket AT&T T-Mobile of course everyone supports me"" he said.

He said district managers told him they love his content.

Suddenly it seemed not to be everyone did.

""All I wanted to do was work with T-Mobile corporate and work with their social media team and move up"" he insisted.

Naturally he received an outpouring of support. Comments in the thousands likes in even more thousands. (Likes are easier.)

T-Mobile loves it but doesn't



I couldn't help but wonder then what had happened. So I asked T-Mobile what PrimeTime had done wrong.

The first response from the company went like this: ""After looking into this this is a dealer employee. He has never worked for T-Mobile.""

I asked whether T-Mobile had though asked him to stop making his TikTok videos.

The response: ""Because this person worked for one of our third-party dealers and was never one of our employees we're not going to have anything to share on his employment status or on policies related to the content posted.""

I felt disturbed by this logic. It may well be that he worked for a dealer store rather than for T-Mobile directly but he did seem to have an inordinate enthusiasm for T-Mobile and a certain ability to entertain people with his observations on phone store life.

One might imagine that in the recent climate of somewhat full employment T-Mobile might -- at the very least -- have tried to work with PrimeTime to achieve artistic expression that would be to everyone's full advantage.

Time ticked on and the plot thickened.

I received another message from T-Mobile: ""While our dealer partners manage their employees and policies we want to clarify that our dealer partners are asked to have their employees follow T-Mobile's social media guidelines if they are speaking about our brand.""

Aha. This was about specific things that PrimeTime said intimated or did that may just have upset head office? It seems so.

The T-Mobile spokesperson added: ""We love the enthusiasm here but some of the posts didn't align with those brand guidelines.""

Brand vs employee TikTok



It's hard not to love PrimeTime's enthusiasm. He seemed generally to do a fine job of making many people believe T-Mobile is an entertaining brand.

Yet one can also imagine that the company may have struggled with his independent takes. PrimeTime isn't the first employee to have discovered that creating work-related social media videos may create corporate problems.

A McDonald's employee for example claim they were fired for going viral on TikTok. Actually more than one even though they say the video was entirely positive.

Also: McDonald's customers are really unhappy (Chick-fil-A's just laugh)

The making of work-related TikTok videos you might think seems to align with some people's alacrity to publicly declare their salaries and sometimes regard their jobs with a relatively jaundiced eye.

The temptation to make videos seems to rise above any pause for employer-related concerns.

But back to T-Mobile. Wouldn't the company want to find some way to capitalize on PrimeTime's audience?

Well this week he posted this to his TikTok: ""More updates on my whole situation coming soon.""

You're thinking AT&T has hired him aren't you?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvbW9iaWxlL3BpeGVsLTdzLTU5OS1wcmljZS1zZWVtcy1sb3ctYnV0LWNhcnJpZXJzLWlwaG9uZS1hbmQtZ2FsYXh5LWRlYWxzLWFyZS1iZXR0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pixel 7's $599 Price Seems Low but Carriers' iPhone and Galaxy Deals Are Better,"Google's new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro promise to be impressive phones that could rival Apple's iPhone 14 and Samsung's Galaxy S22 all while undercutting Apple and Samsung on price. Even with noteworthy software and camera features Google made a particular point to emphasize this during Thursday's Pixel event. The Pixel 7 starts at $599 (£599 AU$999) while the 7 Pro starts at $899 (£849 AU$1299).

By contrast Samsung charges $799 for the S22 (or $1200 for the S22 Ultra). Apple meanwhile prices the iPhone 14 at $799 and the 14 Pro Max at $1099. Unfortunately for Google this price difference may not actually matter to the US audience where consumers still largely buy devices from wireless carriers.

When going this route the price difference melts away as all three of the major providers offer a variety of trade-in and upgrade deals on iPhones Galaxies Pixels and other devices to both new and existing users. At Verizon for example depending on your plan and trade-in device (and your willingness to stay with the carrier for 36 months) you could get an iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Galaxy S22 or Galaxy S22 Plus for free. Devices like the iPhone 14 Pro Max Galaxy S22 Ultra or Z Fold 4 could be had for up to $1000 off. AT&T and T-Mobile regularly offer similar deals.

For the carriers subsidizing the price of a device is a good way to lock users into 24- to 36-month financing plans and make it more complicated to switch to a rival. It's also a good way to get people to switch to newer sometimes pricier monthly unlimited plans. While all three providers have plenty of deals on the new Pixels they offer similar discounts for Apple and Samsung phones that make the price difference Google is highlighting less of an issue.

Watch this: Google Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro: First Look 03:32

According to Roger Entner an analyst at Recon Analytics 75% of people in the US upgrading to a new phone during the June-through-September period did so with financing on an installment plan.

""People in the US largely fall into two categories. Flagship phone buyers who want all the bells and whistles and budget buyers for [whom] price is the most important"" Entner tells CNET. He adds that while the Pixels are ""a little bit cheaper than the iPhone"" it won't be ""enough to really notice if you finance"" and will only play a role if you are paying out of pocket for the phones.

Still playing a long game at home and abroad

Google is expanding the Pixel's availability with the 7 and 7 Pro. Screenshot by Eli Blumenthal/CNET

After years of working on building up the Pixel brand as an alternative to Apple and Samsung Google still doesn't have much to show for it. A recent report from Canalys that evaluated the market during the second quarter of 2022 saw the company grow by 230% annually but even with that growth it still tallied just a 2% market share in North America.

""I do think the more aggressive pricing will help Google"" says Bob O'Donnell president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research. ""But given the tiny market share size they have even if they double it it would only prove to be incremental.""

One area where Google could benefit from a lower price however is overseas. The company is expanding the Pixel's availability with the new 7 and 7 Pro and will be selling the devices in 16 countries.

""I do think it gives them more opportunities internationally as well"" O'Donnell adds noting that if Google ""can start to get traction it gives them momentum moving forward. That's probably as important to them as anything.""

Avi Greengart an analyst with Techsponential agrees. ""The bigger news is that Google is expanding its sales footprint to new markets making the Pixel line less of a US phenomenon and more globally accessible.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL21hcmluZXJzL3RoZS1tYXJpbmVycy1maW5hbGx5LWdldC10by1icmluZy1iaWctcG9zdHNlYXNvbi1nYW1lcy1iYWNrLXRvLXQtbW9iaWxlLXBhcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Mariners finally get to bring at least one postseason game back to T-Mobile Park,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

According to regulatory filings Stripe’s valuation was marked down 64% to $23.04 per share as of June 30 by the $4 billion T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund following the prior price recorded at the end of 2021.

At the same time the valuation for grocery delivery platform Instacart was also slashed Bloomberg reported with the fund cutting the value of its stake in the grocery delivery service company by 40% to below $72.

Instacart investor Capital Group cut the delivery firm’s valuation to $14.7 billion from Instacart’s own calculation of $24 billion PYMNTS reported in July. Capital Group put the shares at $45.84 at the end of June the second Instacart investor to indicate that the valuation estimate was incorrect.

Fidelity Investments cut Stripe’s valuation to $32.05 a share Bloomberg reported. Other money managers too are reducing the value of tech firms in the mutual funds they oversee.

The reductions in valuations come as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has been taking a hit down 30% in the first six months of 2022. A slide in tech stocks pushed the Nasdaq to its worst session on Monday (Aug. 22) since June 28 CNBC reported on Tuesday (Aug. 23). The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.5%.

“The global growth story is in shambles right now” Ed Moya a senior market analyst at Oanda told CNBC. “That’s what’s really kind of weighing on risk appetite right now because you can’t have the U.S. continue to be attractive while the rest of the world is crumbling.”

Because of this sentiment pressure will continue to stay on big tech stocks he said.

A tattoo artist has successfully sued Take-Two the company that owns the publisher behind the WWE games 2K.

Catherine Alexander argued that the developers reproduced her work on WWE 2K16 WWE 2K17 and WWE 2K18 without permission.

The roots of this long-standing argument go back to 2009 when Alexander attempted to negotiate a licensing deal with Take-Two Interactive.

Advert

The proposed deal would have seen tattoos Alexander inked on pro wrestler Randy Orton between 2002 and 2008 in the game.

However Take-Two rejected the proposal and instead offered her $450 for the right to use the images.

The tattoo artist ended up rejecting the offer but the publisher went ahead and used the tattoos in some of their future games anyway.

Alexander pursued the matter in court and took her first step to winning the case in 2020 when a judge rejected a request for a summary judgement in Take-Two's favour.

Advert

Instead it ruled that the publisher and WWE did copy her work and that she may have suffered damages as a result.

Part of that 2020 ruling stated: ""In particular Defendants admit that consumer response is a consideration to their development of WWE 2K and the design choices made. They also acknowledge that consumers expect there to be authenticity in the videogames and that WWE would have rejected Orton’s videogame persona if it appeared without his tattoos or appeared with tattoos that were different than Orton’s actual tattoos.

""Additionally Alexander’s expert addresses the importance of authenticity to drive sales and profits. Thus an issue of material fact exists as to whether Alexander suffered actual damages based on the value of the infringing use defeating summary judgment.""

The latest ruling issued on 30 September (via VGC) was ruled in Alexander's favour.

Advert

The US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois said that the use of tattoos inked by Alexander in the game did not qualify as fair use.

As a result Alexander was awarded $3750 in what was deemed a relatively small amount.

The court found that none of the profits earned by sales of the WWE games could be attributed to the presence of the tattoos so Alexander was not awarded more.

Staggeringly it is not the first time Take-Two has been sued over tattoos but it did win against Solid Oak Sketches in which Solid Oak Sketches claimed they owned the copyrights on tattoo designs seen on LeBron James Kenyon Martin and Eric Bledsoe in the NBA 2K games.

We used the reprocessed AMP-AD RNA-seq data available from three studies—the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) the Mount Sinai Brain Bank cohort (MSBB) and the Mayo clinic RNA-seq study43— covering seven brain regions (cerebellum temporal cortex dorsolateral prefrontal cortex parahippocampal gyrus frontal pole inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus) as well as a published meta-analysis of these datasets43 to identify genes in the SM pathway that are differentially expressed in AD cases compared to controls. Gene expression changes were considered significant at an FDR-correctedp-value ≤ 0.05. All datasets are publicly available see the “Data availability” Statement. The data used for the analyses described in this manuscript were obtained from the GTEx Portal on 02/10/22.

In silico metabolic flux analysis using brain region-specific metabolic networks

Genome-scale metabolic networks of brain regions were reconstructed in our previous study76 and we used these metabolic networks for our present work. We integrated the post-mortem brain transcriptome data as mentioned in ref. 76. Using iMAT algorithm77 we generated context-specific personalized metabolic networks for each post-mortem sample in the dataset. Human cells in general do not proliferate rapidly and they tend to maintain their metabolic functions78. We therefore chose the biomass maintenance reaction glutamate and glutamine exchange as the objective function for the brain regions. We used dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples for the present analysis. We performed flux variability analysis (FVA) to evaluate minimum and maximum flux for each reaction in the metabolic networks. We carried out the analysis for all context-specific metabolic networks. We selected the reactions that were part of sphingolipid metabolism using the subsystem definition. We used the scale function in R to normalize the flux values and applied the Wilcoxon test (rstatix package) to the normalized values to identify reactions with an adjusted p-value of <0.05 in AD versus NCI and MCI samples. These reactions were identified as significant reactions in the groups. We used COBRA toolbox v3.079 for metabolic analysis that was implemented in MATLAB R2018a and academic licenses of Gurobi optimizer v7.5 and IBM CPLEX v12.7.1 were used to solve LP and MILP problems.

Neuroimaging processing and analysis

Participants of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used in the analysis. Demographic information imaging scan data neuropsychological test scores and clinical information were downloaded from the ADNI data repository (www.loni.usc.edu). As described in detail in previous studies8081 T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were processed by using a widely employed automated MRI analysis technique (FreeSurfer) to extract cortical thickness. Pre-processed [18F] FDG positron emission tomography (PET) scans were downloaded. Methods for the acquisition and processing of PET scans were described previously80. [18F] FDG-PET scans were intensity-normalized using a pons region of interest to create standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images. For surface-based whole brain analysis of cortical thickness on a vertex-by-vertex basis the SurfStat software package (www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/) was used to perform a multivariable analysis of generalized linear regression to examine the association of genetic variation on brain structural changes. Age sex years of education intracranial volume and magnetic field strength were used as covariates. In order to adjust for multiple comparisons the random field theory correction method was used with p < 0.05 adjusted as the level for significance. For whole-brain analysis of brain glucose metabolism on a voxel-wise basis using the processed FDG-PET images SPM12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) was used to investigate the effect of genetic variation on brain glucose metabolism across the whole brain. Age and sex were used as covariates. In order to adjust for multiple comparisons the significant statistical parameters were selected to correspond to a threshold of p-value < 0.05 (FDR-corrected).

Assessment of SM ratios using targeted metabolomics in ADNI-1

For the investigation of SM ratios measured by targeted metabolomics using the Biocrates P180 kit we used the same cohort data and statistical models used in Toledo et al.20. For the selection of the most informative SM ratio we first calculated all ratios between short-chain (chain length < C20) and long-chain (≥C20) SMs on metabolite levels not adjusted for medication. For each ratio we then identified significant medications using backward selection based on the Bayesian Information Criterion. Significant medications were included as additional covariates extending the base models described in Toledo et al.20 for phenotype associations. Using the Pgain criterion which is defined by the ratio of the minimum association p-value of the constituents of a ratio with the association p-value of the ratio and provides a measure of significance added by the ratio we obtained the ratio of SM (d34:1) and SM (d43:1) as the one with the largest overall Pgain.

Replication analysis of SM ratios using targeted lipidomics in ADNI-1

A more detailed lipidomics method was applied in the ADNI-1 samples to obtain better coverage of the sphingolipidome. Methodology on the ADNI cohort was as described by Huynh et al.21. In brief extracted samples were run using reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 6490 Agilent). Characterization of sphingolipid isomers has been reported previously82 where repeated pooled runs using differing mass spectrometry conditions to obtain structurally informative fragments in MS/MS. Ratios were generated using 112 sphingolipid species and log2-transformed. Linear regression with ADAS-Cog. 13 was done with age sex BMI HDL-C total cholesterol clinical triglycerides fasting status and APOE e4 genotype as covariates. p-values were corrected for multiple correction comparison using the Benjamini and Hochberg approach83.

Candidate mGWAS analysis in ADNI-1

We downloaded genome-wide genotype data for ADNI-1 participants from LONI. Genotype quality control (QC) included the exclusion of samples and genotypes with <95% call rate and exclusion of variants that violated a Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test p-value of 1 × 10−5 or had a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%. We then performed autosomal mGWAS analysis with the three SMs (SM (d32:0) SM d(34:1) SM (d38:3)) reported as significantly associated with markers of AD in Toledo et al.20 as well as the SM(d43:1)/SM(d34:1) ratio reported here. As covariates we included age sex diagnostic group as well as the first five components derived by multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis to account for population stratification. The threshold for genome-wide significance adjusted for four metabolic traits was p-value ≤ 1.25 × 10−8. Genetic associations were calculated using PLINK v1.984.

Phenotype GWAS and global SM mGWAS analysis in ADNI-1/GO/2

Genome-wide genotyping data of ADNI-1/GO/2 participants were collected using the Illumina Human 610-Quad HumanOmni Express and HumanOmni 2.5 M BeadChips. Before imputation standard QC procedures of GWAS data for genetic markers and subjects were performed (variant call rate <95% HWE test p-value <1 × 10−6 and MAF < 1% participant call rate < 95% sex check and identity check for related relatives). Then non-Hispanic Caucasian participants were selected using HapMap 3 genotype data and MDS analysis. Genotype imputation was performed for each genotyping platform separately using the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) reference Panel r1.1 and merged afterward resulting in data on 1576 individuals and 20779509 variants. Using this dataset we ran GWAS analyses for each outcome (A-T-N-C measures clinical diagnosis and metabolite levels) that included outcome-specific sets of covariates. These are listed in Supplementary Table 6 along with the respective numbers of included individuals and genetic variants.

Annotation of genetic variants and gene-wide significance thresholds

Previously reported metabolite associations for genes in the SM pathway were retrieved from SNiPA52 which was also used to identify overlapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from multiple sources. Effect directions of genotype–metabolite and eQTL associations were obtained from the original publications52. SNiPA was also used to project genetic variants to genes a process that includes mapping of variants to genes via genomic location links to genes via expression and protein QTLs as well as a location in a gene-associated promoter or enhancer region52. The number of all genetic variants projected to a particular gene was used to derive gene-wise Bonferroni thresholds for significant genetic associations (p-value ≤ 0.05/(number of variants)). Furthermore as SNPs within genes are correlated due to linkage disequilibrium and Bonferroni correction is often too conservative we used the permutation test which provides a gene-based empirical p-value that corrects for the number of SNPs within each gene by randomly permuting the phenotypes multi times (20000 times) and performing statistical tests for all permuted data sets.

Experiments were approved by the Division of Comparative Medicine (DCM) from SUNY Downstate Medical Center. APPswe/PS1dE9 (referred to as APP/PS1) and C57Bl/6J (referred to as WT) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. The APP/PS1 is a double transgenic mouse expressing a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) both directed to central nervous system neurons85. For all behavioral and synaptic studies at 7 and 9 mo each experimental group comprised both males and females (Supplementary Table 5). We found no significant differences due to sex within each experimental group (data not shown).

Fingolimod administration

To determine if fingolimod oral administration achieves appropriate plasma concentration we treated 8 WT mice at 7 mo (50% Females) with fingolimod at 1 mg/kg/day for 4 wks. Plasma samples were collected at two-time points (2nd and 4th weeks) after treatment and analyzed by UHPLC and MS–MS. Fingolimod levels in plasma were in ng/ml: 2nd week = 8.03 ± 0.24 and 4th week = 10.02 ± 0.4. The results indicate that oral administration is an appropriate route for mice experiments.

We used APP/PS1 and their wild-type littermates to examine fingolimod effects in vivo. Fingolimod treatment was provided in drinking water in a dark container and changed every 48 h to provide 1 mg/kg/day.

In vitro electrophysiological recordings

Mice were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine (100/10 mg/kg) and decapitated with an animal guillotine. Horizontal hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared using a Vibrotome slicer (VT 1000S; Leica) in ice-cold cutting solution containing the following in mM: 130 potassium gluconate 5 KCl 20 HEPES acid 25 glucose 0.05 kynurenic acid 0.05 EGTA-K and pH equilibrated at 7.4 with KOH. After slicing the tissue was allowed to recover for an hour before the beginning of experiments in artificial CSF (aCSF) that contained the following in mM: 157 Na+ 136 Cl− 2.5 K+ 1.6 Mg2+ 2 Ca2+ 26 HCO 3 − and 11 d-glucose.

LTP recordings were performed in an interface chamber (Fine Scientific Tools Vancouver Canada) and slices were perfused with aCSF continuously bubbled with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2  to maintain pH near 7.4 and the temperature was set at 34 °C. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the CA1 stratum radiatum and lateral entorhinal cortex superficial layer II (LECII) with a glass electrode filled with aCSF (2–3 MΩ resistance) and the fEPSPs were elicited by stimulating the Schaffer collateral fibers and LECII with a bipolar electrode. Input–output curves were obtained and a stimulus that evoked ~40% of the maximum fEPSP was selected to record the baseline. Baseline responses were obtained (15 min with an inter-stimulus interval of 20 s) before high-frequency stimulation (HFS) one train of 100 stimuli at 100 Hz and three trains of 100 stumuli at 100 Hz with 10 s intervals were used to induce synaptic LTP at the CA3–CA1 and LECII–LECII synapses respectively. Responses were recorded for 60 min after HFS. The tungsten stimulating electrodes were connected to a stimulus isolation unit (Grass S88) and the recordings were made using an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and then filtered (0.1 Hz–10 kHz using −6 dB/octave). The voltage signals were digitized and stored on a PC using a DigiData 1200A (Molecular Devices) for offline analysis. The fEPSP slope was measured and expressed as a percentage of the baseline. The data was analyzed using Axon™ pCLAMP™ software and the results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data were analyzed statistically using two-way ANOVA or an Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test as described in the figure legend with the GraphPad Prism package.

Novel object recognition (NOR)

Mice were habituated to experimental apparatus consisting of a gray rectangular open field (60 cm × 50 cm × 26 cm) for 5 min in the absence of any objects for 3 days. On the third day after the habituation trial mice were placed in the experimental apparatus in the presence of two identical objects and allowed to explore them for 5 min. After a retention interval of 24 h mice were placed again in the apparatus where one of the objects was replaced by a novel object. All sessions were recorded using Noldus Media Recorder software. Exploration of the objects was defined as the mice facing and sniffing the objects within 2 cm distance and/or touching them assessed with ANY-maze software. The ability of the mouse to recognize the novel object (discrimination index) was determined by dividing the difference between exploration time devoted to the novel object and the time devoted to the familiar object by the total time exploring the novel and familiar objects during the test session. For the comparison of WT and APP/PS1 treated and untreated performance in the NOR task a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s post hoc was used. An Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test was used to compare WT and APP/PS1 at 7 mo. All the statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software).

Barnes maze

The behavioral apparatus consisted of a white flat circular disk with 20 holes around its perimeter. One hole held the entrance to a darkened escape box not visible from the surface of the board allowing the subject to exit the maze. The escape chamber position remained fixed during all trials. Mice learn the location of the escape hole using spatial reference points that were fixed in relation to the maze (extra-maze cues). The task consisted of one habituation trial on day 1 where the escape hole was presented to the animal the animal remained in the escape box for 2 min. After the habituation trial the training phase consisted of four 3-min trials of spatial acquisition for 4 consecutive days with a 15 min inter-trial interval. On the fifth day (probe trial) the escape box was removed and the animals were allowed to explore the maze for 90 s. All sessions were recorded using Debut video software and assessed through ANY-maze software. For each trial several parameters were recorded to assess performance. These include the latency to locate the escape box the number of incorrect holes checked prior to entering the escape box as well as the distance traveled prior to locating the escape box. For the probe trial the time spent on the target hole was analyzed. A two-way repeated measure ANOVA was applied to compare escape latency across days between groups. For the comparison of WT and APP/PS1 treated and untreated performance in the probe trial a Kruskal Wallis test with a Dunn’s post hoc was used. An Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test was used to compare WT and APP/PS1 at 7mo. All the statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software).

Statistics and reproducibility

Statistical analyses of gene expression and reaction fluxes were done in R using the rstatix package. The genome-scale metabolic networks were analyzed using COBRA toolbox v3.079 implemented in MATLAB R2018a. Academic licenses of Gurobi optimizer and IBM CPLEX v12.7.1 solvers were used in MATLAB. SurfStat software package (www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/) was used to perform a multivariable analysis of generalized linear regression to examine the association of genetic variation on brain structural changes in the neuroimaging data. For the lipidomics analysis we used age sex diagnostic group and the first five components derived by multidimensional scaling for population stratification and used PLINK v1.984 for calculating genetic associations. All the statistical analyses in APP/PS1 and WT mice were performed using the GraphPad Prism version 9.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software).

Here is what Kerrisdale Capital had to say about Paycom Software Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) in its July 2022 investor letter:

“We are short shares of Paycom Software Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) a $19 billion SaaS-based payroll services company that has been one of the best performing large capitalization software stocks since it went public in 2014. Even after the market turmoil of this year Paycom trades at more than 70x the consensus estimate for this year’s free cash flow a testament to the fact that while unprofitable tech companies and temporary pandemic winners have been justly punished in the markets there’s still plenty of froth left in allegedly higher quality fare. Paycom’s valuation in particular doesn’t come close to reflecting the near term headwinds of slowing employment growth meaningful TAM saturation and increasing competitive intensity. Paycom’s steady and robust growth over the past decade has come by way of taking market share from payroll industry behemoths ADP and Paychex. Paycom has been accompanied in this quest by high-tech peers Paylocity (PCTY) and closely held BambooHR and has been buttressed by secular job growth trends in the US small and medium business sector. But Paycom is no longer a $100 million annual revenue upstart and neither are its peers. At $1.4 billion of run-rate recurring revenue the company is a scaled business and combined with Paylocity Bamboo and other dynamic tech companies in the sector the group’s share of the SME payroll market is north of 40%. That’s a lot more than the blue-sky implications of Paycom’s 5% market share claim and it means that further market share gains will be a lot more difficult going forward. At the same time ADP is fighting back increasing its customer retention rate and growing its employee rolls. Rippling and Gusto two rapidly growing startups in the space have also recently raised capital at $10-billion-plus valuations and are actively fighting for market share. All this means that the competition faced by Paycom is about to get a lot tougher. If that weren’t enough US employment growth looks to be decelerating at a fairly significant clip which means that all the payroll players will be fighting in a smaller field. For a SaaS company with an astronomical valuation like Paycom’s price cutting is probably not something investors are accustomed to thinking about but they might soon have to…” (Click here to read the full text)

“Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a leading provider of innovative customizable team-collaboration software tools for over 200000 customers. Despite positive fundamental momentum—the company recently reported 30% revenue growth and 28% trailing twelve months FCF margins—shares traded lower during Q2 as investors rotated out of high-growth stocks with elevated multiples. The company’s highly efficient sales and marketing capability combined with substantial R&D investment points to sustained long-term revenue and FCF growth. Meanwhile we recognize a recession would likely have an impact on Atlassian via slowing growth metrics. However we believe its low priced mission critical cloud tools would prove relatively resilient in this scenario. For these reasons and shares trading at a very attractive valuation for a business with highly recurring revenues strong revenue growth prospects and attractive margins we added to our position.”

Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Axon Enterprise Inc. (NYSE:AXON) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“Axon Enterprise Inc. (NYSE:AXON) is a public safety-oriented company that sells its products to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Its mission is to “…make the bullet obsolete” using non-lethal TASER® devices combined with digital cameras cloud-based software and virtual reality training. This array of technology aims to provide better relationships between law enforcement and its constituent communities and to reduce fatal outcomes dramatically when stressful confrontations occur. Axon takes its mission seriously and has an extensive ethics committee that includes members of law enforcement and activist communities. Axon claims that with usage of body cameras complaints against police departments are down 88% and use of force is down 58%. We believe the company is a premier part of the solution to prevent bad actors in law enforcement and the mistrust that has resulted from those bad actors. The company has three major product lines: first high-definition cameras (sensor division) worn on the body or mounted on vehicles (newer products incorporate live streaming and automated license plate readers); second subscription-based digital evidence software (evidence.com) that stores body camera and third-party video allowing for evidentiary chain of custody search and report writing (officer court time reduced by 70%); and third non-lethal TASER devices (that can temporarily incapacitate dangerous and violent actors using an electrical shock) that save lives by avoiding discharging firearms (the company claims 258000 lives have been saved so far). When used in combination its cameras provide GPS officer location and live streaming while its software can provide real-time operations mapping of active situations. In the future Axon seeks to add consumer safety products (launching in 2022) that will automatically notify 911 if deployed drone-based camera products more VR training and additional cloud-based software including evidence software usable by prosecutors and defense attorneys which could be a $1 billion market on its own. From a financial perspective the company is really built upon recurring revenue – it is not a one-time device sales company. Software made up 28.5% of 2021 revenues. And while hardware made up 43% of 2021 sales about two-thirds of that is now bundled under long-term deals so really only about 15% of the company’s total revenue is one time in nature. The remaining 27% of sales is warranty and cartridge consumables which are largely recurring as well. As software grows as a proportion of revenue (to what we believe will be over 40% by 2026) margins should expand. We believe that EBITDA margins can expand from 20% in 2021 to nearly 30% by 2026. Revenue growth which was nearly 27% in 2021 should continue at over 20% given that the company is less than 2% penetrated into its $52 billion addressable market. Finally the company has over $400 million of cash and no debt on its balance sheet. When combined with its significant free cash flow (about 75% of EBITDA converts to free cash flow) Axon has significant capital to grow its business complete accretive acquisitions and potentially return capital to shareholders.”

Under the new plan of the government every car which will get sold in India from 2030 will be electric. Due to the competitive environment in the market India’s auto industry has become one of the largest in the world. As per the Review Report of Automotive Mission Plan 2016 the turnover of the auto industry is equivalent to 7.1%. The government of India approved the National Mission on Electric Mobility in 2011 and subsequently National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 which was unveiled in 2013. Department of Heavy Industry has formulated a scheme namely FAME – India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India) for implementation with effect from 1st April 2015 which therefore was part of the mission India’s national mission for electric mobility and faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) looks to have received its much-required shot in the arm. Thanks to a few key amendments established by the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) in June 2021 to the FAME-II Scheme the EV momentum saw a notable revival and gained pace especially in the wake of the remarkable slowdown experienced due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The overall scheme is proposed to be executed over a period of 6 years till 2020 wherein it is intended to carry the hybrid/electric vehicles market development and its manufacturing eco-system to achieve self-sustenance at the end of the stipulated period. The scheme has 4 focus areas i.e.

Demand Creation Charging Infrastructure Technology Development and Pilot Projects.

An electric car uses alternate fuel electricity in place of petrol or diesel. There is a developing acceptance for hybrid and electric cars in the country and more and more manufacturers are going for this niche segment with an express objective of lowering the import bill of fuel and running cost of vehicles. Conversion of vehicles to electric vehicles can save fossil fuels worth about $100 bn per year which in turn prevents the dependence on imported petroleum products which would save the country precious foreign exchange and will also reduce the pollution in cities by 80-90%.

The government’s ambition is to have EV sales accounting for 30% of private cars 70% for commercial vehicles and 80% for two- and three-wheelers by 2030 as there is an instant need to decarbonise the transport sector. If electric vehicles expand to 40% in the car segments and two-wheeler and close to 100% for buses by 2030 India would be able to cut crude oil consumption by 156 million tonnes which is worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore.

The government introduced the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME 2) scheme with an expenditure of INR 10K Cr. It aims to give the required push to EVs to curb pollution afflicting major cities and cut down oil imports. FAME has put a healthy number of electric buses 2W 3W and some BEV and mild hybrid cars on Indian roads. In FY 2019 more than 750K EVs were sold with a total of 7 59600 units which include electric passenger vehicles (3600 electric three-wheelers (630K) and electric two-wheelers (126K).

By 2030 the government plans to have EV sales penetration of 40% for buses 30% for private cars 70% for commercial vehicles and 80% for two- and three-wheelers. The Road Transport and Highways Minister pointed out that NITI Aayog has inspired 25 States to come up with EV policies out of which 15 have already announced State EV policies in the EV mission.

The study by Arthur D Little titled ‘Unlocking India’s electric mobility potential’ anticipates that by the year 2030 more than 30 percent of vehicles in India will be electric. The study also highlights that by 2030 the EV industry will cross 10 million vehicles with an adoption rate of 30 percent across categories. However the study also emphasises that passenger cars will only amount to 5 percent of total EV sales.

Disclosing more details the study suggests that by 2030 India will require approximately 800 GWh of batteries to be able to attain 30% EV adoption. To achieve this the country is accelerating the plans to manufacture lithium-ion cells anticipating more than 7.5 billion USD in investment potential and USD 2.3 billion in government subsidies.

The EV industry illured $6 billion in investment in 2021 this could grow to $20 billion by 2030. In a sign it looks like the EV market is drawing the attention of private equity/venture capital investors in India such funding is estimated to grow from $181 million to $1718 million during the same period – an annual growth rate of 849%. So far This (PE/VC investment) has reached about $666 million in 2022.

It was easy. What's the big deal?,"Recently I drove a Tesla Model 3 on an electric roadtrip from Southern California to Portland and back. The total distance was around 2200 miles with the bulk of the driving happening over the course of five days (three up two down) and I only “spent” about 25 minutes waiting for the car to charge total over the whole trip.

There are many travelogues and YouTube channels that go into deep analyses of efficiency and charging speed with lots of detail on how exactly to plan an electric roadtrip. Though I typically do enjoy those sorts of details I didn’t actually think to keep track of any of them during this trip since they’re all sort of unnecessary at this point because electric roadtrips are easy.

The roadtrip included a mixture of heavy driving days on interstates and lighter days on state routes with side routes and sightseeing. We had two drivers in the car along with luggage for three and didn’t bother to plan the route ahead of time except for the goal of getting a little time on the Northern California/Oregon coast and seeing some coastal redwoods along the way. Both of us have plenty of experience driving and charging electric cars though this is the longest electric roadtrip I personally have been on.

And that 25 minute number – that counts the amount of time spent waiting for charging and doing nothing else productive. If we were getting a meal that was “free” charging time since we need to eat anyway. In other words time spent charging that would have otherwise been spent driving if we weren’t charging.

Side routes? Detours? No problem

It has been said many times that electric roadtrips are doable as long as you stick to the plan and don’t deviate at all. Most chargers are along main routes which see the most traffic – smaller routes have fewer chargers or slower ones or don’t have any at all.

Well… we didn’t have a plan. We didn’t plan our route ahead around charger availability merely left in the morning and charged where we wanted to once we got hungry or needed to take a driving break. In the car’s navigation system it’s easy to pull up a list of chargers see what services exist at each stop and search the map nearby for restaurants hotels bathrooms and so on. And if you’re new to this whole thing you can ask the car to route you to your destination and it will tell you where to charge and for how long (you can modify the plan if you’d like and we usually did).

Restaurants near the Tejon Ranch charger Say “take me to Portland”and the car shows you this

Everything was straightforward until the second morning of the trip where right before setting out towards the coast from Williams CA I sustained an injury which needed urgent care (I won’t bore you with the details of how badly my insurance company Oscar dealt with the situation but they deserve mention for being unhelpful). Turns out there’s no urgent care in Williams CA so off we went on twisty roads towards the coast. After a couple hours through mountains and trees we got to Fort Bragg which along with urgent care facilities also had a supercharger despite being quite far from anything that might be considered a main road.

The car’s ultrasonic sensors were not happy with me for this

We continued on and drove through the Avenue of the Giants an area of coastal redwoods the tallest trees in the world which were breathtaking to behold and only made better by the silence of driving with electric propulsion. At one stop a man in a truck remarked “You’re the first Tesla I’ve seen in four days” presumably suggesting that Teslas mostly stick to the main roads and don’t get out to the more empty regions. We thought that was odd since at no point on the trip did we feel restricted by charging concerns (and we did see other EVs but maybe not as many as we saw on the main roads or near the cities).

Unfortunately we had to end our side-route adventure the next day turning in through the mountains towards Grant’s Pass due to the time loss associated with our medical misadventure. The coastal route would have added about two hours (of driving not charging) along with sightseeing time and we had a dinner to get to – though charging in Bandon and Lincoln City on the coast would have been just about as easy as our charges in Grant’s Pass and Harrisburg were.

Charging is available fast and pleasant

Charging was never a problem during our electric roadtrip. We chose hotels with chargers (by checking PlugShare) but these hotels were in the towns we wanted to stop in so we didn’t have to go out of our way to find these overnight charges.

Each overnight charge was “free” insofar as it was included with the hotel and it was nice to leave in the morning with a 100% charge (rather than ~80% which is the usual state of charge to leave a supercharger at). This provided more flexibility on where to charge during the day and saved some money on supercharging fees.

Every charge save one or two was associated with a meal or bathroom break which meant we spent little actual time charging during the trip. Every stop by the time we were done with what we needed to do on the stop the car was already ready to go with 200+ added miles of range.

Whether it be walking to and eating fast food waiting to be seen at urgent care (whoops) devouring the haul from a local fruit stand or having free wine samples (only the passenger of course) there was plenty to do at each stop and only ever a few minutes if at all spent “waiting” for the car to charge enough to continue on.

On that wine tasting point a special mention goes to the Olsen Run Winery at the Harrisburg OR supercharger which exists poetically on the property of an old gas station (though for some reason isn’t listed in the in-car search for nearby restaurants – don’t be fooled stop there anyway).

Instead of serving up stinky cancer-causing dino juice it now pushes electrons and delicious burgers (with veggie option) fries shakes and free wine tastings and even serves as an event space (in… the middle of nowhere). It was such a pleasant stop that even though we didn’t need a charge we stopped again on the way back South from Portland just for the burgers and conversation. We hope to see more entrepreneurial innovation with properties like this converting stinky old gas stations into something much more pleasant.

And we didn’t even take advantage of every charge opportunity – one of which was actually easier for non-Teslas. We stopped at a rest stop right after the CA border just to look around and by chance happened to find a free CCS/CHAdeMO DC fast charger there. We didn’t have the necessary CHAdeMO or CCS adapter but didn’t need a charge anyway though we still got an emotional charge standing by a pleasant river breathing clean air unsullied by gas station fumes and seeing some unnervingly bold deer crawling all over the place on the rest stop lawn which was clearly marked “no pets.”

All told we probably only spent a total of about 25 minutes across the whole trip doing nothing but charging. This was primarily at the last charge on the last day where we stopped at an outlet mall (Tejon Ranch East supercharger) after business hours and spent about 15 minutes watching a couple play with their dog in the parking lot while charging. The point is: The amount of extra time spent actively charging across the whole trip was no more than the amount of active time it takes to fill up at gas stations – and perhaps even less.

650 miles in one day

Typically on roadtrips I don’t like to do more than around 300 miles in a day. After that point you start feeling like you’ve been in the car forever like you haven’t gotten to see or do anything outside of the car you feel cooped up and tired and stressed and so on.

But sometimes you just want to get home and rest your broken toe and you don’t have any particular sights you want to see along the boring I-5 in California. So you spend the morning tooling around Mount Shasta after an overnight charge then set out to drive almost the entire length of California in one day.

And when driving in a car with one driver with a broken toe and the other with a bum knee autopilot is nice to have. While the promise of full self-driving is not here (…yet?) autopilot does work well on highways and helps reduce fatigue on a long drive like this.

On this 650 mile day we stopped for three charges – Woodland to get a pizza Firebaugh for a taco and Tejon Ranch. Again we didn’t have to wait for the car until the very last charge where we weren’t hungry and didn’t need a break so waited about 15 minutes.

Even if people recognize that electric roadtrips are doable they will often carve out an exception for these long driving days suggesting that they would be hindered by charging when they really need to make a lot of ground quickly. Well given that we only “spent” 15 minutes charging during this 650 mile day (again not counting the two fast food meals and bathroom breaks which we needed anyway) that doesn’t really sound like much of a hindrance given that at least one 10-minute gas stop would be necessary if the roadtrip were done on gas (and don’t forget the ~5-7 other gas stops that would have been needed over the 2200-mile trip and can’t be done overnight at a hotel).

Reminders why electric roadtrips are important

We did make a brief stop during our longest driving day to look at Shasta Lake which put a bit of a point on why we spent five days doing an electric roadtrip instead of the more convenient option of burning fuel in a plane to get to where we were going:

California like many parts of the world is experiencing historic drought. Shasta Lake the largest reservoir in the state is at critically low levels. The lake feeds the Bay Area and the Central Valley the most agriculturally productive land in the nation which provides more than half of the fruits vegetables and nuts for the entire US.

This drought is exacerbated by climate change causing dry weather and high temperatures in the area and climate change is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel emissions from transportation are the largest contributor to climate change in the US (another major factor is animal agriculture which not only produces methane emissions but uses large amounts of water).

The rest of the final day was spent driving through that valley which also happens to be one of the more polluted places in the country. Air pollution from trucks and machinery gets trapped by the mountains causing constant smog conditions. Despite being in a valley you wouldn’t really know it because much of the time you can’t see the mountains all around you due to the smog.

There’s supposed to be mountains in the background but that thing in the foreground seems to obscure them…

So not only was an EV the right choice for the practical side of the roadtrip but also for the greater picture – trying to avoid the environmental disasters caused by fossil fuel usage.

Your mileage may vary?

We encountered no charging reliability problems on the trip. There were a few supercharger connectors that weren’t working at some of the stops but the car informed us ahead of time which ones were inactive and it never affected charge speed or the locations we chose to charge at.

Of course this trip was on the West Coast of the US mostly in California the state with the most EVs. I have been assured that the trip would be more difficult elsewhere or on a network other than Tesla’s superchargers (though other cars will gain access to Tesla’s system soon™). Other networks probably wouldn’t be as easy and other cars don’t have as elegant a routing and “nearby search” system as the Tesla system or as simple of a “plug-and-charge” payment system like superchargers have.

But I have also been assured that this trip would be difficult with so many people talking about how hard it is to take roadtrips in an electric car.

But it wasn’t hard it was easy. So this suggests to me that those other trips while perhaps not as easy as mine may well be more possible than people think they are.

(*The comments below say the same – many say this trip would be more difficult elsewhere alongside several stories of readers who have done similar trips elsewhere and with other cars and it wasn’t a problem including one reader who emailed us about a similar drive from Portland to Santa Cruz and back in a Leaf in five days with one 450-mile day.)

I will reiterate again that we did not plan a route ahead. We didn’t plug our trip into ABRP or other route planners. We didn’t stick to a specific speed so we could make our charging plan. We changed routes frequently on a whim we charged when or where we felt like doing so or where there was a restaurant we were interested in. None of this was an issue. It was just a regular roadtrip but less polluting more pleasant and cheaper.

And yet there is a persistent myth that since EVs are supposedly incapable (they are not as displayed above) of doing this one thing that most cars will never do they are therefore not an acceptable source of transportation. Nevermind that they are superior in normal driving tasks – and as displayed above not even inferior in this one – somehow this myth still persists.

It should also be noted that trips like this are not a common occurrence. As a practical matter most cars will rarely if ever do a roadtrip like this. But particularly in America cars are not sold for what they’ll be used for but for every conceivable purpose the buyer could ever imagine using them for. You’re not being sold a tool you’re being sold a dream – the dream of freedom in the form of a $1000/mo car payment.

This is the reason the “electric roadtrips are impossible!” myth has gained so much traction – Americans are buying the dream of the Great American roadtrip and think that an EV makes that dream impossible.

Well I’m here to tell you that it’s not impossible. In fact it’s more than possible – it’s even better than the alternative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi90ZXNsYS1zZWxscy1yZWNvcmQtY2hpbmEtbWFkZS12ZWhpY2xlcy1zZXB0ZW1iZXItZm9sbG93aW5nLXNoYW5naGFpLWZhY3RvcnktMjAyMi0xMC0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla's China-made sales hit record following Shanghai factory upgrade,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-sells-record-china-made-vehicles-september-following-shanghai-factory-2022-10-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi90ZXNsYS1zZWxscy1yZWNvcmQtY2hpbmEtbWFkZS12ZWhpY2xlcy1zZXB0ZW1iZXItZm9sbG93aW5nLXNoYW5naGFpLWZhY3RvcnktMjAyMi0xMC0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2hvbWUvc21hcnQtaG9tZS9kb250LWxhdWdoLW9mZi10aGUtdGVzbGEtYm90LWVsb24tbXVza3Mtb3B0aW11cy1pcy10aGUtcmVhbC1kZWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don't Laugh Off the Tesla Bot. Elon Musk's Optimus Is the Real Deal,"When watching Tesla's humanoid Optimus robot debut at AI Day 2022 it's entirely fair to be skeptical about the company's ultra-ambitious plans. The prototype robot's shuffling gait paled to the exciting parkour and flips of Boston Dynamics' Atlas and Tesla has missed many deadlines bringing its full self-driving technology to its cars.

But I was at the AI Day event and I'm here to advise you not to dismiss Tesla's sci-fi inspired vision.

The company revealed abundant evidence that it's thinking deeply about a bipedal robot and the artificial intelligence technology needed to make it useful. And much of Tesla's track record of genuine achievements in electric vehicle engineering and manufacturing apply to Optimus.

Non-Tesla experts in robotics and AI I spoke with at the event were impressed with Optimus the code name for the Tesla Bot. And Tesla engineers had the kind of fire in their bellies that bodes well for progress especially when backed by Chief Executive Elon Musk's vision and Tesla's resources.

""I haven't worked this hard since grad school. But I love it"" said one senior chip designer working on Tesla's Dojo technology for training the artificial intelligence systems behind Optimus' ability to navigate rooms and Tesla's FSD technology to steer cars. He wasn't authorized to speak to the media.

Seeing the Tesla Bot firsthand was impressive

I was impressed too compared with last year when Tesla debuted Optimus as a few presentation slides accompanied by a robot-costumed human dancer.

I didn't applaud and cheer like many of the 1000-plus people crammed onto a giant shop floor at Tesla's offices in Palo Alto California when the first Tesla Bot walked across the stage. I did appreciate the engineering achievement when seeing the computer-controlled biped pivot at the waist without toppling powered by a computer on its chest moved by a collection of gleaming cylindrical actuators studded with status LEDs and cabled with a copper nervous system. I heard its cooling fans blow and later strained to heft the 42-pound block of copper and electronics that constitutes each 25-processor Dojo AI training tile.

It's not yet clear whether humanoid robots will someday do our shopping or take over from humans toiling on production lines as Musk envisions. The controversial and outspoken billionaire estimates it'll be three to five years before the first Optimus goes on sale an eternity in the technology world. But if his vision holds true it could transform the world as profoundly as the automobile or smartphone.

""We wouldn't be surprised to see it becoming the primary driver of the stock price towards the end of the decade"" New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu said in a report Monday. ""Imagine Optimus as a startup today: It could be valued at several billion dollars maybe even a few tens.""

Research firm IDTechEx expects spending on service robots to nearly quintuple by 2032 to $70 billion.

To be sure there's a long trip from prototype to product as AI Day attendees were reminded when seeing a Tesla Semi and Cybertruck two vehicles that have missed initial ship dates.

While Tesla's ability to deliver on its robot vision is even more up in the air I'd recommend against writing the project off merely as Musk's utopian fantasy. Here's why.

Give Musk credit for creating nerd heaven

Musk has a talent for picking businesses that are difficult but attainable for finding engineers up for the challenge and providing them an environment where they expect to make a difference. They've managed to stay motivated even with Musk distractions like launching new companies and acquiring Twitter.

One who works at SpaceX which has upended the rocket business the same way Tesla is shaking up the automotive industry said rivals have tried recruiting her several times. They'd be cushy jobs she said but in practice she wouldn't really get to do anything there. She wasn't authorized to speak to the media.

We might spend lots of money on laptops and smartphones but Musk is looking for newer horizons. ""You definitely want to see what's happening with Optimus whereas a bunch of other technologies are sort of plateaued"" Musk said at the AI Day event.

That message resonated with one engineer I spoke with at AI Day who's working on actuators a key mechanism that moves Optimus' torso legs arms and fingers. Previously he worked at Boeing but he sees robotics as a new wave of innovation.

AI Day 2022 is explicitly set up as a recruiting event for engineers. One I spoke with who works for a direct Tesla rival showed up because of a recruiting email. Another who works on surgical robots was clearly impressed by the breadth and funding of Tesla's work in the area. Nobody was laughing off Tesla's Optimus.

Tesla Bot represents deep research

On stage at AI Day a pre-Optimus prototype called Bumble-C shuffled waved pumped its arms and flexed at the waist. It was unspectacular by some standards but also the result of less than a year's work. A series of engineers shared the stage with Musk to detail the research that's so far gone into Optimus. Among them:

Tesla is designing its own actuators tightly packaged sets of gears motors sensors and controls that act like human muscles. The company is drawing from the team that already designs Tesla cars' drive units. At AI Day engineers showed Tesla's calculations on how it settled on a collection of six actuators for the whole robot that best optimized cost ease of manufacturing speed torque mass and efficiency.

Tesla is drawing lessons from human anatomy for example employing a complex four-bar hinging mechanism similar to the human knee that adapts an actuator's differing needs for strength or speed depending on how far the knee is bent.

Tesla is using the same AI technology behind FSD to guide Optimus too. That includes the occupancy network an AI system that converts camera input data into a 3D map of everything around a robot.

Tesla is building its own custom data center technology Dojo to train the multiple AI systems that go into a vehicle or robot. So far Tesla has built three cabinets of Dojo hardware and already it can handle video training data in ways impossible with the earlier approach using 72 of Nvidia's high-end A100 processors.

For locomotion Optimus combines a physics model that simulates a virtual robot with real-world sensor data that gauges how the robot is actually performing. The walking technology has grown more sophisticated: first steps were in February; Optimus' pelvis started rocking in July; swinging arm motion accompanying its strides starting in August; and Optimus' toes first lifted off the ground in September.

""The Tesla team is so far ahead and so confident in its pace of innovation that it doesn't worry about sharing details of what they do"" Ferragu said.

AI is mandatory on Optimus

Optimus faces a challenge that Tesla cars do not: It requires AI for everything it does. Tesla can make a successful business selling industry-leading electric vehicles piloted entirely by humans then gradually develop autonomous vehicle technology.

Tesla in September expanded beta testing of FSD its software designed to eventually lead to self-driving cars. 160000 people in the United States and Canada have access CEO Elon Musk said. Stephen Shankland/CNET

With humanoid robots AI has to work from the start. And the AI challenge is harder with robots.

A quick primer on today's AI technology: Instead of programming computers with narrow rigid if-this-then-that instructions AI works by training a system to recognize patterns in vast quantities of real-world data. That lets AI systems handle much more complexity and make more nuanced decisions.

The tricky thing is that self-driving cars encounter a huge variety of situations. Even the same road intersection can be very different if it's raining under construction or blocked by a stalled car.

Tesla is investing massively to overcome these challenges slurping up 100 terabytes of video data reported by its cars every day according to one engineer at Tesla AI Day. It also simulates various conditions to extend AI training situations beyond that real-world data.

But the variety of situations robots could encounter is vastly broader. Think of how different one home is from the one next door. Then compare those homes to businesses sidewalks and farms.

Tesla's robot demonstration videos were set in a relatively narrow domain though: its offices and research labs. And Musk said the company plans to first test them in its own ""gigafactories."" That could provide enough training data to give the robots a useful foothold.

Why build the Optimus robot?

Musk offered a somewhat murky motivation for why to build Optimus. SpaceX's job is to get humanity to Mars and Tesla electric vehicles and batteries are to wean us from fossil fuels. Musk's explanation for Optimus seemed more opportunistic: Tesla has the expertise so it might as well.

Musk hopes Optimus will ""help millions of people"" freeing humans from boring dangerous and repetitive work. In his most starry-eyed moment he said robots could lead to ""a future of abundance a future where there is no poverty where people can have whatever you want in terms of products and services. It really is a fundamental transformation of civilization as we know it.""

I wouldn't expect an end to poverty anytime soon. But today's Optimus is taking big steps literally and figuratively from last year's debut as just an idea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGF0ZXNsYWFwcC5jb20vdGVzbGEtcmVmZXJlbmNlLzk2My9ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXdlLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtdGhlLXRlc2xhLXNlbWnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Everything We Know About the Tesla Semi,"Tesla delivered its first production Semis on December 1 2022 to its first customer PepsiCo. It was five years in the making; Elon Musk first introduced this idea to the world on December 14 2017. With deliveries officially taking place the Tesla Semi is on the right track to change the trucking industry and in the words of Musk: This is going to revolutionize the road make the world a better place in a meaningful way.

The Semi Beginning

Elon Musk first mused about the Tesla Semi in his Master Plan Part Deux which appeared on the company website on July 20 2016. Under the header: Expand to Cover the Major Forms of Terrestrial Transport the CEO went further than sedans and SUVs. ""There are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport.

Both are in the early stages of development at Tesla and should be ready for unveiling next year (2017)"" wrote Musk. He also added ""we believe the Tesla Semi will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate.""

However you could trace the Semi back even further. At the delivery event Musk reminded everyone of the Tesla mission “Our actual mission is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. So that is why we are making this wide range of cars that don’t really make sense from a brand standpoint traditionally but makes total sense when you consider what is the mission of the company.”

The company stated there are 15 million passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. every year but only a couple hundred thousand big rigs. But that small percentage of long haulers makes up 20 percent of U.S. vehicle emissions because they are large vehicles that are always being used. Musk also pointed out that more than one-third of articulate emissions are produced by semi-trucks.

Tri-motors and a 1000-volt Powertrain

When Musk introduced the Tesla Semi in 2017 he compared it to current semi-trucks on the road today and to a $2 million supercar the Bugatti Chiron. The first features the CEO talked about were performance but not just any performance.

Instead Tesla referred to it as BAMF Performance. I'll let you figure out the acronym. While the appearance alone will make the Semi a standout at truck stops it's the performance that will change the trucking industry.

The Semi was initially going to have four independent motors; however when delivered it was down to a tri-motor system similar to the Model S Plaid. But don’t let that fool you. Senior Manager of Tesla’s Semi Engineering Dan Priestley explained why many people refer to the Semi as the beast.

“(It has) three times the power than any diesel truck on the road right now. So you’ve got all the power you need to get the job done but the other reason that it’s a beast is because it is efficient you can go 500 miles on a single charge on one of these things. It’s the mix of those two - this is a game-changer. What’s awesome is both of those are enabled by our 1000-volt powertrain. This is the first vehicle we are doing with that.”

Tri-Motors and a Clutch

The tri-motor power train system has one motor that will carry the load the majority of the time as it’s mainly for highway driving. That efficiency motor is approximately the size of a football. The other two are for torque and acceleration. Those motors use the system straight out of the Model S Plaid powertrain except the Semi can physically disengage two motors when they're not in use.

Tesla introduced a clutch that will automatically engage or disengage the two performance motors. According to Tesla the clutch will automatically engage the performance motors when needed and it'll do it completely seamlessly. Instead of having the motors moving freely when not in use like the Model S Plaid disengaging them results in even better efficiency. Priestly said “These are clutched automatically no driver input is needed. It is seamless.”

Semi Performance

Musk commented on the Semi’s performance “It looks crazy it looks like an elephant moving like a cheetah.” When it was launched it was promoted as reaching 60 miles per hour in five seconds without a load. It can also reach 60 miles per hour fully loaded with the maximum 80000 pounds gross vehicle weight in 20 seconds. As for up a hill with the full weight current diesel trucks achieve 45 miles per hour at a 5% grade; the Tesla Semi will do 65 miles per hour at the same degree.

Semi Range and Efficiency

While the speed and acceleration are undoubtedly impressive and a considerable improvement over the current diesel trucks on the road the range is the industry's most important factor. Tesla states that its Semis have a 500-mile range at maximum gross vehicle weight and highway speeds. This number is significant because 80% of trucking routes are 250 miles or less. ""You can deliver a load out to the middle of nowhere and come back"" said Musk.

It seems that this claim was the most in dispute. Bill Gates openly doubted the range in a blog post dated August 24 2020. The Gates Notes stated: Even with big breakthroughs in battery technology electric vehicles will probably never be a practical solution for things like 18-wheelers cargo ships and passenger jets. Electricity works when you need to cover short distances but we need a different solution for heavy long-haul vehicles.

Tesla set out to prove him wrong. They recorded an entire unedited video of the Tesla Semi traveling 500 miles on a single charge. Luckily they speed up the eight-hour video to a few seconds for the presentation but it did show a long haul with 82000 pounds going from Fremont to San Diego.

There are several advanced technologies at work to make this happen. The Semi's current efficiency is about 1.7kWh per mile but Musk sees a way to make it even more efficient.

""We designed the Tesla truck to be like a bullet whereas normal diesel trucks are designed more like a barn wall; this is a bullet"" said the Tesla CEO. The Semi can generate the performance and the range due to the design. The drag coefficient or wind resistance of the regular diesel trucks is a .65 to .70. The Tesla Semi scores a 0.36 cutting the regular diesel truck drag in half and even beating the Bugatti Chiron score of .38.

The sleek nose and flat bottom are accompanied by side flaps that adjust to the trailer. These features help cut the drag and increase the range.

Charging the Semi

Tesla nearly upstaged the Semi delivery by announcing what will be charging it. The new V4 Superchargers are capable of producing 1 MW DC. Musk explained “to charge a truck like this quickly you need a high-powered charger. It’s our next-generation immersive cooling. It’s liquid-cooled so you don’t need like a gigantic elephant truck of a cable you can actually have a small cable and that cable delivers a megawatt… We’ve 3x-ed the current density.”

Priestley went further into detail “This is pretty cool stuff. You’re actually immersing the conductor in the coolant. This water-based coolant that we have we are doing some really neat isolation monitoring on the back end to ensure that it is safe and delivering what it needs to. But it means that we can really shove a lot of current in a very very small place. So for those who have charged their cars at a V3 Supercharger and the cable’s nice and maneuverable it’s the same thing here but now we’re just shoving a megawatt through it instead.”

Tesla wants the Semi to go from empty to 70 percent in 30 minutes. That time is vital to note because in most jurisdictions drivers must stop every six hours for a 30-minute break. The company says that the Semi will have added 400 miles in half an hour which can last another six hours. Additionally these chargers will be at destinations that would allow owners to charge the Semi while it is being loaded or unloaded.

Tesla Semi Unveiling

Displays and Software

The Semi's interior is most similar to the Model 3 or Model Y.

The Semi lacks an instrument cluster but features two horizontal displays one to either side of the driver.

The right display appears to contain the traditional launcher we have in today's Teslas with access to music phone cabin temperature and more while the left display contains truck-specific features at the bottom such as tire PSI trailer air supply and parking brake functions.

Although the software can be changed at any point the best way to describe the vehicle's current software is to compare it to a Model 3/Y.

The Semi essentially takes the display of the Model 3 or Model Y and splits it down the middle then puts those items on two separate displays.

The left display contains the speedometer gear selector battery indicators and the vehicle's visualization.

The right portion of the display on a Model 3 which includes information such as maps and apps is displayed on the Semi's right display.

However Tesla isn't taking up the entire display with these features. About one-third of each display appears to be reserved for always-on blind spot camera monitors.

Battery

Although Tesla hasn't released the exact size of the batteries in the Tesla Semi they have released enough information for us to accurately assess its size.

Tesla has said that the Semi will achieve an efficiency of less than 2 kWh per mile (1.24 kWh per km). Tesla has also said that the Semi will have a range of approximately 300 or 500 miles.

With these two bits of information we can speculate that the Semi will be available in two versions. A ""Long Range"" model that will have approximately a 1000 kWh or 1 MWh battery and a ""Standard"" version with about a 600 kWh battery.

For comparison a 2022 Model S contains a 100 kWh battery so the Tesla Semi will have a significantly larger battery at 6x to 10x the size of its smaller cousin.

Having a larger battery will allow the Semi to charge faster than Tesla's current models since the current can be spread across more batteries.

The first Tesla Semi trucks will use the 2170 battery cell; the same one that is used in the Tesla Model 3 and the Model Y. However it's expected the Tesla will eventually switch over to use their 4680 batteries once production improves.

Safety

The Semi comes with the same safety features as Tesla's existing vehicles the same kind of standards that have earned Tesla countless accolades. The Semi has Enhanced Autopilot Automatic Emergency Braking Automatic Lane Keeping and Forward Collision Warning.

The company also believes that moving the driver seat to the middle of the vehicle makes the Semi safer if it is involved in a crash. It has a low center of gravity due to the battery pack's location at the bottom and middle of the vehicle. That is the same as current Teslas reducing the vehicle's chance of rolling over. ""Jackknifing is impossible"" declared Musk. He said that due to the independent motors the Semi would detect a jackknifing situation and adjust the torque to the wheels needed to keep the vehicle from skidding out of control. ""Your worst nightmare is gone with this truck. Gone. You never have to worry about it.""

Driver Experience

When it comes to the experience of driving a Tesla Semi Musk summed it up best ""it's like driving a Model S or X or 3. It's just big."" Today big trucks on the roads can have anywhere from 10 to 18 gears . That's a lot of shifting. Operators of the Tesla Semi need to simply shift into drive. It's a lot less fatiguing and lets truckers focus more on the road.

The driver's seat is in the center of the expansive cockpit that is also tall enough that someone can stand in it. The videos and pictures have failed to show the sleeper cab portion of the vehicle. However there is a significant amount of room behind the cockpit to house a sleeping area.

Reliability

At the unveiling Musk made a shocking promise; he guaranteed that the Semi will not break down for a million miles. He was confident in that number because of the independent drivetrains. If one motor stops working the others can pick up the slack. Musk said if just two of the motors were active the Semi would still beat a diesel truck in performance.

Trucks put brakes to the test because they haul so much weight. But again like other Teslas the brakes will be used as generators and put back energy into the battery. ""Brake pads literally last forever"" said Musk. Removing the internal combustion engine also means no transmission to maintain emissions scrubber or differentials.

The Semi has thermonuclear explosion glass. Musk quipped ""it survives a nuclear explosion or you get a full refund."" He pointed out that on average semi-trucks' windshields crack at least once a year. Trucks are not legally allowed to drive with a cracked windshield in several areas worldwide. That means a single crack could park a trucker for an undetermined amount of time waiting to get fixed. The Tesla armored glass takes away that risk.

Just like other Teslas the app will be available for the Semi. That feature includes remote diagnostics predictive maintenance location tracking and connection to Tesla Mobile Service.

Cost of Ownership

Trucking is a unique business. The costs are difficult to predict mainly due to the fluctuations in the cost of diesel and maintenance. When the Semi was unveiled in 2017 the diesel fuel price per gallon was $2.50; Five years later it has more than doubled.

Tesla estimates that operators will save approximately $200000 over three years because electricity is 2.5 times cheaper per mile. There will also be considerable savings by not having to leave the truck in the shop for routine maintenance and less time off the road for cracked windshields.

Aerodynamics and Drag Coefficient

The Semi's aerodynamics produce even bigger cost savings if they operate in convoy. It's estimated a three-truck convoy averaging 60 miles per hour would cost $0.85 per mile. That price not only beats diesel trucks but also trains.

The Tesla Semi has a drag coefficient of just 0.36. This helps reduce wind noise and improve efficiency. A traditional diesel semi truck has a drag coefficient range between 0.65 and 0.70 while a Buggatti Chiron has a coefficient of 0.38. For comparison the Tesla Model 3 one of the most aerodynamics vehicles ever created has a coefficient of 0.23.

Buyers

Big name companies were some of the first to put down a deposit. Walmart ordered 130 Semis UPS purchased 125 Pepsi is waiting for 100 Anheuser Busch asked for 40 and FedEx has reserved 20.

Other names reported to have bought the Semi include Sysco DHL Ryder and Loblaws. It's believed that several independent truckers have also secured the Semi. Obviously Tesla is using its Semi. The attention-grabbing technological breakthrough has been spotted delivering Tesla products to dealerships in California.

A Megacharger has been installed at the Pepsi facility in California as well. Expect more companies to jump on board as these impressive beasts start to be spotted on highways worldwide.

While Tesla has closed reservations buyers in the United States may be lining up to get in once Tesla starts retaking orders. The Inflation Reduction Act announced in July could net Tesla Semi buyers upwards of $40000 in incentives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC93ZXJlLW5vdC1xdWl0ZS1zdXJlLXdoYXQtdG8tbWFrZS1vZi10aGlzLXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXMtd2l0aC1hLWxhbWJvcmdoaW5pLWh1cmFjYW4tZnJvbnQtZW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We're Not Quite Sure What To Make Of This Tesla Model S With A Lamborghini Huracan Front End,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC93ZXJlLW5vdC1xdWl0ZS1zdXJlLXdoYXQtdG8tbWFrZS1vZi10aGlzLXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXMtd2l0aC1hLWxhbWJvcmdoaW5pLWh1cmFjYW4tZnJvbnQtZW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC894D870>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC93ZXJlLW5vdC1xdWl0ZS1zdXJlLXdoYXQtdG8tbWFrZS1vZi10aGlzLXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXMtd2l0aC1hLWxhbWJvcmdoaW5pLWh1cmFjYW4tZnJvbnQtZW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

(AeroVironment)

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is poised to launch a competitive prototyping effort for a tactical drone after selecting AeroVironment’s Jump 20 earlier this year as an interim option. And according to Army aviation leaders the pool of competitors appears significantly larger than when competition began in 2019.

In 2018 the Army began considering requirements for a replacement for the Textron-made Shadow drone. The aircraft is widely used but is one of the most accident-prone unmanned aerial systems in the service’s inventory. It is also difficult to deploy and has a loud engine allowing for easy detection.

By 2019 the service narrowed the pool of competitors to two: a Martin UAV-Northrop Grumman team and Textron Systems’ AAI. Martin UAV supplied its V-Bat system while Textron offered its Aerosonde HQ.

Shortly after the Army added two more aircraft for evaluation: L3Harris Technologies’ FVR-90 and Arcturus UAV’s Jump 20. In 2021 AeroVironment acquired Arcturus for $405 million.

For about a year operational units evaluated the four different tactical drones culminating in a rodeo in spring 2021 at Fort Benning Georgia.

Two units received Arcturus’ offering while the other systems went to one unit each. That approach was based on the number of systems readily available and the service’s desire to get platforms to five units.

At the Fort Benning rodeo all five units tried each offering to compare them.

“Although the demonstrations were a critical portion of that to inform the requirements they weren’t necessarily going to be used as source selection” Maj. Gen. Robert Barrie the Army’s program executive officer for aviation told Defense News in a recent interview.

Demonstrations wrapped up in the first half of 2021 but it took until August 2022 for the Army to select one company to build an initial tranche of systems. The service was working through requirements an acquisition strategy and waiting for congressionally approved funding.

The Army in August awarded AeroVironment an $8 million contract to pay for one Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System which includes six air vehicles ground data terminals and ground control stations. The system will go to a single brigade combat team.

“Increment 1 ... really represents the current state of industry regarding performance capabilities that are going to get us rapidly deployable runway independent expeditionary [a] vertical takeoff [capability]” Barrie said ahead of the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference. “Increment 1 allows us to field a capability today that’s available.”

Increment 2 in which the Army prepares for a competitive prototyping phase “builds on that with all of those current demonstrated capabilities [but] it’s going to increase range [and] it’s going to incorporate a scalable control interface which [gives] the ability for multiple soldiers in multiple places to be able to control an Increment 2” Barrie said.

The second increment should also offer upgraded sensor capability — “specifically an enhanced laser designator” he added. The system is expected to offer more interoperability through manned-unmanned teaming for example and provide an improved controller interface.

Additionally he noted the second increment must enable organic maintenance of the system so the Army can “break ourselves of contractor logistics support.”

Following the Increment 2 competitive process which will involve multiple vendors the Army plans to choose a winner and buy its system in larger quantities than in Increment 1.

“It will be an incremental downselect [process] to maximize all of the competition” Barrie said.

Maj. Gen. Walter Rugen who manages the Army’s future vertical lift technology development said five units went through one of the longest soldier evaluations the Army has ever done and by the end were “pretty much demanding that technology.”

Because of that demand the Army decided to progress in an incremental fashion providing a unit immediate capability but then competing to pursue what the service considers to be a truly “transformational capability” Rugen said.

The incremental approach and a competition for a second increment are meant to help the Army get the best value for the best capability according to Barrie.

“One could argue: ‘OK [AeroVironment] won … therefore they have a leg up.’ The other side is we have well understood costs and capabilities and limitations with those systems” Barrie added. “So as we go into a competitive environment we will know very well what their system can do and we’ll be able to compare it against other systems.”

Asked whether to expect more industry participation this time around Barrie said: “100% yes. In fact I know we have a bigger pool.”

He wouldn’t provide a specific timeline on the Increment 2 prototyping effort but said decisions will come in fiscal 2023.

According to FY23 Army budget documents the service plans to enter FTUAS Increment 2 competitive prototyping in the first quarter of FY23 and wrap it up in the first quarter of FY25. The Army is slated to make a rapid fielding decision in the second quarter of FY25 and to hold an operational evaluation in the third quarter of FY25. The system is planned to then enter full-rate production in the second quarter of FY26.

A549 cells (human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Manassas USA) and HeLa Ohio cells (HOG human cervix carcinoma epithelial cells) were obtained from L. Kaiser (Central Laboratory of Virology University Hospital Geneva Switzerland) and used as described3233. Cells were cultured at 95% humidity 37 °C 5% CO 2 in high glucose Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham USA) supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen Carlsbad USA) 1% L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis USA) and 1% penicillin streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis USA). Cells were split regularly upon reaching 90% of confluence by washing with PBS followed by Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis USA) treatment not surpassing a passage number of 20.

Viruses

RV-A16-GFP was kindly provided by Dr. James Gern (University of Wisconsin–Madison Madison USA). The virus was expanded by inoculation of HeLa Ohio cells with a lysate from cells infected at 33.5 °C overnight. At occurrence of cytopathic effect (CPE) in 80–90% of cells the cells were harvested and pelleted. Lysis was performed by three freeze and thaw cycles and subsequent addition of 1% v/v NP40 and use of a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was treated with 150 μg of RNase per 10 ml at 37 °C for 30 min. Purification of the virus was performed on a CsCl gradient before dialysis against 140 mM NaCl 25 mM Hepes 5 mM MgCl 2 . The purified virus was stored at −80 °C3234. IAV-WSN (H1N1) was grown in MDCK cells and purified on a sucrose gradient3536. The recombinant strain HSV-1-C12-CMV-GFP referred to as HSV-1-GFP was kindly provided by S. Efstathiou (University of Cambridge Cambridge UK)3738. Virus was expanded on A549 cells (American Type Culture Collection) upon inoculation of supernatant from cells infected at 37 °C for 24 h. At 2 dpi when strong CPE was visible supernatant was collected cleared from debris by centrifugation at 1500 × g 4 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 22000 × g 4 °C for 90 min to pellet virions. The pellet was agitated overnight in MNT buffer (30 mM MES 100 mM NaCl 20 mM Tris pH 7.4) at 4 °C resuspended and virus was purified by centrifugation through a nycodenz gradient of 25% and 30% w/v in MNT buffer at 20000 rpm 4 °C for 2 h. All purified viruses were stored at −80 °C. Virus titers were determined by TCID 50 titration according to the Spearman-Kärber method.

Prestwick chemical library control compounds and Z’-plates

The Prestwick Chemical Library (PCL) was obtained from Prestwick Chemical (Illkirch France). Compounds for controls and validations were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge UK) Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor USA) MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction USA) and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis USA). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at concentrations of 10 50 or 100 mM. For each virus a set of four microscopy grade 384-well plates (Becton Dickinson AG Allschwil Switzerland) containing the negative and positive controls (columns 1 2 and 23 24) as well as the PCL compounds (columns 3–22) were prepared at a final concentration of 1.25 μM using an Echo acoustic dispenser (Labcyte Inc. Indiana USA) in four biological replicates. Positive controls were spotted at a concentration of 0.625 nM BafA1 for RV 1.563 nM BafA1 for IAV and 25 μM GCV for HSV respectively. DMSO was spotted at equivalent volumes as negative control. This way each screening plate contained 32 technical replicates of each positive and negative control and 320 of PCL compounds in single technical replicates. To assess the assay quality Z’-factors were determined for the optimized screening conditions for each virus. For this 192 wells of each Z’-plate were spotted with the DMSO control and 192 wells with the positive control compounds. All plates were stored at −20 °C until use.

High-throughput compound screening

Number of seeded cells virus stock dilution and incubation time were optimized prior to the execution of the compound screening. Determined parameters for the three viruses are summarized in Table 1. Cell seeding virus infection fixation and staining were performed using a Matrix WellMate dispenser and the corresponding Matrix WellMate tubing cartridges (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham USA). Prior to use plates were thawed for 30 min at room temperature (RT) briefly centrifuged and 10 μl of PBS were added to each well to dissolve the compounds. Subsequently cells were seeded in 60 μl culture medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C. On the next day virus was added in a volume of 10 μl culture medium per well. Plates were incubated for 24–48 h before they were fixed with 26.6 μl 16% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis USA) in PBS for 1 h at RT followed by three washings with PBS and final addition of 0.02% NaN 3 in PBS for storage at 4 °C. For IAV cells were incubated with 50 μl of NH 4 Cl for 10 min at RT followed by treatment with 0.25% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After three washes with PBS cells were blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis USA) for 30 min at RT. Staining with primary mouse monoclonal anti-IAV NP antibody HB-65 was carried out at a dilution of 1:15 in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA in a volume of 30 μl per well for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham USA) in a 1:1000 dilution in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in a volume of 30 μl for 1 h at RT. After three washes with PBS 0.02% NaN 3 in PBS was added to the cells for storage at 4 °C. For all steps standard bore tubing cartridges were used and tubings were rinsed with 125 ml autoclaved ddH 2 O and PBS before and after use and autoclaved before next use.

Imaging

Images of individual wells were acquired with the DAPI channel (nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342) and the FITC channel (viral GFP or NP). The plates for RV and IAV were imaged at UZH and EPFL while plates for HSV were imaged at UZH only. At UZH we used an IXM-C automated inverted epifluorescence microscope (Molecular Devices San Jose USA) at 4x magnification39. At EPFL plates were imaged using an IN CELL 2200 automated high-throughput fluorescence microscope (GE Healthcare Chicago USA)5.

Image analysis and data processing

Five main parameters were scored using the software Plaque2.026 to quantify the infection phenotype: number of nuclei number of infected nuclei infection index (ratio between total number of nuclei and number of infected nuclei) total virus intensity and number of plaques (infection foci). Each of the institutions optimized Plaque2.0 parameters according to the acquired data and all read-outs can be found in the Plaque2.0 output files ImageData.csv and ObjectData.csv. The obtained results were then processed in R version 4.0.240 at UZH and in KNIME version 3.5.341 together with the EPFL-BSF in-house LIMS at EPFL. For each of the four biological replicates of the 1280 PCL compounds as well as for the 32 technical replicates on 16 biological replicates of the positive and negative controls the mean scores for the five main read-outs were calculated. Each compound score was then normalized by the mean score of the DMSO negative control for each plate individually. All compounds within a threshold of μ - (mean of the negative control) ± 2σ (SD of the negative control) for number of nuclei were filtered for toxicity and beyond a threshold of μ + ± 1.5–3σ for the infection scores (number of infected nuclei infection index number of plaques or integrated GFP intensity) for efficacy.

Z’-factor calculation

According to Eq. 1 Z’-factors42 were determined using R version 4.0.2:

$${Z}^{{\prime} }{\rm{=\; 1}}-\frac{\left({{\rm{3\sigma }}}_{+}+{{\rm{3\sigma }}}_{-}\right)}{\left|{\mu }_{+}-{\mu }_{-}\right|}$$ (1)

where σ + is the SD of the positive control σ - is the SD of the negative control μ + the mean of the positive control and μ - the mean of the negative control.

Z-score calculation

Z-scores were computed in Python version 3.7.143 according to Eq. 2:

$${\rm{Z}}=\frac{{\rm{X}}-{\rm{\mu }}}{{\rm{\sigma }}}$$ (2)

where X is the plaque number or infection index of the compound and µ and σ are the mean and SD of the negative control of the plate where the compound was spotted.

PrestoBlue toxicity assay

While toxicity of the PCL compounds on infected cells was assessed with the screening read-out ‘total number of nuclei’ toxicity of the compounds on uninfected A549 and HOG cells was determined using the PrestoBlue Cell Viability reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham USA). PrestoBlue4445 indicates the viability of cells via conversion of non-fluorescent resazurin to a strongly fluorescent resorufin during cellular respiration. Specifically cells were treated with the compounds in duplicates for 24 h (A549) or 48 h (HOG) at the same concentrations and cell densities as used in the screening. Then PrestoBlue was added to each well to a final concentration of 10% and the cells were incubated at 37 °C (A549) or 33.5 °C (HOG) for 1 h. A multi-well plate-reader (Tecan Infinite F500 Tecan Männedorf Switzerland) was used to measure fluorescence intensity at an excitation of 560/10 nm and emission at 590/10 nm. As positive control for cytotoxicity Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Prestwick Chemical Illkirch France) at a final concentration of 10 μM was used with corresponding volume of DMSO as negative control. Data processing and statistical validation were performed using the EPFL-BSF in-house Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Raw values were normalized to the positive (=1) and negative (=0) control before averaging. Compounds were classified as toxic if the normalized value for both replicates was higher than the average + 3σ (standard deviation SD) of the DMSO negative control for the same plate.

Phospolipidosis assay

The phospolipidosis assay was performed as previously described31. Briefly 15000 A549 ATCC cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well imaging plate and grown overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1x NEAA. On the next day medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS 1x NEAA 7.5 µM NBD-PE (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham USA) cells treated with compounds at 37 °C for 24 h stained with a solution of DMEM 100 mM sodium pyruvate 200 mM L-Glutamine 10% FCS 1x NEAA 10 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 and 2 µM Ethidium homodimer-2 (EthD-2 Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham USA) at 37 °C for 30 min. Microscopy images were acquired at ImageXpress Micro confocal (Molecular Devices). For image analyses nuclear area was expanded to a diameter of 50 µm and the integrated NBD-PE fluorescence measured in the EthD-2-negative intact cells. Drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL) scores were normalized to the mean integrated intensity of the positive control Amiodarone used at 10 µM dosage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWRhaWx5am91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hbWdlbi1vcGVucy1zb3V0aC1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLW9mZmljZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV9lMGMxYzdmNi00NmJlLTExZWQtOTZmNS02YmI5ZGJlOTZjMWYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amgen opens South San Francisco offices | Local News | smdailyjournal.com,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

A total of 36 OC and adjacent non-tumor tissues were obtained in the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University (Guizhou China) and approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Guizhou Medical University. Samples were quickly frozen at −80 °C after surgery until the experiments were performed. None of the patients had received radiotherapy or chemotherapy before sample collection. All patients provided written informed consent prior to clinical specimen collection.

Bioinformatics analysis for the autophagy signature in OC tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)

First we downloaded the RNA-seq data and overall survival rate (OS) information of 373 patients with OC from TCGA (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). Before conducting the follow-up analysis RNA-seq data were merged normalized and annotated. A defined set of autophagy genes was downloaded from GSEA (http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010508). The expression of autophagy genes was extracted and used to calculate the autophagy signature of each sample via the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method. According to their autophagy signature and Euclidean distance calculated based on autophagy gene expression OC tissues were then clustered into high (n = 128) and low autophagy groups (n = 245).

Immunohistochemical staining (IHC)

IHC was performed on OC and adjacent tissues. After deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with a gradient of ethanol to distilled water blocked the section with goat serum. The sections were then incubated with a primary antibody against FBXL11 (1:500; Cat No. 24311-1-AP Proteintech Wuhan China) labeled with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase. The stained results were reviewed and scored as the staining extent and positive range.

Immunofluorescence

OC tissues were immobilized using 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized via 0.5% Triton (Beyotime Jiangsu China). After washing three times with PBS 5% BSA was used to block the tissues. OC tissues were then incubated with an anti-LC3 primary antibody (1:50; Cat No. 14600-1-AP Proteintech Wuhan China) at 4 °C overnight. Then a FITC conjunct-second antibody was incubated with OC tissues for 2 h and DAPI was used to label cell nuclei. Finally a 90i fluorescence microscope (Nikon Japan) was used to obtain the fluorescence signal of the LC3 dots in each OC tissue.

RNA-sequencing

RNA sequencing was performed to identify circRNAs between OC tissues with high LC3 dots (n = 3) and low dots (n = 3) as follows: total RNA in tissues was acquired by a TRIzol reagent (Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd.; Shanghai China) based on the manufacturer’s instructions. Ribosomal RNA and linear RNA were removed using the MGIEasy rRNA Removal Kit (MGI Shenzhen China) and RNase R (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) respectively. Fragmentation buffer (Ambion USA) was used to break the residual RNA into short fragments which acted as templates to synthesize cDNA. A QiaQuick PCR Extraction Kit (Sigma-Aldrich USA) was utilized to purify double-stranded cDNAs which were then dissolved in EB. Following agarose gel electrophoresis suitable fragments were used to perform PCR-amplifying in order to construct a cDNA library. The prepared cDNA library was then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform by SeqHealth Biotechnology Co. (Wuhan China). Differentially expressed circRNAs were analyzed in R software by the EdgeR package. P < 0.05 and |LogFC | >1 were set as the cut-off to identify differentially expressed circRNAs.

qRT-PCR

The mRNA levels of circRNAs miRNAs and mRNAs in OC tissues or cells were determined by qRT-PCR method. Briefly total RNA in OC tissues or cells was extracted using a TRIzol reagent (Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd.; Shanghai China). The SuperScript IV Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) was used to transform circRNAs and mRNAs into cDNA while the highly sensitive M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd; Shanghai China) was conducted to synthesize cDNA for miRNA. RT-qPCR amplification was conducted using SYBR reagent (Roche USA) on a LightCycler 96 instrument (Roche USA). GAPDH was set as a reference for circRNAs and mRNAs whereas U6 was set as the loading control for miRNAs. The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Cell culture and transfection

The ovarian epithelial cell line (IOSE80) and OC cell lines (A2780 HEY-T30 SKOV3 OVCAR-3 ES2 and OV-1063) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (USA). OC cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37 °C whereas IOSE80 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting circRNF144B FBXL11 and their negative control (NC) were acquired from GeneChem (Shanghai China) and subcloned into pSuper-retro-puro. MiR-342-3p mimic inhibitor and NC were also acquired from Genechem. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting FBXL11 and NC were accessed from HANBIO (Shanghai China). We constructed pCMV5-circRNF144B pCMV5-HA-FBXL11 and pCMV5-flag-Beclin-1 to overexpress circRNF144B HA-FBXL11 and Beclin-1. Polybrene reagent (Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd; Shanghai China) was used to perform transfection. After transfection with shRNAs for 48 h OC cells were selected for 10 days under puromycin treatment to obtain stably low-expressing cells; OC cells were selected for 14 days under geneticin reagent (G418) treatment to obtain high-expressing cells after transfection with plasmids for 48 h.

Actinomycin D assay

First 2 mg/mL actinomycin D (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) was used to suppress transcription in OC cells. Then after 0 4 8 12 16 and 20 h total RNA in OC cells was extracted. Finally the expression of linerRNF144B and circRNF144B in the RNA products was then determined by qRT-PCR method.

RNase R treatment assays

Total 4 μg of RNA was extracted from OC cells by a TRIzol reagent and equally divided as treatment and control groups. RNase R (4 U/μg) was added to the RNA in the treatment group whereas the solvent was used to treat the RNA in the control group. Finally the products were analyzed using RT-qPCR.

Nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation

Cytoplasmic & Nuclear RNA Purification Kit (Norgen USA) was conducted to extract nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The proportion of circRNF144B in the nucleus and cytoplasm was determined by a qRT-PCR method whereas GAPDH and U6 were used as nuclear and cytoplasmic references.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

The Cy3-conjugated circRNF144B probes were constructed and obtained from Genechem Co. Ltd. and used for detecting the sub-localization of circRNF144B in OC cells. The OC cells were fixed in the coverslips by 4% paraformaldehyde and the cells were digested by protease K (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gradient alcohol (70 85 and 100%) was then used to dehydrate the cells. Followed by diluting in hybridization solution and degeneration the Cy3-conjuncted circRNF144B probes were added in OC cells overnight at 40 °C under a dark environment. Finally formamide NP-40 and DAPI were added to the OC cells and circRNF144B signals in OC tissues were detected using a confocal microscope (Olympus Japan).

Methods for detection of cell proliferation in vitro

The CCK-8 colony formation and 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine absorb assays were performed to detect OC cell proliferation in vitro. CCK-8 reagent (Yeasen Shanghai China) and BeyoClick™ EdU-488 kit were used to perform CCK-8 and 5-Ethynyl-2 absorb assays respectively according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For colony formation assay 1000 OC cells were set in a 6-well plate and cultured at 37 °C for 14 days. The medium was then removed and 4% paraformaldehyde was used to fix the cell colony. Finally the cell colonies were stained with crystal violet and colony number in each well was calculated.

Methods for detection of cell mobility in vitro

The migration and invasion of OC cells were detected by wound healing and transwell assays respectively. For the wound healing assay OC cells were set in 6-well plates and cultured until the confluence >95%. Then a 200 μL-tip was utilized to create a wound in the cell monolayer. The wound conditions at 0 and 24 h were recorded to calculate the area of cell migration. For the transwell assay 2 × 105 OC cells resuspended in 200 μL DMEM without FBS were placed in the upper chamber (Corning USA) pre-coated with 7% Matrigel (Millipore USA). Then 700 μL of DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber as an inductive substance. After 24 h 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% crystal violet solution were used to fix and stain the upper chamber respectively. After washing the residual crystal violet an orthotopic light microscope (Olympus Japan) was used for collecting the field of the upper chamber and the invasive cell number in each field was calculated using the ImageJ software.

In vivo experiments

The in vivo experiments were approved by the Animal Research Ethical Committee of Guizhou Medical University. For the subcutaneous tumorigenesis model a total of 2 × 106 SKOV3 cells with circRNF144B-inhibition circRNF144B-overexpression and NC-treatment were injected into the left flank of mice (n = 5 for each group). The health condition of the mice was observed daily and the tissue volume was recorded weekly. After feeding for 30 days the mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation method and tumor tissues were extracted to photo and weight. To detect cell metastasis 2 × 106 SKOV3 cells with circRNF144B-inhibition circRNF144B-overexpression and NC-treatment were injected into the caudal vein of mice. The health condition of the mice was recorded daily and the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation method after 4-weeks feeding. Finally the lungs were extracted and HE staining was performed.

Western blotting

Total protein in OC cells was extracted by a potent RIPA lysis reagent (Millipore USA) containing 1% PMSF (Millipore USA). The protein concentration of each sample was determined using the BCA method and then samples (30 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on an SDS-PAGE gel (Mellon Dalian China) and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Merck USA). To prevent non-specific signals the membranes were incubated with 5% BSA (Merck USA) for 2 h. The primary antibodies including LC3 (1:500; Cat No. 14600-1-AP Proteintech Wuhan China) P62 (1:1000; Cat No. 18420-1-AP Proteintech Wuhan China) FBXL11 (1:500; Cat No. 24311-1-AP Proteintech Wuhan China) Beclin-1 (1:500; Cat No. 11306-1-AP Proteintech Wuhan China) HA (1:5000; Cat No. 51064-2-AP Proteintech Wuhan China) Flag (1:1000; Cat No. 80010-1-RR Proteintech Wuhan China) and GAPDH (1:2000; Cat No. 60004-1-Ig Proteintech Wuhan China) were added to incubate PVDF membranes at 4 °C overnight. After washing TBST for thrice secondary antibodies were incubated for 2 h and the protein signals in membranes were detected using the ECL reagent (Yeasen Shanghai China). GAPDH was set as a loading control to calculate the expression level of the target proteins.

Detection of mRFP-GFP-LC3 dot

Adenovirus for overexpressing mRFP-GFP-LC3 was obtained from HanBio (Wuhan China) and transfected into OC cells via polybrene. After transfection for 48 h cells were set into confocal dish. Follow by adding treatment factors OC cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and detected in confocal microscopy (Olympus Japan). Yellow dots in OC cells indicated the autophagosomes while red dots indicated autolysosomes.

Dual-luciferase reporter assay

The binding relationship among circRNF144B miR-342-3p and FBXL11 was analyzed using a dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega Corporation) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Wild-type or mutant reporters of circRNF144B and FBXL11 were constructed and transfected into OC cells which were pre-transfected with NC mimic or miR-342-3p mimic respectively. The fluorescence intensity of each group of cells was determined using a Modulus fluorescence detector (TurnerBioSystems USA).

Immunoprecipitation

Total protein in OC cells was extracted by a mild RIPA lysis reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) containing 1% PMSF and 1% phosphorylase inhibitor (Boster Wuhan China). Primary anti-FBXL11 (1 μg) anti-HA (1 μg; Cat No. 51064-2-AP Proteintech Wuhan China) and anti-Flag antibodies (1 μg; Cat No. 80010-1-RR Proteintech Wuhan China) were used to bind FBXL11 HA-conjunct and Flag-conjunct proteins at 4 °C overnight. Agarose bead gel (Beyotime Suzhou China) was used to enrich the antigen-antibody complex at 4 °C for 3 h. Then after washing PBS for thrice agarose beads were obtained using centrifugation. The agarose bead gel was mixed with 2× loading buffer and performed degeneration at 100 °C for 10 min. Proteins interacting with FBXL11 were identified via LC/MS and visualized via silver staining using a rapid silver stain kit (Beyotime Suzhou China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally the expression of target proteins was verified by western blotting.

Statistical analysis

All experiments were performed three times. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation and were analyzed using SPSS 19.0. An independent t-test was conducted to analyze the data derived from the two groups while one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni’s host test was used to analyze data derived from multiple groups. The co-expression relationship between circRNF144B miR-342-3p and FBXL11 in OC tissues was analyzed using Pearson’s correlation analysis. The difference in the overall survival rate between the two groups was analyzed via Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05."

Getting machinery and components has been an ongoing struggle for farmers this year said Keystone Agriculture Producers president Bill Campbell who farms south of Brandon in southwestern Manitoba.

""We're in the midst of harvest"" he said. ""Any breakdown or parts unavailability has a huge impact on being able to get our crop in the bin.""

Farmers have been dealing with supply chain delays since the spring he said. Keystone Agriculture Producers has heard reports of delays in getting everything from seeding equipment to microchips to tires.

""We've heard of different people who've ordered new equipment last winter and they were not showing up for harvest season"" he said. ""They thought … [the equipment] would be delivered.""

Some dealers are not taking orders or have cancelled requests because equipment is unavailable for 2023 says Keystone Agricultural Producers president Bill Campbell. (Riley Laychuk/CBC)

The problem is likely to stretch beyond this season. Some dealers are not taking orders or have cancelled requests because the equipment is unavailable for 2023 said Campbell.

He added it is also hard to find used equipment as an alternative option.

Producers are trying to make do with existing equipment — but eventually repairs are required.

The bigger challenge Campbell said is trying to adapt to new technology. Older equipment can't always be retrofitted making it difficult to use with more modern technology in some cases he said.

""We are as an agricultural industry in a different framework as we move forward in 2023..... [There are] rising input costs when we look at all of our fertilizer and our fuel and seed costs"" Campbell said.

""It is only going to be more expensive to produce a crop.""

Finding parts machines for harvest a challenge

Mike Nykoliation works on a farm near Virden also in southwestern Manitoba.

Getting his hands on the equipment and parts he needs to ensure operations on the farm run smoothly has been one of his biggest challenges during this harvest he said.

Nykoliation said he purchased a combine in mid-September 2021. It arrived just about a week ago when the current harvest season was already at full tilt.

He says a combine typically takes about six months to arrive after it's ordered.

Now delays are so severe Nykoliation said he's debating ordering a new rig in the hopes it will arrive by 2025.

He said he began to notice delays earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic when factories deliveries and other links in the supply chain began facing labour shortages.

He now worries there will be years of catch-up producing supplies farmers need leaving them with ""a huge financial burden.""

""You have to plan ahead to make sure your equipment is ordered on time if you're going to receive it"" Nykoliation said.

""If you know what you need for parts ... you have to stock up on those yourself because the dealers won't have them in stock if you need them.""

Nykoliation says looking to the future seems scary with low supplies of machinery and parts in high demand on top of other factors like rising costs and labour shortages.

""It's not just the ag … it's everywhere. It's in the industrial [sector] the factories the grocery stores the big warehouses.… The shortage of labour is everywhere.""

Colin Penner farms near Elm Creek about 50 kilometres southwest of Winnipeg where he's currently harvesting soybeans. The machine he uses has knives on the front that work like scissors to remove plants.

Penner went to the dealership earlier this season as he knew he'd need new knives — but the parts were tough to find.

""We had to make a few extra calls and we ended up finding the knives. But it's something that we typically don't think about"" he said. ""Usually we just go to … the dealership and say 'Hey I need these parts.'""

Colin Penner who farms near Elm Creek says he's been trying to stockpile more parts for his equipment and other items than he normally would. (Chelsea Kemp/CBC)

Penner said he's been trying to stockpile more parts and items than typical.

""It would be almost a catastrophe if we ran out of something and … the machine had to stop and wait until we were able to continue with harvest"" he said.

""If we see it we're going to have to just jump on it.... That's what a lot of people are doing right now.

""[If] I need it or I might need it I'm going to buy it just so I could have it.""",,,,,,,,,

Imaginechina

People traveling or returning to Shanghai from other provinces will receive a pop-up notification covering their health code if they fail to undergo a nucleic acid test within 48 hours of their arrival.

The city's health commission made the announcement on Sunday as Shanghai tries out a new way to enhance COVID-19 prevention and control amid the new round of resurgence mainly transmitted from other provinces during the weeklong National Day holiday.

The pop-up window will prevent travelers from displaying their Suishenma health code banning them from accessing most of Shanghai's public services transport and places.

It will disappear after a nucleic acid test record is detected Yu Tao deputy director of the Shanghai Health Commission told the city's COVID-19 press briefing on Sunday.

Shanghai reported two COVID-19 community cases on Sunday including an elementary school student who was infected by a previous local case.

The 12-year-old boy who lives in Wujing Town in Minhang District was connected with an infection reported on Friday from northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Apart from his accommodation he had been to a trampoline park another community and the private Zizhu Bilingual School in Minhang.

Shen Xinyi / SHINE

The other case a 27-year-old woman a resident of Xianxia Community in Changning District tested abnormal during a recent regular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening after returning home from her travel to other provinces.

Since returning she had been to an office building and its underground Luckin Coffee outlet in Changning.

As a result the duo's accommodations and the trampoline park were designated as medium-risk areas and put under lockdown said Yu.

A total of 192 close contacts of the new cases have been traced and put under central quarantine. Among them 104 have tested negative. More than 1465 related people have been screened and all tested negative he revealed.

Shanghai has reported some 90 COVID-19 positive cases since October 1 the beginning of the National Day holiday mainly travelers from other provinces and their close contacts according to the commission.

Multiple schools in Minhang have been affected by the resurgence among the district's 400-plus elementary and middle schools as well as kindergartens Liu Yan deputy director of Minhang noted.

Shen Xinyi / SHINE

The COVID-related schools have shifted to online classes including livestreaming and online tutoring from teachers. Round-the-clock psychological counseling is available for students under lockdown.

Other schools with normal offline classes have strengthened their anti-COVID-19 management and asked students and teachers to enhance self-protection said Liu.

Shanghai requires people traveling or returning to the city from other provinces to report their itinerary online before arrival. Every traveler coming or returning to Shanghai also must take a nucleic acid test upon arrival.

They are also required to conduct a weeklong self-health monitoring – take a temperature check in the morning and at night – every day. In addition they must reduce unnecessary gathering activities and properly wear a mask when going out Yu said.

Travelers coming from domestic COVID-19-related regions must report to neighborhood or village committees and companies or hotels within 12 hours after arriving in Shanghai.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEwLzA5L25hdGlvbmFsL2phcGFuLXJlb3BlbmluZy1leHBlY3RhdGlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What to expect as Japan opens back up to the world,"After almost three years Japan will fully open its borders again to foreign independent tourists and other arrivals on Tuesday — a move that many hope will galvanize the economy and kickstart the country’s post-pandemic recovery.

Paul Durham | Times

Steadily becoming unflappable during a season of no home games the Beddingfield High varsity football team seized the moment — a moment that could arguably be considered the opportunity of a lifetime for the Bruins and Friday night opponent North Johnston.

With breathtaking Truist Stadium at Barton College the latest home away from home for Beddingfield an ambush at the start and a statement finish buoyed the Bruins to a convincing 34-0 2-A Neuse 6 Conference victory against the neighboring Panthers.







Both teams were playing their first game on synthetic turf. They were the first high school football teams to play at Barton and Beddingfield emerged the first victor in claiming a share of the conference lead with Princeton at 2-0.

A crowd of some 900 — Beddingfield’s largest of the season — created a festive atmosphere on a clear comfortable evening. The Bruins jubilantly celebrated homecoming and Senior Night.

“I was happy for our guys” declared second-year Beddingfield head coach Ben Ellis. “This was an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It was the first time for pretty much all of them playing in a place like this. The majority of the guys won’t play in a place like this again.

“It was even better to get a win on homecoming and Senior Night. It can’t get much better.”

Commented North Johnston head coach Michael Barnett: “This was wonderful. The kids enjoyed it. We want to really thank Barton College; it was so nice of them. It’s a beautiful facility.”

With its fourth consecutive win Beddingfield improved to 4-3 overall and faces a road league test at Eastern Wayne next Friday.

The Panthers departed 11-1 in the Neuse 6 and 2-5 against all foes. Next up for North Johnston is league foe Goldsboro next Friday.

The Bruins struck for the only touchdown they would need with less than two minutes elapsed. Bruins sophomore Keyshawn Richardson wrested possession of the football from the North Johnston ball carrier and thundered 74 yards for the TD. Sophomore Escart Rico kicked the extra point.

By the end of the first quarter Beddingfield owned a 20-0 cushion. Senior scatback Malik Woodard dashed 15 yards for the second TD and Rico again added the PAT with 7:33 still remaining. With 38 seconds showing junior quarterback Bryson Wagner sliced the final six yards.

The Bruins have now outscored the opposition 74-0 in two conference outings and the defense boasts a 26-0 scoring margin.

Richardson junior Craig Barnes junior Christian Reyes senior Cris Atkinson senior Jelani Taylor senior Toni Baza and junior Zion Gray anchored a Beddingfield defense that yielded a stingy 76 yards total offense.

The Bruins’ balanced running attack produced 222 yards led by Woodard with 84 yards on just eight rushes. Wagner added 67 yards on seven totes while sophomore Desmond Wooten managed 49 yards on 14 carries. Atkinson added 26 yards on six rushes and caught two passes for 11 yards.

Beddingfield’s only first-half toss was intercepted by Panthers’ junior Brayden Cuddington. The Bruins put the football into the air just three times while North Johnston’s first of just two throws was picked off by the Bruins’ Asun Pender and returned 49 yards for the only second-half TD.

With passes totaling just five the contest was completed in approximately an hour and 45 minutes and included a 10-minute delay when Panthers senior Ashton Woodall was removed from the field by stretcher after suffering an ankle injury.

“We came out really good” Ellis reviewed “but we were a little flat in the second quarter. We are not as consistent as we need to be. We have a hard time sustaining all the way through. The defense played awesome.”

North Johnston finally penetrated Beddingfield territory in the final quarter and its longest play was a 17-yard scamper by junior quarterback Jordin Moore in the Panthers’ only sustained drive in the final quarter.

Executing the keeper Moore who alternates with junior Cory Barnes at quarterback faked to his running back kept the football spun and followed his offensive line — picking up 31 yards on the drive that ended with an incomplete pass on fourth down at Beddingfield’s 27-yard line.

“The offensive line made it work and it felt good” Moore said of his success in running the keeper in the second half.

“But we came out of the gates bad. We didn’t bring energy and they did. In the second half we played better.”

Added Barnett: “The second half is definitely something to build off. But the problem was we dug such a big hole that it was hard to dig out. We expected a slobber-knocker but they threw a haymaker and we never recovered.

“They came out on fire and took charge. Beddingfield is as talented a team as there is in the conference and they’re well coached.”

Beddingfield’s other TD came in the second quarter when out of the wildcat formation Atkinson slithered 14 yards into the end zone.

“We run the wildcat about 10% of the time” Atkinson noted. “We run it at practice and the coaches believe in me and they believe in the O-line. Coach put in a good game plan and the O-line executed. The play worked perfectly.

“(Overall) we played good but on certain plays we didn’t play as well as we could have. But the score tells the story; it feels good.”

The Bruins squandered a second-quarter threat inside the Panthers’ 10-yard line.

Featuring Wooten as the primary ball carrier Beddingfield controlled the football the final eight-plus minutes trudging from its 27-yard line to North Johnston’s 12-yard line as Wooten accounted for 34 yards on eight carries.

“We were trying to get Desmond some carries and get him going a little bit” Ellis explained. “He’s had a rough week. He’s a different type runner than the other guys; he has to get momentum.

“But I can be happy with that last drive.”

Tyson’s fresh meats division is now based in a sprawling office complex that anchors the Two Rivers Business Park in Dakota Dunes an upscale planned community in Southeast South Dakota. Tyson announced Wednesday that about 1000 corporate staff in the Dunes and Chicago area will move to the meat company’s world headquarters in Springdale Arkansas.

All of the approximately 500 employees in Dakota Dunes will be eligible for assistance to relocate to Northwest Arkansas company spokesman Derek Burleson said. Those who chose to stay will be eligible for severance with packages determined on an individual basis he said.

The relocations scheduled to be completed in phases will begin in early 2023.

Wednesday’s announcement surprised many community leaders who immediately offered their support to the Tyson employees who now must decide whether to move or stay in Siouxland.

“First and foremost our thoughts are with every single person who is adversely affected by today’s announcement.” Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan said in a statement.

“We were surprised and saddened by today’s news and want to reassure our community that the Siouxland Chamber of Commerce will do everything in our power to mitigate the negative impact on our tri-state region while working tirelessly to assist those who have been affected and want to find employment locally so that they and their families may remain in Siouxland.”

The sprawling Tyson complex in Dakota Dunes was built in 1997 as the world headquarters for IBP Inc. which moved from Dakota City to Dakota Dunes. Just four years later IBP was acquired by Tyson in October 2001 for $3.2 billion in cash and stock creating the world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken beef and pork.

Tyson will continue to operate its flagship Dakota City beef plant which employs about 4500 people and its cold storage facility in Sioux City. The publicly-traded company is by far the metro area’s largest employer.

Tyson said no layoffs are expected as a result of consolidating its corporate offices. The company said the move will “foster closer collaboration enhance team member agility and enable faster decision making positioning Tyson to win with its team members customers and consumers.”

“Bringing our talented corporate team members and businesses together under one roof unlocks greater opportunities to share perspectives and ideas while also enabling us to act quickly to solve problems and provide the innovative product solutions that our customers deserve and value” Tyson President and CEO Donnie King said in a statement.

Tyson also announced Wednesday it will expand and remodel its corporate offices in Springdale to help prepare for the arrival of the relocated workers.

Metro Sioux City has seen a number of corporate departures in recent decades. In 1998 Gateway a Fortune 500 computer maker moved its headquarters from North Sioux City to the San Diego area. In the aftermath of the Tyson deal in 2001 hundreds of former IBP executives relocated to Springdale.

After Gateway left a large number of executives who moved to California sold their homes in Dakota Dunes trigging a housing market downturn that lasted about 18 months recalled Jeff Dooley manager of the Dakota Dunes Community Improvement District.

The simultaneous departure of hundreds of Tyson employees could have a similar impact on the metro area housing market which already faces rising mortgage interest rates after years of robust sales driven by historically-low rates and a short supply of homes listed.

Dooley noted unemployment in the metro area is lower and the local economy is more diversified today than it was at the time of the Gateway and IBP corporate relocations.

“Siouxland has a lot of companies that could use their services” he said of the Tyson employees who want to stay in the region.

Tyson did not immediately respond to a Journal reporter’s question Wednesday about what will happen to the corporate complex in Dakota Dunes. At the time IBP opened it thousands of employees were based there. But as more and more jobs were transferred to Arkansas Tyson began leasing space to other employers. The tenants included the direct sales division of Vizio a leading maker of televisions and other electronics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdHRhZ25ldC5jb20vcG91bHRyeS1mdXR1cmUvY29uc3VtZXItdHJlbmRzL2Jsb2cvMTU1MzY2NDcvdHlzb24tc3Bvb2t5LW51Z2dldHMtYS1oYWxsb3dlZW4tdHJlYXQtZm9yLXNlbGVjdC1mZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson Spooky Nuggets a Halloween treat for select few,"Halloween is fast approaching so you know there had to be some sort of promotion with Halloween-themed foods.

And while I’m sure there are plenty out there I’m going to focus on one particular product line.

Just in time for the Halloween season Tyson Foods is introducing Spooky Nuggets. The limited-edition Halloween nuggets should taste the same as other chicken nuggets produced by Tyson but these come in three shapes: pumpkins bats and ghosts.

“Our Fun Nuggets are a fan favorite and we want to give people more ways to celebrate the season with new Halloween-inspired shapes” Colleen Hall senior director of marketing for the Tyson brand said in a press release. “There's no better way to gear up for a night of trick-or-treating than a warm delicious spread of Spooky Nuggets.”

According to the press release Tyson Spooky Nuggets are now available for a limited time through a giveaway on the brand’s Instagram page.

Those who want a chance at some of these Tyson Spooky Nuggets are being asked comment on the Instagram announcement post with the emoji of the shape they are most excited to try and tag a friend they’d like to share them with using hashtags #TysonSpookyNuggets and #Sweepstakes now until October 14.

When it’s all said and done 250 winners will be selected.

Will a larger rollout come?

So it appears if you want some of these fun nuggets you will have to enter through the Instagram sweepstakes. Certainly not everybody who wants them will get them but when you look at it from Tyson’s perspective even if these nuggets may not have expired yet would what remains on store shelves be tough to get rid of once November rolls around?

Still I think an opportunity is being missed here.

Take a look at what Perdue Farms did with its ThanksNuggets turkey nugget product two years ago. Perdue sold the Thanksgiving-themed turkey nuggets on a very limited basis that year selling only 100 packages of them via a company website. And they sold out in less than three minutes.

I haven’t heard what will be done with these ThanksNuggets this year but I do know they were made more widely available in 2021.

Kids love their nuggets and especially those that come in fun shapes. And let’s be honest a lot of adults do too.

I hope this campaign is successful and we see more of these fun-shaped nuggets during future Halloweens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vZnV0dXJlLXBlcmZlY3QvMjAyMi8xMC85LzIzMzkzMDE3L3N1cHJlbWUtY291cnQtcG9yay1waWdzLXByb3AtMTItY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1hbmltYWwtd2VsZmFyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How will the Supreme Court handle California’s cage-free bacon law?,"The Supreme Court regularly makes decisions that directly affect the lives of tens of millions of Americans. But next week the Court will hear oral arguments in a case that could decide the fate of millions of pigs.

The case — National Pork Producers Council v. Ross — hinges on a simple question: Can California set its own standards for how pigs are treated on farms even when they’re raised in other states?

The case centers quite literally on how sausage gets made in the US. Each year over 6 million female breeding pigs or sows are raised in “gestation crates” — narrow metal crates that confine the pigs so tightly they’re unable to turn around for the duration of their four-month pregnancies (and they have about four pregnancies in their three- to four-year lifetimes). As the pioneering animal welfare scientist Temple Grandin once put it the crates are akin to forcing a human to live much of their life in an airline seat.

The American Public Health Association says confining pigs so intensively also increases their stress levels and weakens their immune systems which makes them more susceptible to infectious disease. (And given the ease with which some zoonotic viruses can pass from swine to humans that threatens us as well.)

In 2018 over 62 percent of California voters supported a state ballot measure called Proposition 12 that would ban the crates and require sows be raised with at least 24 square feet of space. Importantly the measure applied whether or not the pigs had been raised in California so all whole uncooked pork sold in the state would be required to be produced according to California’s standard. Given the vast size of the state’s market it’s having a transformative effect for pigs across the country — just as California’s stricter emissions standards for automobiles have changed the way cars are made nationwide.

The law has similar provisions for cage-free eggs and crate-free veal which have already gone into effect — the challenge in the Supreme Court only covers pork which will go into effect in five months. (Disclosure: The ballot measure effort was led by the Humane Society of the United States an organization I worked for from 2012 to 2017.)

The win was a watershed moment for the movement against factory farming with some 1 million pigs 40 million hens and tens of thousands of calves to be taken out of cages each year once the law is fully implemented. It also built momentum to banish cages for hens from other states in the following years.

“What may seem like a small incremental change on paper to the life of that pig it’s immense” says Chris Green executive director of Harvard Law School’s animal law and policy program.

The agriculture industry backlash was inevitable asserting it would cost pork producers $293 million to $347 million to comply — a cost they said would invariably raise the price of pork not only for Californians but for all Americans. In the years after it passed meat trade groups filed three separate lawsuits against the pork provision. Each challenge argued the same point: California’s ban imposes an unfair burden on out-of-state pork producers who produce most of the pork sold in California. (California produces a lot of dairy and eggs but less than 1 percent of the nation’s pork while consuming around 13 percent of it.)

The pork producers argued that retrofitting their barns to be crate-free would be too costly and that they couldn’t easily segment crate-free pork from crated pork they might be able to sell in other states. That purported inability forces them to raise more of their pigs crate-free than needed a cost they say will have to be passed on to consumers nationwide. However several major pork producers now say they can comply (more on this later).

All three lawsuits were dismissed by lower courts but the Supreme Court took up the one filed by the National Pork Producers the industry’s main trade group and the American Farm Bureau Federation an insurance company and agriculture lobbying group.

While it might be easy to assume that a conservative-dominated Court will rule in favor of business interests it’s hard to predict how the case will ultimately turn out. Animal welfare questions don’t adhere to party lines as neatly as you’d think. Democrats are only a little more likely to say cruelty to farm animals is a moral concern and plenty of red and purple states have passed laws to reduce the suffering of farm animals. A group of conservative thinkers filed an amicus brief in support of California’s animal welfare law while Biden’s Justice Department filed one in opposition.

“Anyone who says they know what’s going to happen is lying to you or themselves” says Green.

The Court’s ruling won’t be delivered for months but wherever it lands will have long-term effects on the welfare of the animals we factory-farm for food potentially setting back the movement to improve their conditions by decades — or propelling it forward.

The pork industry’s contradictory argument against California explained

The animal welfare activists have a straightforward case: Pigs and other animals raised for food are thinking feeling animals — like dogs and cats — and shouldn’t be treated like mere widgets in a factory. Plenty of scientific research has concluded what is intuitive to laypeople: Confining animals in tiny cages for years on end is really bad for their well-being as noted by the 378 veterinarians and animal welfare scientists who filed an amicus brief in support of California’s law.

That straightforward case has been successful at chipping away at the practice of cage confinement: 14 states have banned cages to some degree especially for egg-laying hens and hundreds of food companies have been switching to cage-free eggs. In 2008 under 5 percent of hens were raised cage-free; today 35 percent are. The egg industry now welcomes a cage-free future with the biggest producers investing heavily in cage-free barn construction generally not opposing cage-free state legislation and in some cases even supporting it.

But the pork industry hasn’t been so amenable to change and has continually invoked a legal doctrine called the dormant commerce clause to challenge California’s law. As I wrote in an explainer last year about the industry’s lawsuits against Prop 12:

The industry’s core argument is that Prop 12 violates the “dormant commerce clause” a legal doctrine meant to prevent protectionism or states giving their own businesses preferential treatment over businesses in other states. Industry groups argue that because most US pork is produced outside California the financial and logistical burden of complying with Prop 12 falls mostly on out-of-state producers and that those burdens outweigh any of the law’s supposed benefits.

On the surface they have a point. Overhauling the housing of a million pigs or more is a costly logistical nightmare. Many crate-free sows today are raised with 16 or 18 square feet of space; California’s law requires 24 square feet. Adapting to a patchwork of norms and regulations isn’t easy.

In a separate but similar lawsuit filed by the North American Meat Institute in 2019 a spokesperson for the largest US pork producer Smithfield Foods wrote (under penalty of perjury): “It is no exaggeration to state that the expense and complications of complying with Proposition 12 may cause Smithfield to conclude it is no longer viable to do business in California.”

Other major pork producers similarly wrote in the lawsuit that compliance with Proposition 12 would be just too costly and would significantly hamper their operations. Some went so far as to say like Smithfield Foods that it may force their partial or total exit from the California marketplace.

But now many in the industry say they can comply including five of the largest pork producers: Tyson Foods Smithfield Foods Seaboard Hormel and Clemens Food Group. It’s a confusing course reversal that also weakens the National Pork Producers Council’s argument that Prop 12 is overly burdensome.

Jim Monroe vice president of corporate affairs for Smithfield Foods says he doesn’t see any inconsistency between the statements writing in an email that “there is no doubt it will be more challenging to supply Californians with affordable pork with this law in place.” Monroe said the regulatory climate and escalating cost of doing business in California were factors in Smithfield Foods’ recent decision to shutter its Los Angeles County slaughterhouse. “The standards proposed are arbitrary not based on science and require considerable time and expense without yielding any improvements to animal care” he added.

(The National Pork Producers Council and Tyson Foods declined an interview request for this story; Hormel and Clemens Food Group did not respond to a request for comment.)

Even California says big pork producers are hard at work to comply. As noted by Civil Eats an official with California’s state agriculture agency visited 10 hog farms and slaughter plants across the country over the last year and reported that some of the nation’s largest pork producers were constructing new barns and overhauling old ones to be California-compliant and had already implemented tracing systems to separate conventional pork from the California-bound pork.

While the National Pork Producers Council has written a great deal about the difficulty of tracing California-compliant pork the largest producers have long advertised their sophisticated traceability systems. As Richard Sexton a UC Davis agricultural economist recently told the Guardian “Products are being differentiated in a whole variety of ways: organic GMO-free different properties related to animal welfare antibiotic-free.”

The increased cost for Californians will be somewhat modest around an 8 percent hike according to Sexton and two colleagues and almost no change in retail price outside California. In an amicus brief to the Court Sexton and another UC Davis economist also stressed that the pork producers’ claim that the costs of Prop 12 compliance would be felt by all pork producers not just those selling into California is flat-out wrong: “Not only are [the pork producers’] arguments flawed as a reflection of basic economic incentives but they are factually implausible.” Their research was funded in part by the National Pork Board a USDA-administered program that promotes US pork as well as the California Department of Food and Agriculture.

The price increase may be tough for Californians at a time of high inflation especially for food but it’s important to remember that the price of conventional meat is artificially low due to animals who are forced to live in the most miserable conditions imaginable and to workers who toil in dangerous conditions to raise and slaughter them. Rural citizens who live near hog farms also bear the brunt of the industry’s lightly regulated air and water pollution.

How the conservative Court might think about the case — and animal welfare

It wouldn’t be a shock if all or most of the conservative justices side with the meat industry as several business groups (like the Chamber of Commerce) and 20 mostly red state attorneys general filed an amicus brief in support of the pork producers (15 attorneys general from mostly blue states filed an amicus brief in support of California). California is also the right wing’s favorite punching bag.

But there are some reasons to believe that the justices won’t rule along predictable political lines. Justice Clarence Thomas has said the dormant commerce clause — the legal doctrine continually invoked by the pork producers to argue its case — “has no basis in the text of the Constitution [and] makes little sense.” Justice Neil Gorsuch has called it a source of “judicial activism.” At the same time the liberal Justice Elena Kagan wrote the decision when the Court struck down a California farm animal welfare law in 2012 and in 2010 when the Court struck down a federal animal cruelty law the conservative Justice Samuel Alito dissented.

And animal welfare hasn’t been as ensnared in the culture war as other issues on the Supreme Court’s docket such as immigration and affirmative action. That becomes clear when reading the amicus brief in support of California’s animal welfare law written by Megan Wold a former law clerk for Alito. The brief was filed on behalf of other conservative thinkers including former George W. Bush speechwriter Matthew Scully University of Notre Dame law professor O. Carter Snead and writer Mary Eberstadt.

Wold wrote that voters’ support for Proposition 12

reflects concerns of ancient lineage in Western moral thought. Western philosophers and religious leaders have considered the treatment of animals to be an appropriate and important subject of inquiry for millennia. They have explained how human decency demands that animals be treated with basic respect for their needs natures and dignity as living creatures and why humans are morally bound not to participate in or facilitate animal abuse.

Last week the Washington Post conservative columnist Kathleen Parker also made a passionate plea for the Court to side with the animals writing “... the justices that make up the high court’s conservative majority have a rare opportunity to align themselves not only with their liberal counterparts but with some of history’s greatest ethicists and philosophers.”

Fervent support for animal welfare is not uncommon among conservatives: Bob Dole championed important amendments to the Animal Welfare Act in 1985; Rick Santorum may be vehemently opposed to LGBTQ rights but is also vehemently opposed to cruelty to dogs and horses. Even if their primary motive is to slash government spending dozens of Republican members of Congress have voted to curtail government-funded animal research experiments in recent years.

While Big Pork is behind the challenge to California’s animal welfare law many farmers (who tend to be conservative) are in support of the law saying that it could help level the playing field in an industry that is dominated by meat giants that cut costs by mistreating animals. One of the largest meat companies Perdue Farms also supports the animal welfare law (Perdue mostly raises chickens for meat but also owns Niman Ranch a higher-welfare pork company).

If the Court does side with the National Pork Producers Council it could have lasting devastating consequences for the future of farm animal welfare in the US. It would not only condemn nearly a million pigs a year to extreme confinement but it could also inspire others in the animal agriculture industry to challenge similar state laws or dissuade state lawmakers and food companies from moving on the matter. Some observers say the effects could be felt far beyond animal welfare too endangering state laws that cover renewable energy or product safety.

In the past two decades we’ve witnessed a rapid shift away from cages supported by voters consumers corporations and policymakers of a number of political stripes. If California’s animal welfare law is eventually overturned it will certainly be a setback for the anti-factory farming movement but not the death knell.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9wdW1wa2luLXRoZS1taW5pLWhvcnNlLWlzLWNlbGVicmF0aW5nLWhlci0xc3QtYmlydGhkYXktYXMtb3duZXJzLWFza3MtZm9yLWhlbHAv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9rZm9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3B1bXBraW4tdGhlLW1pbmktaG9yc2UtaXMtY2VsZWJyYXRpbmctaGVyLTFzdC1iaXJ0aGRheS1hcy1vd25lcnMtYXNrcy1mb3ItaGVscC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pumpkin the mini horse is celebrating her 1st birthday as owners ask for help,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://kfor.com/news/local/pumpkin-the-mini-horse-is-celebrating-her-1st-birthday-as-owners-asks-for-help/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9wdW1wa2luLXRoZS1taW5pLWhvcnNlLWlzLWNlbGVicmF0aW5nLWhlci0xc3QtYmlydGhkYXktYXMtb3duZXJzLWFza3MtZm9yLWhlbHAv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9rZm9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3B1bXBraW4tdGhlLW1pbmktaG9yc2UtaXMtY2VsZWJyYXRpbmctaGVyLTFzdC1iaXJ0aGRheS1hcy1vd25lcnMtYXNrcy1mb3ItaGVscC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExMjk3NDQzL0Zsb3JpZGEtbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWhvbWVsZXNzLWZhbWlseS01LXNob3Qtc2xlZXBpbmctY2FyLXByZWduYW50LW1vbS1zaG90Lmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTI5NzQ0My9hbXAvRmxvcmlkYS1tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtaG9tZWxlc3MtZmFtaWx5LTUtc2hvdC1zbGVlcGluZy1jYXItcHJlZ25hbnQtbW9tLXNob3QuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida man arrested after homeless family of 5 shot at while sleeping in car pregnant mom shot,"Christopher Stamat Jr. 21 was taken into custody on Saturday and charged with six felonies including attempted first-degree murder

Florida police have arrested a man accused of shooting a family sleeping in their car including a pregnant woman.

Tampa Police arrested Christopher Stamat Jr. 21 on Saturday in connection with the shooting which took place at around 4:30am on October 5.

Stamat allegedly shot the pregnant mother in the head leaving her with non-life threatening injuries.

Stamat who is being held without bond faces six felony charges for the attack including four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon one count of second degree attempted murder and one count of shooting into a vehicle.

In a news conference on Sunday morning Tampa Police Chief Mary O'Connor said revealed how police arrested Stamat on Saturday for felony marijuana possession but was later released.

Christopher Stamat Jr. 21 as not said why he opened fire but claimed that he felt people were 'stalking and following him' in cars on bikes and walking

Much of Stamat's social media sees him working out in the gym

He was then re-arrested later that afternoon after making the case for the shooting charge O'Connor explained.

'Our community as a whole can sleep easier tonight knowing the suspect linked to this monstrous random act of violence is no longer free to prey on innocent people' O'Connor said.

'You take a gun and you unload it on a family. We can't really sit back and try to figure out the 'why' on that. There's really zero tolerance for that kind of behavior.'

The shooting occurred in a parking lot across from the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Complex in the Old West Tampa neighborhood.

Stamat was identified after police traced his 2012 BMW through surveillance footage from the scene.

Dozens of photos adorn Stamat's Instagram page that show him working out

His car was found in the garage of his girlfriend's home some three miles from the scene of the attack.

Police searched Stamat's car and home after obtaining warrants whereupon they found an empty gun box for a 9mm handgun and empty shell casings matching those found at the scene of the crime.

O'Connor also told how the handgun police found was not the one Stamat allegedly used in the shooting.

The chief added how the door to his bedroom in which the shell casings were found requires finger print identification to open the door 'so there's no doubt that these shell casings belong to him' she said.

Stamat was identified after police traced his 2012 BMW through surveillance footage from the scene.

His car was found in the garage of his girlfriend's home some three miles from the scene of the shooting

Stamat already admitted he was the only person who had used his car recently and that he was driving in the area of the crime the morning of the shooting.

Stamat who appeared to be obsessed with weight lifting and working out judging by photos on his social media page did not provide police a motive for the shooting but told authorities that he believed he was being stalked and followed which his girlfriend also confirmed to police.

The father who is in his 30s saw another car pull up and heard gunshots. He yelled for his wife who is in her 20s and their three children to get down in order to dodge the bullets.

The mother who is pregnant was struck in the head and taken to a local hospital for non-life-threatening injuries police said.

The children a nine-year-old girl a four-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl were all uninjured in the shooting according to police. The children are now staying with other family members in Florida.

The family are said to have been living in a rental car because a relative did not have space for them. They had spent recent months of living outside of Florida.

They had covered the windows of their car with clothes making it hard for any suspect to see who was inside.

Stamat allegedly fired more than a dozen shots before fleeing.

Police said there is currently no indication of any connection between Stamat and the victims."

The banks led by Morgan Stanley and six others including Barclays and Bank of America committed six months ago to raise $13bn in debt to finance Musk’s purchase – an agreement that does not hinge on whether they are able to sell the debt on to investors.

According to Bloomberg calculations published on Saturday the banks’ losses would collectively amount “to $500m or more if the debt were to be sold now”.

Higher interest rates tied to efforts to bring down record inflation have led to a deterioration in the credit markets with returns on risky junk bonds and leveraged loans surging. When the Musk-Twitter deal was financed in April banks agreed to terms with lower yields than the market would now accept leading to potential write-downs.

About $400m of the $500m in losses that the banks are estimated to have on the Twitter debt are in unsecured high interest bonds and they exclude fees the banks would typically earn on the transaction.

“I think that those banks would like to get out of it I think the deal makes less sense for them now and that the debt will be harder to syndicate to investors” Howard Fischer a Moses Singler law firm partner told the outlet.

In a surprise turnaround last week Musk abandoned his three-month effort to terminate the Twitter deal through a US court in Delaware citing the large number of fake accounts on Twitter. By some estimates 20% of Twitter users are fake.

The billionaire boss of Tesla and SpaceX also cancelled negotiations to shave $10bn off the agreed $44bn price tag (Twitter shares have traded as much as $20 below the $54 a share agreed in April) and said he would accept the original terms of the deal.

Musk told the Financial Times on Saturday that his interest in the company has never been primarily financial.

“I’m not doing Twitter for the money. It’s not like I’m trying to buy some yacht and I can’t afford it. I don’t own any boats. But I think it’s important that people have a maximally trusted and inclusive means of exchanging ideas and that it should be as trusted and transparent as possible.”

Twitter however did not immediately drop the lawsuit it is pursuing in order to force Musk into compliance.

“There is no need for an expedited trial to order defendants to do what they are already doing” Musk’s attorneys wrote in a filing. “Yet Twitter will not take yes for an answer. Astonishingly they have insisted on proceeding with this litigation recklessly putting the deal at risk and gambling with their stockholders interests.”

Twitter said the attempt to halt the litigation was “an invitation to further mischief and delay”.

On Thursday the judge presiding over the case Kathaleen McCormick granted Musk’s request to delay a trial scheduled for 17 October. Musk’s attorney said they could get the deal could done by 28 October “pending receipt of the proceeds of the debt financing”.

But some warn that there are few ways for the banks to get out of providing financing for both legal and reputational reasons even if that means booking substantial losses. “Generally it would be hard to have deals go forward if they were contingent on bank financing and that bank financing was not rock solid” Fischer told the outlet.

But if the deal does not close later this month McCormick has said that she would schedule a trial for November.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW5vcnNlbWFuLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzgvMjMzOTQ4NjgvZ2phbGxhcmhvcm4tc291bmRlZC1zb21lb25lLXNwZWNpYWwtY2hhcmxpZS1odWl6aW5nYS1taW5uZXNvdGEtdmlraW5ncy1jaGljYWdvLWJlYXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Gjallarhorn will be sounded by someone special on Sunday,"We usually don’t talk about who’s going to sound the Gjallarhorn before each game but in this case I’m quite willing to make an exception.

She said that the BOA refused to take cash and she would have to write a check. The reason they gave her was it is their policy not to take cash any longer. Is this true?

S.K.

Answer: Not exactly Bank of America will take cash if you are putting the money in your account. The rub is putting cash into a third party’s account.

Don Vecchiarello a spokesman for Bank of America said that the bank stopped allowing people to put cash in other people’s accounts in December 2017.

“It was to reduce fraud and money laundering” he said.

There are other ways to deposit money into a third-party account. You can write a check use a mobile app and use online person to person transfer.

“Our customers’ security is our top priority” Vecchiarello said.

Many other banks have similar prohibitions.

Q: The beautiful paving job on Reynolda Road has been complete for several months. However the permanent lines have been very slow to being restored making driving at night especially difficult. What is the projected date of completion of the permanent lines?

R.K.

Answer: Pat Ivey the N.C. Department of Transportation division engineer for Forsyth County said that the line work will be completed soon.

“Equipment issues with the pavement marking subcontractor have delayed the installation of permanent pavement markings but they plan to have the work completed by the end of October” he said.

Q: Is it true that the U.S. Mint will stop the production of pennies soon because of the high cost of making them.

P.N.

Answer: Pennies aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.

“As of this date the Mint has no plans to cease production of the penny” a spokesperson for the U.S Mint said.

This has been floating around for many years. In 2013 USA Today reported that despite other countries dropping their penny coin but the United States had no plans drop our penny.

But I'm not blaming the drivers,"It’s flooding again in Chicago so much that this time you can’t reach your stop at the “L” unless you swim. You swallow your pride (and four hours of minimum wage) to make it to class on time and pull out your Uber app. 64.56$ for a 15 min drive. Flipping between Lyft and Uber watching the prices reach higher each time you refresh the page a Citizen notification pops up and notifies you that somebody got robbed right behind the bus stop to help pressure your decision.

After ordering one anyway and sacrificing lunch money for the week you see the wait time is 30 minutes. No matter what you do you’re screwed.

What once was a reliable form of transportation rideshare apps now fail their workers and riders. These services need to make rides safer and cost efficient again.

Olivia Hunter a senior at DePaul used to rely on rideshares during the pandemic to get to work safely. But now after multiple traumatic experiences Hunter refuses to use them.

“My work was still in person and it wasn’t safe to go on the L during the pandemic. There was so much crime and the trains never showed up anyways” Hunter said. “I wouldn’t hate Uber as much if I could count on our public transit.”

Between 2018 to 2021 average Uber prices soared 92% according to data from Rakuten. This is one of the many reasons Hunter decided using Lyft or Uber wasn’t worth it.

“Late at night I used to call Ubers to be safe but sometimes the price would be $50 to $60 just to get from River North to Belmont” Hunter said. “I work in the service industry and it’s not like I make a lot of money now I just take the risk because I’m not wasting all the money I just made.”

Stated in the Uber help line “Dynamic pricing takes effect when a lot of people in the same area are requesting rides at the same time. This means that rides will be more expensive. Adjusting the price attracts more drivers to an area so everyone can get a ride.”

Like many Chicagoans during the pandemic Hunter’s life didn’t stop and without the consistency of Chicago’s public transit Hunter dealt with multiple issues when using rideshare apps including ghost drivers upcharges and just straight harassment from drivers.

“I would feel so uncomfortable with male drivers they would ask for my instagram compliment me really creepy and couldn’t take a hint that I didn’t want to talk” Hunter said. “I hate that they knew where I lived and when I reached out to Uber multiple times they never fixed the situation.”

Harassment with Ubers is not uncommon. Eli Schmitt a junior at DePaul experienced homophobic microagressions with a particular driver that left them uncomfortable.

“I was on my way back from a friend’s house late last winter my driver was a young guy who was adamant about not wearing a mask [relating] it to other people going to hell” Schmitt said. “And then like all things do the conversation turned to religion and the phrase ‘and there’s the gays’ didn’t sound like a good start to me.”

Schmitt continued the conversation as the driver grilled them about bisexuality and being non-binary. According to Schmitt the driver seemed to be going through a crisis asking intrusive questions about his personal sexuality.

“Him being a straight man all his life slowly realizing he isn’t straight he seemed like he didn’t know heads from tails” Schmitt said. “By this time we are parked outside my house… I was opening the door to leave when he said ‘No no no you don’t have to go.’ I left my foot in the door so it couldn’t be locked.”

The driver proceeded to harass Schmitt and ask if they wanted to engage in sexual intcourse. After politely turning him down Schmitt left the car and walked around the block before heading back into their house to not be followed.

Uber received 3824 reports across the five most severe categories of sexual assault and misconduct.” according to the Uber newsroom.

Unfortunately it is not only the riders who get harassed. One Uber driver spoke to The DePaulia about their struggles with unsafe riders but asked to remain anonymous.

‘There are a lot of bad people in Chicago you can never be too safe. I call my wife during my rides in case [something] happens and she needs to call [the] police” the driver said. “People make fun of my English and call me terrible names and I just keep driving.”

The driver continues to work for Uber and Lyft because it’s difficult to find a good paying job in Chicago while not having the best English skills.

“I have to do what I do to support my family but I wish I didn’t have this job” the driver said.

Samantha Close a Communications and Media professor at DePaul tells The DePaulia riders are now experiencing what drivers have had to endure since the beginning.

“The recent interest in surge charges and unreliability is consumers​ of digital platform services experiencing what drivers​ and other workers on these platforms have had to deal with for years. It’s very hard to know exactly how much you’re getting paid much like it can be difficult to know how much a ride will cost” Close said.

I don’t blame the drivers for how rideshare apps are unreliable. The companies themselves have been putting profit first instead of consistency and support for its workers and users.

Geoffrey R. O. Durso an assistant marketing professor at DePaul said the recent increase in prices is a normal practice for bigger companies to make profit.

“For years Uber and Lyft invested a lot of resources in getting riders and infrastructure (like at airports) to win market share including college students of course” Durso said. “But those early years were subsidized by venture capital without much in real-time profits to sustain the business. Now they are in a position where their consumers rely on their services and they are pursuing their longer-term profit goals.”

With data analytics companies like Uber and Lyft can change prices around to meet consumers demands including surge prices depending on weather special events and time of day.

“There is then a squeeze: Riders get sticker shock at the price of a service they’ve come to rely on and drivers don’t see much of the additional profit for their labor and the higher prices discourage riders from adding tips which do go to the drivers” Durso said. “All the money flows to investors after years of low profits.”

Without the consistency of public transportation and now the overcharging and unsafe climate with rideshare apps many young adults are left to risk their safety how they travel within the city.

Of course there are steps you can take to have misplaced items returned from an Uber UBER or a rental car But is that even possible when it comes to marijuana?

American workers travelers and socialites are leaving behind all sorts of personal crud in Ubers and rental cars these days. One report found that some of the most common of these accidental abandonments include laptops cell phones purses and backpacks. Yet the extent of the stuff the scatterbrained population resigns to the backseat of other people’s vehicles is absolutely endless.

Everything from pets to propane tanks have been found by drivers of this popular ride-sharing service. It’s also becoming increasingly more common for people to leave cannabis products and paraphernalia behind. And while a situation involving any lost item is undoubtedly one loaded up with stress and hassles losing your weed is just like well a bummer man. Of course there are steps one can take to have misplaced items returned. But is that even possible when it comes to marijuana? And if so what does a person have to do to see that their dope makes it home safely?

Even in the states where marijuana is now legal for adults 21 and older getting lost weed returned to its rightful owner could prove tricky. Legal or not Uber and car rental agencies does not want passengers using their service for cannabis transport. In fact Uber guidelines show a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. This means that if a driver even suspects a passenger has marijuana they can take steps to get them banned from Uber altogether. The reprimand might only start out with a warning but with enough marijuana-related reports a person could easily be back in taxis in no time. This is similar for rental cars.

So if you realize that you left your weed in the back of an Uber or rental car what should you do? Well if we’re honest it might be best to let it go. Yep just chalk it up as a loss and move on with your life. Because while a person certainly has the right to file an inquiry with the company to have their weed returned there is a chance that it could come back to bite them. After all admitting to a violation of the company’s drug and alcohol policy might be construed as a bold move and it could result in the company stripping away your privileges.

And seriously you don’t want to go back to cabs now do you? Of course not. But also we get it weed is expensive and no self-respecting cannabis connoisseur could live with themselves if they didn’t at least try to get their weed back.

You can always try this: Open the Uber app on your phone. Now select the menu and find “Your Trips.” From there you’ll be able to search your ride history and find the one where you most likely lost the weed. At the bottom of the page you’ll see a list of possible complaints. Click “I lost an item.” Once this is done you’ll see a list of possible options. Select “Contact driver about a lost item.” You’ll then provide Uber with a contact number and eventually you’ll be connected with the driver to discuss the missing item. If they are cool well you might have a shot at getting it back. But again the situation could always result in disappointment anger and ultimately sobriety.

But please take note: A person who loses marijuana in an Uber or rental car in a state where it is illegal should avoid filing any kind of grievance like it is the coronavirus. Seriously there probably isn’t any chance that the driver is going to return the weed.

And if they do they might even involve law enforcement and you could end up going to jail for marijuana possession. The situation could also result in you losing access to the Uber app on a permanent basis leaving you with no convenient way to get back home once the county jail finally releases you from custody. It’s just not worth it.

Why Trust Us?

Quinta Brunson 32 shared the retinol serum she says “recharges” her skin at night.

She loves because it’s gentle yet effective.

“Serums just feel like they’re doing that extra layer of work under your moisturizer. I think it’s really important to use one.”

No skincare routine is complete without a good retinol but the truth is—the powerhouse ingredient can get pricey. And when you’re going to be using a product multiple times a week (you know to fade dark spots fine lines and smooth texture) having one you can restock without breaking the bank is ideal. And Quinta Brunson has just the recommendation: .

In a new Go to Bed With Me video with Harper’s Bazaar the Abbot Elementary star and Olay partner shared her nighttime skincare routine which she said is “just as important as the morning skincare routine.”

“You have to hydrate your skin at night you have to protect your skin at night you have to recharge your skin at night” she continued which is why she loves the Olay Regenerist line—particularly the retinol serum which you can get for $40.

It not only contains rejuvenating retinol but also anti-inflammatory niacinamide which helps fade dark spots and tame redness and irritation that retinol an intense exfoliator can sometimes bring. It also contains an amino-peptide blend to liven the skin with bounce and hydration.

“I love keeping it all in the [Olay] family” Brunson 32 explained in the video. “I can really trust that these things are gonna work together to recharge my face as I sleep. I like to put it all over my face and my neck and serums just feel like they’re doing that extra layer of work under your moisturizer. I think it’s really important to use one.”

And she’s not alone in her love of the product. “Not only has it helped treat acne and prevent new problems but also has brightened my complexion faded old scars and pigmentation! Not to mention addressing fine lines and wrinkles” one Ulta reviewer writes. “It’s amazing. No irritation. No redness. Just glowing even tone and my face looks visibly firmer. Not only are small lines around my eyes becoming much less noticeable but the small crease I have between my brows has actually shrunk” another adds.

“This is easily the best retinol I’ve ever found. It absorbs into the skin and doesn’t leave a sticky film like some do” another shopper writes.

Along with the serum Brunson also uses the  which she says is “great” after waking up at 5 a.m. as well as  which she says is “light easy to use creamy” and “feels like silk.”

This week our beauty writer is testing out the ITEM Beauty Boost Juice Mascara.

In August I finally made my way across the pond all the way from London England to the city they say never sleeps — New York. As well as having a list of touristy things on my itinerary I knew a lot of my time would be spent hunting down the very best beauty stores in NYC and stocking up on products that aren’t available in England. I found myself frequenting C.O. Bigelow Ulta Beauty and Sephora with the latter being where I made one of my favorite purchases ITEM Beauty’s Boost Juice which is a dual-ended lash primer and two color mascara.

If you’re yet to be acquainted with ITEM Beauty it was co-founded by TikTok star turned entrepreneur Addison Rae with MadeBy Collective and includes a range of makeup from creamy blushes and eye shadow to highly pigmented eyeliners as well as skin care. If it wasn’t already obvious from the standout electric blue shade and ethereal lilac hue of the mascara the brand gives off really fun and expressive energy which instantly caught my attention.

It’s not often that I steer away from my beloved black mascara but as someone who loves to experiment with colorful makeup I thought I’d put this one to the test. Keep reading for my honest review.

My Everyday Mascara Routine

Despite wishing for long curly eyelashes when I was younger my natural lashes are pretty straight and short blending in with my dark brown eyes. To achieve my favorite natural-looking fluttery lashes I usually start off by using an eyelash curler to give them a bit of a lift and then go in with two different types of mascara — one for volume and one for length. I’ve yet to find a black mascara that gives me both volume and length which is why I always opt for using different formulas for each. In terms of a mascara wand I find myself drawn to straight wands that coat each lash individually without much clumping.

My eyelashes with no mascara.

The ITEM Beauty Boost Juice Mascara

This mascara is super innovative and can be used in a number of ways with the brand hailing it as “a green juice for your lashes” and having 3-in-1 conditioning benefits. As mentioned before it is dual-ended with the lilac-shaded formula designed for maximum volume and the blue-colored end being all about lengthening. Both formulas are infused with nourishing ingredients from bamboo to olive oil to keep your eyelashes conditioned and strong while imparting a bold pop of color.

What’s really genius about this mascara is that you can use both sides as a primer for either volume or length and then top it with a more traditional black or brown formula if you prefer something subtle. But don’t worry — when applying a different mascara on top the lilac and blue shades disappear underneath so there’s no worrying about mascaras mixing together. So you’re essentially getting a lash primer and two mascaras all in one product.

If you’re interested in trying a colored mascara but aren’t too sure about the best way to remove it make-up artist Chanel Temple suggests “Double cleansing with an oil cleanser and micellar water is necessary when you go bolder with your look.”

I can really attest to an oil-based cleanser or cleansing balm being best for removal as they both easily break down no-budge makeup. Temple adds that “Saturating a cotton round with micellar water and holding it to the eye for at least 10 seconds gives it enough time to work. Then gently massage the eyes to remove the product and follow up with a gentle cleanser for extra removal.”

Testing The ITEM Beauty Boost Juice Mascara

I’ve been wearing the ITEM Beauty mascara non-stop since I got back from New York and I just can’t get over how pigmented the blue shade is on my lashes. I’ve tried a few different colored mascaras in the past but always found the hue didn’t pop as much as I’d hoped. Surprisingly the mascara stayed on my lashes all day without even a hint of flaking or transfer. I was sure this wouldn’t be the case as even some of my favorite black mascaras transfer — but I was proven wrong.

The curl to my lashes lasted from morning to night which I was really impressed with as I often attend beauty events in the evening after a full day of work meaning whatever makeup I apply half asleep in the morning has to see me through the next 12 hours. Despite the conditioning benefits of the mascara I didn’t find my lashes particularly stronger or healthier. When it comes to lash health and growth I prefer to reach for something like a lash serum that I can apply before bed so that I’m not just relying on an everyday mascara.

Recently I’ve found myself reaching for the blue side of the boost juice mascara and pairing it with 19/99 Beauty’s Precision Color Pencil in the shade Notte as both shades are almost identical and make for a standout eye look. I’ve also been pleasantly surprised at just how many compliments my blue mascara has gotten me. I recently went backstage at Paul Costelloe’s S/S 23 London Fashion Week show and the makeup artists praised my colorful look. Spring/summer 2023 seems to be gearing up to be full of vibrant makeup looks and I for one am glad that I’ve got the Boost Juice Mascara to help me embrace the trend.

Is The ITEM Beauty Boost Juice Mascara Worth It?

Absolutely! While there are still a few months left until the end of the year I think I can confidently say that this mascara has been my favorite makeup purchase of the year. At $18 plus all the nourishing ingredients and a variety of ways to use it what’s not to love?

As someone who loves to incorporate color into her makeup looks people often say “I wish I could wear colorful makeup” which everyone can — it’s just about finding the right products to get you more comfortable with bold shades and I think ITEM Beauty has done just that. The mascara works really well whether worn alone or underneath black/brown mascara as a primer to achieve plenty of length and curl. Now I’m just ready for ITEM Beauty to grace the beauty world with more shades.

Debs and the struggle of railroaders,"As railroad workers prepare for a confrontation against the corporations the government and the union bureaucracies that falsely claim to “represent” them they must learn from and grapple with their own history.

Of particular importance is the life of the great socialist worker and railroader Eugene V. Debs. His long life—from locomotive fireman to trade unionist to socialist candidate for American president to class war prisoner—holds crucial lessons for today’s workers.

Debs and the growth of the rail industry

Debs’ life was bound up with the rail industry. The first railroad reached his hometown Terre Haute Indiana from Indianapolis in 1852 three years before his birth to Alsatian immigrant parents who named the boy Eugene Victor after French novelists Eugène Sue and Victor Hugo. Other railroads followed making Terre Haute into a transportation hub. Over the course of Debs’ youth the railroads transformed the bucolic Wabash River town into a small industrial city. The population increased sevenfold from roughly 4000 in the early 1850s to 30000 in 1890 when Debs turned 35. Immigrants poured in including one Johann Dreiser from Germany whose son the great novelist Theodore Dreiser was born in Terre Haute in 1871 the same year as the Paris Commune and the year that Debs 16 years old took up work as a locomotive fireman on the Vandalia Railroad.

Debs later said he regretted leaving school but it was natural for youth to be drawn to work on the trains which embodied all the technology and excitement of the age a “Type of the modern—emblem of motion and power—pulse of the continent” as Walt Whitman put it.[1] Debs soon entered the ranks of organized labor joining in 1875 the two-year-old Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen. His leadership talents were recognized and he rose quickly in the Brotherhood’s ranks by 1880 becoming Grand Secretary and Treasurer and the editor of its journal Firemen’s Magazine.

Meanwhile the national railroad industry grew by leaps and bounds. Some 30000 miles of track were laid by 1860 with four trunk lines linking the Midwest to the East and realigning it economically away from what had been its traditional orientation to the South via the steamboat and barge commerce of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The rail network thus unified the North economically and facilitated its victory in the Civil War in 1865 when Debs was 10 years old—a Second American Revolution that destroyed chattel slavery and gave birth to a whole new capitalist society.

The railroads were the ligaments of that new society. Another 30000 miles of track were laid between 1866 and the panic of 1873. Midway between those two years on May 10 1869 the last spike in the Transcontinental Railroad was driven at Promontory Utah joining the West and East coasts. The Canadian Pacific Railway was completed in 1881 the Northern Pacific and Southern Pacific followed in 1883 and the Great Northern in 1889. The transcontinental lines transformed the continent into a vast new arena for the development of capitalism and put an end to the frontier a fact officially proclaimed by the US Census of 1890. Indeed it was the iron horse far more than the American military that subjugated the Sioux and the other Plains Indians to capitalism. The British French and Germans used the railroads for similar ends in their overseas colonies. As Lenin noted it was these “capitalist threads” that

… have converted this railway construction into an instrument for oppressing a thousand million people (in the colonies and semicolonies) that is more than half the population of the globe that inhabits the dependent countries as well as the wage-slaves of capital in the “civilised” countries.[2]

Antebellum America had consisted of thousands of small towns like Debs’ Terre Haute little islands whose small industries catered to regional farming populations generating a kind of private property as Lenin explained “based on the labour of the small proprietor free competition [and] democracy.” However by the 1870s the steel and coal of Pennsylvania the wheat and timber of Minnesota the minerals of Idaho the cattle of Texas the cotton of Mississippi and so on could be shipped everywhere in a matter of days. But this created not just a continental field of play for the capitalists. It forged a powerful new social force: the North American working class.

If today that class begins its showdown with the capitalists on the railroads it will make for a tidy historical symmetry. For it was the railroads that gave birth to that formidable antagonist of the worker—the corporation. In the 19th century no single investor would risk the amount of capital required to build the roads. The privately held joint stock corporation operating with a public charter provided the solution. The railroad corporations were the first to separate proprietorship from management based on the concept of minority ownership “the legally established authority of a small group of directors and managers to act in the name of a larger amorphous body of otherwise unrelated stockholders.”[3]

The major owners holders of the company bonds and stocks might never set foot on their own lines much less know anything of their day-to-day operations. This was left to a new species of man the corporate executive. He had one overriding aim: to increase the value of company’s securities. The means of achieving this was to squeeze ever more profit out of rail workers. For this a successful executive could be rewarded even made a millionaire owner himself. This was the career path of the young Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie who worked his way up the ranks of the day’s richest firm the Pennsylvania Railroad en route to become steel baron and world’s richest man.

The massive scale of the corporation was “a new power for which our language contains no name” admitted Union Pacific president Charles Francis Adams Jr. great grandson and grandson of the Adams presidents John and John Quincy. “We have no word to express government by monied corporations.”[4] Lacking the vocabulary the political culture of Debs’ adulthood still attempted to affix a name and a face to the incomprehensible wealth of the corporation. These personages were the Robber Barons. And indeed those deriving their wealth from the railroad corporations reads like a veritable “who’s who” list of Gilded Age tycoons: Gould Cooke Vanderbilt Stanford Harriman Hill Huntington. Even for Carnegie and Rockefeller steel and oil wealth were inseparable from their control of railroads. But the most significant figure of all and the one who most anticipated the future of capitalism was J.P. Morgan. Historian John Garraty explains how Morgan

[compelled] the lines to substitute “mutual co-operation” for cutthroat competition. The experience wealth and prestige gained in railroad finance enabled bankers to exert a growing influence over manufacturing corporations as well… [T]he foundation of banker domination was being laid… In large heavily capitalized enterprises selling goods all over the United States and sometimes international markets too the coordination of many different operations taking place at widely scattered sites made management itself a specialized profession. The ability to see the structure whole to appreciate its interrelations became essential.[5]

The vast “coordination” described by Garraty is what Lenin called the socialization of economic production. Yet this socialization which objectively brings workers together in a massive network of production transportation and distribution is dedicated to the accumulation of private wealth not social good. This is the most basic contradiction of capitalist society.

The finance capitalists are still around and more dominant than ever. The descendants of the brotherhoods are still around too and still dividing rail workers up rather than uniting them. But even at the time of their emergence they were hardly obstacles for the railroad corporations. In fact they emerged not as “unions” in any modern sense of the term. Half fraternal benefit organizations akin to the Masons they organized “lodges” not union locals. At first their main practical function was to maintain insurance benefits for injury and death. Based on craft skill they separated the various sections of the railroad workforce into different organizations. They excluded unskilled workers by custom and blacks by rule. They did not engage in collective bargaining rejected the notion that there existed a divergence of interests between capital and labor and eschewed the strike weapon. Their leaders the young Debs included hoped fervently that differences between capital and labor could be reconciled in a “cooperative commonwealth.”

The Brotherhoods and the Great Railroad Strike of 1877

Because of these characteristics the Brotherhoods played only a negative role in one of the greatest strikes of American history the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. It seems that Debs only 22 at the time and still a loyal Democrat stood aside from the struggle though the train men in his own hometown joined the strike shutting down Terre Haute’s lines on July 23 and occupying the Vandalia line shop.

The Great Strike had begun a week earlier on July 16 1877 in Martinsburg West Virginia when firemen and brakemen of the B&O walked off the job in response to the announcement of a 10 percent pay cut that had been initiated on the neighboring Pennsylvania Railroad system. Militia sent to free trains from Martinsburg instead fraternized with the strikers. The strike then spread to Baltimore where much of the working class rallied to the cause of the trainmen. From Baltimore it swept the continent reaching as far as California Texas and Canada. Major strikes or general strikes took place in Baltimore Chicago Scranton Pittsburgh Harrisburg Buffalo Toledo East St. Louis and St. Louis. In St. Louis for a brief period the working class took power with the formation of a commune led by Karl Marx’s followers. In all more than 100000 railroaders led perhaps one million workers in the strike. With memories of the Paris Commune fresh in mind the American ruling class was at first stunned but it quickly responded to the revolt with a mobilization of the army and state militias.

The central cause of the strike was pay cutting. Big business reacted to the panic of 1873—which erupted because of financial speculation in the railroad industry—with an unprecedented attack on workers’ wages. Railroad corporations slashed wages in May and June 1877 for the third time since 1873 bringing pay down by as much as 50 percent.

However just as is the case today pay cutting was not the only issue. According to one historian’s account railroad management was also demanding

[w]hat amounted to a complete reorganization of work. [Workers] opposed the system of assigning trains in which the first crew into town was the first crew out leaving them no time to rest or see their families; they wanted regular runs to stabilize pay and working days; they wanted passes home in case of long layovers; they wanted the system of “classification” of workers by length of service and efficiency—used to keep wages down—abolished… The men felt they were treated “just as the rolling stock of locomotives”—squeezed for every drop of profit.[6]

Another issue was worker safety. For all the organizational development for all of the cutting-edge technology which so captured the 19th century imagination the railroads were brutal workplaces no better than coal mines or steel mills. In the state of Massachusetts alone 42 trainmen died on average each year in the mid-1870s. In one three-decade period 1890 to 1917 some 72000 men died on the tracks and another 158000 died in repair shops and roundhouses. Over the same period another two million more suffered serious injury on the rails.[7]

The railroad firms disclaimed any responsibility for their slaughterhouse. All accidents no matter what the cause were invariably chalked up to “worker error.” The powerful Pennsylvania Railroad set the industry standard in clauses 6 and 7 of its official regulations:

6. The regular compensation of employes [sic] covers all risk or liability to accident. 7. If an employe [sic] is disabled by sickness or any other cause the right to claim compensation is not recognized…

The Brotherhoods’ solution to this had been fraternal insurance plans. But these were overwhelmed by the economic crisis of the 1870s having little value to railroad men who were constantly being laid off and rehired. And with their commitment to the “harmony of interests” with capitalists the Brotherhoods had no answer for wage cutting.

Instead the rank-and-file had to organize themselves to take a step forward in 1877. “The self-organized nature of the strike wasn’t merely the result of the near absence of labour unions; rather it occurred despite them” writes Robert Ovetz. “The existing train brotherhoods were highly fragmented by craft didn’t coordinate with one another negotiated separate labour agreements and were universally opposed to any strikes or disruptions.”[8] Preparatory work to make an end-run around the Brotherhoods came with the formation of an industrial union which would bring together under one umbrella all the industry’s workers: the Trainmen’s Union founded in June 1877. The trigger was a new wage cut imposed by the Pennsylvania Railroad. According to Jeremy Brecher

When the leaders of the Brotherhoods of Engineers Conductors and Firemen made no effort to combat the cut the railroad workers on the Pennsylvania system took action themselves. A week before the cut went into effect the Newark New Jersey division of the Engineers held an angry protest meeting against the cut. The Jersey City lodge met the next day voted for a strike and put out feelers to other workers; by the day the cut took effect engineers’ and firemen’s locals throughout the Pennsylvania system had chosen delegates to a joint grievance committee ignoring the leadership of the national union.[9]

This effort at building an industrial union was thwarted by an influx of company spies who provided information to the firms leading to the firing and blacklisting of militant workers. This had its effect. When the rebellion came in 1877 it lacked a centralized leadership the decisive factor in its defeat. Nonetheless the strike showed the potential of the American working class. And it announced that the class struggle had taken center stage in American history.

Debs only 22 at the time opposed strikes in general. In the autumn of 1877 he addressed a union convention in Indianapolis. “Does the Brotherhood encourage strikers?” he asked. “To this question we most emphatically answer ‘No brothers.’”[10]

How Debs became a socialist: The Pullman strike of 1894

Within a decade Debs was thinking very differently. “The strike” Debs wrote in an editorial in 1888 “is the weapon of the oppressed of men capable of appreciating justice and having the courage to resist wrong and contend for principle” before adding an appeal to the spirit of 1776: “The nation had for its cornerstone a strike. ”[11]

By then Debs had become one of the best-known labor leaders in the country affectionately called “Gene” by workers from coast-to-coast. He was different than most union bureaucrats. Debs always identified as a worker:

I had fired an engine and been stung by the exposure and hardship of the rail. I was with the boys in their weary watches at the broken engine’s side and often helped to bear their bruised and bleeding bodies back to wife and child again. How could I but feel the burden of their wrongs? How could the seed of agitation fail to take deep root in my heart?[12]

Debs remained committed to an overriding aim what he called “the emancipation of labor.” To him the craft union was a tool toward that end not an end in and of itself. And he determined over the course of the 1880s that the craft union tool did not work for the job. This became painfully evident in 1886 when the great railroad interests motivated by J.P. Morgan combined in a General Managers’ Association with a total capitalization of over $2 billion and a workforce of 220000. In the face of this leviathan the Brotherhoods kept up their petty jurisdictional turf wars raids and exclusions. “Debs desired a completely new structure of the labor movement in order to offset the power of capital” his biographer Nick Salvatore concludes.[13]

True to his convictions Debs resigned from his office to free himself as a leader. Due to popular demand from the rank-and-file he stayed on for a time as editor of the Firemen’s Magazine but he insisted that the union reduce his salary from $3000 to $1000 per year.

Debs then went about setting up the American Railway Union an organization that “would replace the brotherhoods abolish craft divisions and unify the railroad workers” as Salvatore puts it.[14] The first test of the ARU came in early 1894 when a strike erupted in Minnesota on the Great Northern Railroad controlled by “the empire builder” the viciously anti-labor tycoon James J. Hill. Debs traveled to Minnesota to rally the workers and to conduct negotiations. The solidarity of all the trades under the ARU proved unshakeable and Hill was forced to agree to almost all the workers’ wage demands.

The defeat of the Great Northern was Debs later said the “only clear cut victory of any consequence ever won by a railroad union in the United States” a statement that may still be true today. In the weeks afterwards railroaders flooded into the new organization at a rate of 3000 per day. The labor bureaucrats including Samuel Gompers head of the AFL viewed the ARU with dread but at that moment they dared not challenge Debs. The stage was set for the great Pullman strike of 1894.

The Pullman Car Company enjoyed a monopoly on the production of sleeping-car manufacturing out of its 500-acre “model town” in Chicago. The owner George Pullman pretended that his company paternalism had created a happy workforce. The reality was just the opposite. The Pullman workers seethed under Pullman’s fiefdom which included ownership of nearly every aspect of their lives: their homes the places they shopped the local police force and even the churches where they prayed. Pullman used his company-town domination not for benevolence but to suppress opposition and to wantonly raise rents and cut wages. A federal commission later determined that the

conditions created at Pullman enabled the management at all times to assert with great vigor its assumed right to fix wages and rents absolutely and to repress that sort of independence which leads to labor organizations and their attempts at mediation arbitration strikes etc.[15]

When the Panic of 1893 hit Pullman responded like many other corporations by cutting wages. Pullman workers announced their intention to strike counting on the support of Debs and the ARU. Debs let the rail barons know that no trainmen would handle any Pullman cars until Pullman workers’ demands were met. If the rail corporations responded by laying off railroad workers Debs promised a nationwide strike.

This is exactly what took place. The Pullman strike led to a sympathy boycott by railroad workers. Firings of boycotting workers set in motion a growing nationwide strike movement. Once again as it had against the Great Northern the ARU showed the advantage of the industrial union over the craft system. Its boycott succeeded in shutting down rail transport in much of the country. And it appeared that Debs was on his way to another victory “and the American Railway Union [had] again won clear and complete [with the] combined corporations … paralyzed and helpless” as he wrote in his famous essay How I Became a Socialist. But then at the very moment of victory Debs recalled

there were delivered from wholly unexpected quarters a swift succession of blows that blinded me for an instant and then opened wide my eyes—and in the gleam of every bayonet and the flash of every rifle the class struggle was revealed.

The “blows” were delivered by the federal government under President Grover Cleveland a Democratic Party politician Debs had earlier supported. The White House organized a cynical campaign against the ARU securing a court injunction against the boycott under the allegation that it was an illegal conspiracy. First deployed against workers in Chicago the Cleveland injunction was actually a model to be used everywhere. It was quickly emulated against the ARU across the country.

Debs rallied the workers. “It will take more than injunctions to move the trains” he wired. “Get everybody out.” But Cleveland and his attorney general Richard Olney were not done. Under the pretext that the strike was interfering with the mails Cleveland sent in the United States Army under General Nelson Miles a Civil War veteran of the Union Army. Soon the military was dispatched to other states. The presence of the army in Chicago triggered rioting resulting in several deaths the overturning of train cars and the torching of seven buildings at the site of the recently concluded World’s Fair the Chicago Columbian Exhibition.

Debs responded with a call for a national general strike to take place on July 11 1894. At this point Cleveland had Debs and other strike leaders arrested for violating the injunction against conspiracy. With the leadership imprisoned and unable to communicate to the rank-and-file Samuel Gompers head of the AFL issued the coup de grace. Pretending to assume temporary leadership of the strike he told the trainmen to return to work. Militants across the country were blackballed.

The US Supreme Court unanimously upheld Debs’ conviction in 1895 affirming the right of the president to use an injunction to break a labor strike. Debs was jailed in federal prison at Woodstock Illinois. While there he was visited by socialists and he began to undertake a study of Marx. Debs’ development as a socialist leader of the working class would last the rest of his life. But he emerged from the Pullman experience convinced that industrial organization was not enough. A political struggle was also required.

War revolution and the rail strike of 1922

Debs supported William Jennings Bryan and the Democratic Party-Populist Party fusion ticket in 1896 attracted by the Populists’ calls for the nationalization of the railroads—a demand that Bryan and the Democrats were intent on scrapping. Then as now the Democrats’ special role in ruling class politics is to absorb defuse and destroy popular demands.

But by the turn of the century Debs had broken with capitalist political parties. He ran as a socialist candidate for president in 1900 in 1904 1908 and in 1912. In that latter year Debs won one million votes in the four-way contest with incumbent Republican President William Howard Taft Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson and Progressive Party candidate and former Republican president Theodore Roosevelt.

Debs did not stand in 1916 when Wilson won reelection on a peace platform a reflection of the overwhelming hostility to the European slaughter in the working class. “He Kept us out of War!”—was the winning slogan. But in fact Wilson was preparing to drag the US into World War I on the side of Britain and France against Germany. This was fully in line with the aims of American capitalism and especially the J.P. Morgan interests which had used domination of the railroads to assert control over steel anthracite coal and much of the country’s manufacturing industry. According to business historian Martin Horn

From August 1914 to April 1917 while the United States was neutral the Morgan banks worked assiduously to further the Allied cause… In January 1915 J.P. Morgan & Co. was appointed the British government’s purchasing agent in the U.S.; some months later in May 1915 they assumed the same position for the French government. Acting through its Export Department J.P. Morgan & Co. coordinated the purchasing requirements of the Allies in the United States a task that became progressively larger as the scope of Allied buying increased… [T]he bank floated loans for Britain and France handled foreign exchange operations and advised British and French officials.[16]

Much was at stake for the House of Morgan and American capitalism. Entry became urgent in February 1917 when a massive working class revolution in Russia drove Tsar Nicholas II from power and threatened to take Russia out of the war. In that case Germany could concentrate the bulk of its military in the brutal trench fighting on the Western Front against Britain and France. American imperialism could not accept either a German victory or a Russian withdrawal. It financed the Russian war effort in exchange for a promise that the Provisional Government under Alexander Kerensky would continue the war. As the head of the American mission to Russia Elihu Root put it to Kerensky: “No fight no loans.” Defeat of Germany was paramount “whatever the cost in life and treasure.”[17]

On April 6 1917 the US declared war on Germany. Ten days later an event of still greater significance took place. On April 16 1917 Vladimir Lenin returned to Russia from exile in Switzerland and immediately steered the Bolshevik Party on the course of revolution mobilized behind the slogan “All Power to the Soviets!” One month afterwards May 17 1917 Trotsky delayed by an illegal detention by the British military returned to Russia from New York where he had been living in exile and where he had met Debs.

The February Revolution had produced not just a bourgeois government under Kerensky. Out of it emerged a contending power: a system of rank-and-file working class democracy organized from factory and neighborhood councils all the way up to the Soviets or workers’ councils. The power of the capitalists operated through Kerensky’s government. The potential power of the working class which had toppled the Tsar was wielded through the Soviets. Under the leadership of Lenin and Trotsky the Soviets became the organs through which the proletarian revolution advanced. On November 7 1917 the Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd and created the first workers’ state.

Lenin left and Trotsky

As dramatic as it was the Russian Revolution was in fact part of a working class upsurge that played out on a global scale. Objectively this movement of the working class was spurred on by inflation which devoured paychecks and politically by the growing influence of socialism. Within the US between 1916 and 1922 more than one million workers struck each year. In 1919 the figure reached over four million.

The AFL under Gompers along with the railroad Brotherhoods sought to suppress the strike wave. In return the Wilson administration acting through mediating federal structures came close to official recognition of the conservative unions. Union officials were invited into tripartite discussions with representatives of government and business and Gompers became one of the country’s leading pro-war propagandists.

At the same time the Wilson administration turned ruthlessly to crush more radical threats including the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) which Debs had co-founded in 1905 and the left-wing of the Socialist Party. The methods of repression included censorship deportation arrest and semi-official vigilante justice that included violent attacks and even murder.

Debs giving his ""Canton Speech"" for which he was arrested and imprisoned by the Wilson administration

Debs was a major target. He had solidarized himself with the Bolsheviks and vehemently opposed American entry into the war. In 1915 after observing the betrayal of Europe’s socialists in the defense of “their” ruling classes Debs wrote:

I have no country to fight for; my country is the earth; and I am a citizen of the world. ... I am not a capitalist soldier; I am a proletarian revolutionist. ... I refuse to obey any command to fight from the ruling class but I will not wait to be commanded to fight for the working class. I am opposed to every war but one; I am for that war with heart and soul and that is the world-wide war of the social revolution. In that war I am prepared to fight in any way the ruling class may make it necessary even to the barricade.

In 1917 Debs enthusiastically welcomed the Bolshevik seizure of power in Petrograd. He wrote an essay published in 1919 defending Soviet Russia and eviscerating the treachery of reformist socialists:

Lenin and Trotsky were the men of the hour and under their fearless incorruptible and uncompromising leadership the Russian proletariat has held the fort against the combined assaults of all the ruling class powers of earth. … In Russia and Germany our valiant comrades are leading the proletarian revolution which knows no race no color no sex and no boundary lines. They are setting the heroic example for worldwide emulation. Let us like them scorn and repudiate the cowardly compromisers within our own ranks challenge and defy the robber-class power and fight it out on that line to victory or death! From the crown of my head to the soles of my feet I am Bolshevik and proud of it.

Debs was charged with violating the Espionage Act in his famous Canton Speech opposing US entry into World War I. (This same reactionary law will serve as the legal basis for any prosecution of another class war prisoner Julian Assange 100 years later.) Debs was convicted a ruling upheld by the US Supreme Court. He was imprisoned at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. At his sentencing Debs delivered perhaps his most famous remarks telling the court:

Your Honor years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then and I say now that while there is a lower class I am in it and while there is a criminal element I am of it and while there is a soul in prison I am not free.

Running for president from behind bars in 1920 Debs won nearly one million votes. Debs was frail and old beyond his years but Wilson disregarded pleas for clemency. Debs’ sentence was commuted in 1921 by Wilson’s successor Warren Harding. But his health had been broken. He died in 1926.

In his 1918 Letter to American Workers Lenin called Debs the “most beloved” leader of the American proletariat. Lenin went on:

I am not surprised that Wilson the head of the American multimillionaires and servant of the capitalist sharks has thrown Debs into prison. Let the bourgeoisie be brutal to the true internationalists to the true representatives of the revolutionary proletariat! The more fierce and brutal they are the nearer the day of the victorious proletarian revolution.

In holding to principle Debs preserved his integrity as a leader of the working class. As for Gompers and the union officials who solidarized themselves with Wilson and the capitalists in World War I they left behind a different set of lessons for today’s workers.

The unions were repaid for their wartime patriotism with the darkest ingratitude. After the war with mobilization over and production falling the US entered a depression in 1920-1921. Employers used the opportunity to launch a far-reaching counteroffensive. Known as “the American Plan” it rolled back all of the gains organized labor had made during World War I. As one rail management journal put it “The swanking and swaggering will shortly be on the wane. Workers will pay more attention to their jobs and less attention to agitators who fill no pay envelopes but fill their followers only with wind.”[18]

The war years had been good for the labor bureaucrats—or so they thought—but less so for workers. For most of the working class wage increases were more than gobbled up by inflation. On top of this railroad workers had worked harder and longer hours to meet ramped-up wartime demand. The combination of workplace stress and low real wages had precipitated a number of wildcat strikes among the railroad workers.

After the war with the railroad corporations cutting back wages again the anger of the shopmen could no longer be contained. But the federal government had also made its preparations. In 1920 Congress passed the Transportation Act which formed the Railroad Labor Board (RLB). The RLB grew out of wartime developments. In 1917 Wilson had put the railroads under federal control for the duration of the war. This “nationalization” marked a further advance in curbing the turmoil of capitalist free market competition a process that had begun with JP Morgan’s monopolization. Like Morgan’s efforts Wilson’s order was no left-wing measure. It preserved private property and guaranteed profits.

Yet is also helped to promote ideas among workers and fears among owners that the rail system could be converted into a publicly held utility. In response to objections from the rail corporations Congress passed a law requiring that the rails revert to private management within 21 months of peace. This was the basis of the RLB. It assumed the role of federal oversight in 1920. Pretending to be a neutral arbiter from the beginning it in fact acted as an overarching branch of railroad management.

In 1921 the RLB handed down a wage cut that affected two million rail workers. The sentiment for a national strike was strong. This was “narrowly avoided after the Big Four operating brotherhoods refused to give the shop crafts (and other non-operating rail workers) any guarantee over joint action” according to labor historian Colin Davis. “Thus at a critical stage as in the past rail union solidarity splintered.”

When the RLB imposed yet another wage cut in 1922 with the economy rebounding the shopmen’s strike could no longer be held back. Some 400000 walked out on July 1 1922.

The government used its broad array of powers to crush the shop unions. It stood idly by while strikebreakers and company detectives attacked and murdered workers in a number of states. And it organized its own repression. This involved governors state legislatures and local police tasked with harassing and arresting workers; the federal state and local courts which delivered restraining orders and injunctions and issued arrest warrants; and the Harding administration which orchestrated the entire anti-labor operation through the RLB. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty sought and received a court injunction that effectively stripped striking workers of the rights of freedom of speech assembly and the press on the specious grounds that the strike was an illegal conspiracy. The courts ruled in favor of the injunction in the first week of September. It was upheld by another ruling on September 11.

The unions had no answer. Meeting as an executive council in Atlantic City the AFL refused any concrete assistance to the rail shopmen. On September 7 the union executives threw out demands coming from the rank-and-file that a general strike be called against the Harding administration’s injunction. The sentiment for a fightback was strong in the working class. The year 1922 had already seen some 650000 coal miners strike and a strike among the anthracite miners ran parallel to the shopmen. Instead the AFL called on its members to agitate for pro-labor legislation.

Even the rail Brotherhoods moved against the strike that they nominally led. B.M. Jewell president of a committee representing myriad different rail shop unions announced on September 11 that there would be no attempt to prevent the separate unions from settling with the different rail firms.

Conclusion

Debs’ life traced three major developments in the history of the American working class. The transformation from craft unions under the railroad Brotherhoods to industrial unionism of the ARU and then from industrial unionism to socialism. Two important lessons can be drawn from this history.

One is that the organizational form of the struggle of railroad workers must correspond to the actually existing industry. It is a maxim that armies cannot win the next war by preparing to fight the last. So too workers cannot win the current struggle by relying on organizational craft union forms and methods rooted in the 19th century.

Nowhere is the trade union straitjacket more crippling than in the rail industry. It is a massive multi-billion-dollar industry that operates over the entire North American continent inextricably bound up with all the world’s transportation production and distribution networks. The railroads are controlled by a handful of powerful corporations and banks. These care nothing for the infrastructure they own let alone the health and safety of workers. To the capitalists the rail network is a piggy bank to be raided for stock buybacks and executive bonuses. And for them it is just one of many such operations. The same stockholders and bankers who dominate the rails exert similar control over all sectors of the economy—and the governments of the US Canada and Mexico.

The union apparatus is more corrupt and pro-capitalist than they have ever been. But even in their better days whenever major confrontations with the rail corporations and the American government took place the various unions either opposed strike action or were peeled off one by one to set up defeat and impose sellout contracts. This history underlines the necessity of the building of rank-and-file committees to link rail workers up across all the unions all the hubs and regions and across borders and to build support in ever-broader sections of the working class.

The second lesson is that railroad workers face not just an industrial fight but a political struggle. The pro-capitalist union bureaucrats like to tell workers to keep politics out of “bread-and-butter” labor struggles. What they mean is socialist politics. But the fact is that unions are political instruments. It is just that theirs are the politics of the ruling class not the workers. The rail unions are attached to the American state through innumerable NGOs think tanks and a veritable alphabet soup of federal and state agencies—the DOT the FRA FRP RSA the NLRB etc.—the very agencies the union executives say they can never challenge. Moreover the unions funnel millions in worker dues to the Democratic Party—the same Democratic Party that acting through the Biden administration is conspiring with the unions to block the rail workers’ strike. And if Biden cannot stop workers from striking by colluding with the unions then the American ruling class will turn to Trump and the fascist right. Regardless it will use its state.

This is not new. Every time a great confrontation has developed between the railroad workers and the corporations the government has intervened against the workers including the Great Railroad Strike of 1877; the Pullman strike of 1894; the national rail strike of 1922; and the strike of 1950 when Democratic President Harry Truman militarized the rail lines.

These lessons demonstrate the need for a political perspective to guide the coming struggles. That perspective is socialism. Workers in all industries and in all countries face the same problems as the rail workers as well as the threats of war fascism pandemic and ecological catastrophe. This objective reality has to be consciously understood and acted upon. And in the final analysis no step forward has ever been taken in the history of the working class without militant socialist-minded rank-and-file workers willing to say out loud to the corporations: “We do not accept your ‘right’ to make profit at the expense of our lives.”

Debs arrived at these conclusions over his whole life which in its own way shadowed the development of the railroad industry and American capitalism. With history as their guide workers today can and will learn these lessons at a much more rapid pace.

Cherruy Sevilla allegedly “yelled exhibited disturbing/uncontrolled behavior and assaulted at least two individuals” during the wild Tuesday ride — one a flight attendant whose right breast he “grabbed and twisted” according to an affidavit filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

He copped to taking the hallucinogen psilocybin often referred to as “magic mushrooms” after FBI agents busted him when the plane landed at Dulles Airport in northern Virginia.

Sevilla who said he had taken the drug before “was not totally surprised that he acted this way after consuming” it authorities said.

The freak out began about one hour into the two-hour flight and ended with him screaming and yelling “incoherent things” while handcuffed the filing said.

Over the course of his chaotic outburst the Miami man allegedly wandered around the plane ran up and down the aisle clapped loudly and grabbed the arm of a female passenger.

He “refused to remain seated” and even laid on the floor at one point the filing said.

When a flight attendant “calmly” asked him to return to his seat he grabbed her breast — prompting other passengers including an on-board law enforcement officer to restrain him authorities said.

The high-as-a-kite traveler spent the rest of the flight screaming obscenities while under the watch of the officer and a flight attendant. He’s due back in court Thursday.

In a media release on Friday the DOH said that it has accelerated its COVID-19 vaccination and booster rollout efforts through the ""PinasLakas"" vaccination drive which was launched on July 26.

As of October 6 at least 45255 senior citizens and 3433713 individuals from the eligible population were vaccinated and boosted respectively.

“The numbers helped improve the country’s vaccination rate for fully vaccinated individuals to 93.81% or 73.3 million Filipinos as of October 6 2022. The number of Filipinos who received their first booster dose also increased to 25.62% of the general population or 20 million individuals” the DOH said.

The PinasLakas campaign initially aimed to administer booster shots to 50% of the country's eligible population within the first 100 days of the Marcos administration.

Earlier the DOH said 19283 PinasLakas sites have been launched all over the country which include areas such as markets schools workplaces terminals places of worship and mobile vaccination sites among others where free safe and effective vaccines are made available.

Likewise the Health department sustained its testing capacity with an average daily demand-driven output of 17788 tests from 350 DOH-licensed COVID-19 testing laboratories as of September 30.

Moreover the DOH said that the support of the local government units (LGUs) and concerned agencies in strengthening the country’s COVID-19 detection control and isolation resulted in the Office of the President’s decision to allow the voluntary wearing of facemasks in outdoor settings on September 12.

COVID-19 benefits compensation

On the otherhand the government has disbursed over P26 billion for the grant of COVID-19 benefits and compensation as of September 30 according to the DOH.

Of the amount over P18 billion was disbursed for the grant of Special Risk Allowance (SRA) Meals Accommodation and Transportation (MAT) benefits Active Hazard Duty Pay (AHDP) and Life Insurance Enrolment under the Bayanihan Laws; P6.64 billion for the provision of Health Emergency Allowance (HEA) formerly known as One COVID-19 Allowance; and P1.56 billion for the payment of COVID-19 Sickness and Death Compensation.

Furthermore the DOH said it has strengthened its Healthcare Provider Networks (HCPN) established during the pandemic by improving the country’s referral system and expanding healthcare access.

The National Patient Navigation and Referral Center catered to 89% of successful referrals within 48 hours from July 1 to September 30 it added.

As for healthcare access at least six specialty centers namely: the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center (BGHMC); Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) for cancer; Mariano Marcos Memorial Hospital and Medical Center (MMMHMC); Batangas Medical Center (BMC); Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC); and SPMC for neonatal services were completed increasing the total number of functional specialty centers in the country to 46.

Meanwhile the DOH said that most hospitals have already achieved 65% to 91% of their completion including specialty centers covering heart lung and kidney.

It also prioritized the completion upgrading repairing and/or equipping of 1661 health facilities including 1034 barangay health stations 323 rural health units four polyclinics 125 LGU hospitals 79 DOH hospitals 15 military hospitals and 88 other health care facilities.

So far the department also deployed at least 29948 human resources for health (HRH) all over the country -- including doctors dentists nurses pharmacists medical technologists nutritionist-dietitians midwives and physical therapists to support various health programs.

Additionally it implemented the Medical Assistance for Indigent Patients Program (MAIPP) which aims to augment any remaining hospital bills of indigent patients after the deduction of PhilHealth coverage and provide them with free medicine and other medical interventions.

As of August 2022 the DOH said it has served 975928 patients using P12.21 billion of the P15.65 billion allotted for the program.

“The DOH will continue to further realize the true meaning of Universal Health Care to continue to serve the Filipinos with the quality health service that they deserve.

BY RONALD ZVENDIYA

A

ccording to World Health Organisation (2010) Universal Health Coverage (UHC) means that all people and communities can use the promotive preventive curative rehabilitative and palliative health services they need of sufficient quality to be effective while also ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship.

This definition of UHC embodies (1) equity in access to health services — everyone who needs services should get them not only those who can pay for them; (2) the quality of health services should be good enough to improve the health of those receiving services; and (3) people should be protected against financial-risk ensuring that the cost of using services does not put people at risk of financial harm.

On 12 December 2012 the United Nations General Assembly endorsed a resolution on Global Health and Foreign Policy urging countries to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage (UHC) — the idea was that everyone everywhere should have access to quality affordable health care as an essential priority for international development.

Furthermore on 25 September 2015 the resolution on Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted the target 3.8 of SDG 3 for achieving Universal Health Coverage by 2030 including financial risk protection access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe effective quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

On December 12 2017 United Nations passed a Global Health and Foreign Policy resolution that focuses on addressing the health of the most vulnerable for an inclusive society.

The resolution calls on the member states to promote and strengthen their dialogue with other stakeholders including civil society academia and the private sector to maximise their engagement and contribution to the implementation of health goals and targets through an inter-sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach.

Key capacity challenges

Service delivery capacity has expanded but not sufficient to meet current and future needs. Health professionals are the most critical input in the delivery of health services.

The shortage of skilled health workers has been a consistent bottleneck to achieving UHC across the continent and is particularly severe in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Access to safe affordable and quality essential medicines remains a challenge.

Common challenges include high prices inadequate financing weak pharmaceutical regulation and inadequate procurement and supply systems. Africa has an increasing circulation of counterfeit and sub-standard medical products due to the weak performance of national regulatory authorities.

Out-of-pocket spending on healthcare by households remains high. The need to strengthen domestic mechanisms for prepaid funding remains a priority for health systems. The role of insurance coverage is critical since social health insurance and other forms of insurance are low.

The risk to the human security of not having sufficient capacity to respond to pandemics has become paramount. There is a need for training in epidemic management in all countries since almost every new type of disease arises periodically.

Lessons from other countries

Lesson 1: UHC is a political process and commitment from the start.

The critical factor that leads to the successful implementation of a policy is genuine and sustained political leadership — often at the head-of-state level. Across different regions political leaders have recognized that by bringing accessible health care to the masses successful UHC reforms are extremely popular and can be a potent political tool to help win and sustain power.

Lesson 2: Engage the private sector to support UHC

Across Africa private health providers deliver the majority of outpatient health services. The challenge for countries moving towards UHC is to find ways to engage the private sector as a way of maximizing access to health services. However there is much more scope to deliver services through a mixture of public and private providers.

Lesson 3: Closing primary health care gaps is a foundation for UHC

Countries wishing to make rapid progress towards UHC should prioritise primary health care. Well-structured efficient primary health services can meet most of the health needs of the population. Without a comprehensive primary health care approach through which proven cost-effective and life-saving services can be made available to all countries will be unable to ensure that services promised by UHC commitments are accessible to citizens.

Lesson 4: Commit more public financing to UHC.

Build and sustain an adequate level of pooled public funds as the predominant financing mechanism for the health system through:

Incremental growth in the allocation of GDP to health. Countries should aim to spend at least 3% of GDP on public expenditure on health and health care.

Increasing revenue from alternative sources (e.g. through additional taxes on some commodities such as alcohol tobacco sugar etc. — the so-called ‘sin’ taxes)

Lesson 5: Align purchasing with benefits to turn promises into results

One particularly promising direction is to create an explicit link between purchasing mechanisms and declared benefits for the population. For example in Kyrgyzstan when an ineffective fee exemption system was replaced in 2001 by a mechanism to pay providers more to treat people in exempt categories there was a dramatic decline in out-of-pocket payments by people in exempt groups

Universal health coverage related capacity issues

Monitoring and evaluation Health sector professionals need to know how to track and analyze the evidence needed to monitor equity. They must also be adept at designing and adapting survey instruments and other means of collecting evidence.

Availability of human capital

The health sector critically needs people with the capacity to generate country-specific evidence on the feasibility sustainability and equity of different financing sources.

Implementation capacity

In Zimbabwe the problem is not policy but implementation capacity. For UHC to bring about desired outcomes countries should be helped to strengthen their ‘how’ to do things practically.

Convening negotiating and consensus-building capacities are needed to harmonize benefit packages and payment methods and to minimize gaps across schemes.

In conclusion the UHC journey for each country is different so there is no one size fits all blueprint. Every country can make progress from its current position. All countries regardless of their economic status can increase domestic revenue for health by improving tax collection and curbing illicit financial flows. Countries should draw on lessons from best practices to shape their journeys making adjustments and adaptations as they build experience. The groundwork for UHC needs to be laid carefully so that service provision can meet health needs irrespective of where the funding comes from. Financial protection through health insurance is the way to go if UHC is to yield results.

Ayushman Bharat: Four years on the scheme continues to broaden horizon and reach

India

oi-Madhuri Adnal

New Delhi Oct 08: India has completed four years of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri-Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) a free health insurance to India's poor and marginalised families and is deemed to be the largest such scheme in the world. Named Pradhan Mantri Jan Ayogya Yojana or Ayushman Bharat the scheme was rolled out in Chhattisgarh on 18 April 2018.

It has continued to broaden its reach and brought in many beneficiaries who have been benefited by it and has also expanded its horizon to include otherwise neglected group like the transgenders into its ambit.

Recently Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a citizen's response to Ayushman Bharat Scheme highlighting the health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakhs for all Indian citizens. The Prime Minister also remarked that the benefits of the scheme can be availed all over India. Quoting a tweet by a citizen the Prime Minister wrote""It absolutely is. The poor and middle class have greatly benefited.""

Yes that is true. The poor and middle class have greatly benefited. https://t.co/A2w90Uy6aU — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 7 2022

Since the launch there has been a remarkable seven-fold increase in PM Modi's flagship Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres between 2018 and 2022. Union Health Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya also noted that so far over 19 crore Ayushman Cards have been created extending its coverage in 33 States and UTs and that more than 25 crore Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) numbers have also been generated highlighting PMJAY beneficiaries as the scheme's most significant stakeholder. This is a significant turning point in the nation's health records digitalization process. In addition he said that the current daily production rate of 4.5 lakh cards would be doubled to 10 lakh Ayushman Cards. In terms of the country's access to healthcare services he further said that PM-JAY has been successful in closing the gap between the rich and the poor.

The minister continued that in the next coming years every community in the nation will be connected via high-speed optical fiber ensuring that everyone has access to connectivity and ongoing healthcare. Additionally the government is creating an effective legislative framework to protect the information of the health beneficiaries.

Ayushman Bharat was launched as recommended by the National Health Policy 2017 to achieve the vision of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). This initiative has been designed to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and its underlining commitment which is to ""leave no one behind.""

Please note CEC Chair David Hochschild Responds to Recent Gasoline Price Spikes.

“As I expressed in my letter to the oil industry last week the recent sudden increases in prices at the pump are unacceptable and place an undue high burden on California families and businesses. Over the course of 10 days oil companies increased gas prices by a record 86 cents per gallon. At the end of August crude oil prices were roughly $100 per barrel and the average gas price in California was $5.06. Now even though the price of oil has decreased to $90 per barrel today the average gas price at the pump has surged to $6.43.

“The oil industry’s lobbying group argued that gas prices increased because of drilling permitting issues which is misleading. The reality is 40% of the oil industry’s approved permits in California are still valid but have not yet been used and the price increase is occurring at the refining stage of gas production not the oil extraction stage. And it does not explain the sudden gap between national and California prices.

“In September 2019 five refineries experienced unplanned maintenance issues and California was faced with several refinery outages. The price spike was a mere 34 cents — a fraction of what Californians have been paying over the past week. Even the 2015 explosion at the ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance caused a price increase of only 46 cents per gallon and the California Department of Justice deemed this price shock to be exacerbated by illegal price-fixing. So refinery maintenance alone — especially prescheduled maintenance — cannot explain a sudden $1.54 increase in what refineries charge for every gallon of gas Californians buy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWFjY3VzZXMtb2lsLWluZHVzdHJ5LXByaWNlLWdvdWdpbmctdmFsZXJvLWhpdHMtYmFja9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWFjY3VzZXMtb2lsLWluZHVzdHJ5LXByaWNlLWdvdWdpbmctdmFsZXJvLWhpdHMtYmFjay5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,California accuses oil industry of price gouging Valero hits back,"Valero hit back at California’s Energy Commission (CEC) last week after the agency demanded oil refinery executives explain why despite declining crude oil prices gas prices have spiked.

""[C]rude oil prices are down and industry profits are up yet gas prices have increased by a record $0.84 per gallon in 10 days in California – a $2.50 difference compared to U.S. prices"" CEC Chair David Hochschild wrote in a Sept. 30 letter to executives. ""This degree of divergence from national prices hasn’t happened before regardless of planned or unplanned refinery maintenance and no explanation has been provided. The oil industry owes Californians answers.""

Hochschild accused the executives of not providing an ""adequate and transparent"" explanation for the price spike. He noted that the industry’s ""lower-than-normal"" stockpiles of gasoline appear to be a contributing factor to a tightening gasoline market that has increased gasoline prices over the prior week.

Hochschild demand that the industry leaders explain why gasoline prices have risen ""despite a sharp downturn in global crude prices no significant unplanned refinery outages in the state and no increases in state taxes or fees.""

YELLEN SAYS OPEC OIL PRODUCTION CUTS BAD FOR GLOBAL ECONOMY

Hochschild asked what the State of California could do to address logistics or other obstacles that have contributed to the price increases. He also demanded that refiners explain why they supposedly allowed inventory levels to drop despite ""for months or in some cases years"" that planned maintenance would occur.

In response Valero’s Vice President State Government Affairs Scott N. Folwarkow denied any allegations of ""price conspiracies"" among oil refineries pointing to a federal judge having thrown out another case finding no basis for them.

Instead Folwarkow said market price was driven by supply and demand coupled with ""government-imposed costs and specifications.""

He noted that Valero has planned maintenance activity but said the company has planned accordingly to meet its contractual obligations to its customers.

BIDEN BLAMES RUSSIA SAUDI ARABIA FOR RISING GAS PRICES TAKES CREDIT FOR RECENT DIP

Folwarkow blamed low inventories on post-COVID’s growing demand and limited supply. He said the higher prices in California than in the rest of the U.S. had to do with the state being the ""most expensive operative environment in the country and (being) a very hostile regulatory environment for refining.""

""California policy markers have knowingly adopted policies with the expressed intent of eliminating the refinery sector"" he said. ""California requires refiners to pay very high carbon cap and trade fees and burdened gasoline with cost of the law carbon fuel standards.""

He argued that the state’s policies have made it difficult to increase refining capacity and have prevented supply projects to lower operating costs of refineries.

FOX Business has reached out to Valero and the CEC for additional comment.

""Adding further costs in the form of new taxes or regulatory constraints will only further strain the fuel market and adversely impact refiners and ultimately those costs will pass to California consumers"" he said.

Gas prices soared across the nation this summer because of high inflation Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain.

But while gas prices have recovered somewhat nationwide they have continued to spike in California hitting an average of $6.39 per gallon on Friday — $2.58 higher than the national average according to AAA.

California has the second-highest gas tax in the country and other environmental rules that increase the cost of fuel in the nation's most populous state. Still Newsom said there is ""nothing to justify"" a price difference of more than $2.50 per gallon between California's gas and prices in other states.

As Valero’s letter was made public Friday California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will call a special session of the state Legislature in December to pass a new tax on oil company profits to punish them for what he called ""rank price gouging.""

It's unclear how the tax Newsom is proposing would work. Newsom said he is still working out the details with legislative leaders but on Friday said he wants the money to be ""returned to taxpayers"" possibly by using money from the tax to pay for more rebates.

El 7 de octubre a las 1 p.m. KST Stray Kids hizo su muy esperado regreso con su nuevo mini-álbum “MAXIDENT” y su canción principal “CASE 143”.

Según Hanteo Chart “MAXIDENT” ya había superado el millón de ventas de álbumes a las 6 p.m. KST esa noche lo que significa que el mini-álbum tardó menos de un día en alcanzar el récord. En comparación al mini-álbum anterior de Stray Kids “ODDINARY” que le tomó más de un mes para llegar a 1 millón de ventas.

Al final del día “MAXIDENT” ya había superado a “ODDINARY” para convertirse en el álbum más vendido de todos los tiempos de Stray Kids. El mini-álbum vendió un impresionante total de 1308971 copias el primer día de su lanzamiento más que cualquier otro álbum de Stray Kids hasta la fecha (según los datos de Hanteo Chart).

En la actualidad Stray Kids es uno de los cuatro únicos artistas en la historia de Hanteo que han logrado superar 1 millón de ventas en el primer día del lanzamiento de un álbum siguiendo a BTS SEVENTEEN y BLACKPINK.

¡Felicitaciones a Stray Kids por su increíble logro!

Así se apunta por tercer mes consecutivo una baja en las ventas minoristas en la comparación interanual. Sin embargo en los primeros nueve meses del año se observa un crecimiento en el comercio minorista del orden del 05% (vs. igual periodo 2021).

En septiembre cinco de los seis rubros relevados vieron reducir sus ventas en la confrontación con 2021. En el balance mensual las ventas de las pequeñas y medianas empresas se retrajeron 14% también con cinco rubros en declive y uno en alza.

Así surge del Índice de Ventas Minoristas Pymes de la Confederación Argentina de la Mediana Empresa (CAME) elaborado en base a su relevamiento mensual entre 1.207 comercios del país realizado entre el 3 y 5 de octubre de 2022.





Análisis por rubro

El sector de Farmacia y Perfumería con una suba de 81% interanual en sus ventas fue el único que registró un incremento en el mes de septiembre. El resto de los ramos se retrajeron con la mayor caída contabilizada por Textil e Indumentaria (-17%).

1) Alimentos y Bebidas. Las ventas disminuyeron 1% anual y 36% mensual a valores constantes. Los negocios consultados coincidieron que el mes estuvo marcado por una inflación creciente y una merma en la demanda respecto a meses anteriores. Los comerciantes comentaron dificultades para reponer mercaderías subas de precios semanales y acumulación de deudas con proveedores como las principales problemáticas del mes.

“Los aumentos en los precios y las manifestaciones en la vía pública afectaron mucho nuestras ventas del mes” relató el copropietario de un almacén localizado en la ciudad de Córdoba.

“La inflación nos está ahogando vendimos mucho pero no vemos la diferencia en las ganancias” dijo la dueña de un local de comidas de Tinogasta en Catamarca.

2) Bazar decoración textiles para el hogar y muebles. El desplome fue del 51% anual en septiembre y 3% en la comparación mensual a valores constantes. Fue otro mes en baja para las pymes del rubro que ubicaron al incremento del costo financiero del último mes al faltante de productos y sobre todo los aumentos de precios en cada entrega de mercadería como la justificación de este comportamiento de las ventas.

“No podemos seguir vendiendo así los costos de las tarjetas subieron y nos mató” resumió la dueña de un negocio de Godoy Cruz en Mendoza.

“Nos fue bien en ventas porque mantuvimos todos los precios pero nos fue pésimo en rentabilidad” expresó el propietario de un negocio en Castelar Provincia de Buenos Aires.

3) Calzado y marroquinería. Las ventas del sector se retrajeron 105% anual y 57% mensual en septiembre siempre medidas a valores constantes. La mayoría de los comercios consultados llevaron adelante acciones para levantar la venta: reformas en los locales incorporación de nuevos segmentos de productos liquidaciones anticipadas fueron algunas de las estrategias para despertar el interés de un público poco entusiasmado aunque la evolución de los precios desanimó al consumidor.

“Septiembre fue particularmente malo estamos muy preocupados. Hicimos cambios de vidrieras liquidaciones rebajas pero no repuntan las ventas” relató un empresario de CABA.

“Estamos invirtiendo todo en stock de la nueva temporada primavera-verano estamos reformando el local solo esperamos que sirva para repuntar” manifestó la dueña de un local de la ciudad de Salta.

4) Farmacia y perfumería. En este rubro hubo un aumento del 81% anual y 51% mensual. Además es el único sector que contabiliza registros positivos desde hace 4 meses en forma consecutiva. Algunas farmacias informaron retrasos de pagos de las obras sociales situación que no caracteriza la evolución de este mes en particular dado que tiene un tiempo sin resolverse aún.

“Crecimos en septiembre por una buena política comercial de descuentos y la incorporación de diversidad de mercadería” señaló el gerente de una farmacia de la ciudad de Mendoza.

“Antes se trabajaba más constante todo el mes y ahora se nota la baja a partir de la segunda quincena” contó la propietaria de una farmacia y perfumería de Mar del Plata en la provincia de Buenos Aires.

5) Ferretería materiales eléctricos y materiales de la construcción. La actividad minorista retrocedió 06% anual en septiembre a valores constantes y 1% en la comparación intermensual. Si bien este mes fue más estable los incrementos de precios continuaron pero con menos frecuencia y en porcentajes más reducidos de lo registrado durante los meses de julio y agosto pasado. La situación relevada resulta bastante dispar entre comercios y productos. Si bien septiembre suele ser un mes de baja actividad pinturas y elementos para refacciones registraron mejores números que aquellos relevados por los materiales eléctricos.

“Mejoraron las ventas pero estamos en niveles muy bajos sosteniendo el negocio abierto esperando que se recupere el consumo” dijeron desde un comerciante de San Miguel de Tucumán.

“Este mes incorporamos promociones y decidimos achicar nuestros márgenes de ganancias para sostener las ventas” comentó la propietaria de una casa de luminarias de la ciudad de Salta.

6) Textil e indumentaria. Las ventas minoristas se derrumbaron 17% anual en septiembre y 13% en la comparación mensual. Fue el rubro de mayor retracción en el índice minorista de CAME y es el quinto mes consecutivo en que sus indicadores caen. Además en septiembre se registra el declive más importante del año. Las tiendas se están manejando con subas de precios interanuales por encima del 100% lo que describe porqué la demanda se retrae tanto. Algunos comerciantes mostraron preocupación creciente por una tríada de elementos que se retroalimentan y que explican esta evolución: el aumento de la informalidad la evolución de la venta online y la suba de precios. Aun así las expectativas para octubre noviembre y diciembre son alentadoras por el Día de la Madre el Mundial y las fiestas.

“Se nota la disminución del poder adquisitivo ingresan clientes con menor poder de compra y se venden productos más baratos” dijo el dueño de un comercio de la ciudad de Santiago del Estero.

“El año pasado a esta altura del año nos iba mejor hay una contracción desde hace meses que no logra mejorar estamos 15% debajo de 2021 en cantidades. Esperamos que en octubre y durante las fiestas repunte” se lamentó la dueña de un local en CABA

Amazon lo está comprobando con una de sus grandes aspiraciones el envío automatizado de paquetes a través de robots autónomos capaces de eliminar a los repartidores de la ecuación agilizar procesos y ganar eficiencia. Aunque apunta ya a finales de este año para el impulso del servicio en EEUU su división con drones Prime Air acumula retraso y una inversión milmillonaria que ha puesto a prueba incluso la paciencia de sus directivos.

La cosa no va mucho mejor con su principal iniciativa para el reparto autónomo por tierra. Los de Seattle acaban de anunciar que aparcan el proyecto del robot de entrega Scout.

Scout a la cochera. Eso es básicamente lo que acaba de anunciar Amazon. Como avanza Bloomberg la multinacional ha decidido cancelar las pruebas con su robot de entrega a domicilio Scout y reubicar al equipo técnico que lo impulsaba. En el proyecto trabajaban más de 400 personas a nivel mundial. Que dé un paso atrás con Scout no significa eso sí que arroje la toalla. Bloomberg asegura que mantendrá un equipo mínimo centrado en las posibilidades de un robot autónomo.

¿Qué es exactamente eso de Scout? El sueño de Amazon de repartir paquetes a domicilio con pequeños robots autónomos similares a neveras portátiles dotadas de ruedas. Tras una primera fase la multinacional empezó a experimentar con el dispositivo en aceras de áreas suburbanas de Seatlle en 2019 y más tarde planteó expandirlas al sur de California Georgia y Tennessee.

La idea era que la máquina se moviese por pequeños vecindarios llegase a un domicilio con su carga y se abriese para que el cliente pudiera retirarla todo mediante un mecanismo con baterías que señalaba la firma reduciría las emisiones contaminantes. En 2019 la compañía llegó a anunciar que habría media docena de Scout cubriendo entregas en el condado de Snohomish Washington.

¿Y por qué da un paso atrás ahora? Los de Seattle alegan una simple cuestión de aprendizaje. Sencillamente Scout no parecía estar apuntando en la dirección adecuada. “Durante nuestra prueba limitada para Scout trabajamos para desarrollar una experiencia de entrega única pero aprendimos a través de los comentarios que había aspectos del programa que no satisfacían las necesidades de los clientes” señala un portavoz de Amazon a The Register: “Como resultado estamos finalizando nuestras pruebas de campo y reorientando el programa”. La compañía no va más allá pero hay quien apunta a una cuestión de logística o la competencia del servicio postal en EEUU.

El contexto clave. El anuncio de que Scout echa el freno llega sin embargo en un escenario muy concreto para el sector del comercio electrónico —y por supuesto la propia Amazon— marcado por la desaceleración en el crecimiento de las ventas. Tras el boom del ecommerce que marcó el inicio de la crisis sanitaria el escenario post-pandemia se está dejando sentir en el sector.

Hace días The Objective publicaba que durante el primer semestre del año Amazon redujo alrededor de un 35% sus ventas de comercio electrónico en España descenso que habría sido especialmente acusado a lo largo del primer trimestre. No es la única información que apunta en esa dirección. El escenario que dejan el fin de los confinamientos y restricciones a la movilidad que dieron alas en su día al sector del ecommerce también estaría llevando a la multinacional a buscar estrategias para adaptar su potente músculo logístico una decisión que afecta también a España.

El reflejo en Scout. Aunque también recoge las declaraciones de Amazon sobre las pruebas de campo Bloomberg vincula la cancelación del proyecto con el complejo contexto económico. La decisión abunda sería un movimiento para adaptarse a la desaceleración en el crecimiento de las ventas. En septiembre la consultora MWPVL International apuntaba que la empresa ha cancelado o retrasado sus planes para abrir decenas de almacenes repartidos por Estados Unidos.

El reto de los repartos autónomos. Lo cierto es que Scout no es el primer intento de Amazon de poner en marcha el reparto de paquetes con robots autónomos. Tampoco el único que le ha dado dolores de cabeza. El gigante del ecommerce anunció en 2013 sus planes de realizar entregas con drones algo que entonces veía factible en un horizonte de solo cinco años. Casi una década después el balance del bautizado como Prime Air queda lejos de aquel optimismo inicial.

Pese a los años de pruebas y la más que considerable inversión que le ha dedicado a lo largo de todo este tiempo Amazon —más de 2.000 millones de dólares— la compañía todavía no ha logrado implantar de forma generalizada el servicio. El sistema presentaría ventajas relevantes pero también obliga a hacer frente a un reto de calado: la seguridad de sus operaciones en áreas habitadas.

Ir más allá de las pruebas piloto. Este verano Amazon aseguraba que a finales de 2022 quiere implantar el servicio en Lockeford California y expandirlo por College Station Texas. A mediados de agosto la compañía incidía en sus planes para ambas localidades que responden en cualquier caso a un perfil de pequeña o mediana población con menos de 150.000 habitantes.

Su objetivo es en cualquier caso claro: ir de una vez por todas más allá de las pruebas piloto y experimentales a las que ha limitado hasta ahora. Amazon no es la única que trabaja en cualquier caso en esa dirección. El delivery con robots ha atraído también a firmas como Walmart Alphabet o UPS. También a Alibaba que ya está probando su flota de robots con un concepto similar a Scout.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vY2FzdGVsbG9ucGxhemEuY29tL2FwZS1ncnVwby1lc3BlcmEtcm9uZGFyLWxvcy03MC1taWxsb25lcy1lbi12ZW50YXMtZXN0ZS1hbm8tcGVzZS1hLWxhLWNhaWRhLWRlLXBlZGlkb3MtYWN0dWFs0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly9jYXN0ZWxsb25wbGF6YS5jb20vYXBlLWdydXBvLWVzcGVyYS1yb25kYXItbG9zLTcwLW1pbGxvbmVzLWVuLXZlbnRhcy1lc3RlLWFuby1wZXNlLWEtbGEtY2FpZGEtZGUtcGVkaWRvcy1hY3R1YWw_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,APE Grupo espera rondar los 70 millones en ventas este año pese a la caída de pedidos actual,"8/10/2022 -

Así el CEO de la firma castellonense apunta que ""a partir de agosto y septiembre la cartera de pedidos ha bajado de forma importante"". Este es un problema que ya ha dado la puntilla a un par de compañías  la última Azulejera Alcorense que se ha conocido este viernes . Pero en APE consideran que podrán transitar por esta crisis sin llevar a cabo ningún expediente de regulación de empleo ni siquiera temporal señala Pellicer.

Así en el presente ejercicio la principal comercializadora de cerámica de Europa (la firma no fabrica producto) incrementará en aproximadamente un 20% su facturación ""récord"" del año pasado que fue de 58 millones de euros tras crecer ya un 30% . Tras el excelente arranque de año las previsiones apuntaban a un crecimiento mayor y el presupuesto de la firma se había fijado los 71 millones en ventas para este 2022 reconoce Pellicer pero la crisis del gas también le pasa factura pese a no ser fabricante.

CASTELLÓ. APE Grupo prevé cerrar el año con unos ""68 o 69"" millones de euros de facturación pese a la caída evidente de pedidos que el sector azulejero vive en la actualidad. Su consejero delegado José Miguel Pellicer  así lo ha señalado este viernes en la presentación a los medios de la ampliación del showroom de la compañía que suma 1.000 metros cuadrados en sus instalaciones de Castelló.

De hecho en los 30 años de historia de la compañía que nació en 1992 ""las crisis nos han venido bien"". En la anterior a la actual la de 2008 ""en dos años doblamos el tamaño de la empresa"" recuerda su principal responsable. En todos estos años la firma no ha dejado de crecer pero ha sido en el último lustro cuando ha pisado el acelerador: si en 2017 en su 25 aniversario cerraba el año con una cifra de negocio de 40 millones de euros ahora prevé rondar un 75% más.

6 millones de inversión este año

Todo ello lo ha logrado acompañado de inversiones que suele acometer en buena parte con fondos propios. Así este año ha aportado 6 millones de euros para ampliar el centro logístico en Onda que ya alcanza 105.000 metros cuadrados de superficie. Asimismo cuenta con otro más modesto en Fiorano Modenese (Italia) con 14.000 m2. Además ""a finales de este año"" prevé inaugurar su nueva delegación en Dubai (Emiratos Árabes) asegura Pellicer. La compañía ya cuenta con oficinas en Perth (Australia) Béziers (Francia) Dublín (Irlanda) y Burgas (Bulgaria).

En total para la firma trabajan 150 personas: 60 en Castelló 90 en Onda y 4 en Italia. De todas ellas ""40 las hemos incorporado durante la pandemia"" remarca el CEO de la firma azulejera.

El mercado nacional gana peso

A través de sus cuatro marcas APE Xlining Carmen e Ilbagno la firma exporta actualmente a más de 125 países en los cinco continentes. Pero al contrario de lo que ocurría en sus inicios cuando nació enfocada en el exterior el mercado nacional se ha convertido en su principal nicho de negocio. Actualmente cuenta con una cuota ""de un 16 o 17%"" y tiene la intención de seguir creciendo en él. De cara al futuro la compañía pretende incidir en los grandes formatos agrupados bajo la marca Xlining un producto que hasta hace poco no trabajaba.

En cuanto a la ampliación del showroom diseñada por IdearIdeas destaca el espacio Gravity un cubo suspendido en el aire que mediante una proyección 270º ""genera una experiencia inmersiva que crea un paralelismo entre la biodiversidad y la forma en la que APE Grupo entiende la cerámica una materia viva que tiene la capacidad de adaptarse al medio"" ha remarcado Pellicer en la presentación. Asimismo la firma ha construido en sus instalaciones un graderío con capacidad para 70 personas con una pantalla de cuatro metros para presentaciones a lo que hay que sumar una zona de cocina con la idea de realizar demostraciones culinarias y otra de restaurante."

To be eligible you'll need to trade in an old device and pick up a Pixel 7 on an unlimited data plan. Both upgraders and new customers can take part in this deal but the latter will get a free $200 gift card on the house as a special welcome bonus. In case you were wondering - yes that's in addition to any trade-in savings.

If you'd prefer the more premium Google Pixel 7 Pro then that's also available with the same maximum trade-in rebate of up to $700 off with an unlimited data plan. Considering this device costs $899 outright this saving isn't quite enough to cover the entire cost of the device but it is enough to cut those monthly device payments down significantly (down to just $5.55/mo over 36 months).

Note both devices are also available with the carrier's 'buy-one get-one-free' promo; a deal that will score you a whopping $700 off a second device when you purchase the first outright. As with the trade-in deal you'll need an unlimited data plan to be eligible here (on both devices) but it's open to both new and existing customers.

One minor caveat to bear in mind with these Verizon Pixel 7 deals is that you can't both trade in and get a multi-line saving at the same time. You've got to essentially pick one deal at a time. If you're torn we'd recommend the trade-in for the single-line user and the BOGO for multi-line setups as a very basic rule of thumb.

Note that this week's Google Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro deals are technically preorders and the devices will be released (and delivered) on Thursday October 13th.

Verizon Google Pixel 7 deals this weekend

Google Pixel 7: BOGO or get up to $700 off with a trade-in and unlimited plan at Verizon

Either trade-in to get a device for free or take advantage of the carrier's buy-one-get-one promo with this week's Google Pixel 7 deals at Verizon. Both these excellent promotions are open to both new and existing customers and the former will even get a $200 gift card as a welcome bonus. Note as with all the best Verizon deals both these promotions are eligible with unlimited data lines only.

Google Pixel 7 Pro: BOGO or get up to $700 off with a trade-in and unlimited plan at Verizon

Alternatively if you'd prefer a more premium device then you can find those same excellent Pixel 7 preorder deals on the Pixel 7 Pro model. Either trade-in for a massive rebate of up to $700 on a single device or get a whopping $700 off a second device when you purchase the first outright with an unlimited data line. Note the $200 gift card for new customers is also available with this particular model.

What's new with the Google Pixel 7?

(Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)

On the surface not a lot has changed with the Pixel 7 - it features the same basic design and display as the previous Pixel 6 with a few tweaks here and there. What has changed however is the internal chip and camera setup.

Both the Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro come with the Tensor 2 chip which is the second iteration of the brand's own silicon. While it's a little more sluggish than the competition (namely the A16 Bionic in the iPhone 14) it's focused on improving the Pixel 6's strong suit of computational photography and machine learning. In short it's looking to make the latest devices even better in areas where Pixel devices traditionally shine.

It's not just the brains inside the Pixel 7 that's been improved either. The cameras have also received a boost when it comes to zoom and image stabilization which should make them even easier to use. While we haven't gotten our hands on these devices yet (well enough to truly put them through their paces) they're highly likely to be some of the best camera phones on the market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC9uZXdzL2dldC1zYW1zdW5nLWdhbGF4eS16LWZsaXAtNC1mb3ItZnJlZS1vbi12ZXJpem9uLXNhdmUtdXAtdG8tMTAwMC03MTY2NTE3MDU5MDYxOS5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9nZXQtc2Ftc3VuZy1nYWxheHktei1mbGlwLTQtZm9yLWZyZWUtb24tdmVyaXpvbi1zYXZlLXVwLXRvLTEwMDAtNzE2NjUxNzA1OTA2MTkuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 for FREE on Verizon!

The company added a bunch of Google Assistant features and touted new photography tricks like the unblurring of old photos.

It's clear Google put a lot of work into its latest flagship phone. What's less clear is whether anyone will care.

In a world dominated by iPhones and Samsung phones Google isn't a contender. Since the first Pixel launched in 2016 the entire series has sold 27.6 million units according to data by analyst firm IDC -- a number that's one-tenth of the 272 million phones Samsung shipped in 2021 alone. Apple's no slouch having shipped 235 million phones in the same period.

The Pixel has long been a paradox of the mobile handset business. The family is the standard bearer for Android the most popular mobile operating system in the world bankrolled by one of the most successful and well-known companies. Yet it lags far behind its biggest rivals and is a niche player in a world that it essentially controls.

It's a bit baffling for Google's phones to sell so poorly since the Pixel phones have been well-liked by reviewers and consumers (at least the ones who've heard of them). Moreover they're the first phones to get new features and versions of Android months or even years before other phones.

A set of decisions and strategic moves have put Google in this position something the company is trying to dig itself out of. Its fall Made by Google event typically is a cornucopia of different products from smart speakers to security cameras. Thursday's event was solely focused on the Pixel name.

But here are some of the reasons why Google is playing catch-up now.

Lack of access

It seemed to make sense for Google to tie itself to Verizon as exclusive partners when it first launched the original Pixel. After all an exclusive partnership between Google Motorola and Verizon to push the original Droid helped catapult Android into the mainstream.

But that exclusivity meant fewer people could buy the phone in the US a strategic misfire with long-term implications. Consumers had been able to buy Apple and Samsung phones from any carrier for years before Google released its first Pixel handset in 2016 so it didn't help that Google's first three years of Pixel phones were exclusive to Verizon limiting the brand's reach to customers who were already choosing between iPhones and Galaxy phones.

That limited reach has kept Pixels far from consumers' minds as the field of phone brands has dwindled. Even without competition from LG which stopped selling phones in 2021 and brands like Xiaomi that sell high-value Android phones in China but not in the US Pixels are far less known than iPhones and Samsung Galaxy handsets.

""Despite Pixel getting rave reviews Google's biggest challenge in gaining share has been poorer marketing spend and presence with carriers both areas that are currently dominated by Apple and Samsung"" said Nabila Popal a research director at IDC.

Pixels aren't the only phones to be locked to a single carrier -- Motorola had followed up its lucrative exclusive deal for the Droid with many follow-up devices. But times had changed and when Google finally opened up its phones to other carriers with the Pixel 4 in 2019 it had to play catch-up with other carriers and consumers.

Lagging hardware

By then iPhones and Samsung flagships had entrenched themselves in the public consciousness as devices that pushed the limits of both software and hardware with powerful chipsets and lots of camera lenses. Google's phones focused on just software with mediocre tech specs and cameras famously keeping the same primary camera sensor from the Pixel 2 through the Pixel 5.

Despite improving the photo software every year to compensate Google's phones still got a reputation for lagging behind other top phones in hardware. Pixel phones appealed only to enthusiasts rather than general consumers because of this software-intensive approach with a purer version of Android that didn't have the modified overlays in Samsung or Motorola phones.

Google course-corrected by including improved cameras and its new in-house Tensor chipset in last year's Pixel 6 phones and has even better hardware in the new Pixel 7 phones. With a triple-rear camera (found in the Pixel 7 Pro) and bespoke silicon Google's pivot has led to fun and innovative camera-focused features like scrubbing unwanted bystanders out of your photos and helping blind and low-vision users take selfies.

Identity crisis

Google however still doesn't have a strong identity for its phones that sets them apart from iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy handsets. For years enthusiasts and members of the media have been the loudest proponents of Pixels calling them good camera phones but even Google doesn't quite know what its phones do best. For instance the company described its Pixel 6 handsets as ""the phone for you"" citing customization features that actually came to all phones that got Android 12.

Moreover the company seems split on whether its Pixels offer serious value or push the limit as flagships. While the Pixel 7 has most of the bells and whistles of its pricier Pro sibling for a more midrange $600 starting price the Pixel 7 Pro rivals Samsung and Apple flagships at a $900 starting price -- but without their name recognition in phones.

""Part of Google's challenge is that smartphones are a mature market and consumers are -- understandably! -- happy with Samsung and Apple"" said Avi Greengart analyst at Techsponential.

Unseating Samsung may not be Google's goal Greengart explained since doing so could destabilize Android. Both phones use the same operating system so Samsung's continued dominance of the phone market is still a win for Google. So long as Pixel phones sell well enough to be profitable Google will probably keep making them.

The US market is the most promising for Pixel sales. Without cheap Android phones from Xiaomi and others and with LG out of the phones game Pixels have grown to 2% of the North American market in the second quarter of 2022 up from 1% in the same period in 2021. That's a paltry amount compared with Apple which owns 52% of the market or even Samsung which has just over a quarter of the US market.

""Pixel is still not a household brand like Galaxy"" said Anthony Scarsella analyst at IDC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpbG90b25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzA5L2JlYWNoLWJ1enotaGlnaC1zY2hvb2xlcnMtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1qZXdlbHJ5LWJ1c2luZXNzLXNob3dzLWl0cy1ub3QtYWxsLWFib3V0LWdyYWRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beach Buzz: High schooler's successful jewelry business shows it's not all about grades,Letters for May 10: America is great and it didn’t get that way because of ‘racism xenophobia or misogyny’

October 9 2022

By: Niki Kapsambelis

To see Anita Abu Bakar from the outside was to see the picture of confidence: a self-described extrovert she was surrounded by friends a onetime school leader who grew into a woman who loved her work as an investment banker in her native Malaysia. She was happily married and the mother of two small children.

But to see her from that angle was to get only half the picture.

Inside she spent years struggling with her mental health starting in her childhood. As an adult she would be diagnosed with a panic disorder and mild to moderate depression. But growing up she didn’t quite understand what was happening so she lived with the dichotomy between her two worlds – the happy exterior and the painful interior – for years.

Until one day she couldn’t.

Nine years ago the struggle finally caught up with her – and caught her off guard.

“I lost functionality in life. I could no longer work. I couldn’t take care of my kids. I couldn’t function as a normal human being” Anita recalled. “And that really hit me hard because everything became beyond my control.”

She fell into what she described as “a deep and dark hole.” The psychological pain was excruciating. She felt as though her brain was trying to kill her and she – the capable woman so many people admired – had no idea where to turn. She could not understand what was happening to her.

Anita’s experience echoes a worldwide trend. According to the World Health Organization in 2019 one in every eight people or 970 million people worldwide were living with a mental disorder with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most common. Since 2019 rates of these conditions increased by 25% in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. (For additional information on the global burden of mental health disorders visit our report Creating an Integrated Approach to Noncommunicable Diseases on page 19.)

Yet despite their growing prevalence the stigma of mental health disorders persists. Anita cited stigma as a factor in her own crisis: “You feel really ashamed. You feel very embarrassed with what you’re going through and there was a lot of fear attached to it.” (Anita shared additional thoughts on the role of stigma in mental health in Viatris’ Listen Well podcast.)

It was her gynecologist a trusted health care provider for 10 years in whom Anita finally confided.

“The first thing I said to her was ‘I’m not crazy’” Anita recalled. “And then she said ‘Of course you’re not.”

The doctor also told Anita there was a 99% chance she would recover – a statement that created hope in a time of fear and confusion.

The gynecologist’s compassion and reassurance were fundamental to Anita’s eventual recovery. She referred Anita to a psychiatrist and because Anita believed she could return to a functional and fulfilling life she was better able to participate in that journey.

Today Anita is an internationally recognized advocate for mental health and social issues. She is the founder and president of the Mental Illness Awareness & Support Association (MIASA) which champions the recovery model and human rights-based approach to addressing mental health.

In her work she encourages health care providers to discuss stigma and its accompanying fear with their patients to empower them as they begin to recover.

“For me it’s always about working together in that process in that journey and it improves recovery outcome tremendously if that (conversation) happens from the very beginning” she noted.

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised awareness about mental health struggles but Anita worries that the momentum is fading even though more people struggle now than ever before due to factors such as isolation financial uncertainties and loss of jobs and loved ones. She pointed out that the World Health Organization has highlighted an urgent need worldwide to transform access to mental health care.

Training primary care providers in effective coping mechanisms and strategies as well as offering mental health screens at primary care sites could go a long way toward helping people who are struggling she noted.

Likewise reducing stigma and providing peer support are critical to helping people recover Anita said. MIASA’s programming offers an array of peer-led support activities a process that creates hope.

“For me and for the millions of people that are struggling that’s what they need: they need hope” she said. “And they need you to trust them that you can recover and thrive in this journey and that is indeed for me the most powerful thing.”

The WVU Innovation Corporation will provide 1.2 million square feet of space for various organizations. The pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment is still in the building and former employees of Viatris and its predecessor Mylan Pharmaceuticals will maintain the facility.

“Twelve individuals who are passionate about this facility and worked for Mylan some of the 15 to 20 years” said Stacey Armstrong the president of the WVU Innovation Corporation. “They are our boots on the ground to make sure the facility is well maintained.”

Mylan Pharmaceuticals used the site through 2020 as the merger between the company and Upjohn Business was being finalized.

“The way it was developed over time — adding sections on over the years — the way Mylan and then Viatris did it really sets it up nicely to be able to section it off into different components” Armstrong said.

Officials are reviewing the companies interested in moving into the space. Some businesses may need sterile areas while other groups may need large offices or climate-controlled areas.

“We want to be thoughtful about who we bring in and how they partner with us and how they can work with one another” Armstrong said. “You don’t get an opportunity very often to have a very big open finished well-cleaned well-maintained space and get to figure out proactively how to fill it up.”

Hope Gas — the new entity created with the Hearthstone Energy purchase of Dominion Energy gas assets — will open their headquarters in the space. South Korea-based insulin producer UNDBIO considered the facility but it will instead build a new facility in Morgantown.",,,,,,,,,

A bench of five judges led by Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu said MasterCard Asia Pacific PTE and the bank lobby have an identifiable stake in the matter as they will be directly affected by the outcome of the case.

Absa moved to the apex court arguing that the payments made to Visa International Services Association Mastercard Inc and American Express Ltd did not constitute royalty and KRA had no basis for demanding withholding tax.

Mastercard argues that the imposition of withholding taxes on the interchange and transaction fees as management and the professional fee will impact the use of its payment solutions in Kenya. “The applicant therefore stands to be prejudiced and its joinder is thus necessary” the court said. Mastercard says it has a direct interest in the case as the orders to be issued by the court will affect its engagement with Absa and all the other banks in its network.

The firm’s executive vice president in charge of customer delivery in the Asia Pacific region Shafi Shaikh said it will provide the court with an understanding of the nature of the MasterCard service and interchange fees.

He said the petition is a matter of public interest as it will impact the uptake and popularity of the use of debit and credit cards as modes of payment in Kenya. The court heard that the firm is a leading global payment solution provider through the MasterCard network that facilitates the processing of card payments throughout the world.

He said the interchange fees earned by Absa and other banks within its network act as an incentive to utilise the global payment system for transactions on debit and credit cards issued to cardholders and for customers to join the network. KRA demanded withholding tax on payments in 2012 from Absa saying the interchange fees were royalty and those to the other banks were for professional or management services.

The arrangement with the card companies enables Absa to issue its customers with credit debit and pre-paid cards which the customers use to pay for services and goods purchased from contracted retail outlets. In turn the lender has entered into agreements with the outlets to accept payments through the cards.

The demand prompted Absa to challenge the KRA’s move arguing that it was illegal and unreasonable. It was quashed by the courts in 2015 but KRA appealed and the decision was overturned.

KRA says the bank was obliged to pay withholding tax arising from its relationship and dealings with the credit card companies.

KBA said it has a direct interest in the petition being the body bringing together banking institutions licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya.",,,,,,

Rap star Nicki Minaj‘s influence has just reached collegiate status!

According to reports the University of California Berkley will be offering a college eduction course next semester studying the hip-hop giant’s cultural influence. The course named “Nicki Minaj: The Black Barbie Femmecee & Hip Hop Feminisms” will reportedly

“encourage students to think about how Minaj’s impact on the hip-hop music industry connects to the broader historical-social structures and hip-hop feminisms”.

Nicki Minaj 39 subsequently expressed interest in attending the year long course.

After a Minaj “Barb” account made the musician aware of the course the “Do We Have A Problem” artist immediately expressed interest in attending. Responding to the announcement she wrote:

“I’d love to stop by”

Subsequent the college professor who developed and will teach the curriculum chimed in with more details about the course. She wrote:

“i’m so excited to be teaching AAS 140.2: “Nicki Minaj: The Black Barbie Femmecee & Hip Hop Feminisms” this spr 2023 @ uc berkeley. we would be hella happy & honored for u to stop by!”

And continued:

“this class is interested in thinking critically about u and ur productions w/in the context of broader historical-social structures & hip hop feminisms. so having yo personal insights would be AMAZING! i’m finalizing things this fall & would love to talk more details w/ u via DM?”

Minaj has certainly made her mark in the music industry. With over 100 million records sold she holds the title of best selling female rapper of all time. The Trinidadian musician has released 4 studio albums and amassed over 30 billion Youtube views alone. Additionally Minaj is on the list of top 20 most followed celebs with 202 million on Instagram and another 26.5 million on Twitter.

The ten time grammy nominated rapper has won over 300 of the 580 musical nominations she’s received.

It’s still hard to believe that the beloved CBS show ended three years ago . Believe it or not there were actually three surprising actresses vying for the sitcom's lead role before Kaley Cuoco came into the picture.

It’s hard to imagine what a long-running TV show would be like without a particular actress. The Hollywood Reporter shared a sneak peek of untold stories that are featured in Jessica Radloff’s novel The Big Bang Theory: The Definitive Inside Story of the Epic Hit Series that said Penny was originally very different from what we know her to be now. While her original name was going to be Penny they decided to change it to Katie as there was initially a character named Penny in another CBS pilot. And instead of Katie having a Midwestern bubbly personality she was more down on her luck and off-putting. When 20-year-old Kaley Cuoco first auditioned for The Big Bang Theory co-creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady were taken with her but the optimistic energy she brought out wasn’t what they were looking for in Katie and thought she was too young for the part.

In the very early days My Cousin Vinny’s Marisa Tomei auditioned with Jim Parsons. Then came American Pie’s Tara Reid and Saved by the Bell’s Elizabeth Berkley auditioning for the role that Prady described as ""terrific."" Canadian actress Amanda Walsh who was known for the short-lived ABC dramedy Sons & Daughters also auditioned for Katie. In the end none of them made the cut the first time around.

The first actress that they cast for the role of Katie ended up being She’s All That’s Jodi Lyn O’Keefe. During the table read Parsons thought that O’Keefe nailed what was written. But the creators felt that the female lead's interaction with the other characters was too harsh and dark. This led to O’Keefe being fired after that table read to the shock of Galecki and Parsons which meant The Big Bang Theory creators had three days to recast.

While Amanda Walsh didn't make it for round one she was brought back again for round two where she was told she got the part after auditioning again. A little behind-the-scenes fact about The Big Bang Theory to share is that the show was originally going to have two female leads - tough Katie and scientist Gilda who had a secret crush on Leonard and actually had sex with Sheldon at a Star Trek convention. The original Big Bang Theory pilot was considered “just a mess” because the creators were still failing to understand the characters they created. If a woman was going to enter Sheldon and Leonard’s life it had to be someone who was “gentle” with them because of how vulnerable the male characters were. So the original first draft of the female lead ""Penny"" resurfaced Gilda was scrapped and Kaley Cuoco replaced Walsh.

Marisa Tomei Elizabeth Berkley and Tara Reid may not have been the next “Penny” but their careers took them in a number of different directions that led them to success. Tomei would end up playing Aunt May in the MCU's Spider-Man trilogy Reid would be in the Sharknado movies that helped change her career and Berkley came back to the iconic role of Jessie Spano in Peacock's Saved by the Bell reboot which lasted two seasons. Kaley Cuoco brought out a likable quality in Penny who evolved over the years from a cute “girl next door” type of woman to someone who never had any problems calling out her awkward scientist friends for their stuff too.

This article was published 07/10/2022 (580 days ago) so information in it may no longer be current.

Do not despair if you have not caught a trophy walleye this year. That’s because some of the biggest walleye on the planet live right outside our back door. In the next month and a half the odds turn in your favour as the nomadic walleye of Lake Winnipeg return to the Red River up to Lockport.

Doug Watkinson is a biologist with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. For the last six years he has been involved in a program detailing fish movement in Lake Winnipeg. His incredibly important work has helped unlock the puzzle of walleye movement on the big lake and its tributaries.

Doug says it looks like more than 80 per cent of the walleye in Lake Winnipeg spawn in the Red River. What surprised him the most is that only five percent of his radio tracked walleye returned to the Red River in the fall time.

Don Lamont / Winnipeg Free Press Angler Jim Price with a Master Angler walleye caught last fall.

There are a lot of variables that determine how many walleye will return in the fall and at what time. These include water temperature current flow water clarity and the amount of available forage in the river.

Last fall the walleye did not show up in any numbers until the middle of October. When they did it provided some of the most spectacular fishing in a long time. Friend Jim Price and I headed out on the river on November 5 on a warm sunny late fall day.

After launching at Selkirk Park we headed up river toward Lockport and some of the best walleye water on the planet. I must mention that to pay for the boat launch at Selkirk Park you must go online to do so. The website is https://campground.myselkirk.ca/product/boat-launch-parking-permit-daily/

This was our first time on the river that fall so it was probably going to take us a bit to figure out where the action was. I thought I would start with a trolling run by the Selkirk golf course. This would allow us to cover water and see what we could find on the depth finder. Over the years the silver Canadian Wiggler accounted for more walleye over ten pounds than almost any other presentation. While we didn’t have Canadian Wigglers on we had on our favourites the Berkley Flicker Shad and Flicker Minnow.

After 20 minutes without a hit we reeled up and headed down to Lower Fort Garry and the Miracle Mile.

My front troll motor a MinnKota Terrova has a feature called SpotLock. With this amazing technology your troll motor will hold you in one spot by using the GPS feature. This saves time and effort of dropping an anchor especially one that weighs 40 pounds.

We positioned our boat on a ledge in 10 feet of water. With a ton of baitfish showing on my Helix 10 depth finder I figured we should get some good action. After a half hour with nonstop sauger action I hooked into a good walleye that managed to shake the hook. That was a good sign because it meant to me that there were some big fish in the area.

We decided to switch tactics to try and cover a bit more water so we started a drift with jigs. The current was surprisingly strong on this day and it made us float down stream at a perfect speed. This really picked up the action and Jim hooked into a big walleye almost immediately. A short time later ten pounds of beauty ended up in the bottom of my net. The gorgeous greenback measured out at an even 28 inches before being released.

As the day went on we alternated between drifting with jigs and trolling crankbaits. I often get the question about trolling direction either up current or down? I almost always try both and let the fish tell me what they want. When trolling downstream your lure will dive faster because of less water resistance so sometimes that can help. On this day we caught all our walleye going into the current. Trolling speed averaged 1.8 mph a good speed with the water temperature at 39.4 Fahrenheit.

We used 1/4 jigs rigged with soft plastic. I used a Berkley Max Scent flat nose minnow as well as a couple different kinds of swimbaits. Jim caught his fish on a white Ripple Shad. Both were equally effective.

We had frozen shiners along but given the number of sauger in the system it would have been a waste.

WBA,Walgreens Boots Alliance,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEwLzA5LzItcmVhc29ucy10by1idXktd2FsZ3JlZW5zLXN0b2NrLWFuZC0yLXJlYXNvbnMtdG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Reasons to Buy Walgreens Stock and 2 Reasons to Sell,"If you want income you're in the right spot but if you want growth you might want to look elsewhere.

Whether you're a dividend investor or just someone looking for a safe harbor in uncertain economic times Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 0.26%) has a lot to offer. The company is an important provider of healthcare throughout the U.S. and the U.K. offers a solid payout and boasts a sturdy business built on its collection of over 9000 retail pharmacies.

But it might not be the right investment for you especially if you're interested in growth. Let's break down the reasons why you might want to buy Walgreens as well as the characteristics of the stock that might make it a less-than-ideal investment for you.

Reason to buy: Its dividend is sustainable and growing

The biggest reason to buy Walgreens' stock is for its stable passive-income potential. As a pharmacy the company's business model isn't going to change much over time and it's unlikely that consumers will suddenly stop needing to patronize its stores. After all people are going to keep needing to get their prescriptions filled and they'll probably keep picking up an additional item or two at the store when they go to grab their medicines each month.

Therefore so long as the company remains profitable and its earnings are growing -- both of which it hasn't had any problem with in the past decade -- it's reasonable to assume that the conditions are ripe for it to keep paying out its dividend year after year.

Walgreens' forward dividend yield is in excess of 5.9% significantly higher than the roughly 2.2% yield of CVS Health another U.S. pharmacy retail chain and one of its major competitors. Furthermore in the past five years Walgreens has raised its payout by 20% and its payout ratio is a comfortable 32%. That means management has plenty of leeway to keep hiking the dividend without the outflow using up a major part of the earnings.

Reason to buy: Its consumer health segment is coming online

Another reason to buy Walgreens stock is that the business is starting a major new growth initiative. While Walgreens is known for its pharmacies it's also diversifying into providing primary care quick care and advisory services via its Walgreens Health segment at its in-store clinics. Though those efforts are still in their infancy they're already taking off. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022 the company's 315 operating clinics brought in $596 million in revenue.

In total management expects Walgreens Health to generate around $2 billion this fiscal year. It plans to keep opening new clinics at its stores as well as stand-alone sites. In the long term continuing to scale up its health offerings will ensure that the business keeps up with similar initiatives by competitors like CVS not to mention driving top-line (and eventually bottom-line) growth.

Reason to sell: Initiatives won't greatly boost the top line

For a gargantuan business with a massive base of revenue it will be nearly impossible to expand quickly given that demand for the products and services in its major segments won't be rising very much over time. In 2021 its total revenue was more than $132 billion. If we tack on the $2 billion in anticipated fresh sales from Walgreens Health the top line will expand by only 1.5%.

There's nothing wrong with buying shares of slow-growing businesses. But if you're holding this stock with the expectation that the inflows from clinics will drive substantial revenue gains you may want to consider finding a growth stock instead.

Reason to sell: Shares will probably still underperform

As retail pharmacies aren't exactly a hot sector of the economy nor have they been there's little in the way of hope for Walgreens' ability to outperform the market. Over the past five years the stock lost more than 47% as measured by total return whereas an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust gained about 60%.

Simply put Walgreens' earnings are likely going to keep growing more slowly than the average company and that means its shares will probably keep underperforming. Of course that isn't much of an impediment for shareholders who are holding the stock for its dividend.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy wrote about being dispatched to the store on Forest Hill Boulevard in Greenacres late on Friday Sept. 16 ""in reference to a shoplifting in progress.""

According to the arrest report a store employee said he was watching video surveillance and saw Joel Rico “place several items inside his backpack.”

It also said the employee “is familiar with Rico. He is a known shoplifter and has been known to flee and become violent with law enforcement officials.”

See Also:

This deputy didn't have to face Rico or even catch him.



The report said other deputies got there and arrested Rico “as he passed all points of sale. Several items which Rico failed to pay for were recovered from his backpack (total $71.15).”

But that wasn’t all.

“Incident to arrest two clear oval-shaped pills containing gray substance [sic] were recovered” the report said. “Substance field tested positive for meth. Additionally two crack cocaine rocks were recovered which were field tested positive for cocaine. Additionally a clear glass pipe containing burnt residue was discovered on his person.

Joel Rico 33 was charged with two counts of cocaine possession and one count each of possession of drug paraphernalia and larceny.

He was booked on Sept. 17 at 1:50 a.m. and is being held at the Main Detention Center without bond.

See also:

That was actually Rico’s third arrest in Palm Beach County in the past year.



On May 17 another arrest in Greenacres was also for drugs. The state attorney’s office did not file charges but Rico spent almost a week in jail.

And on Jan. 4 he was arrested in three different cases and stayed in jail until May 11. He wasn’t free for a week before his next arrest.

In addition to staying hydrated and planning breaks you can also review which Disney World rides are pregnancy friendly — and which ones are not. If you’re going to visit Disney World while pregnant you might want to review which rides you have to take off your to-do list.

Disney World Rides That Are Not Pregnancy Safe

In general the rule of thumb for pregnancy and Disney World rides is height restrictions. Any ride with a height restriction (of any height) is not recommended for pregnant people and you’ll see signs notifying guests of these restrictions outside the entrance of these rides. If you see “expectant mothers should not ride” on any ride sign you know that it’s not considered safe.

The reasons these rides are considered unsafe are due to factors like speed rapid starts and stops and pressures and forces the body may experience. The full list of Disney World rides that are not safe for pregnant riders is listed below:

Avatar Flight of Passage

Barnstormer

Big Thunder Mountain Railroad

DINOSAUR

Expedition Everest – Legend of the Forbidden Mountain

Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind

Kali River Rapids

Kilimanjaro Safaris

Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run

Mission: SPACE

Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster (Closed for refurbishment)

Seven Dwarfs Mine Train

Slinky Dog Dash

Space Mountain

Star Tours – The Adventures Continue

Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance

Test Track

Tiana’s Bayou Adventure (Coming in 2024; must be 40 inches or taller)

Tomorrowland Speedway

The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror

Pregnancy Safe Rides

So are there any safe rides? The short answer is yes!! Any ride without a height restriction is typically considered safe which means tons of classic Disney rides like Dumbo the Flying Elephant “it’s a small world” and Peter Pan’s Flight are not restricted.

Shows parades and character meet-and-greets are also safe options! Basically there are plenty of things you can do while visiting Disney World pregnant but you have to cross thrill rides off your list.

Note that it might be a good idea to speak with your doctor or midwife to find out if you should avoid any specific movements (drops and spins for example). The rides below include short drops but are technically not restricted so you may want to consider your personal limitations.

Digitally Removes Black Adam Movie Crewman From New BTS Photo,"Amidst the controversy and uncertainty surrounding Warner Bros. Discovery the next chapter of whatever the DCEU is was or will be arrives on October 21 with Black Adam.

Starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson Black Adam is an anti-hero film that follows Teth-Adam's return to the modern world where he stands in stark contrast to the universe's other heroes particularly the Justice Society of America.

Throughout the film's promotional campaign Johnson has been front and center in building the hype for Black Adam.

And now it appears that Warner Bros. has been particularly painstakingly in its promotion of Black Adam as well.

Warner Bros. Scrubs Black Adam Crewman from Set Photo

Reddit user u/BatmanNewsChris has pointed out that Warner Bros. digitally removed a Black Adam crew member from a behind-the-scenes photo featuring Dwayne Johnson and director Jaume Collet-Serra.

Deadline

In the photo which was first shown in June of this year a crewman wearing a white shirt glasses and a black facial covering can be seen just over Collet-Serra's shoulder.

However when the photo was used in July for a Deadline article the crewman had disappeared.

The Direct

This isn't the first time a studio has digitally scrubbed a crew member who was mistakenly included in a shot.

During Season 2 of The Mandalorian a crewmember wearing a t-shirt and jeans was spotted in an action scene.

The Direct

After viewers made note of the mistake the individual was later removed from the shot.

A similar situation occurred twice throughout the run of Moon Knight on Disney+.

The Direct

Why Did Black Adam's Crewman Get Erased?

While both Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios have digitally erased mistakes from their streaming shows doing the same for a photo is different especially since it was taken behind the scenes where a crewmember should be.

Even though the photo's use for marketing is probably why the individual was removed it still seems a bit unnecessary and excessive especially since the crewman's presence didn't take away from the focus of the photo.

The fact that this decision was made however may be another example of how important Black Adam is to the studio.

After all Dwayne Johnson is one of the industry's most influential stars and knows how to deliver at the box office.

And given the year Warner Bros. has had thus far there's no denying that the studio needs a win.

It's also worth noting that the change in the photo took place between June and July. Not only was that mere weeks after the Discovery merger but also around the time of San Diego Comic-Con and the peak of the Ezra Miller controversy.

It will be interesting to see how Warner Bros. handles the final marketing push for Black Adam ahead of its theatrical debut and if its pursuit of perfection pays off.

Discovery is not letting go of The Flash movie and the latest reshoot news is another example of the studio sticking to its guns.

The Wrap reports Ezra Miller shot a day of pickups last week for The Flash. Pickups are another term for a reshoot or additional photography usually involving small relatively minor shots.

This marks Miller’s first work day with Warner Bros following months of strange and disturbing behavior which have even resulted in arrests and police involvement. They have been charged with burglary in Vermont and involved in various legal issues across Hawaii Massachusetts and North Dakota.

“Miller and their agent met with Warner Bros.’ film heads back in August” claims The Wrap in a new piece. The publication says the meeting was “very positive” about the future of DC’s The Flash. It seems like the studio is also making the right moves since The Wrap notes that an insider with knowledge of the project says “the film has been testing positively.”

No matter the trouble Miller and Warner Bros. Discovery are determined to launch this Flash movie. It’s reported The Flash is being treated as a way to restart the DCEU timeline.

In the film the titular character will travel across the multiverse encountering other versions of himself and a version of Supergirl from an alternate timeline. We shall even see Michael Keaton as Batman after his appearance in The Batgirl was scrapped and the entire film canned.

The Flash stars Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash alongside his Zack Snyder’s Justice League co-stars Ben Affleck (Batman) and Kiersey Clemons (Iris West) with Andy Muschietti (It) directing. The Flash will see Michael Keaton making his return as Batman along with Ron Livingston (Office Space) as Henry Allen Maribel Verdu (Pan’s Labyrinth) as Nora Allen and Sasha Calle (The Young and the Restless) as Supergirl. Michael Shannon and Antje Traue are also expected to reprise their Man of Steel roles as General Zod and Faora-Ul.

The Flash is set for release on June 23rd 2023."

In South Korea another champion of the circular economy a garbage inspector may fossick through your refuse and fine you if you put the wrong thing in the wrong bag.

In Kamikatsu on the Japanese island of Shikoku villagers sort their household waste into 45 categories (bottle caps are sorted by colour bottles that held soy sauce or cooking oil are separated from PET drinking bottles and so on).

Nowhere in Australia has taken recycling to anything like those lengths but last month Victoria announced that all residents would get a fourth purple wheelie bin for recyclable glass creating the nation’s first uniform statewide program. Elsewhere local governments have created a patchwork system where the rules change at council borders.

Is this a meaningful step towards a more effective recycling system or will it be another well-intentioned initiative that does little to reverse Australia’s poor history of waste management?

Home advantage

Australia has a series of 2025 recycling targets: 100% of packaging being reusable recyclable or compostable; 70% of plastic packaging being recycled or composted; 50% of average recycled content included in packaging; and the phase-out of problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic packaging.

But there’s no agreed way to get there.

One part of the recycling dilemma is that it works better when items are separated early in the process but that means bin collection arrangements get ever more complicated and households are expected to do more of the sorting work.

Will technology one day allow households to chuck everything in one bag and let the robots sort it out?

Suzanne Toumbourou chief executive officer of the Australian Council of Recycling is sceptical.

“It would be nice. I think it would probably be unlikely at least in the near future to have a facility that sorts everything” she says.

“Everyone has a role to play.”

Until then we have a hodge-podge of kerbside recycling options and the waste that is collected streams through to facilities that have various ways of filtering heating screening and sorting into different streams. Some facilities can detect different types of metal glass plastic and paper directing materials down different pathways.

But it still all starts in the home.

There is no global gold standard but four-bin systems dominate some of the most successful recycling countries. A scan of the top countries shows Victoria’s planned system is common. Glass is separated as are food or garden organics. Then there are the other recyclables (paper cardboard and some plastics) and then a bin for everything else.

In some countries that system is augmented by pricing plans. People get charged by the kilo for whatever they’re dumping.

Necessity was the mother of invention for many countries that excel at recycling Trevor Thornton says.

The Deakin University hazard materials management lecturer says some of the best performers – such as Germany and South Korea – just didn’t have the space for landfill “so they’ve had to do something about it”.

Australia with its sweeping plains has had a delayed reckoning with its rubbish.

It’s about everyone doing their bit along the whole chain Lily D'Ambrosio

Victoria’s environment minister Lily D’Ambrosio says she knew something was “terribly amiss” when kerbside waste collection suffered a “significant collapse”.

In 2018 China stopped accepting 99% of the world’s recycling. Australia’s reliance on shipping its rubbish offshore was exposed as untenable and councils had to start stockpiling as they worked on a new solution.

“A lot of reforms were needed to get a system in Victoria that people could rely on” D’Ambrosio says. “People in one part of the state had a whole set of rules but you only had to move to another municipality to find different rules.”

D’Ambrosio says the lack of consistency made it difficult to change people’s behaviours around recycling and “led to a lot of confusion”.

Fast forward to October 2022 when the government began the rollout of the system first announced in 2020.

It’s best practice in Australia to have the four bins D’Ambrosio says particularly to separate out glass.

“I heard very loud and clear from industry that glass put in the same bin as paper cardboard and plastics contaminated everything that went into that bin” she says. The splinters not only render other materials useless but interfere with machinery.

Toumbourou agrees that households’ work is critical.

“Separation at source is a really important part of great recycling outcomes” she says.

“The cleanest stream you’re going to get of recycling material is when it is separated at source – and the source is householders.”

Starting a virtuous cycle

A good circular economy starts with product design Toumbourou says. It’s better to have “monolayers” containers with just one type of plastic for example. Once you have more products that are easier to recycle it’s down to consumers to “choose wisely and dispose of wisely”.

Successful countries invest in education better pathways for recycling and innovative ways to turn waste into useful products. In many cases they convert waste to energy a fledgling idea in Australia.

Thornton says there needs to be more focus on creating less waste in the first place as well as efficient recycling. There’s a danger he says that the availability of recycling makes people complacent about consuming too much while thinking the waste will all be put back to use.

Reduce reuse recycle goes the mantra. But the simplicity belies the complicated economics behind a circular economy. Companies that collect kerbside waste and companies that turn it into something new and useful both need to be economically viable. That means they need a critical mass of products to be recycled and a market to buy whatever those materials are recycled into.

D’Ambrosio says local councils obviously want to find a lower price for both collection and recycling “no matter the outcome”.

“But at the end of the day cheap prices led to the collapse of our system. We never want to go back there.”

If the streams coming out of households are cleaner it’s more attractive to companies to set up facilities to receive them.

“It’s about everyone doing their bit along the whole chain” D’Ambrosio says. “Do we really need to load up our fridges with all that food knowing we’ll throw it out? Be careful about your own consumption. Match it to what your need is and you’ll have less materials.”

Innovations around Australia are making a difference at the margins.

In Adelaide some public bins now come with external shelving for bottles and cans that attract a 10c container deposit so that “community collectors” don’t have to rummage through rubbish to get them.

There are local programs such as Curby where households can collect targeted materials such as soft plastics and coffee pods in a special bag scan a QR code before they put it in their recycling bins and follow it as it’s separated from other waste.

Work continues on enduring problems such as recycling solar panels.

As Australia strives for a true circular economy and the ideal of zero waste recycling will likely get more complicated. More wheelie bins more innovation more options. Toumbourou says robots and artificial intelligence will make recycling smarter but households will have to keep doing their bit by sorting their own waste.

“One bin to rule them all? Probably not” she says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3JlbGllZndlYi5pbnQvcmVwb3J0L3NvbWFsaWEvaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1vcHBvcnR1bml0aWVzLXNvbGlkLXdhc3RlLWRpc3Bvc2FsLWh1bWFuaXRhcmlhbi1zZXR0aW5ncy1leHBsb3JhdGlvbi1wcm9ibGVtcy1pZGVudGlmeS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLW9wcG9ydHVuaXRpZXMtdWdhbmRhLWFuZC1zb21hbGlh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Innovation Opportunities in Solid Waste Disposal in Humanitarian Settings: An exploration of problems to identify ...,"THIS REPORT EXPLORES THE PROBLEM OF SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL IN TWO HUMANITARIAN SETTINGS TO IDENTIFY INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES USING A NEW METHODOLOGY.

Our 2021 Gaps in WASH in Humanitarian Response: 2021 Update -- Elrha reveals the most pressing WASH challenges facing communities affected by crises worldwide. This gap analysis is informed by the most comprehensive global WASH data collection of its kind. It included more than 1700 people affected by crisis sharing their views and experiences along with almost 700 in-country WASH practitioners. This process identified over 6000 gaps in WASH humanitarian response. Further analysis identified the four key gaps most mentioned by respondents -- need for water supply and provision need for sanitation access and coverage weak hygiene practices and knowledge and improper solid waste disposal.

The purpose of Innovation Opportunities in Solid Waste Disposal in Humanitarian Settings report is to explore how innovation may help address the challenge of improper solid waste disposal. Recognising that this is a broad gap the research team developed a 6-step methodology for exploring problems to identify innovation opportunities. Access to a healthy sustainable environment has been recognised as a universal right. And yet neglect and failures in solid waste management (SWM) are common and repeated; hence there is a need to search for solutions through innovation.

The research team explored the problem of improper solid waste disposal in two settings -- Rwamwanja Refugee Settlement Uganda and Doolow Internally Displaced Person (IDP) Camp Somalia. The report outlines the problems causes and impacts of poor solid waste disposal in these settings and five innovation opportunities that could contribute to improving the situation. For each of these five broad opportunities more specific examples of how innovators or innovation funders could leverage the opportunity are provided:

Build a zero-waste vision for humanitarian settings Safe and accessible disposal sites Sustainable collaboration models for humanitarian agencies and local authorities Support potential entrepreneurs to turn waste into a resource Identify and reduce high-impact waste resources

""Access to a healthy sustainable environment has been recognised as a universal right. And yet neglect and failures in solid waste management are common and repeated; hence there is a need to search for solutions through innovation.""

In creating this report specific problems within solid waste disposal and management have been identified that the innovation opportunities highlighted could address. There is potential to build on this work in several ways:

The methodology developed to identify innovation opportunities could be implemented in other settings WASH gaps and challenges

The problems explored could contribute to wider sectoral efforts to map problems within the SWM gap

Innovation funders could open up identified opportunities to support further innovation in the SWM space by launching funding calls that ask innovators to respond to the challenges identified

Innovators in humanitarian settings with similar problem patterns to the two contexts explored in this report could use this information to identify potential targets for innovation in their contexts that would benefit from their time attention skills and resources

To this end the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) has put together a holistic National Strategy for the Environment (NSE) 2050 which has recently been launched for public consultation. The NSE’s goals range from better air quality zero waste and flourishing seas to thriving biodiversity; its aim is to ambitiously enable Malta to reach these goals by 2050. The NSE builds on eight strategic goals that tackle traditional environmental facets whilst focusing on key environmental challenges and provides a plan to enable the transformative changes that are required. The Strategy makes it clear that all stakeholders including the general public must work collectively to pull the same rope to secure a better tomorrow for future generations and achieve the eight main goals:"

The spotlight will be focusing on the women however as both the Raw and SmackDown women's titles will be on the line in a ladder match and traditional Extreme Rules bout respectively.

Liv Morgan is set to put the SmackDown women's championship on the line against Ronda Rousey in an Extreme Rules match meaning there are no rules and the match can only be won by pinfall or submission. Meanwhile Bianca Belair will defend the Raw women's title against Damage CTRL leader Bayley in a ladder match.

Let's take a closer look at who our CBS Sports experts predict will come out on top at WWE Extreme Rules which begins Saturday at 8 p.m. ET from Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia and streams live on Peacock.

2022 WWE Extreme Rules predictions

SmackDown Women's Championship -- Liv Morgan (c) vs. Ronda Rousey (Extreme Rules Match)

The pairing of Morgan and Rousey has been extremely difficult for WWE to navigate. Despite this reality WWE has gone back to the well yet again. Morgan's match with Sonya Deville showed she has the ability to ""get extreme"" but the Rousey/Morgan dynamic revolves around Rousey's physical dominance. That dominance led to a bizarre SummerSlam match where Rousey ""won"" as Morgan tapped out to an armbar -- after a match in which Rousey dominated every second -- but the referee instead counted Rousey's shoulders down to allow Morgan to retain her title. The lack of rules should allow Morgan to fight back without having to go truly blow-for-blow. This feels like an excuse to let Morgan get a clean win and move past Rousey though WWE deciding to just give the belt back to Rousey is in play as well. Pick: Liv Morgan retains the title -- Brent Brookhouse

I would have expected a longer run for Morgan after her monumental cash-in at Money in the Bank. Unfortunately the fan response to her subsequent reign has been less than stellar. Props for WWE for trying to give her an edge but she has yet to recover her momentum in the aftermath of SummerSlam. It's time to hand the strap to anti-hero Rousey and give Morgan another title shot down the line. Pick: Ronda Rousey wins the title -- Shakiel Mahjouri

Raw Women's Championship -- Bianca Belair (c) vs. Bayley (Ladder Match)

Belair is a massive talent and her title reign has not been mishandled. That said she's running out of viable opponents while Bayley and Damage CTRL have been red hot since returning to the main roster. WWE seems very interested in strong factions at the moment and adding the Raw title to the tag belts make Damage CTRL the women's locker room's version of The Bloodline. That's a good reason for Bayley to go over here. Pick: Bayley wins the title -- Brookhouse

There is nothing wrong with giving Bayley the title and Damage CTRL dominion over the women's roster. The problem is a dominant faction already exists. The Bloodline has controlled the lion's share of titles for a long time now and replicating the same experience on the women's side feels redundant. Damage CTRL has enough longterm potential to delay Bayley's inevitable title win. Let Belair roll with it for a while longer. Pick: Bianca Belair retains the title -- Mahjouri

Matt Riddle vs. Seth Rollins (Fight Pit Match)

While Rollins has basically dominated the rivalry it seems a given Riddle will get his win at some point. Placing the match in the ""Fight Pit"" and allowing Riddle's MMA background to take control gives them the easiest chance to do so. Daniel Cormier as the special guest referee doesn't seem like it's something that would lead to any real shenanigans but could lead to a set up for a Brock Lesnar match. Riddle should just win a fun scrap here. Pick: Matt Riddle wins -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)

Edge vs. Finn Balor (""I Quit"" Match)

Balor is another superstar who should receive better treatment in a creative environment led by Triple H. He was a made man in NXT and was pegged for big things prior to an injury early into his main roster run. The Judgement Day is desperate for momentum and the group already lost to Edge and Rey Mysterio at Clash at the Castle. Balor should emerge victorious through some devious means of coercing a resignation from Edge. Pick: Finn Balor wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)

Karrion Kross vs. Drew McIntyre (Strap Match)

WWE has done a brilliant job of portraying Kross as a genuine threat since he and Scarlet made their surprise debuts in August. Kross needs this win more than McIntyre does. It's an opportunity to implant a fresh face into a main event scene that is slowly healing under Triple H's supervision. If WWE were going to pull the trigger on McIntyre they would have done so at Clash at the Castle. Expect Kross to have his hand raised in a hard-hitting match. Pick: Karrion Kross wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)

The Brawling Brutes vs. Imperium (Good Old Fashioned Donnybrook Match)

There's nothing wrong with a wild clash between two groups of brawlers. Sheamus and Gunther have already created magic together and now they battle with their teams backing them up. Imperium could stand to continue to build some momentum as they don't have a leader who is as established as bulletproof like Sheamus. They should get the win here. Pick: Imperium wins -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdqZXJzZXlzdGFnZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZ2V0YXJ0aWNsZTIucGhwP3RpdGxlbGluaz1wb3N0LW1hbG9uZXMtc3RlbGxhci1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1hbi1leHRyYWN0aW9uLW9mLWxvdmUtaW4tcGhpbGx50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Post Malone's Stellar Performance: An Extraction of Love in Philly,"By Jennifer Petrics

originally published: 10/08/2022

﻿

Post Malone in support of his fourth studio album Twelve Carat Toothache continued his “Twelve Carat Tour” #TCT in Philadelphia at the Wells Fargo Center Thursday October 6 with supporting act Roddy Ricch. Both artists offered an explosive supercharged performance. With a tetralogy of chart-topping hits spanning over only 6 years (ranging from White Iverson to I Like You…) Post gave it his all with a passion set into overdrive and musically leaving nothing behind. It was a night of celebration love and community… and we’re absolutely here for it!

DJ Zak Bia opened the show with a dance party extravaganza spinning tracks that got everybody pumped followed by lyrical heavy-hitter Roddy Ricch whose array of hits catapulted him to fame such as the Grammy-winning record Racks in the Middle as well as High Fashion Ballin’ The Box and (the Ricch and Post collaboration) Cooped Up.

In the City of Brotherly Love Post shared a powerful sentiment: If you see someone that looks like they need a hug please hug them because you never know what that might do to a person. Even at the end of the show he expressed gratitude God’s love and energy and all of the love his fans have given him while emphasizing the importance of everyone’s own truth and individuality. Above the music Post places people and the compassion he has for them first… and always has since the beginning… which is only one of the reasons why he’s loved by millions of fans. And his connection with them is unmatched.

In a class of genre-defying rock rap pop etc Post’s performance was comparable to a heavyweight fight in music throwing all of the punches and just slaying and dominating the stage with a fierce energy which is perfect for a Rocky reference since the beloved fictional fighter from Philly had brought so much love and heart to his city. Going by a famous quote in the movie which said “Life’s not about how hard of a hit you can give… it’s about how many you can take and still keep moving forward.” And this is universally true! When Post got injured at one of his shows just weeks ago he got right back up like a high-powered machine. After dark times we faced collectively in recent years especially we are powering through and thriving on the strength of the human spirit.

While many other artists’ live shows are comprised largely of glitz and glamour such as dancers wardrobe changes and special effects Post is a standalone artist real and raw: a powerhouse of his own. While he can (and has) pull(ed) off a full band performance (Budlight Tours/Sessions) he really doesn’t need it. Likewise while there was a full production of smoke pyro fireworks and out-of-this-world lighting (including color-changing flames) which intensified the concert experience that all pales in comparison to his stellar performance. If you didn’t feel alive and electrically charged during this concert check your pulse! Because Post really delivered and brought us a pulse-pounding show—one in which we felt a palpable good energy pulsing in our hearts for the whole damn set!

The amount of love showered down on this incredible artist is unreal. Honestly my senses were blown at how extraordinary of a performance it was amplified by an unfiltered compassion and outpouring of love that flowed through us all. He STAYED after the show to greet fans and sign autographs… ON STAGE! And this is a huge artist who doesn’t need to put in the extra time but he does and has remained super humble from day one. Unconventionally Post didn’t disappear in the shadows before an encore; instead he made the encore seamless within the set list laying everything out openly (and in doing so baring his soul). After the show people were chanting and screaming his name all the way down the halls and out the venue. As people were walking outside the doors to the parking lots you could hear their adoration echoing throughout the whole arena’s interior. I’ve never seen anything like it!

Again it was obvious Post was swelling with gratitude throughout the show. I think he’s reached an apex of balance and harmony within himself despite all of his trials in getting there. I believe he’s found a sense of inner peace and happiness which he’s discussed in an interview with Zane Lowe. And what he’s taken in he channels out directly to his fans and brings other artists (his friends) along for the ride. It’s all about sharing the love. The most powerful moment was THE HUG that Post gave Ricch… it moved me in such a way that I welled up inside and was hit by the intensity of it… of just pure radiating kindness. It induced a joyous chain-reaction of people hugging in the audience which was positively beautiful.

This intense outpouring of emotion is precisely what the album’s complexities allude to for the 9-time Grammy-nominated artist which is a stark look at one’s internal struggles and vulnerability: managing to find the unkind and ugly parts within ourselves and transmuting that energy into love. The interesting thing about that is that the same brain circuitry is said to be involved in all extreme emotions which is why love and hate (Love/Hate Letter to Alcohol) are at times interlinked. It’s our job to focus that energy (and all its chaotic insane parts) into a place of mindfulness serenity gratitude and well-being. And that begins with self-love and the caring and appreciation for others. It’s where Philadelphia got its name: the root words of philos (beloved) and adelphos (brother).

Finally what was cool afterwards was that the popular Philadelphia hip hop station Q102 kept playing Post’s songs throughout the night following the show as if to celebrate him in their city. Even the Philly stations love Post! The full set list for The Wells Fargo Center can be found here. If fans were lucky enough they got to experience the World Pong League (VIP) Lounge or one of the Don Londres Tequila After Parties. Because you know that any party-related atmosphere surrounding Post Malone is replete with love and synonymous with great energy! Catch Post on the road for the remaining dates of the Twelve Carat Tour… and party with the ultimate rockstar!

A health department team arrives at the Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd unit in Sonepat. (PTI)(HT_PRINT)

Haryana drug authorities meanwhile issued a show cause notice to the Delhi-based company with manufacturing unit in Sonepat district after deficiencies and inadequacies were discovered during a recent joint inspection by DCGI and state drug regulator. The notice was issued under Section 85(2) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules pertaining to cancellation and suspension of licence officials familiar with the development said.

Maiden Pharmaceuticals’ director Vivek Goyal in a statement issued on Saturday said the company has been in the business for over three decades and their products are not sold in domestic market. The company said it has the requisite export approvals for the products that have come under the scanner of drug authorities.

“We are shocked to hear the media reports regarding the deaths and deeply saddened on this incident but we received the official information from our agent in (The) Gambia on October 5 and on the subsequent date the WHO alert was issued against us” read the statement.

“Government agencies visited our factory on October 1 October 3 October 6 and October 7 and samples were drawn by the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation) along with all relevant documents in question in the presence of our directors” it added.

On October 5 WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that four cough and cold syrups — Promethazine Oral Solution Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup — manufactured and exported by Maiden Pharmaceuticals were suspected to have caused the death of 66 children in The Gambia.

“The substandard products referenced in this alert are unsafe and their use especially in children may result in serious injury or death” the WHO alert said.

Tedros told reporters that they were investigating with Indian drug regulators and the company.

A day later the Union health ministry said that four of the 23 samples tested by the WHO were contaminated with diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol. According to health experts diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol can be toxic to health and can trigger symptoms such as abdominal pain vomiting diarrhoea headache hallucinations and acute kidney injury.

“Controlled samples of the same batch manufactured by Maiden Pharmaceuticals Limited for all the four drugs in question have been taken and sent for testing to Regional Drug Testing Lab Chandigarh by CDSCO the results of which will guide further course of action as well as bring clarity on the inputs received from WHO” the health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.

An official familiar with the development said the company has been in the news earlier also because of the substandard quality of its drugs. “In 2005 a drugs inspector from Kerala filed a prosecution against the company for which in 2017 a judicial first-class magistrate court in Kerala fined it; it was one of the 39 companies blacklisted by Vietnam for violation of quality control regulation and drug regulation; the Bihar government also black-listed it in 2011 for substandard drugs etc. That’s the track record” the official claimed.

Since the WHO alert the pharma firm has refrained from making any statement. HT has earlier reported that the company’s corporate office in northwest Delhi’s Pitampura has been shut since Thursday.

“Samples have been drawn by the CDSCO officials and we are awaiting results. Since the matter is already pending investigation we cannot comment on any other issue...” the company said.

In an exclusive interview with India Today public health activists T Prashant Reddy and Dinesh Thakur said the primary responsibility lies with the licensing authority which is the state regulatory authority in our current framework.

But in the case of the present incident in The Gambia they said since the Drugs Controller General of India was issuing a COPP (Certificate of Pharmaceutical product) even the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation) bears responsibility. ""How was it not aware of the company's track record while certifying its products? What is the basis on which CDSCO issues a CoPP?"" they asked.

The experts said there is plenty of blame to pass along especially in the higher echelons of the Ministry of Health. ""The drug regulation section of the ministry is aware of these problems but has done little to remedy the situation. The buck ultimately should stop with the top leadership of the Ministry"" they said.

Thakur is the whistleblower who exposed dangerous practices in the generic drug industry in 2013. He has co-authored a book titled 'The Truth Pill' along with Prashant Reddy.

Maiden Pharmaceuticals whose four syrups have been found to be of substandard quality has a manufacturing plant in Haryana. After the WHO's alert the Centre appeared to wash its hands off by saying that the responsibility in this case was that of Haryana's health department.

The experts however said that the certificate of the pharmaceutical products (COPPs) is issued by the CDSCO which operates under the Ministry of Health. ""The CDSCO took over this process in 2009 because state drug controllers were not being consistent in how they issue COPPs. The state drug regulator only issues the manufacturing licence"" they said.

They further said that if the central government was claiming that it had no role to play it was ""most certainly not being honest"". ""The list of facilities certified for COPP published by the CDSCO clearly has Maiden Pharmaceuticals on its list"" they said.

When asked about the Centre's position that these medicines were not given the license to be sold in India the experts said that the government was deliberately obfuscating the issue as once a manufacturing licence is issued the company can automatically sell products in the country.

""There is no regulatory process in Indian law that allows only for an export licence without domestic manufacture. Given that Maiden Pharma was on the CDSCOs COPP list the Ministry of Health is answerable for these deaths in the Gambia"" they said.

Earlier India Today reported that Maiden Pharmaceuticals is a habitual offender as it has defaulted many times and flouted rules before as well. The report said the pharma company has been flagged in many Indian states over the years for their medicines failing the quality and safety parameters.

The WHO on October 5 issued a health alert against Maiden's four products - Promethazine Oral Solution Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup. The world health agency said that to date Maiden Pharmaceuticals had not provided guarantees to the WHO on the safety and quality of these products.

""Laboratory analysis of samples of each of the four products confirms that they contain unacceptable amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol as contaminants. To date these four products have been identified in The Gambia but may have been distributed through informal markets to other countries or regions"" the WHO said.

WDC,Western Digital,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtaW5ndHJlbmQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmUvcmV2aWV3cy93ZF9ibGFjay1wNDAtZ2FtZS1kcml2ZS1yZXZpZXctdGlueS0yZ2Itcy1wb3dlcmhvdXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WD_Black P40 Game Drive review -- Tiny 2GB/s Powerhouse,"We are in an interesting time in the storage space. Thumbdrives are everywhere but that’s starting to change. As the price of high speed SSDs come down their capacities expand and high speed interfaces catch up in the mainstream I’ve stopped recommending thumbdrives entirely. Frankly they are just too slow and there are far better uses of your time. Western Digital agrees and they’ve introduced drives like the WD_Black P40 to further expand your high speed storage options. Let’s get into the use cases and what makes this a huge step up from their previous entry – the D30.

WD Black P40 Unboxing Benchmark and Review [Gaming Trend]

Watch this video on YouTube

The P40 is branded as a gaming drive and thanks to its high speed archiving capabilities that means you can use them on your PC as well as your shiny new Sony or Microsoft console. Like the D30 before it the P40 works perfectly on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S providing fast storage for hot copies of your games that you can swap into the M.2/Internal storage of the console or to play PS4 and Xbox One games from the drive natively. This means games like Spider-Man: Miles Morales can be archived though not played from this drive but can be moved quickly onto the more expensive internal storage on both platforms so you don’t have to download the entire game and patches all over again. This is crucial if your ISP has any sort of hard cap or throttling on your download capacities.

When playing previous-generation games you’ll see a pretty marked improvement in drive speed. The mechanical hard drives in the previous generation of consoles maxed out at a read and write speed of roughly 100MB/s resulting in some fairly lengthy initial load times but fast enough for streaming worlds like The Witcher 3. As you’ll see below we’ve got speeds well in excess of double that of the D30 meaning you’ve got enough horsepower to load the game as fast as the engine will allow – you’ll be happy with your previous gen performance here.

To achieve maximum performance whether you are using this for previous games or current you’ll need to use a USB 3.2 Gen 2 port. The Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 both sport Gen 2 ports (you’ll want to plug into the back of the PS5 — the front ports cap out at 480MB/s) so you won’t have to worry about speeds there but the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are both USB 3.0 so that 500MB/s we saw on the D30 when plugged into those consoles was as good as it’s going to get. You can thank the IEEE folks for making USB as confusing as humanly possible.

One of my favorite aspects of the WD_Black P40 is it’s size – it’s tiny. So tiny in fact that it can slip comfortably in a pants pocket without being uncomfortable. At just 4.21″ x 2″ x 0.51″ it also fits easily into a side pocket on a backpack and anything I can do to de-bulk my grab-and-go travel gear is a win in my book.

Heading over to the PC we have more tools to really put the device to the test. If you’ve checked out our hardware reviews in the past you know our primary staples are ATTO and Crystaldiskmark though with Western Digital there’s an added bonus – the WD_Black Dashboard. As you’ll see in the video above this dashboard allows you to upgrade firmware monitor usage warranty temperature and remaining estimated lifespan and it gives a very accurate view of the performance of both read and write. Naturally given that it’s 2022 you can also adjust a small RGB strip to maximize speed.

Firing up the WD_Black dashboard I can see all of my drives their interface speeds health capacities temperatures and firmware levels. I can also see if a drive becomes unhealthy as well as access tools to help resolve those issues. In this case we are interested in the Performance Tab. Running side-by-side with ATTO and Crystal Diskmark I fired up benchmarking on the P40 and wow does it deliver. As you’ll see below it delivers some serious read and write speeds hitting 1.84GB/s for any file size larger than 512 KB and maintaining that all the way up to chunks of 64MB. Better still it does so while holding up a write speed nearly as fast – 1.68 GB/s for those same file sizes.

ATTO and CrystlaDiskMark agree with what Western Digital’s own Daskboard is reporting but I wanted to get some additional information about the drive and I knew precisely the utility to do it – 3DMark’s Storage Benchmark. This utility focuses on real-world gaming performance as well as providing some basis for comparison against other drives. Sequential drive usage is easier to quantify as it’s literally about whether a drive can hit a theoretical maximum or not but having at least some level of repeatable performance simulation is important. While it does focus on SSDs primarily there are a number of external drives in here as well. It’d also provide the first of our benchmarking database for external drives. Without further ado let’s get to the tests.

An extensive test 3DMark’s Storage Benchmark runs sims like recording in OBS at 1080p while playing Overwatch launching Battlefield V from the main menu or loading Call of Duty Black Ops 2. Ultimately like other 3DMark products it comes up with a score. The WD_Black P40 Game Drive delivered a score of 1056. For basis of comparison I benchmarked some of the SSDs I had on hand including the predecessors to this drive – the D30 and the P50 as well as a direct competitor in the Seagate FireCuda SSD.

It’s easy to see the iteration Western Digital has done even within their own product lines. Each one is a significant improvement over the previous and they are easily doubling their nearest competitor in theoretical speeds as well as real-world simulations. We see this backed up in practical everyday use where file copies are dramatically improved. In these benchmarks we see that only the larger version of this device the P50 compares and even that is a few points shy of the P40.

For frame of reference we see roughly double those scores out of an NVMe which tracks as they are generally speaking roughly double or more in speed. It’s an unfair comparison but it does provide some context for where these scores land in the grand scheme of things.

1TB WD_Black SN850 NVMe – 3436

1TB Sabrent Rocket 4.0 NVMe – 2845

1TB WD_Black SN750 NVMe – 2102

1TB Samsung 970 EVO NMVe – 1901

So what does all of this tell us? Well it’s pretty plain to see that the P40 is an absolute monster of a drive. It’s delivering speeds approaching a mid-tier internal NVMe drive and that is impressive given the price portability and form factor.

As with all of my hardware reviews I’m a stickler for warranties. The WD_Black P40 comes with a robust 5 year warranty. When so many drive manufacturers offer 3 years 1 year or worst of all just 90 days Western Digital is standing behind their product in a big way. This is fantastic news if you hold onto your systems for their full lifespan.

The WD_Black P40 comes in three different size varieties to fit your needs — a 500GB model as well as a 1 and 2 TB variety. The 500GB drive will set you back $119.99 whereas the 1 and 2 TB versions will cost you $179 and $329 respectively. Of these sizes the 1TB model feels like the right balance between cost capacityand performance but using it as an external drive on my Steam Deck I have to admit that a little extra room goes a long way. The included cable is a little stubby at just one foot in length. Thankfully it’s just a USB-C cord so just make sure any replacement you get is USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 capable – here’s the one I used for these tests.

95 Excellent WD_Black P40 Game Drive Review Guidelines The WD_Black P40 Game Drive may be a smaller incarnation of the P50 but the fact that it runs cooler is more travel-ready and delivers on its 2GB/s promises is impressive. Provided you’ve got the UBS 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface to take advantage of it this drive is going to blow you away. —Ron Burke

In a tweet Saturday night West wrote that he was going to go “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.”

“I’m a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I’m going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE” he wrote. “The funny thing is I actually can’t be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda.”

After an hour of being up and tens of thousands of engagements the tweet no longer appears on the rapper’s Twitter. In its place there’s a notice from Twitter that reads “This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.”

West returned to Twitter on Friday after a lengthy hiatus where he almost immediately called out Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg saying “How you gone kick me off instagram.” He was quickly welcomed back to Twitter by Elon Musk who confirmed his plans to buy Twitter. “Welcome back to Twitter my friend” Musk replied to West’s tweet about Zuckerberg.

The rapper’s Instagram account was restricted after he posted an exchange allegedly between him and Diddy in which users criticized West for using language that seemed anti-Semitic. The post has since been deleted.

West’s first Twitter post since 2020 came Oct. 7 in which he posted a photo in a warehouse of a black cap that reads “2024.”

He also posted questions like “Who you think created cancel culture?” as well as tweets supporting Iranian youth. He wrote “Iranian youth are leading a revolution against 44 years of dictatorship. The world needs to support them and honor their courage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi9kaWdpdGFsL25ld3Mva2FueWUtd2VzdC1pbnN0YWdyYW0tcmVzdHJpY3RlZC1hY2NvdW50LTEyMzUzOTcwNTUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIyL2RpZ2l0YWwvbmV3cy9rYW55ZS13ZXN0LWluc3RhZ3JhbS1yZXN0cmljdGVkLWFjY291bnQtMTIzNTM5NzA1NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kanye West’s Accounts Restricted on Twitter Instagram Following Backlash Over Antisemitic Posts,"Kanye “Ye” West’s Twitter account was locked by the social media platform for violating its policies a spokesperson for the company has confirmed to Variety.

In its statement Twitter did not indicate which specific posts by West led to the decision to restrict his account.

The restriction comes after West took to Twitter after facing a similar restriction on Instagram. The musician shared two tweets that have largely been criticized as antisemitic.

The first post has since been deleted by Twitter for “violating the Twitter rules.” In the post West claimed that he couldn’t be antisemitic and said he had been “toyed with” by the Jewish people.

“I’m a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I’m going death [sic] con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE” West wrote in the now-deleted post. “The funny thing is I actually can’t be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also. You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda.”

A second post shared closely after the first remains public on Twitter: “Who do you think created cancel culture?”

A day earlier a restriction was placed on West’s Instagram account after the platform deleted content from his account for a violation of its policies.

A Meta spokesperson confirmed the decision to Variety sharing that temporary restrictions on posting commenting and messaging are standard practice for accounts that regularly violate the social media platform’s policies. The company did not indicate which specific posts were the cause behind the restriction.

West who uses the handle @kanyewest on the platform had shared a now-deleted post featuring a screenshot of a message allegedly sent to rapper Diddy that had been criticized as antisemitic by Jewish advocacy groups like the American Jewish Committee.

Representatives for West were not immediately available for comment.

In the hours following his restriction on Instagram West took to Twitter for the first moment in some time seemingly calling out Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg for his restriction from the platform.

Look at this Mark

Tesla CEO Elon Musk who has been engaged in a legal process regarding a potential purchase of Twitter responded by welcoming West back to the social media platform.

The rapper also shared what seems to be a teaser for a 2024 political campaign a prospect that he has flirted with in the past.

This does not mark the first time that West has faced restrictions on Instagram. In March the rapper was suspended from the platform for 24 hours. Content from West’s account was also deleted in that incident for violations of policies for hate speech bullying and harassment.

West also faced controversy earlier this week after wearing a shirt reading “White Lives Matter” during his surprise Yeezy Season 9 fashion show in Paris. The rapper also appeared for an interview on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Thursday evening to discuss the decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2Fzcm9jay1ibGF6aW5nLW0tMi1wY2llLWdlbi01LXNzZC1jb29sZXItYWN0aXZlLWZhbi1oZWF0c2luay1jb21wYXRpYmxlLXdpdGgtejc5MC14NjcwZS1iNjUwLW1vdGhlcmJvYXJkcy_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vYXNyb2NrLWJsYXppbmctbS0yLXBjaWUtZ2VuLTUtc3NkLWNvb2xlci1hY3RpdmUtZmFuLWhlYXRzaW5rLWNvbXBhdGlibGUtd2l0aC16NzkwLXg2NzBlLWI2NTAtbW90aGVyYm9hcmRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASRock Unveils Blazing M.2 PCIe Gen 5 SSD Cooler With Active Fan Heatsink Compatible With Z790 X670E & B650 Motherboards,"ASRock has revealed its Blazing M.2 PCIe Gen 5 SSD which is an active fan heatsink for X670E Z790 & B650 motherboards.

ASRock develops Blazing M.2 PCIe Gen 5 SSD cooling system compatible with new next-gen Intel & AMD motherboards

ASRock has developed five styles for the new SSD cooling system and it is stated that the airflow measured in cubic feet per minute (cfm) will be 4.92. The new Blazing M.2 PCIe Gen 5 SSD cooling fan attachments will be compatible with X670E B650 and B650E and Z790 motherboards and the company has provided a list of compatible models and which type of cooler variant will work with each.

Earlier this year in March Phison reminded manufacturers and users of the elevated temperatures that PCIe Gen 5 M.2 NVMe SSD devices would produce. Not only would the new PCIe SSDs offer speeds topping 14GBps but Phison reported that the M.2 SSD controller limits had been factory set to 125°C. Phison explained that as the drive is filled with data the temperatures increase. However the NAND flash memory which can only accept up to 80°C will cause the SSD to go into a critical state and shut down the system causing losses of information and depreciation of the system.

Currently Phison tested the company's E26 PCIe Gen 5 primary control chip and was found to reach speeds of 10GBps. With the help of new manufacturing materials such as various silicon advancements and 3D NAND technologies those speeds have increased to 12GBps adding further heat to computer systems. Also PCIe offers three specifications for the new 5.0 generation — 2280 2580 and 25110 — each offering various specifications from standard specifications to larger and more robust ones.

Hopefully ASRock and other computer component manufacturers can offer additional cooling devices to help maintain the heat dissipation needed in most current PC systems being introduced into the marketplace.

The fifth season of ‘Yellowstone’ is coming soon

Yellowstone follows the Dutton family which owns the largest contiguous ranch in the United States. The series looks closely at the way ranches are impacted by land developers reservations National Parks and more.

With season four’s stunning conclusion fans are excited to see what is to happen with Jamie Dutton next and how his actions might impact the Dutton family as a whole.

Fans can watch the first four seasons of Yellowstone on Peacock. The fifth season will be released on November 13 2022

‘1883’ (2021-2022)

1883 is the prequel to Yellowstone and tells the story of how Dutton’s ancestors came to settle in Montana according to IMDb. James Dutton played by Tim McGraw leads his family across the Great Plains with the assistance of Shea Brennan (Sam Elliot). The journey is about as perilous as you can imagine.

1883 is an old-fashioned Western that fits nicely with the more modern Western of Yellowstone. You can watch 1883 on Paramount+.

‘Billy the Kid’ (2022-)

Amazon’s Outer Range brings the weird fiction mindset to Westerns https://t.co/SRenLy6nLv pic.twitter.com/gwdQV2pp1s — The Verge (@verge) May 5 2022

Take Yellowstone’s Western theme and fight for personal property and combine it with the sci-fi and supernatural elements of Lost and you have Outer Range.

Royal Abbott played by Josh Brolin is “a rancher fighting for his land and family discovers an unfathomable mystery at the edge of Wyoming’s wilderness” according to IMDb. Abbott finds a large and mysterious hold on his Wyoming property that seems to put out some kind of supernatural power. Some people try to take Abbott’s property from him but he refuses to sell until he can figure out what the hold could be.

You can watch Outer Range on Prime Video.

Yellowstone has created a fan base for the reimagined Western and Joe Pickett is catching the trend. IMDb says Joe Pickett “follows a game warden and his family in a changing political and socioeconomic climate in a small rural town.”

Michael Dorman stars as Joe Pickett. Pickett is a game warden in Wyoming where any sort of government authority is not viewed with trusting eyes especially when told what they can and can’t hunt. Pickett gets involved in a murder investigation that forces him to face a crime family and other unlikeable characters.

You can watch Joe Pickett on Paramount+.

‘The Son’ (2017-2019)

The Son provides a mashup of the period setting of 1883 with the family drama of Yellowstone. IMDb describes The Son as an epic that tells the story of “America’s birth as a superpower” that follows the story of a Texas oil empire.

The Son follows Eli McCulloch played by Pierce Brosnan through two different timelines the 1840s and early 1900s. You can catch episodes of The Son on Hulu."

Weyerhaeuser owes its employees health care

Weyerhaeuser employees in Eugene and Springfield have been on strike for three weeks because the company is trying to cut health insurance for them and their families.

Weyerhaeuser boasted to shareholders that it raked in record profits – of almost $3 billion – last year. Those profits were made from Oregon trees and on the backs of Oregon woodworkers. When the economy was bad employees made sacrifices to help Weyerhaeuser through the recession. But now that business is booming instead of sharing the wealth with the people who produce their products the company wants to make their lives harder.

As a school board member I know that in all our classes from kindergarten to high school we teach students about the fundamental principles of fairness and mutual respect. If as parents and educators we then treat the disgraceful behavior of companies like Weyerhaeuser as something acceptable we give all our kids an education in hypocrisy saying that fairness is only for inside the classroom.

As a company that has benefited for so long from the work of people in our community the least Weyerhaeuser owes its employees is to maintain affordable health care for their families at a time of record profits.

Gordon Lafer Eugene (Opinions are his own and don’t reflect the school district)

Weyerhaeuser the problem not the solution

More than 1000 union workers are on strike and now are losing their access to health care because Weyerhaeuser wants the employees to pay more to the health insurance company. Some may say the union members are selfish for wanting more wages but can they be condemned for wanting access to health care for themselves and their families?

Weyerhaeuser and other companies have weaponized health care. It holds a double-edged sword: wages and health care. The company is making the employees pay for the rising cost of health care which is not the fault of the employees. Meanwhile the health insurance companies are laughing all the way to the bank while everyone else suffers.

The real enemy here is the health insurance companies. Why doesn’t Weyerhaeuser attack the health insurance companies instead of its own employees? At least it could join with the union to demand that we have a universal health care system so no matter where you work or how much you make you get health care.

Or is Weyerhaeuser simply doing this for control of the workers? If it is doing that it shame on Weyerhaeuser for being the problem instead of the solution.

Goodbye to a lake

Today I swam in a small clear lake surrounded by forest huge trees of different species and an understory of wildflowers and huckleberries. I’d like to return every summer and bring my grandchildren when they are a bit older. But I was there to say goodbye.

If Forest Service plans go ahead the lake will be next to miles of clear-cut forest: the Flat Country timber sale. More than 3115 acres out of the 4400-acre sale is mature and old-growth forest. This year President Biden ordered his administration to save older forests for their crucial carbon storage. The importance of these forests in protecting wildlife and water is also widely acknowledged along with their resistance to wildfire. And Flat Country’s watershed the McKenzie is only beginning to recover from the 230000-acre Holiday Farm fire two years ago. So why is this Trump-era sale going ahead? More loss and devastation damage that will last for generations just to make money for timber companies.

There is some hope. Rep. Peter DeFazio has spoken out against the Flat Country timber sale. Ask Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden to be courageous and join him; ask the Biden administration to withdraw the sale.

Can we turn America around?

When we don’t know history we are doomed to repeat it. Carle Zimmerman researched the similarities of ancient civilizations and what caused their downfall. The United States is following in their footsteps.

In his book “Family and Civilizations” he compiles his research. Here is a brief overview from Amazon:

“In this unjustly forgotten work Zimmerman demonstrates the close and causal connections between the rise and fall of different types of families and the rise and fall of civilizations particularly ancient Greece and Rome medieval and modern Europe and the United States ...

""Originally published in 1947 this compelling analysis predicted many of today’s cultural and social controversies and trends including youth violence and depression abortion and homosexuality the demographic collapse of Europe and of the West more generally and the displacement of peoples.”

Can we turn America around? If we don’t our country and our freedoms will disappear.

Kotek is for reproductive and bodily autonomy not the others

No one is free unless they control their health lives and futures. Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has taken away our constitutional right to abortion the midterm elections are more important than ever to determine whether Oregon will remain a safe haven for abortion access.

In the governor’s race the choice is clear: Tina Kotek trusts us to make our own decisions about our bodies. She is a proven progressive who has never wavered from her commitment to reproductive freedom.

In fact when Donald Trump was elected Kotek championed the nation’s most progressive reproductive health policy and passed it into law. Thanks to the Reproductive Health Equity Act abortion rights are safeguarded in Oregon.

But rights are meaningless if you can’t afford to access them. The act also expands coverage for reproductive health care to thousands of Oregonians regardless of their citizenship status type of insurance or gender identity.

The Reproductive Health Equity Act has made a huge difference in my life. I am able to get birth control pills and Plan B for free. Last year I got the Nexplanon implant — also for free. I know my reproductive health is taken care of thanks to Tina Kotek.

Ignoring harm and damage

As I listened to charities decrying a ban on fireworks in Eugene I was struck by what seemed like hypocrisy. On one hand they were upset that their cash flow for helping others would be diminished yet they ignored the harm and damage done to people buildings our pets and forests from these fireworks. If you’re going to try to help people shouldn’t you be also keeping them safe? I donate monthly to help feed those in need but would never buy fireworks that could make someone homeless. These charities need to find other sources of revenue. In addition more policing needs to be done to stop illegal fireworks which we see going flying in the air around us every July 4.

Are we surprised decriminalizing drugs was a disaster?

A now-retired psychologist I developed and evaluated substance abuse prevention and early intervention programs for school districts offender diversion programs and alcohol harm reduction programs in seven states several under NIH research grants.

So I wonder why anyone in the field expected decriminalization to reduce addiction or overdoses. Decriminalization simply eliminates long-term criminal records stigma – most importantly obstacles to future employment. And people dependent on anxiolytic and antidepressant agents rarely want “treatment” for what provides them transient relief.

In scientific investigation comparability of the control and “treatment” conditions independent of the intervention is elemental. Oregon’s confessed failure compared variables pre-2020 with 2020-22. Did any other societal-level mental health-relevant changes occur simultaneously? Like continuously amplified COVID-19 anxiety? Shutdowns? Masked faces? Muffled voices? Six-foot “distancing”? Empty streets? Massive Main Street to Wall Street wealth transfer?

Thousands of small businesses and associated livelihoods were destroyed including establishments providing public sociability – Oldenburg’s “third place” between work and family found across all human societies a daily source of psychologically essential interpersonal “strokes” so named by Dr. Eric Berne.

We have near-universal monumental losses: employment-based self-esteem friends and family who disagree student achievement trust in government institutions media medicine optimism.

And very bad science.

How does Skarlatos know what’s best for women’s health care?

One of Alek Skarlatos’ campaign TV ads states that he will “protect women’s access to health care.” Since Skarlatos is on record stating that he supports the repeal of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court and believes that Planned Parenthood should not receive federal funds I’m not clear on how he is protecting a woman’s access to health care. In reality he is in favor of limiting a woman’s access to health care.

Apparently Skarlatos believes that he knows what is best for a woman’s health. It seems that he will protect access to health care for women who he deems appropriate. Does he think that he has the right to dictate what and where a woman should be allowed to access her health care? So what’s his plan to protect women’s access to health care? Is he offering transportation to our appointments at clinics that he thinks we should be allowed to use and that offer procedures that he thinks are good for us?

Skarlatos I don’t need your “protection.” In fact women’s health care needs to be protected from politicians like you! Teresa Dobles Eugene

Venus Williams has earned earned acclaim by staying in tip-top shape and she’s aiming to help others get healthy as well.

Her Happy Viking company is a plant-based superfood brand that launched in 2020 it looks like it’s gaining backing from some heavy-hitters.

Per a press release Happy Viking has raised $2 million in an investment round led by Venus Williams Serena Williams Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman’s 35V Peloton Vice President of Fitness Programming Robin Arzón among others.

“Venus is an incredible entrepreneur and in getting to know her and the team she’s put together behind Happy Viking it was clear to Kevin Durant and I that the company has set itself up for success” Rich Kleiman 35V said in a news release. “No one understands the health and nutrition space like a professional athlete and Happy Viking is proof in product form.”

The tennis champion battle with an autoimmune disease prompted the launch of the company.

“When I was diagnosed with Sjogren’s Syndrome I became obsessed with doing research and exploring superfood ingredients that helped with my recovery” Williams said in a news release. “I would experiment with different recipes until I found a combination that tasted great improved my health and allowed me to get back to tennis.

OXFORD Miss. – Corinth Coca-Cola Bottling Works Inc. has been serving beverages since 1907. In that time the family-owned and operated organization has expanded from its original location in Corinth to multiple locations across the Mid-South.

And all the while family members have run the business. In its fifth generation of owner-operators Corinth Coke not only has deep roots in Coca-Cola and the Mid-South but also at the University of Mississippi where four generations of the family earned degrees.

To honor their UM legacy while helping future generations of students the family has funded one scholarship – the Corinth Coca-Cola Business School Scholarship Endowment – and formalized a second one Refreshments Inc. Partners in Business Scholarship Fund which has supported School of Business Administration students for many years.

“Our family has owned and operated this business for more than 100 years and we’ve got connections to Ole Miss that go back for generations as well” said Ken Williams Jr. who has two children who are either recent graduates or current students and represent the fourth generation of family at the university.

Corinth Coke’s chair Sandy Williams (BBA 57) and his wife Rosemary Taylor Williams (BS 60) a native of Lucedale as well as president and CEO Kenneth Williams (BBA 63) and his late wife Nancy Kincade Williams (BS 63) a native of Clarksdale all earned degrees from Ole Miss.

After completing undergraduate work at Millsaps College Corinth Coke’s COO Ken Williams Jr. earned his MBA in 1994 from the university. His daughter Emma is a junior at Ole Miss pursuing a degree in communication sciences and disorders. His oldest daughter Elizabeth graduated in 2018 with a degree in elementary education just like her grandmother Nancy Kincade Williams did in 1963.

Nancy Williams’ father Robert P. Kincade played football for the Rebels from 1935 to 1938 including the Rebels’ first and only appearance in the Orange Bowl in 1936.

“Our connections to Ole Miss are early and often” Williams said. “And several of us have been educated in the School of Business Administration.

“Our involvement with Ole Miss has been extremely beneficial to us and we want to aid students in northeast Mississippi so they have the same opportunities at the business school.”

To achieve this goal of helping other students the Coca-Cola Business School Scholarship awards a minimum of $1000 for four semesters to full-time students enrolled in the school who are residents of Alcorn Itawamba Lee Prentiss or Tishomingo counties.

Scholarship recipients must have a strong academic record as well as a history of involvement in extra-curricular activities and service to others and their communities.

“We believe it’s important to educate young people from our region in the decades to come” Sandy Williams said. “And we think Ole Miss is one of the premier places for that to occur and it’s right here in our own backyard.”

The Refreshments Inc. Partners in Business Scholarship provides funds to full-time sophomore junior and senior students in the school who are residents of Alcorn Itawamba Lee Marshall Pontotoc or Union counties.

The Refreshments Scholarship is funded in part by an annual golf tournament said Ken Cyree Ole Miss business dean and a veteran participant in this fundraiser.

“I have enjoyed the relationship with Kenneth and Sandy Williams since I have attended their charity golf tournament that benefits the Refreshments Inc. Scholarship for about a dozen years” Cyree said. “These events reveal the heart of this wonderful family to educate and elevate people in their organization and across the state and region.

“It has been great to meet the family members and interact with them over the years. They are selfless and caring individuals and I appreciate their dedication and commitment. They have left quite the legacy on their family company Corinth and Ole Miss in addition to the region.”

Family members hope the scholarship helps strengthen northeast Mississippi communities Kenneth Williams Sr. said.

“Our dream is that with our assistance some of the students from this area will attend the business school and then stay in Mississippi and join one of the many quality companies already established or perhaps even start their own business venture” he said. “Hopefully they will use their talents to better the state for generations to come.”

“We believe that those who live and work in the communities in these counties are part of our family” said Ken Williams Jr. “We’ve always felt that being involved in community events across the territories is an essential part of what we do.”

The Corinth Coca-Cola Business School Scholarship Endowment and the Refreshments Inc. Partners in Business Scholarship Fund are open to accept gifts from individuals and organizations. To contribute send a check with the endowment’s or the fund’s name noted in the memo line to the University of Mississippi Foundation 406 University Ave. Oxford MS 38655 or give online at https://give.olemiss.edu.

During the latest campaign spending reporting period which ran from Aug. 14 to Sept. 26 Victorino brought in $102033.09 and spent $37174.37 while mayoral opponent Richard Bissen received $91512.50 during the same period and spent $72459.43 for his campaign according to reports released earlier this week.

For Victorino who fell about 2000 votes short of Bissen during the primary the funds include a $15000 investment from himself and his family.

“Mike Victorino is committed to completing the work he began in 2019” the Victorino for Mayor campaign said in an email to The Maui News. “The pandemic redirected his work for a while but he never lost his vision for what can be accomplished.”

Victorino received several $4000 donations from organizations and businesses that included the United Public Workers PAC in Honolulu California-based Stable Road Capital LLC three executives from New Jersey-based Unified Door a New Jersey-based architect with Stantec and California-based Esthetics By Brittnee.

Leigh Tonai the CEO of Hawaii Island Creations contributed $2500 while the Hawaii Committee on Public Education AFL-CIO and realtor Robert Tanaka of Tanaka Inc. gave Victorino $2000 each and Parks Department Secretary L.M. Sakumoto contributed $1300.

Among those who gave $1000 each were the Maui Hotel & Lodging Association PAC; Maui County Plan Checker Susan Watanabe; retired CEO of First Hawaiian Bank Walter Dods Jr.; Keller Williams realtor Diane Yoshimura; Mayor’s Liaison Bill Snipes; President of Dorvin D. Leis Co. Inc. Stephen Leis.; Maui County Deputy Managing Director Josiah Nishita; Maui County Director of Finance Scott Teruya; Mayor’s Chief of Staff Tyson Miyake; and Maui County Budget Director Michele Yoshimura.

Other notable donations of $500 included Lori Tsuhako the director of the Maui County Department of Housing and Human Concerns; Helene Kau director of the Maui County Department of Water Supply; S & F Land Company; Kaonoulu Ranch owner Henry Rice; and Stacy Otomo of Otomo Engineering.

When asked how he planned to work to gather the votes that went to other mayoral opponents in the primary election Victorino’s campaign pointed to his endorsements from 12 different industries many of which include county workers.

“They see the progress he continues to make in affordable housing economic diversification and improving our quality of life” his campaign said. “They also believe this isn’t the right time for inexperienced leadership of the county. Voters want viable plans that produce results they are tired of platitudes and promises.”

The report indicated that Victorino much of his campaign earnings on advertising including a total of $18650 to Alaska-based Optima Public Relations for radio print and digital marketing and advertising as well as more than $2600 on Facebook advertising. He also spent more than $4500 on two months’ rent for his campaign headquarters.

Victorino who started the period with $30811.99 had $95670.71 left over.

For Bissen the largest donations of $4000 each came from Gal Cohen president of Kihei-based Cohen Development Group; Damien Stenger of Ax Ranch on Maui; James Marn manager of Honolulu-based JYM Investment LLC; and Karla Rompel office manager of Posso Pizza Inc. on Oahu.

Robert Campbell director of Ohana Rental Company Inc. and Charlotte Yamashiro a manager at Ululani’s Hawaiian Shave Ice each contributed $2500.

“We have been speaking to everybody and anybody you know who wants to have a meeting with Richard. Richard has made himself available because he’s been doing his homework and wanting to know what everybody’s concerns are” Bissen campaign manager Charlene Schulenburg said via phone Wednesday afternoon. “We’re clearly seeing that people want change and they’re believing in Richard’s history his reputation and I think they are believing in him so there’s a lot of hopefulness in the air.”

Ulupalakua Ranch President Sumner Erdman Maui Land & Pineapple Company Stephen Goodfellow of Goodfellow Bros. contract worker Tiffany Losano and Executive Chef Michael Weinstein of Big Food Service Group LLC boosted Bissen’s campaign with $2000 each.

There were several $1000 contributions from retired folks attorneys and business executives including John Dean president and CEO of Central Pacific Bank; Mark Teruya chairman and CEO of Armstrong Produce; Eric Hashizume vice president of Hawaiian Dredging Construction Co.; Richard Papa owner and project executive of RPAPA Construction; Douglas Shimabukuro board treasurer of FCH Enterprises the parent company of Zippy’s; and Catherine Yannone of public relations agency CommPac LLC.

Many of Bissen’s largest expenditures were for advertising including $5875 to Texas-based Nexstar Media for TV ads $5045.80 to Maui Times $3124.98 to Kahului-based Rey-Cel Broadcasting Inc. for radio ads $2712.74 to Pacific Radio Group $2600 to Fil-Am Voice and $1144.26 to The Maui News.

He also paid $3850 to Abigail Samuelson of Paia for social media management $3734.33 to Wailuku-based Royal Hawaiian Shirt Works for campaign T-shirts and $2604 to Kihei-based Double Portion LLC for caps and hats.

“It’s expensive to get a name and a message out. It’s less expensive for the mayor because he has the mayor’s platform” Schulenburg said when asked about Bissen’s higher spending. “If we have spent more money we started from scratch. … He was a judge so he didn’t have a social presence so just starting from scratch all of that takes an exorbitant amount of money so we have not spent anything that we have not absolutely had to spend to get his message out so it’s not like we’re spending money on anything frivolous.”

Bissen who started with $56262.08 at the beginning of the period had $75315.15 left over.

County Council

Among Maui County Council candidates Tom Cook brought in more funding than any other at $36928.24 from Aug. 14 to Sept. 26 as he campaigns for the South Maui residency seat.

The majority of people working in the insurance sector (70%) said that they have more to do at work than they have time for with half (50%) of these respondents saying they were stressed by this.

This was according to the results of a recent survey of 102 UK insurance sector employees cited during a Dive In Festival session on 28 September 2022 entitled Is burnout the new normal? Strategies for well-being in an always on culture.

Employees that responded to the survey were drawn from Willis Towers Watson Gallagher Liberty Specialty Markets Eliot Partnership and Travelers.

However 60% of respondents said that they felt that they were provided with organisational support for their workloads by their employers – only 12% felt unsupported.

Another 70% of respondents indicated that their organisations recognised the importance of well-being.

Work vs family pressure

Emma McCarthy Gallagher’s communications executive shared her experience of feeling burnt out while working during the Covid-19 pandemic.

She said: “I am a mum of two young boys – one is five and one is eight the eldest had gone through a rough time – both my kids are severely asthmatic.

”Combine that with me and my husband working very long hours – it’s just a recipe for disaster if you don’t look after yourself.”

She explained that her burnout began because she was home-schooling her children in the evening on top of her own role at Gallagher.

Jola Adebiyi a financial solutions sales and client management analyst at Willis Towers Watson who joined via a graduate scheme explained: “I have just started the second year of the graduate scheme at WTW and the main thing I have learnt is managing my own expectations – realising I am at the infancy of my career and I am not meant to be able to do every task perfectly.”

Payments worth around £18billion are being denied to these pensioners according to Aon a firm of actuaries.

Around ten million people in the UK are members of final salary – also known as defined benefit – schemes. These are the most generous type as they pay out a guaranteed income for life based on your earnings.

Squeezed out: Hundreds of thousands of retirees with final salary pensions may be losing out on boosts to their monthly payments

However the amount of protection they offer against inflation varies wildly. Most rise with inflation every year but only up to a cap. Some schemes also offer discretionary cost-of-living top-ups when inflation exceeds the cap.

Pension scheme trustees can choose to offer these top-ups where they feel it is in the interests of scheme members and the finances of the scheme are in good enough health that they can afford to make an extra payout.

However the problem arises when UK companies have offloaded their pension schemes to giant insurance companies in so-called buyout deals. During these deals behind closed doors pensioners' discretionary rights are often signed away.

Once a pension scheme is in the hands of an insurer it is no longer looked after by a group of pension trustees with a legal responsibility to act in the interest of its members.

Instead the insurance company is simply responsible for maintaining the monthly pension income payments and has no obligation to provide extra help to members in tough financial times.

Richard Williams is director of strategy and communications at Clara a start-up pension fund consolidator where discretionary payments are still possible. He says of buyouts: 'Broadly insurers have to codify all discretions when they take on a scheme and they'll usually disappear.'

Henry Tapper chair of AgeWage and a pensions expert adds: 'Once insurers have taken on a pension scheme's liabilities via a buyout they are under no obligation to pay a penny of any excess profit generated by the scheme's assets to members.' Rising numbers of companies are offloading their pension schemes to insurers through buyouts. The deals are huge business for insurance giants such as Legal & General Rothesay Life PIC Aviva and Scottish Widows.

Actuaries Hymans Robertson estimates that the value of these buyouts could reach a staggering trillion pounds by 2031.

Which pension members will get a pay rise?

Most private sector defined benefit schemes link their annual pension increases to the Retail Prices Index of inflation but capped at five per cent or just 2.5 per cent.

Schemes that have not been subject to a buyout can then top it up. For example members of one of British Airways' schemes the APS have recently enjoyed a discretionary payment of 1.8 per cent which brought their total pension increase this year to 4.9 per cent.

Some of the stingiest schemes do not offer any inflation protection at all and rely solely on discretionary top-ups. Many trustee boards consider discretionary increases each year as part of their governance process. This year around six in ten boards have actively considered them but only a minority have awarded them.

Bina Mistry head of UK Corporate Pensions Consulting at Willis Towers Watson says: 'Of 139 defined benefit schemes 89 scheme trustees have actively considered discretionary increases in 2022 with just 15 granting an increase.'

The value of discretionary top-ups has not been seen for nearly 30 years as inflation has remained subdued. But as RPI inflation hit 12.3 per cent in August pensioners unable to enjoy top-ups will quickly see the value of their incomes eroded. Tom Selby head of retirement policy at investment platform AJ Bell says: 'If we had five per cent inflation for five years a £10000 pension income without inflation protection would be worth £7738. If we had five per cent inflation for ten years it would be worth just £5987.'

Among those denied top-ups are the 277000 pensioners whose retirement fund has been taken over by the Pension Protection Fund. This organisation acts as a lifeboat and takes over pension schemes of companies that go bust and cannot meet their pension liabilities.

It has no power to award discretionary top-ups which means that retirees in the schemes that it controls receive a maximum increase of 2.5 per cent every year – even if inflation far exceeds that level.

The PPF says: 'We were set up by government to pay members of eligible defined benefit pension schemes compensation for their lost pensions if their employer failed. Our compensation levels – including levels of indexation – are set out in legislation.'

How do I get a top-up for my pension?

It is often up to scheme members and unions to press the case for discretionary pension increases. William McGrath chief executive of C-Suite Pension Strategies encourages them to 'be more active in raising questions about what is in their best interests'.

He adds: 'Where a pension scheme is well funded they can ask trustees for more.'

Hilary Salt a partner at First Actuarial LLP advises that members can look at whether their pension scheme has offered significant increases in the past – and then use this as a bargaining tool.",https://news.google.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_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Poisonous’: Huge problem crippling China,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.news.com.au', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /finance/economy/world-economy/big-tech-companies-are-moving-production-out-of-china-over-geostrategic-concerns/news-story/ce27ed75e2ba0617e90a9d5f75034450 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018ECA185090>, 'Connection to www.news.com.au timed out.

Young

State House News Service

BOSTON - Most of the attention paid to its work recently has focused on implementation of legal sports betting but the Massachusetts Gaming Commission has plenty of other weighty matters pending before it from the potential expansion of Encore Boston Harbor's gaming footprint to two applications for horse racing licenses that come with a mid-November deadline including a bid for a track in Hardwick and a request to end the commission's heightened scrutiny on Wynn Resorts' corporate culture.

Under pressure to get legal sports betting up and running after the Legislature slow-walked the issue for years the commission is facing a ""mammoth scheduling challenge"" chairwoman Cathy Judd-Stein said Wednesday during an agenda-setting session as it tries to plot the most efficient course toward legal wagering while not losing sight of the casino gaming or racing issues that were already on commissioners' minds before sports betting was thrown in their laps.

""There's a lot of work that will need to be done. Some is dictated by firm deadlines not deadlines that ... any of us have any say over"" the chairwoman said. Judd-Stein implored commissioners to be flexible about their availability for meetings and when it comes to the amount of time they will have to review material before public meetings so that commissioners are not an impediment to the work of the commission staff and can expedite it when possible.

""There will be times as the chair that I may convene a meeting where we have a quorum. There may be times if it's essential for [Executive Director] Karen Wells and the team to get their work done. And I'm putting everyone on notice on that. I really hope I can be the chair of those meetings but I might have to ask a different commissioner to chair those meetings if I cannot be there"" Judd-Stein said. ""That's how it's gonna work if it's going to advance the work of this team.""

At press time a commission meeting scheduled for Thursday morning is expected to shed significant light on the status of the commission's sports betting implementation work and its timeline for launching legal betting. In addition to having a discussion of potential launch dates the commission could also decide Thursday to make the application it will use for betting licenses available publicly in the coming days commissioners said Wednesday.

Changes for Encore Boston Harbor

Commissioners are expecting that a topic they dug deep into earlier this year will resurface before them again in 2022. Joe Delaney the commission's chief of community affairs said Wednesday that Encore Boston Harbor and parent company Wynn Resorts have revised their proposal for a development across Broadway from the Everett casino. Delaney said part of the new proposal is ""to make the east of Broadway development part of the gaming establishment.""

The Gaming Commission ruled in March that the first phase of Wynn's development along Broadway in Everett - 20000 square feet of restaurant space a 999-seat live entertainment venue a 2200-space parking garage and a 400-foot pedestrian bridge to connect the new development to the $2.6 billion casino that opened in 2019 - would not be part of the official gaming establishment and therefore would not fall under its jurisdiction or oversight. That was the outcome that the casino company had advocated for.

But now Wynn wants at least some of its planned development to be part of the gaming establishment possibly as it eyes an expansion of its casino gambling offerings. Encore Boston Harbor did not respond to News Service requests for more information but Delaney suggested that an expansion is part of the plan when he said the state's gaming law is silent on the matter.

""This is a little bit uncharted territory here. You know [Chapter] 23K didn't really address any kind of expansions or any of these types of things or expanding to a different property or anything of that nature"" he said. ""So we're as I said in a little bit of uncharted territory and we're trying to figure it out a little bit as we go.""

One issue that is under review is whether the language of the 2013 referendum that cleared the way for the casino to be located in Everett was specific to a single parcel and whether what Encore is now planning would even be allowed under the terms of that vote.

Encore will also be under the commission's microscope starting this week when it hears an update on the status of Wynn Resorts' agreement with Realty Income a real estate investment trust to sell the Everett casino's real estate for $1.7 billion in cash and to then immediately enter into ""a triple-net lease agreement"" for Wynn to lease the property back. A similar transaction involving MGM Springfield was vetted by the commission last year and approved earlier this year.

Heather Hall the Gaming Commission's chief enforcement counsel said Wynn is hoping to close the transaction by the end of the year and asked that the commission schedule its adjudicatory hearing on it in mid-November to keep the deal on track.

Return of thoroughbred racing?

Thursday's commission meeting will also start the commission's annual horse racing application review period. The standardbred horse track at Plainridge Park Casino has been the only venue to host any type of live horse racing in Massachusetts since Suffolk Downs ran its last race in June 2019 but this year the commission also got a second application for racing days.

The commission on Wednesday did not identify the group that filed the second application but a representative of the Commonwealth Equine and Agricultural Center said last month that he represents a group that intended to file an application to bring thoroughbred horse racing back to Massachusetts with races at Great Meadowbrook Farm in Hardwick starting next September.

""Assuming that the commission grants the thoroughbred horse racing license we have planned to apply for a sports wagering license as well"" the representative Patrick Hanley said last month. Licensed horse tracks are among a small group of entities eligible to seek in-person sports betting licenses in Massachusetts an incentive that may help make the development of a thoroughbred track here more appealing and could end the years of false starts toward a new track.

The group behind the Hardwick proposal plans to spend about $20 million on the project's design and construction phases but still needs to secure town approvals. On Tuesday Hardwick selectmen agreed to put off a decision for at least two weeks after a public hearing.

The commission is under a firm statutory deadline of Nov. 15 to review and act on the racing applications. The process includes a public hearing in the each community where racing would take place and then a formal commission adjudicatory proceeding to consider and potentially approve the applications.

Early end to Wynn monitorship?

As the commission wrapped up a nearly two-hour agenda-setting session Wednesday commissioner Eileen O'Brien raised another matter that is likely to command some attention before the end of the year -- Wynn Resorts' petition to end the monitorship it has been under since 2019.

When the commission punished Wynn Resorts in April 2019 for its ""significant"" and ""repetitive"" failures related to sexual misconduct allegations against founder and former CEO Steve Wynn the $35 million fine also came with a requirement that the company pay for an independent law firm to monitor its activities for up to five years and conduct a full review of ""all policies and organizational changes adopted by the Company.""

""That order said that they would be under the monitorship for five years but they had the ability to come in at three [years] and petition for relief. They have done so they have filed a petition for relief to terminate the monitorship early"" O'Brien said.

Since three of the five commissioners have joined the body since the Wynn investigation and enforcement actions O'Brien said she thinks it would be helpful for the commission to be briefed on the monitor's work and findings before an adjudicatory hearing on the request to be let out of the extra oversight early.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXN0YWJiaW5nLXZpY3RpbS1zdXNwZWN0LWludGVudGlvbi1raWxsL3N0b3J5P2lkPTkxMjQ5MzQy0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvVVMvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXN0YWJiaW5nLXZpY3RpbS1zdXNwZWN0LWludGVudGlvbi1raWxsL3N0b3J5P2lkPTkxMjQ5MzQy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas stabbing victim says suspect 'had every intention' to kill,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXN0YWJiaW5nLXZpY3RpbS1zdXNwZWN0LWludGVudGlvbi1raWxsL3N0b3J5P2lkPTkxMjQ5MzQy0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvVVMvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXN0YWJiaW5nLXZpY3RpbS1zdXNwZWN0LWludGVudGlvbi1raWxsL3N0b3J5P2lkPTkxMjQ5MzQy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018EC7F30A60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXN0YWJiaW5nLXZpY3RpbS1zdXNwZWN0LWludGVudGlvbi1raWxsL3N0b3J5P2lkPTkxMjQ5MzQy0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvVVMvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXN0YWJiaW5nLXZpY3RpbS1zdXNwZWN0LWludGVudGlvbi1raWxsL3N0b3J5P2lkPTkxMjQ5MzQy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbXlmb3g4LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dhdGNoLWEtdmlkZW8taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtaW1wbG9zaW9ucy_SAUpodHRwczovL215Zm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy93YXRjaC1hLXZpZGVvLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtbGFzLXZlZ2FzLWltcGxvc2lvbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATCH: A video history of Las Vegas implosions,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://myfox8.com/news/watch-a-video-history-of-las-vegas-implosions/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbXlmb3g4LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dhdGNoLWEtdmlkZW8taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtaW1wbG9zaW9ucy_SAUpodHRwczovL215Zm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy93YXRjaC1hLXZpZGVvLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtbGFzLXZlZ2FzLWltcGxvc2lvbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zdGFiYmluZy1zcHJlZS1zdHJpcC8xMjMwNjE2OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stabbing spree Las Vegas: Victims speak out as suspect Yoni Barrios appears in court; Maris Digiovanni Brent Hallett ...,"'She didn't have to die': Las Vegas stabbing victim speaks out after witnessing friend killed

LAS VEGAS Nev. -- The suspect in a deadly Las Vegas stabbing rampage on the strip appeared in court Friday where new details emerged about the suspect and the attack.

Two of the showgirls stabbed in the attack are reliving the terrifying moments for the first time after a man went on a stabbing spree that injured six and left two others dead including their friend.

Anna Westby speaking from a hospital bed described 32-year-old Yoni Barrios walking up to them on Las Vegas Blvd in a chef's jacket carrying a foot-long kitchen knife and asking for a photo.

""He asked her for a photo with his logo. We said yes then he pulled out the knife. And we're like that's not a logo like a logo we were expecting"" said Westby one of the victims.

One of them said she felt uncomfortable and began to back away which is when the suspect charged at her according to an arrest report from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

The suspect stabbed one of the women in the back and the other woman in the chest killing the woman stabbed in the chest according to the report.

""He grabbed the knife... He grabbed it and stabbed Maris in the heart"" Westby recalled.

Police said Barrios stabbed them and then ran down the street stabbing others in his path.

He appeared in court for the first time Friday and has been booked on two counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. According to a law enforcement official Barrios confessed and said he was sorry.

""This is a serious case as I am sure everyone can understand what a tragedy it is to have occurred"" said Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson.

The stabbings took place Thursday near the Wynn Hotel and Casino the arrest report said. The incident was captured on surveillance video according to the report and homicide detectives interviewed several victims.

Barrios told police he thought the women were making fun of him which they strongly deny saying they work for tips.

""There was no -- not a single moment where he was provoked. Absolutely no there was no making fun of anyone. It was a game for him"" Westby said. ""He had every intention on killing her and killing us.""

Police interviewed another surviving victim at the UMC Trauma Center who told them he was walking on the Strip with his wife near the Wynn Hotel. He saw a man running toward him with a knife covered in blood and said the suspect said ""Sorry man"" as he stabbed him in the center of his back the report said.

Six people did survive the stabbing however three of them are in critical condition in the hospital. Two others 30-year-old Maris Digiovanni and 47-year-old Brent Hallett both died from their wounds.

When asked if Westby remembered her friend's last words she said ""It wasn't her words. It was her eyes... she didn't have to die.""

Their friend Victoria Cayetano was also stabbed but has been released from the hospital.

""I started running. I just started screaming 'he has a knife' and I ran as fast as I could. That's when I realized that I could really die"" Cayetano said.

Both women are survivors but said their dreams have been completely shattered.

Wolfson said investigators are still gathering information about the suspect. They have learned he came from California and has only been in Las Vegas for a short time he added. Barrios is not a US citizen according to Wolfson.

""Whether he is a citizen or not we're going to proceed based upon the evidence in this case so that has no effect at all"" Wolfson said.

When asked if deportation was an option Wolfson said he is ""not thinking about deportation right now.""

""I am thinking about filing very serious charges based upon the evidence and based upon what you all know occurred just yesterday"" Wolfson said.

The suspect is being held without bail according to court records.

CNN has reached out to Barrios' attorney for comment.

Anna Westby speaks from her hospital bed about the attack on her friend Maris DiGiovanni. Both were stabbed with a long knife on the sidewalk in front of the Wynn Las Vegas on Thursday Oct. 6 2022. (Best Showgirls in Vegas owner Cheryl Lowthorrp)

Anna Westby was stabbed in the back. Her friend Maris DiGiovanni was stabbed in the chest and bleeding profusely.

It was about 11:40 a.m. Thursday and the friends who work as showgirls on the Strip had just been attacked by a knife-wielding man near the pedestrian bridge in front of Wynn Las Vegas.

“And I start losing consciousness because I was losing so much blood and so I laid my head on Maris’ chest and I noticed that she stopped breathing” Westby said in a video phone call from her hospital bed on Saturday.

This is what Westby remembers from she and her friends’ brief but fateful encounter with a man police would later identify as Yoni Barrios 32.

“I’m doing OK I guess” Westby said in the video call provided by her employer Cheryl Lowthorp owner of Best Showgirls in Vegas. “Still in a lot of pain. I remember everything from (Thursday).”

2 counts of murder 6 counts of attempted murder

Barrios is accused of stabbing eight people killing two of them in a sudden broad daylight stabbing spree on a busy Las Vegas Boulevard.

He faces six counts of attempted murder and two counts of murder and was ordered held without bail in a court appearance Friday.

Barrios appeared before a TV camera in Los Angeles two days before the stabbing according to story and video clip posted on the website of Telemundo 52. Speaking to the camera Barrios said he had lost everything and needed help according to Telemundo.

DiGiovanni 30 of Las Vegas died of a stab wound to the chest the Clark County Coroner’s Office said.

Brent Hallett 47 also of Las Vegas died of a stab wound to the back the coroner said.

Westby who said she suffered a punctured lung fought through tears and lingering pain and nausea from the stabbing while recounting the encounter with Barrios.

“From the moment that we saw the knife to the moment that he stabbed Maris was two seconds” she said.

Westby said she and DiGiovanni and their fellow showgirl and friend Victoria Cayetano were on the Strip working when Barrios asked them to take a picture that would include him holding his company’s logo.

Westby said it’s common for people to request photos that might include them holding some sort of logo or promotional item.

But before they could even agree to take the photo Barrios reached into a bag and pulled out a piece of cloth which he unfolded revealing a knife. The three friends looked at each other not knowing what to make of the knife when suddenly Barrios plunged the knife into Maris’ chest Westby recalled.

“And he stabbed Maris in the heart and then Victoria and he chased Victoria and he stabbed her in the back” Westby said. “And Maris when she got stabbed she ran and I ran in the same direction as her and she collapsed like 15 feet away from where she was stabbed.”

No ridicule of suspect

Asked if there was any truth to the claim by Barrios according to his Metropolitan Police Department arrest report that he had been made fun of or ridiculed by the women and Westby angrily denounced Barrios as “a dangerous man that took multiple lives for no reason at all” and who should be “buried under the jail.”

“There was not a single moment where he was provoked” Westby said. “No there was no making fun of anyone.”

Even though Westby had also been stabbed she was more focused on trying to help her gravely wounded friend DiGiovanni.

“I guess when she fell she landed on her face. And I saw a lot of blood everywhere and so I flipped her over and I told this man to give me his shirt so I took his shirt and I held it against her wound and just pressed down on it and tried to stop the bleeding.

“And I’m screaming asking everyone ‘help!’ There was like 10 people just standing around. ‘Can someone call 911? Can someone help me?’”

Westby said a man told her that she had a stab wound to her back and asked if she was OK. Westby said no and asked the man to press his shirt against her back while she used another shirt to try to stop DiGiovanni’s bleeding. At the same time Westby said she was on the phone with 911.

XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNwci5vcmcvMjAyMi8xMC8wOC94Y2VsLWVuZXJneS1jb2xvcmFkby1uZXctcHJlc2lkZW50LXJvYmVydC1rZW5uZXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel Energy Colorado has a new boss. He says the trend of rising energy bills won't stop anytime soon,"Customers of the largest power company in Colorado should expect higher energy bills to pay for an expanding energy grid that includes upgrades to its natural gas facilities said Robert Kenney the newest president of Xcel Energy Colorado.

Kenney took the helm of Xcel’s state operations in June after serving as an executive for Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California. In an interview with CPR News this week he said the recent trend of rising energy bills likely wouldn’t end anytime soon.

“We will likely see some amount of increase as we continue to make investments in the system” Kenney said. “We're making the investments that we think are necessary to drive the clean energy transition while doing it safely and reliably.”

Kenney who has both worked with utilities and served as a utility regulator said he wants Xcel to model how investor-owned monopolies can change from coal to cleaner sources of energy.

At the same time he reiterated the company’s position on natural gas insisting customers should pay for power plants to burn the fuel and pipelines to carry it to new homes. Kenney said those plans won’t lock in more emissions because natural gas systems could someday run on carbon-free fuels like green hydrogen a point that’s faced fierce skepticism from researchers and environmental groups.

Climate scientists have also drawn a clear line on new fossil fuel infrastructure. Earlier this year the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a new report saying any new investment in such systems wasn’t compatible with international climate goals.

State regulators this year allowed Xcel to increase prices to correlate with rising costs in wholesale natural gas. The Minnesota-based company expects the average household will see their bills jump 54 percent this December compared to a year earlier.

The company will soon need to seek further rate increases to pay for new investments. The Colorado Public Utilities Commission recently approved nearly $10 billion in Xcel’s plans for new transmission lines and power generation to replace coal-fired power plants. The utility will recoup the cost of those projects from customers over the coming decades — plus an additional profit for their shareholders.

To reduce the effect on monthly bills the company has incentives for customers who use less energy or make their homes more energy efficient Kenney said. Xcel will also buy and store enough natural gas before the winter heating season to help guard against high prices that would be passed onto customers he said.

The utility used one of those programs the AC Rewards Smart Thermostats program when its newest coal-fired generator broke down again last month this time during a heat wave. The company did not warn the 22000 customers who signed up for the program that it would take control of their thermostats nor were they able to override the change. The move frustrated many customers and generated public backlash online.

“It's a component and a feature of the program that customers were voluntarily aware of when they signed up for it” Kenney said acknowledging Xcel should remind customers more often about those terms.

Xcel Energy continues to burn natural gas for electricity. The recently approved plan for new investments includes money for “dispatchable resources” which could include improvements to existing natural gas power plants and new facilities. Kenney said these upgrades are necessary to maintain a reliable electricity grid and maintain low costs for customers. He added the company plans to purchase fuel certified as “responsibly sourced” natural gas.

“There's no inconsistency in continuing to use natural gas for heating and for power generation” Kenney said. “We just wanna make sure that we're doing it as cleanly as possible.”

Kenney said he was approached to lead the utility because of his experience on “both sides of the bench” as chair of the Missouri Public Service Commission and later as a vice president with PG&E.

The California utility has faced government scrutiny and penalties for its electric grid which sparked wildfires that have killed more than 100 people since 2015 according to PBS’ FRONTLINE. It pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection to 2018’s Camp Fire one of the deadliest wildfires in U.S. history.

Utilities need to evolve their electrical systems to prepare for wildfires that are becoming more frequent and furious because of climate change Kenney said. That could mean burying power lines underground or clearing more trees and vegetation near lines he said.

“That work is underway now” for Xcel Energy he said though he did not go into specifics. The company filed its own wildfire preparedness plan with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission in 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS90d2luLWNpdGllcy1idXNpbmVzc2VzLWNhc2hsZXNzLzYwMDIxNDA3Mi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Many Twin Cities venues went cashless during the pandemic — and are not looking back,"Cash is not just going out of style it's already gone in some places.

Aaron Graves and her fiancé discovered that at one of the last Twins games of the year. They left their credit cards in the car figuring they could just use cash at the stadium.

They were wrong.

The couple were among the fans turned away at concessions stands and redirected to a sleek white kiosk — one of five so-called reverse ATMs around Target Field. The sign on the machines says ""Convert cash to card.""

""It's odd to me"" said Graves after the couple inserted cash into the machine and got a pre-paid debit card. ""You would think you could use cash anywhere.""

Many airlines stopped accepting cash years ago at check-in counters and on flights. In the pandemic sports stadiums amusement parks and restaurants moved to cashless transactions as a way to limit contact make do with fewer workers and to be more efficient.

The share of payments made with cash went from 26% in 2019 to 19% in 2020 according to an annual consumer survey by the Federal Reserve. It ticked up slightly last year to 20%.

The Salvation Army which encourages people to toss dollars and coins into its red kettles around the holidays has added QR codes in recent years for donors to make digital payments.

All the major sports venues in the Twin Cities have stopped accepting cash — Target Field Target Center U.S. Bank Stadium Xcel Energy Center and Allianz Field. So has Valleyfair.

Some high schools have also stopped accepting cash to attend games and moved to online ticketing systems.

As more businesses go cashless some consumer advocates are concerned that people who don't use credit cards smartphones or even banks will be shut out. An estimated 5.4% of Americans didn't have a checking or savings account in 2019.

""That's a potential concern"" said Ted Rossman senior industry analyst with Bankrate.com. ""Although to be fair it's maybe a bit of a self-selecting audience [going to a sport arena or concert hall] because chances are to get into that venue in the first place you may have had to buy a ticket with a credit or debit card.""

Before the pandemic some elected officials became alarmed by the shift toward cashless. Lawmakers in New York City Philadelphia and San Francisco passed measures that required businesses to accept cash. But the momentum for those kinds of laws seems to have slowed since the pandemic.

Companies like Ready Credit based in Eden Prairie offer businesses a way to go cashless while still abiding by laws where they exist. The firm which has about 45 employees now has its machines in about 80 sports stadiums 60 amusement parks and 110 airports.

In the Twin Cities they can be found at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport Valleyfair and Target Field.

""We get a significant number of inbound inquiries every day about cashless"" said Ready Credit CEO Brian Hedberg who added that going cashless can help businesses find cost savings and become more profitable.

Since 2019 Ready Credit has tripled the number of kiosks it has deployed — to more than 1100. Now it's looking to grow more globally while also piloting its kiosks in movie theaters and hotels that are also moving toward cashless operations.

In addition to not having to fumble with bills and coins experts say there are other costs associated with cash such as theft — either by outside criminals or by employees — as well as counting cash armored car fees and trips to the bank.

""Handling cash can be expensive"" Bankrate's Rossman said.

For credit cards businesses pay swipe fees of around 2% of a purchase total. But Rossman noted data shows that people also spend more money when they use credit cards.

Concerns that initially arose in the pandemic about the safety of handling cash have mostly subsided. But many venue operators say they're not planning to go back to accepting cash.

""Now that we're there it's kind of hard to dial that back"" said Matt Hoy the Twins' senior vice president of operations.

A handful of stadiums around the U.S. had begun to go cashless before the pandemic. Hoy was initially skeptical of the concept saying he didn't think fans would want to pass their credit cards down a row to a hawker.

But then the pandemic came along and venues everywhere were looking for ways to enhance safety and minimize touchpoints to make people feel more comfortable. At the same time many also rolled out mobile ordering through smartphone apps.

""Cash used to be king but COVID changed all of that for consumers who worried about germs and dirty bills"" said Melissa Ferlaak a spokeswoman for Valleyfair. ""So we really saw a strong benefit to going cashless.""

She added that it's also helped the park speed things up at concession stands so customers spend less time in lines.

Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul began moving toward cashless operations in 2019 when it first rolled out its mobile ordering system aimed at reducing wait times. It fully converted in fall 2020 said Kelly McGrath a spokeswoman for the arena.

Instead of cash-to-card kiosks the arena has a guest services counter where employees can help people put cash onto an online account in the mobile ordering app.

McGrath added that the venue doesn't see many people who do so.

""We certainly operate it as a service because we don't want that to prohibit someone from having an enjoyable experience here but the vast majority of people either have Apple Pay or a credit card payment as an option"" she said.

Representatives of Target Center U.S. Bank Stadium and Allianz Field confirmed they do not have reverse ATMs on-site and did not specify any other accommodations for people who arrive with only cash.

Ready Credit which first launched in 2005 initially put its machines in retail stores to offer a quicker way for consumers who primarily use cash to get a prepaid debit card.

Its kiosks first appeared in 2017 at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport where there are now four of them. In 2018 there were about 18000 transactions on those machines according to airport spokesperson Jeff Lea.

There is a $6 fee to use the cash-to-card kiosks in airports. But there's no fee at stadiums or amusement parks where the operators of those venues pay Ready Credit Hedberg said.

Hedberg added that the kiosks have a broader appeal beyond just those who don't have credit or debit cards. Some people just prefer to use cash. And parents may not want to hand over their credit card to a child they're dropping off at an amusement park.

At a recent Twins game some of those who found themselves at the reverse ATM didn't have a payment card. Others like Darnell Gray had a debit card but didn't want to use it.

""I have to pay some bills unfortunately so I can't use that card"" said Gray who was using the machine so he could buy tickets to attend a game the next day.

He's a bartender at the stadium and not a big fan of the cashless environment. Every game somebody tries to buy drinks from him with cash.

""All the time"" Gray said. ""I send them to these.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW1pZGppcGlvbmVlci5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3Byby9kZXd5LTEtYW5kLWRld3ktMS10aGUtdW5icmVha2FibGUtYm9uZC1vZi13aWxkLXdpbmdlcnMtYnJhbmRvbi1kdWhhaW1lLWFuZC1jb25ub3ItZGV3YXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dewy 1 and Dewy 2: The unbreakable bond of Wild wingers Brandon Duhaime and Connor Dewar,"ST. PAUL -- Minnesota Wild wingers Brandon Duhaime and Connor Dewar don’t know professional hockey without each other. They signed with the organization about a month apart three years ago and developed a bond in the minor leagues playing for the Iowa Wild of the American Hockey League.

Now both players are expected to be in the Wild lineup for Thursday’s season opener against the New York Rangers at Xcel Energy Center. It’s only right that they’re going to be playing on the same line when the puck drops.

“It’s awesome” Duhaime said. “We started in Iowa together and roomed together throughout that whole process. It was pretty special to play with him last year and to have him here this year is pretty cool.”

“It’s funny to look back at where we were at the start of our careers to where we are now” Dewar added. “I couldn’t be happier to do it with him by my side. Not only is he a great teammate he’s an even better friend.”

As far as first impressions go Duhaime 25 said he thought Dewar 23 was “a shy nerd” before he really got to know him.

“He was a little dork” Duhaime said with a laugh. “He kept to himself at first and then really started to loosen up.”

On the flip side Dewar had a more lasting memory when asked about his first impression of Duhaime. After signing with the organization they spent part of the summer living together in a Twin Cities apartment. Naturally they often went grocery shopping together as roommates do.

“It was my first time living away from home without a billet or anything” Dewar said. “He’d been to college for a few years so I figured he’d know how to cook.”

Wrong.

“We got back from grocery shopping and he came to my room and was like ‘You know how to cook rice?’ ” Dewar said. “I was like ‘Uh not really. Just look it up.’ The fire alarm started going off a few minutes later. He somehow set the fire alarm off cooking rice.”

After being made aware that Dewar had outed his culinary skills or lack thereof Duhaime rolled his eyes and gave his side of the story. It turns out he wasn’t even using the stove. He simply forgot to vent the bag of Uncle Ben’s rice before putting it into the microwave.

“It sounded like a grenade went off” Duhaime said. “That was bad.”

Always together

Moments like this don’t surprise Iowa Wild coach Tim Army. He’s got a bunch of stories about Duhaime and Dewar who he nicknamed Dewy 1 and Dewy 2 respectively in the minors because they never left each other’s side.

ADVERTISEMENT

“They would always give it to each other” Army said. “They would make a mistake in practice or something and the other guy would come up to me and say ‘Wake up Brandon he’s sleeping today’ or ‘Wake up Connor he’s sleeping today.’ I loved that interaction between them. It always made me laugh. It was fun the way they would get on each other.”

Make no mistake though as silly as Duhaime and Dewar can be off the ice they are all business on it. They were among the hardest-working players on the team in Des Moines which is why it was no surprise to Army that both went on to play meaningful minutes in the NHL last season.

That explains why Wild coach Dean Evason decided not to mess with a good thing. He made a point to put Duhaime and Dewar on the same line last season and has kept the pair together this season.

“We like them on a line together” Evason said. “They have a chemistry and they communicate very well.”

That communication has helped the pair get to this point in their career.

“Whether I’m down on myself or he’s down on himself we know we always have someone to go to” Duhaime said. “That’s pretty cool to have.”

Asked what connected them in the early stages of their friendship both agreed that it was circumstance more than anything else.

“We’ve just been pushed together wherever we’ve been” Dewar said. “We were roommates at our first training camp. We were roommates down in Des Moines. We go to the rink together. We have similar interests away from the rink. We also both had similar paths.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The latter might offer some insight into how their connection has been so lasting.

“We’ve both earned everything we’ve gotten in our career” Dewar said. “I think that kind of bonds us. It’s something we really appreciate about each other.”

Who knows where Duhaime and Dewar would be right now if it wasn’t for the other. Maybe they don’t get to the NHL without being able to lean on each other ever step of the way. Luckily neither Dewy 1 nor Dewy 2 has to live in that hypothetical.

“I look at them like brothers” Army said. “They are always going to be there for each other. They also don’t want to be outdone by each other. That level of competition drives them. That’s their relationship and it’s a really positive thing for both of them.”

It’s a really positive thing for the Wild too.

PAUL — Wild goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury had just spotted former teammate Sidney Crosby’s stall from across the locker room shortly after arriving at the 2022 NHL Media Tour last month in Henderson Nevada. He knew he didn’t have much time.

Instantly the soon-to-be-38-year-old Fleury sprung into action collecting Crosby’s gear into a pile on the ground. He found a few rolls of hockey tape nearby and got to work hurriedly twirling the adhesive around shoulder pads shin guards and hockey skates.

“He filled my gear with gum last year” Fleury said as he rushed to finish taping everything together. “I don’t forget.”

As soon as Fleury was satisfied with his efforts he hung Crosby’s taped-up gear back in his stall then draped the No. 87 Pittsburgh Penguins jersey in front to cover up the crime.

It took Crosby all of 10 seconds to realize what had happened when he walked into the locker room.

“Oh Flower got me” Crosby said. “That’s why I should’ve beaten him here.”

After freeing his gear from the mess Crosby started to get dressed as Fleury walked by and shouted “What’s going on dude?” As Crosby casually reached to grab his helmet a cup of water came spilling down in front of him. A final gift from Fleury.

“It wasn’t me” Fleury said. “It got in here and it was like that. I was like ‘Who would do that?’ ”

Anyone who has ever been teammates with Fleury knows the answer to that question.

As much as he has been a revered teammate at every stop of his career Fleury also has garnered the reputation as the ultimate prankster.

Though he was only a member of the Wild for a few months last season after being acquired at the trade deadline his teammates quickly learned the importance of watching their backs.

“Oh yeah” said defenseman Alex Goligoski the victim of Fleury’s first prank as a member of the Wild last season. “He came right in and got me with the old shaving cream in the towels. I always look out for the towels now. We’ve got to be on our toes around him.”

This is something Fleury has done since he got to the league in 2003. He learned the craft from veterans like Ryan Malone and Marc Bergevin during his early days with the Penguins and was an active participant in some pretty impressive prank wars.

“We had to have our head on a swivel” Fleury remembered of his days in Pittsburgh. “It could be anyone doing it.”

There’s a particular prank that stands above all others. It is considered by many to be Fleury’s magnum opus.

In the lead up to the 2011 Winter Classic in Pittsburgh Fleury convinced some of his teammates to help him remove every piece of furniture from the hotel room of Mark Letestu and Ben Lovejoy. After clearing the room Fleury and his teammates set up the beds night stands television and couch in the hallway right outside the elevator.

“That’s a fun one” Fleury said with a laugh. “Even if it’s a lot of work it’s worth it for the reaction.”

While that still gets a lot of attention it’s not Fleury’s favorite prank. What is?

“The toilet prank” Fleury said proudly before launching into a full explanation. “You know when the toilet gets flushed the water comes back in the tube inside the tank right? Then when the tank is full the water stops. That tube inside is rubber so I unplug it and put it on the outside and put the cover back on top of the tank so they can’t tell. Then when they flush the water comes shooting out.”

Listening to Fleury detail his favorite prank might explain why Wild defenseman Matt Dumba hasn’t tested him yet. He doesn’t want to get on Fleury’s bad side.

“I’d rather team up with him” Dumba said. “I guess we’ll see what happens over the course of this season. I’m sure there will be some pranks. I’m always ready.”

ADVERTISEMENT

If anyone on the Wild can rival Fleury for hijinks it might be Dumba. He was part of a group that pranked rookie Brandon Duhaime last year filling his car to the brim with packing peanuts.

Though it wasn’t Fleury who pulled the prank Duhaime joked that he would be an easy fall guy.

“He’s got the reputation” Duhaime said with a laugh. “He’s probably got some ideas that we don’t know about and I’m sure he’ll strike soon. You don’t want to get in a prank war with that guy. You just let it be.”

Asked why he’s leaned into the pranks throughout his NHL career Fleury noted how it’s always helped him break up the monotony of an 82-game season.

“It makes me laugh a little bit” he said. “I’m not mean with it. Like I don’t just go burn their car or something. It’s little stupid stuff to have some fun.”

When it was suggested to Fleury that perhaps his pranks might help bring the Wild together he pushed back on that notion a bit. He didn’t want to take credit for the team chemistry that was already in place before he got here.

“Oh I don’t know” he said. “I think that’s a big thing to say about some stupid pranks. It’s not like it’s making us win the Stanley Cup or anything like that.”

That said it’s clear how much Fleury’s infectious personality has already started to impact the Wild and his reputation as a prankster is part of that.

ADVERTISEMENT

“He definitely elevates guys” Dumba said. “That’s why he’s had so much success in his career. His teammates absolutely love him. You want to play for a guy like that and sell out for a guy like that and give him the best opportunity to succeed because he’s such a good dude.”

As for Fleury he appreciates his teammates for keeping him young now that he’s the old guy in the locker room.

“When I think about this game I’ve always been around some 20-something-year-olds” Fleury said with a smile. “It’s a big reason why I still love it. Just the camaraderie. I don’t feel my age.”

Heat exchangers are engineering devices that do exactly as their name implies: they exchange heat between two spaces. While complicated in structure their basic working principle remains unchanged: circulate a working fluid to transfer heat between two systems where the desired action is either to cool heat or equalize one/ both system(s). To get a fuller understanding of the workings of these devices consult our article on understanding heat exchangers.

Heat exchangers must be fabricated correctly as they are integral components in refrigeration power production transportation and other vital applications. They are built with specific thermodynamic goals in mind and so most heat exchangers are custom-made or are at least rated for highly specific rates of heating/cooling. Heat exchanger manufacturers ensure these devices do exactly as intended by both designing and rigorously testing their products for their customers and this article will explore the top featured heat exchanger manufacturers on Thomas as well as the top manufacturers and suppliers in the United States.

Twenty-three customers in the restaurant’s drive-through lane took turns Thursday paying for the person next in line behind them — a new record-high number at the restaurant.

“It was kind of unreal” said employee Sharlene Wincek who was working the drive-through lane at the time.

The spontaneous gesture of goodwill toward strangers impressed the McDonald’s crew so much that Wincek posted it on Facebook congratulating Union Grove for the community’s generosity.

It also turned an average day at work into a memorable and heartwarming experience.

Restaurant manager Tyler Gaethke said he was amazed to see so many people reach into their pockets and connect with total strangers through mutual benevolence.

“Sometimes you have good days and bad days” Gaethke said. “But that was a great day.”

The concept of “pay it forward” — popularized by a 2000 movie with that name — involves random acts of kindness toward others typically by buying their coffee meal or groceries. It is often done anonymously so a recipient never knows who their secret donor was.

At the Union Grove McDonald’s restaurant 835 15th Avenue which serves about 900 customers a day employees usually see someone pay it forward in the drive-through lane about once a day.

A recipient has the option of grabbing their free lunch and leaving. But frequently when someone discovers that their meal has been paid for they continue the spirit of giving by anonymously paying for the person in line behind them. And so on.

The previous record-high streak at the restaurant was 15 people in a row.

Bob Wright of Burlington was No. 8 in the sequence Thursday. When Wincek told him that his Big Mac meal had been paid for Wright smiled and took care of the next customer.

Even though it ended up costing Wright a few dollars more than his own lunch would have cost he said it felt good to help someone else.

“It seemed like the right thing to do” he said. “Someone buys you lunch — why not?”

Wincek said she is always careful not to pressure people into continuing a pay-it-forward streak. She realizes that money is tight and that even just a few dollars can make a big difference for some families.

When Wincek watched one customer after another pay it forward until 23 had participated she was speechless.

Several of them paid more than what their own meal would have cost. But whether the next customer was getting a simple cup of coffee or lunch for a carload of people everyone just continued giving and giving.

“It was beautiful” Wincek said. “I feel like it’s the community coming together.”

The process sometimes slows things down in the restaurant’s drive-through lane as employees take a moment to explain to each customer what is happening.

But no one seems to mind the minor inconvenience.

Autumn Russell a shift manager at the restaurant said she has worked at other McDonald’s locations in the past. She has never seen so many people pay it forward as she does in Union Grove.

Russell said she will not complain about the line moving a little more slowly.

“People want to help each other out” she said. “It’s wonderful.”

By offering companionship comfort and motivation to get moving animals can have a hugely positive impact on our mental wellbeing.

Jamie Brannan is the President of International Operations at Zoetis.

Accelerated by the combined impacts of COVID-19 a challenging economic outlook and environmental crisis the topic of mental health is more prevalent than ever in the political discourse. In last month’s 2022 State of the Union Address Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a new comprehensive approach to mental health that will be presented in full next year which will aim to improve understanding of mental health issues and how they are addressed.

Complimenting existing EU strategies and the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing which emphasize the need for increased mental health and wellbeing support this new initiative presents an opportunity to change our approach to ensure better care for all.

Mental health is complex and healthcare systems are becoming more open to therapeutic tools that don’t include traditional medication. For example psychiatrists in Belgium are now able to prescribe art and museum visits to people suffering from mental health issues.2 Could they prescribe interaction with companion animals next?

Pets and companion animals have been present in all cultures of the world since ancient times and the power of the human-animal bond is remarkable. Not only does having pets in the home nurture cognitive emotional social and physical development human-animal interactions are also proven to reduce anxiety depression and loneliness as they enhance social support and general wellbeing.34

Personally my dog Rocco has always been a key family member but he was a saving grace during the lockdowns over the last years of the pandemic. During days filled with Zoom meetings my family and I gained a new sense of appreciation for him as he got us out for walks that helped us get more exercise and created a special time to connect together in the fresh air.

To investigate the positive impact that pets can have on people in 2010 Zoetis co-founded the Human Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI) which has gathered funded and shared scientific evidence of the positive health impacts of companion animals. The Institute has created the world’s largest research library for the study of the human-animal bond and is funding an increasing number of groundbreaking research projects that will ultimately help millions of people benefit from the healing power of pets.

One of those recent projects has been a survey of 18145 dog and cat owners and 1357 small animal veterinarians from nine countries including Brazil China France Germany Japan Mexico Spain the United Kingdom and the United States. Virtually all pet owners around the world (98%) reported at least one benefit to their health from their pets including increased happiness reduced loneliness and decreased stress and 88% of pet owners say they’ve experienced mental health and/or physical health benefits of the human-animal bond.5

However even with a growing body of data in support of human-animal interactions to foster wellbeing there is currently no EU policy or legislative initiative dedicated to advancing its use in healthcare.

Quite the contrary diverse barriers to pet ownership exist and the full potential of the mutually beneficial human-animal health relationship is not realized. For example these barriers include lack of access to public spaces such as restaurants pet travel restrictions and insurance and licensing issues.

To remove these obstacles we would like to encourage policymakers to explore the following ideas and policy recommendations:

Develop EU-wide actions to raise awareness on the mutually reinforcing human-animal bond on health e.g. role of companion animals in social care;

Support pet-owner friendly environments that are proven to benefit society’s mental wellbeing;

Roll out initiatives to raise awareness and provide guidance on the healthy ageing of pets among pet owners of all generations; and

Facilitate access to and affordability of the whole care pathway for pets from preventive approaches to treatment.

At Zoetis we are committed to supporting the path to pet ownership so that more people can enjoy the myriad benefits of adding an animal to their family. Among others our full portfolio of products for prevention and treatment of diseases expands the veterinary care access to underserved populations and communities in need and we invest in the human-animal bond via charitable programs that reach tens of thousands of people a year.

We relish the opportunity to discuss with policymakers and other stakeholders on ways to further strengthen the wellbeing relationship between people and their pets.",,,,,,,,,,,,
