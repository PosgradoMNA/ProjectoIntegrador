This fall the towns and rural farmsteads along the Mississippi River received alarming news about their drinking water. Chemicals from a large 3M factory north of Cordova Illinois found a way into the river and their wells.

The facility employs about 500 people and makes the adhesives used in Post-It notes Scotch tape and other popular products. It also produces a family of chemicals called PFAS otherwise known as “forever chemicals” whose threat to human health has prompted increasing concern among federal and state environmental agencies.

Water and wastewater sampling by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2019 detected the chemicals. Now the agency says the drinking water of nearly 300000 people including the Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa will need additional testing to ensure it is safe.

Earlier this month the EPA announced that PFAS contamination from the 3M factory has created “an imminent and substantial endangerment” of public and private drinking water supplies. In a Nov. 2 EPA order Minnesota-based 3M agreed to investigate PFAS contamination in private wells and public water systems up to 10 miles away from the plant.

The situation has left local officials in a dilemma: they want to reassure people about their drinking water even as they face unanswered questions about health risks and who will pay to clean up the contamination.

City officials in Camanche Iowa announced in September that the municipal water which serves almost 4600 people tested positive for two of the chemicals above EPA limits.

The city advised residents to contact their health care providers or consider installing home filters. Now officials are informing water customers that the city is seeking “expert guidance” from state and federal authorities and will provide more information when it becomes available.

“As of right now we are in a ‘test and wait’ phase on PFAS issues” Camanche Public Works Director Gaylon Pewe wrote on the city’s website. City officials did not respond to a request for an interview.

Their announcements have not eased the fears of several Camanche residents who on social media reacted to the city’s latest press release with dismay. Is the water safe to drink several asked.

“If it’s that serious you know do some surveys and find out what’s going on” Camanche resident Gary Hopkins 78 said in an interview. “Then get it to the doctors and the scientists and figure out what they can do to stop it.”

The 3M plant has been a fixture in Cordova since the facility opened in 1970. The EPA permits the company to discharge its wastewater into the Mississippi River but 3M must monitor it for PFAS.

In 2019 3M informed the agency it was releasing more of the chemicals from the factory than previously reported. Testing has revealed the presence of at least 60 PFAS analytes within the vicinity.

PFAS or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a class of human-made compounds that do not break down easily in the environment and bioaccumulate in organisms. Some are linked to a range of health problems like altered hormone levels decreased birth weight digestive inflammation and ulcers high cholesterol hypertension in pregnancy kidney and testicular cancers and reduced vaccine effectiveness in children.

They are ubiquitous in consumer and industrial products but for people living near contaminated sites drinking water is typically the main source of exposure of the odorless and tasteless chemicals.

In June the EPA updated draft health advisories for PFOA and PFOS to levels so low as to suggest that no amount of PFAS is safe for consumption — a lifetime limit of 0.004 parts per trillion and 0.02 ppt of the two compounds respectively — equivalent to just a few drops in the combined volume of water in thousands of swimming pools.

This summer 3M began testing some of the drinking water near Cordova for PFAS and offered to sample about 190 private wells within a 3-mile radius of the plant. The company later started to contact private well owners with an offer to install in-home water treatment systems regardless of their sampling results.

Under the EPA order 3M now must offer well sampling to properties within a 4-mile radius of the plant that were not previously included in its outreach. Testing can begin after the agency approves a work plan the company will submit by early December.

Meanwhile 3M is required to test area public water suppliers within 10 miles of the plant. An agency spokesperson declined to say what specific actions the EPA might take if testing reveals contamination in those facilities.

The agency also ordered 3M to develop a special work plan for the city of Camanche located north of the Cordova plant in Iowa. The plan must include the provision of an alternative drinking water supply or water treatment.

Grant Thompson a 3M spokesperson directed people who are concerned about the safety of their drinking water to government websites that address “PFAS-related questions.”

The city of Camanche has issued similar advice.

Numerous river communities downstream of the plant have detectable levels of PFAS in their water treatment systems and continue to test for the chemicals.

Charlie Brown utilities lab manager for the city of Moline said PFAS removal is expensive and there are downsides to taking action too soon.

Treatment standards are likely to change next year when the EPA announces its final recommendations for four PFAS chemicals he said. Research on PFAS removal also is apt to provide water plant operators with additional treatment options in coming years.

Brown said Moline residents contacted him several months ago to inquire if they can drink their water.

“Of course the water is safe” Brown said. “We wouldn’t put it out if it wasn’t and we would let people know.”

Moline tests city water quarterly. Results from December 2021 indicated two PFAS compounds exceeded the EPA’s guidelines but just one tested above the state of Illinois’ health advisory limit which is less stringent.

“We’ll have to wait to see where more funding comes for the actual treatment” Brown said. “But we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves in treatment until we know what the (final EPA PFAS) limits are going to be and then what the science will be for treatment.”

3M has faced several legal cases for PFAS production. Other than in Cordova it has two major US plants that produce the chemicals: in the Twin Cities Minnesota and in Decatur Alabama. The state of Minnesota sued the company over mismanaged PFAS waste from its Cottage Grove plant and in 2018 settled for $850 million to treat drinking water there. 3M also settled multiple lawsuits in Alabama last year for $99 million.

But perhaps the most significant situation centered on the company’s chemical plant near Antwerp Belgium where Flemish authorities briefly shut down production of the chemicals. 3M ultimately struck a $600 million remediation deal.

Beyond the factories that actually make the chemicals 3M’s other major legal threat comes from lawsuits over the products that use PFAS like firefighting foam. Thousands of civil cases have been consolidated in federal court in Charleston South Carolina and now the company is facing lawsuits from California Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

David Cwiertny a University of Iowa engineering professor and director of the Center for Health Effects of Environmental Contamination said if his drinking water tested positive for PFAS he would install a home water treatment system such as carbon filters or reverse osmosis.

“It’s jarring to have your water supply be something that you immediately don’t trust” he said. “And even with treatment a lot of people won’t trust what’s coming out of their taps and that trust is hard to regain and rebuild.”

Linda Vaughn is among thousands of residents living north of the Quad Cities who are confronting the question of whether they can safely drink water from their taps. She lives just four miles from a 3M plant whose PFAS contamination has created “an imminent and substantial endangerment” of public and private drinking water supplies according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. (Juanpablo Ramirez-Franco / WNIJ Northern Public Radio)

As communities surrounding Cordova grapple with the difficult cleanup ahead Cwiertny said it is all but certain they will not be the last.

Linda Vaughn a retired school bus driver lives about four miles from the 3M plant on the Illinois side of the river. She already avoids what comes out of her well but wonders whether she will have to do more. Vaughn drinks bottled water while her husband drinks filtered water from their refrigerator.

“I don’t know if that covers it” she said. “I don’t think we’ve had any problems so far. And my husband’s in his 70s. I’m in my 70s.”

In a 20-page Nov. 15 order Court of Claims Judge Brock Swartzle sided with 3M Corp. agreeing that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration violated administrative procedure by failing to properly account for certain business costs while setting groundwater cleanup rules in late 2020.

Swartzle invalidated the rules but citing their public benefit and expected standard-setting at the federal level paused that effect pending the outcome of appeals.

“The interests of public health weigh in favor of this stay so that the parties can pursue appellate relief and the Department can consider if it wishes whether additional regulatory actions should be taken in the meantime” Swartzle wrote.

The decision arises from 3M’s challenge last May to Michigan’s new drinking water standards for PFAS which the company claimed had been developed by the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy (EGL) through a “rushed and invalid regulatory process.”

Swartzle sided with EGLE on that count agreeing that the standards called maximum contaminant levels or MCLs were properly developed under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

Michigan begin drafting PFAS drinking water standards in March 2019 for seven different PFAS compounds following toxicology reviews that started in 2018. The new rules took effect in August 2020 after the state legislature declined to block them. It marked the first time Michigan developed its own drinking water standards for a contaminant rather than adopting or modifying existing federal standards.

However the judge says EGLE violated the state Administrative Procedures Act when it subsequently attempted a second round of rulemaking to codify those MCLs as groundwater cleanup criteria under Part 201 of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA).

According to Swartzle EGLE deferred a consideration of business compliance costs when developing PFAS standards for drinking water systems and then when applying those standards to groundwater cleanups cited “the prior promulgated rules as in effect a ‘done deal.’”

Swartzle likened that to playing “a shell game with the public.”

Under state law such cleanup rules are used to govern the remediation of toxic pollutants like PFAS which have been often referred to as “forever chemicals” because of their resistance to degradation in the environment and within the bodies of people exposed to them.

Existence of such rules gives the state leverage to force cleanup or sue polluters at sites where the chemicals exceed the allowable levels in groundwater.

The state has aggressively moved to search out PFAS contamination following the onset of statewide drinking water testing in 2018. There are more than 230 sites under investigation around Michigan where PFAS in the groundwater exceeds the state’s cleanup criteria.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office has used that criteria to sue 3M and other chemical manufacturers and PFAS users in an effort to force cleanups and recoup other public costs. The latest case was filed in September against a corporate successor to Keeler Brass a manufacturer which left contamination scattered around Kent County.

A trial in one case versus Asahi Kasei Plastics North America over PFAS contamination at the site of a Brighton factory fire is scheduled for March after being pushed several times.

Nessel’s office would not provide comment about the Swartzle order. EGLE did not immediately responded to inquiries.

Sean Lynch a spokesperson for 3M said the company “supports fluorochemical regulation that is based on the best available science and established regulatory processes.”

“We agree with the court’s decision reinforcing the importance of following established processes” Lynch said. “We are committed to continuing our work with community and government stakeholders to chart a path forward.”

3M has attempted to knock down similar PFAS rules in New Jersey and New Hampshire. It is potentially facing billions in liability costs related to PFAS litigation many cases of which have been consolidated in a massive federal action in South Carolina. Multiple cases filed by Nessel’s office in 2020 have been consolidated there.

Paul Albarran an attorney at Varnum Law who has litigated PFAS cases against 3M and Wolverine Worldwide said the issue appears to be “fixable” for the state.

“The regulations are in place. The court found that the state had done just about everything right except for one small thing” Albarran said. “I think ultimately this is going to end up being like the status quo but it’s just a matter of how it’s going to get there.”

“It’s a good thing the order was stayed.”

Oday Salim an environmental law professor at the University of Michigan called the order “sensible” for leaving the rules in place and giving the state a chance to fix them.

“3M basically lost” Salim said. “They lost on everything that was substantive. They wanted to throw the whole thing out. They were saying the state doesn’t even have the authority to promulgate these rules.”

“And the judge shut that down pretty quickly.”

In the order Swartzle noted that 3M’s challenge to Michigan’s drinking water standards might become “effectively moot” once the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalizes national drinking water standards for some PFAS chemicals which is expected next fall.

The EPA is also adding two individual chemicals from the PFAS family PFOS and PFOA to the list of substances regulated as “hazardous” under federal Superfund law which will give the agency authority to order cleanups similar to what Michigan previously developed.

Mike Johnston vice president of government affairs at the Michigan Manufacturers Association (MMA) which opposed the PFAS standards during development said the organization appreciated Swartzle “holding this state government accountable for creating rules according to the recorded procedures.”

Charlotte Jameson chief policy officer for Michigan Environmental Council which supported the standards during development called on Democrats to use their new control over the state Legislature in 2023 to reform state rulemaking.

“For decades industry in Michigan has eroded good governance by making our rule adoption process convoluted and evaded accountability by opposing legislation that would require them to truly clean up their pollution” Jameson said. “We need legislative reforms that put public health and our environment instead of industry’s bottom line back at the center of both rulemaking and our contamination cleanup programs.”

Welcome back to the halls of Abbott Elementary after a brief break in episodes last week. The wait was worth it — Janine learns the dangers of toxic positivity when she insists her second-graders participate in the eighth-grader’s egg-drop lesson. This is an important canon moment for Abbott Elementary as this confirmed the school teaches middle-school-aged students. Although I knew Jacob teaches older kids I had no idea there were students as old as eighth grade at Abbott. I love this because with older students comes a whole other set of problems. By eighth grade the idyllic days of nap time and storybooks are long gone. The world becomes harsher and less forgiving. Right and wrong go beyond sharing and being a good friend — now there are consequences and the scientific method.

Personality types like Gregory and the eighth-grade teacher Mr. Morton thrive within the rigidity and confines of science. But others like Janine prefer open-ended creativity where everyone wins as long as you believe in yourself. When Gregory asks her if the egg drop may be too advanced for her students Janine replies “Learning should be fun and about new experiences and not whether or not the eggs break.” Gregory counters “It’s actually only about whether or not the eggs break.”

All this egg talk gets Melissa interested and now her class is participating in the experiment too. The second-graders work hard on their egg containers with the project essentially being another arts-and-crafts activity. They use glitter construction paper pipe cleaners and googly eyes to adorn their little egg carriers as Janine gushes over their imaginations. One student Eli loves his creation so much he names it Ralph and proclaims he’s his best friend … and his only friend.

The second- and eighth-graders convene in the gym to test out their devices. Mr. Morton is reveling in the methodology and empirical elements that come with the physics behind the egg-drop exercise. He rattles off the dimensions and payload capacities of his students’ mechanisms before begrudgingly handing it off to the second-graders. Terrified of heights Janine climbs the ladder at an excruciatingly slow pace and begins to drop her students’ egg carriers. It results in a puddle of yolk on the ground and the sound of children gasping as their creations explode before their eyes. Eli rushes to the remains of Ralph yelling out for a Band-Aid while frantically trying to put his friend together again. Janine tries to patch up the situation with affirmations and enthusiasm then passes out participation medals to the shell-shocked (sorry for the pun I had to!) second-graders staring at the mess of yolk proclaiming there are no winners or losers. Eli pleads to his broken egg “It’s okay Ralph you just have to believe.”

Confused about how her egg drop ended in tears while everyone’s eggs in Melissa’s class went unscathed Janine asks her co-worker how she did it. Melissa who went before Janine at the demonstration admits to cheating. Instead of using raw eggs she hard-boiled the eggs to prevent them from breaking thus keeping smiles on her students’ faces. She says of course she’d love to teach her class quantum mechanics but second-graders are simply unable to understand it.

Janine is distraught about making her students feel as if they failed but Gregory points out that failure is a large part of science and really learning in general. It’s the basis of the scientific method — the academic version of fucking around and finding out. Learning is all about trial and error and using problem-solving and critical thinking to make it to the next step. Failure is one of the most natural parts of the human experience. This doesn’t mean it should feel good; it just means it’s inevitable.

Janine struggles with failure as a concept because her entire worldview is dependent on the philosophy that as long as she tries hard enough she can achieve anything. Gregory asks her flat out if she even knows the science behind the egg drop — something I was wondering since she got the idea to do it. If she wants her kids to understand the assignment Gregory says she’s going to have to understand it herself. Amber canceled their plans for the evening so Gregory offers to stay after school with Janine to teach her how to do it. As they walk through the lesson he sees that Janine is further gone than he realized when she proudly maintains that anything at all can be handled if you just try your hardest and have confidence in yourself. Gregory argues you can’t “positive attitude” your way through physics and proves it by asking Janine to touch his hand. Stretching his arm above his head to its over-six-foot height the vertically challenged Janine tries her hardest even pulling out a chair to assist. She falls further proving Gregory’s point.

Janine admits to the cameras that her own history with failure motivates her to prevent her students from feeling like she did. As a kid she had a hard time keeping her shoes tied and was made fun of for it by her peers. So she started wearing Velcro shoes. Projecting her experience onto the next generation she vows to get her students metaphorical Velcro shoes. Three hours of YouTube videos later she has her class remake their contraptions. She asks Mr. Morton to redo the presentation but he’s moved on to the next lesson and recommends she teach them something easier … like tying their shoes. Bloop.

Irritated she vents to Gregory who finally tells her that her intense positivity can do more harm than good and she needs to face the facts: The assignment is too hard for second-graders. Always tenacious Janine pivots. Instead of forcing the students to do something too advanced she shifts the assignment to be appropriate for their level of learning. She turns it into an egg lift and experiments with the class to find out how many balloons can successfully lift the egg. Yes the balloons fly into an air vent and violently pop but I think Janine has learned her lesson. And the broken eggs fittingly left egg on Mr. Morton’s face. R.I.P. Ralph Jr. though.

Meanwhile in the B-plot Barbara goes from being the perennial voice of reason to learning a lesson of her own while everyone else is preoccupied with the egg drop. After seeing the provocative tattoo of one of her student’s parents — a large inscription of “Bitch” across her chest — she requests the mother cover up. The mom obliges zipping up her hoodie which has “Slut” written prominently on the front. Barbara cannot fathom why a grown woman would choose to present herself to the world that way and seeks advice from Ava and Melissa. Melissa tells her to confront the mom and Ava agrees not because she judges the tattoo but because she merely thinks the placement is inappropriate. The next time Barbara sees the parent she patronizingly gives her a pamphlet for a single-moms’ group and recommends a clothing swap for “young professionals.” The mom essentially reads Babara for filth revealing that not only has she been married for six years but she’s also an entrepreneur with her own clothing line.

In the breakroom Barbara browses through the mom’s website Forever Bitch Apparel which has Savage X Fenty energy featuring lingerie and more risqué clothing. Barbara is even more appalled that this mom chooses this kind of lifestyle. Ava surprisingly takes on the voice-of-reason role and reminds Barbara that if the child isn’t being harmed what’s the problem? Barbara realizes she’s misjudged the parent and apologies for her harshness. The mom admits it’s not the first time she’s been judged for her style and business and even concedes that she can work on being more age appropriate around her child. Barbara may never understand the ways of this new generation of parents raised on Foxy Brown and Lil’ Kim but as Ava asked rhetorically does she need to? Amen to that!

Teacher’s Notes

• The bit at the beginning of the episode with the bones in the garden was hilarious. I also love the subplot with Jacob correctly clocking Mr. Morton’s passive aggression. Jacob was nearly bursting trying not to overshare why the two teachers have beef.

• Ava pouring mountains of sugar into her coffee is amazing juxtaposed against a few episodes ago when Gregory put exactly three grains of sugar in his. I love ongoing gags that emphasize the character’s personalities.

• We’re getting incrementally closer to a real romantic moment between Janine and Gregory. Ava’s face when he offered to stay after school to help out Janine was probably the face 90 percent of us made at our screens.

• The discussion about science in the breakroom was golden. Jacob saying science is basically history and math combined Melissa denouncing the moon landing Mr. Johnson saying the moon isn’t even real and Ava questioning pigeons and saying Stevie Wonder isn’t blind gave us an amazing deadpan look to the camera from Tyler James Williams whose faces never disappoint.

• Finally here are some of the funniest lines from this week:

Abbott Laboratories (ABT -0.26%) is a huge healthcare company with more than 130000 employees that operates in more than 160 countries. The company has been around 130 years so it's a familiar name to many investors.

To me it's a stock with a nice blend of growth and value even though for the year its shares are down more than 26%. Because of its size and four separate segments -- Medical Devices Diagnostics Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals -- the company has a built-in diversification that allows it to thrive even in difficult financial times.

Here are two reasons to buy the stock and one reason to sell it.

Consistent revenue and dividend growth

Abbott is on track to increase annual revenue for the 10th consecutive year. Over the past decade the company has increased revenue 226% and earnings per share (EPS) by 22.7%. Medical Devices and Diagnostics brought in $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion in revenue respectively in the third quarter while Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals brought in $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.

Through nine months the company reported $33.6 billion in revenue up 6.2%. The biggest growth came in Diagnostics up 18.9% over the same period in 2021 including 46.6% in the United States.

Abbott is a Dividend King that has increased its quarterly dividend for 50 consecutive years including a 4.4% raise this year to $0.47 per share. The dividend's yield is 1.81% about average for the S&P 500 but there's plenty of room for continued growth as its payout ratio is only 38.4%.

The FreeStyle Libre 3 is a game changer

Abbott sells hundreds of products so singling out just one is unusual. The company's latest version of its continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) for diabetic care the FreeStyle Libre 3 has been a big success because it is so small. CGMs also known as blood sugar monitors keep track of blood glucose 24 hours a day to allow diabetes patients to better manage their disease.

The level of sales in diabetic care is expected to grow because of our aging population and its increasingly sedentary lifestyle. According to a report by Strategic Market Research the global CGM market was worth $6.13 billion in 2021 and is expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% between now and 2030 reaching a $16.33 billion market by that time.

At about the size of two stacked pennies Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 3 is the smallest CGM sensor on the market. That's a big deal because it allows diabetes patients to wear the devices discreetly and without interfering with other daily activities. The information the sensors gather is downloaded to an app on users' cellphones. The company has marketed FreeStyle Libre systems for years but the Libre 3 was just approved for use in the U.S. by diabetics age 4 and older by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May.

Through nine months Abbott's diabetes care sales which have been driven by the release of the new device were nearly $3.5 billion up 34.7% in the U.S. and 10.4% overall. Once supply chain issues lessen overseas the company expects the device to do well there as well.

The FreeStyle Libre 3's users appear to be very loyal and sensors need to be replaced every 14 days so that means consistent revenue for Abbott.

The bottom is falling out of the company's COVID-19 testing sales

Last year Abbott said its COVID-19 testing sales were approximately $7.7 billion. That's a lot of revenue to replace and it will take a while for the healthcare company even with all of its diversity to do so. In the third quarter it did only $1.7 billion in COVID-19 testing sales and the company said it expects only $500000 in COVID-19 tests in the fourth quarter.

That means that next year Abbott's quarterly sales could pale in comparison to this year's so the stock could likely fall out of favor with investors. In the long run it has the strength to replace that revenue but 2023 may be a rough year for Abbott investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFzdHJpYnVuZS5vcmcvMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9ncmVnLWFiYm90dC10aGlyZC10ZXJtLXByaW9yaXRpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Greg Abbott's decisive win over Beto O'Rourke portends for his future,"You deserve to know what’s happening in Texas from a Texas news source you can trust.

While teachers dreamed of a new HVAC systems and functioning bathrooms some students imagined bouncy houses and roller coasters.

In response leaders at AbbVie said: dream bigger.

Now three years later Neal students and teachers are leaving the halls of their old school to enter a new modern learning space that gives them what they wished for – and so much more.

With a $40 million donation from AbbVie and the public-private partnership between AbbVie the North Chicago Community School District 187 local government and construction partners North Chicago has a brand new Neal Math and Science Academy built from the ground up.

“No words can explain how awesome this opportunity is and the lives this school will change” said Jaelah Edwards Turner an 8th grade student at Neal. “This is the beginning of a bright future.”

Compared to the old school the new Neal is almost unrecognizable. Gone are the water leaks uneven heating and cooling and ongoing electrical issues. In their place are large open spaces modern science labs and a host of other new features to enhance STEM learning and inspire Neal students to reach higher in their academic careers.

“Our new space is exactly what we need to push expectations around not just culture but also academics” said Michael Grenda principal Neal Math and Science Academy. “Before we avoided focusing on the space — now it’s a source of inspiration.”

Built on the grounds of the former school the new Neal provides a flexible and reimagined learning space for students to help improve graduation rates reduce dropout rates and increase college and career readiness. The new design also supports educators by giving them new spaces to expand academic curricula and collaborate more effectively.

“My new classroom will allow me to engage students in more versatile art projects and empower me to focus more on instructional time vs. project planning and logistics which is amazing” said Rubina Datta a teacher at Neal.

Before students and staff begin classes in the new building on November 28 leaders from the North Chicago School District and AbbVie hosted a ribbon-cutting event to celebrate the grand opening. Elected officials AbbVie representatives local community leaders students and teachers were in attendance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hZGFsaW11bWFiLWluZmxpeGltYWItZXRhbmVyY2VwdC1iaW9zaW1pbGFycy1nbG9iYWwtMTMwODAwMzE3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adalimumab Infliximab and Etanercept Biosimilars Global Market Report 2022: Featuring Zydus Cadila Abbvie ...,"Company Logo

Global Adalimumab Infliximab and Etanercept Biosimilars Market

Global Adalimumab Infliximab and Etanercept Biosimilars Market

Dublin Nov. 18 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Adalimumab Infliximab and Etanercept Biosimilars Global Market Report 2022: By Product By Application By Distribution"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global adalimumab infliximab and etanercept biosimilars market is expected to grow from $3.10 billion in 2021 to $4.76 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 53.4%. The market is expected to reach $18.61 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 40.6%.



The main types of products in adalimumab infliximab and etanercept biosimilars are adalimumab biosimilars (exemptia mabura hyrimoz hadlima abrilada others) infliximab biosimilars (inflectra renflexis ixifi avsola) and cipleumab (erelzi eticovo). Adalimumab is a biological drug that works on the immune system to lessen inflammation. The different applications include crohn's disease psoriatic arthritis rheumatoid arthritis ulcerative colitis ankylosing spondylitis plaque psoriasis others and is distributed through various channels such as hospital pharmacies retail pharmacies online pharmacies.



The patent expiry of branded drugs allows biosimilars to enter the market. For instance In United States FDA approved inflectra developed by Hospira (a Pfizer Inc company) for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis adult ulcerative colitis plaque psoriasis after the patent expiry of branded drug Remicade.

Similarly Amgen's Enbrel had its patent expired in the EU and with the expiry of the patent Benepali (a biosimilar of Enmbrel) was approved by the European Commission. Humira's patent expired and its biosimilars were made available in the market. FDA has recently (July 2020) approved Hulio the sixth biosimilar of Humira. Therefore the patent expiry of branded biologic drugs such as Humira Enbrel and Remicade will drive the biosimilar market.



The patent extension of Humira (adalimumab) will hamper the Humira biosimilar market. The patent extension is a strategy to compete with generic and biosimilar products after patent termination. For instance the patents of Humira the branded biologic drug manufactured by AbbVie in the US and EU.

AbbVie obtained Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) that provided protection in Europe. AbbVie received a patent extension for Humira till 2023 in the US. In pursuit of patent extension AbbVie also had settlements with Amgen Samsung Bioepis and Mylan to protect Humira sales in the United States. The patent extension of Humira is anticipated to hinder its biosimilars market growth.



The brand versions of biosimilar drugs are of high costs which are now being replaced with biosimilar versions upon their patent's expiry. The cost of branded biologic drugs almost doubled in recent years. For instance the cost of Humira the top-selling drug increased to more than $72000 in 2020.

Story continues

The shift to low-cost biosimilar drugs is mainly because there are no clinically relevant differences in safety and efficacy between the biosimilars and originator biologics. The Danish health care system switched almost entirely to adalimumab biosimilars after the patent on the original adalimumab product Humira expired in October 2018. The switch to biosimilars led to an 82% decrease in costs for the medication.

Several of Accenture’s key strengths were highlighted including its end-to-end services — spanning strategy consulting digital technology and operations — and its integrated service portfolio supported by new energy research innovation capabilities and energy-focused digital labs.



The MarketScape also recognized Accenture‘s ability to develop new service capabilities supporting energy transition initiatives leveraging its broad partner ecosystem and cross-industry expertise. These capabilities include emobility industrial decarbonization carbon intelligence carbon capture utilization and storage renewables and hydrogen which oil and gas companies need as they pivot to greener and more sustainable business models.



Accenture was one of 14 companies the report evaluated with an established reputation for providing services to the oil and gas industry in the EMEA region. Vendors had to offer a variety of services that support oil and gas companies’ energy transition net-zero programs and business model innovation across all industry segments.



The IDC MarketScape assessed the capabilities and strategies of service providers examined their comparative success in the marketplace and how their offerings will evolve providing context for oil and gas firms evaluating and choosing vendors on their path toward net zero and beyond.



“This outcome highlights our ability to help clients successfully navigate the energy transition and pivot to make the most of new sustainable opportunities” said Andrew Smart a senior managing director who leads Accenture’s Energy practice in Europe. “We work with them to develop new business models incorporate decarbonization and operational sustainability plays and build on existing capabilities like carbon tracking.”



“While investing in sustainable energy has gained steam to help drive long-term growth many oil and gas firms are understandably shifting focus to energy security in the short and medium term” added Muqsit Ashraf a senior managing director who leads Accenture’s Strategy and Energy practices globally. “We’re collaborating closely with our clients to ensure this doesn’t erode the necessary work on sustainability with a more diversified mix of future energy sources.”



Additionally the report highlighted Accenture’s significant presence across EMEA as well as its expertise throughout the oil value chain its segment dedicated to services focused on the energy transition and its innovation assets including multiple digital studios and innovation hubs dedicated to the oil and gas industry.



""Oil and gas companies recognize Accenture is a key partner on their net zero journey as they navigate the myriad of challenges the industry is currently facing” said Gaurav Verma research manager IDC Energy Insights. “With its integrated end-to-end services offering Accenture has helped a very diverse range of energy clients successfully develop sustainable business models to support their energy transition efforts. Bolstered by multiple focused partnerships Accenture also evolves and expands its capabilities on an ongoing basis to better serve those clients.""



The report is based on interviews with the end users (oil and gas companies in EMEA) detailed surveys and briefings with the vendors and publicly available information.

With the upcoming cessation of third-party cookies marketers and business leaders across all industries are being forced to navigate a new challenge: to continue building and improving their relationships with customers they now need a new way to gather data. According to Epsilon research about 80% of marketers still rely on third-party cookies with 38% feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the news.

High consumer expectations are becoming larger issues for brands wanting to encourage more purchases and increase customer loyalty. Consumers will only place an order if they feel complete confidence in what they are buying by getting the value they expect. This expectation is prompting brands to shift their relationship with consumers to one that is reciprocal and beneficial to both sides.

Brands today are realizing the importance of relationship-driven commerce and are deploying personalized programs to create a ‘give and get’ scenario with their customers that allows them to gather zero- and first-party data. This is instrumental in deepening the customer and brand relationship which is positive for the brand and also provides better service for customers.

This shift to relationship-driven commerce helps brands drive purchases and build loyalty. A Boston Consulting Group survey says that consumers today are “110% more likely to add additional items to their baskets and 40% more likely to spend more than they had planned” when their shopping experience is hyper-personalized. And we at Revieve have seen that this correlates directly to loyalty growth and repeat purchases.

Delivering personalization at scale is imperative. Customers interact with brands in a myriad of ways and expect an individualized approach across every brand touchpoint. Let’s take a moment to dig a little deeper into the different ways that personalization advances business success.

Strengthening the brand-customer relationship

Personalization allows consumers to develop their preferences and make informed purchase decisions. It ensures the consumer feels recognized as an individual rather than being clustered into a group by generation age group or gender. It provides individual recognition. Consumers are learning that brands can anticipate their needs if they provide those businesses with data. By sharing their data consumers allow brands to create these bespoke experiences for them to enjoy. And consumers can feel more confident that their data is used appropriately to their benefit since they provided it willingly to the brand for a better experience in return.

In digital environments that lack a human touch the best way for brands to personalize the customer journey is through the collection and analysis of data to inform their recommendations to customers. The more data collected the better for the customer. This is where the symbiotic relationship emerges.

By gathering zero-party data brands are empowered to deliver continuously improved personalization. For example in a category as personal as beauty brands can gather and analyze data from variables like skin types hair color beauty preferences etc to provide consumers with specific advice and information tailored to and relevant to them. Because customers are providing their information of their own accord they are training the brands to provide even better recommendations and advice on addressing their concerns.

This data trade creates a seamless interdependent relationship: customers provide their information freely to inform the brands on how to provide better experiences for them and brands now have additional information from their customers to continuously provide better recommendations and advice. As both sides continue this exchange the customer experience improves and the relationship between both sides is strengthened. This builds loyalty and trust and ultimately is a win-win scenario.

Personalization as a driver for brand differentiation

Personalization can also be a key avenue for developing brand differentiation. According to a data report from McKinsey 71% of consumers today expect brands to deliver personalized experiences and 76% become displeased when this doesn’t happen. Brands can use personalization as a competitive advantage to set themselves apart from the rest of the pack.

When a brand makes the customer experience convenient and delightful the chances of a customer returning are higher. Personalization programs that collect first- and zero-party data help improve those odds. And what should underlie an engaging customer experience is a brand strategy that emphasizes building symbiotic relationships with consumers. This type of relationship can set brands apart because it’s based on responding to customer needs fulfilling their expectations and making them feel valued. It takes the brand-customer relationship to the next level. But unfortunately creating this type of relationship isn’t as easy as it sounds and few brands are doing it right.

In beauty retail many brands have set a new baseline for their customer experience one that blends online and offline experiences to provide customers with a seamless and tailored customer journey through every channel. However this requires the use of digital tools to enable a consistent digital and in-store experience to deploy AI-powered product recommendations or quizzes to uncover precisely what the customer wants and needs. The brands that can offer this level of customization for each individual customer can secure their place as leaders in the space by setting themselves apart through a truly customer-centric approach.

Exceeding customer expectations

Customers are complex individuals with rich varied stories. Figuring out how to start a dialogue with them is a step toward providing customers with what they want from a brand. According to a recent study by Accenture 83% of consumers are willing to share their information so that brands will create a personalized experience for them. But businesses must be transparent about how they will use this data and that customers have control over it. In addition 91% of consumers are more likely to shop with brands that “recognize remember and provide” relevant offers and recommendations. Consumers need to get something in return for sharing their data with a brand – otherwise why would they do it? There needs to be something in it for them.

A brand that remembers consumers when they return to their site and recognizes their preferences makes customers feel special. In fact I truly believe that personalization is about respect. It’s proper manners to recognize that people are different and unique when you interact with them. Just as you don’t treat each in-store customer in exactly the same way brands shouldn’t treat online customers like clones. Making consumers feel like true individuals will increase their propensity to become repeat buyers.

Henry Ford famously stated “If I had asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses.“ Customers are quick to describe their problems but aren’t always as adept at finding solutions. Customers might recognize something is missing from their shopping experience but not actually know what it is. That’s where brands can step in and really shine. This is the moment where brands can exceed customers’ expectations and provide them with what they need and what they didn’t even know they needed yet. And personalization is what can drive brands to take that proactive approach. This can impress even the most discerning customer.

What’s next?

Personalization is often a factor that brands don’t fully address. And yet it can be the magic to better understand their customers and give them exactly what they have been wanting even if they haven’t thought to ask for it. Data plays a critical role but the exchange must go both ways so both sides benefit. As long as brands can instill confidence in consumers to volunteer their personal information to get something in return then brands can forge a symbiotic relationship that has greater benefits in the long run. And that approach is what can truly create the best scenario for both customers and brands alike.

ASX to write off investment of A$250m ($169m)

ASX appoints a new project director

Regulators express displeasure

Following a review by Accenture the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has paused its DLT-based replacement project for its CHESS settlement platform which started in 2016. In August a further delay in the project was announced after ASX and technology provider Digital Asset identified scalability and resiliency issues in certain parts of the project.

As a result of the Accenture review the stock exchange is writing off its entire capital investment in the CHESS replacement project which it estimates a A$245m – $255m ($169 million) pre-tax.

ASX has also appointed a new Project Director Tim Whiteley. Bringing in a new leader seems understandable from a management point of view but technical projects demand continuity. Hence this combined with some of Accenture’s findings and the financial write-off means there’s only a slim chance of the project’s survival in close to its current form.

This was reinforced by comments from ASX’s new CEO Helen Lofthouse. “To be clear the derecognition charge reflects the uncertainty of the future value of the current solution design. It does not prevent us from using parts of what we have already built if we determine there are adjustments we could make to our current design which will enable it to meet ASX’s and the market’s high standards.”

Securities regulator ASIC and the Reserve Bank of Australia published a joint statement criticizing ASX for its management of the project.

“ASX has failed to demonstrate appropriate control of the program to date and this has undermined legitimate expectations that the ASX can deliver a world-class contemporary financial market infrastructure. said ASIC chair Joe Longo.

“The regulators are closely monitoring ASX’s ongoing management of clearing and settlement under its licences.”

One of the big concerns is that industry players have already invested time and money in adapting their systems to accommodate the new CHESS system.

Technical takeaways

Accenture assessed that the project is 63% ready but had reservations about the project management between ASX and Digital Asset. Its biggest concern appeared to be around design and complexity.

The consultants praised the Daml smart contract language (with some caveats) and Digital Asset’s code quality. But distributed architectures introduce latency and scalability issues. In this project ASX is the sole arbiter of what transactions are logged. It particularly questioned why Daml was used for the entire business workflow as opposed to using it strategically.

Accenture’s view is that more of the business workflow could be implemented off-ledger. That’s because clients only see the end result of the workflow so they can’t verify the calculation that was performed.

Currently businesses favor a federated micro-services architecture. This involves lots of small independent software components. This loose coupling helps with maintenance. Accenture concluded that the replacement CHESS system using Daml is too tightly coupled making it hard to maintain support and extend. It also expressed concerns about the need for specialist skills to implement Daml.

The Accenture report (Pg 19 44) provides a rare public review of some of the pros and cons of the Daml smart contract technology although there’s not massive detail. Accenture is an investor in Digital Asset."
ADBE,Adobe,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4L2Fkb2JlX2ZpZ21hX2FudGl0cnVzdC_SAUFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vQU1QLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvYWRvYmVfZmlnbWFfYW50aXRydXN0Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Justice Department requests more info from Adobe on $20b Figma buy,"The Department of Justice is closely inspecting Adobe's eye-wateringly expensive purchase of web-first collaboration design startup Figma after making a second request for information from the pair.

The $20 billion cash and stock acquisition was announced in September and sent some corners of the creative industry into meltdown over concerns Adobe will merge the new plaything with its XD software and up the price list.

According to some reports the DoJ has spent time contacting customers competitors and Figma's venture capital backers to collate views on the sale with a possible antitrust investigation in the offing.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week Adobe said it and Figma filed a notification and report form in relation to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements (HSR) Act with the DoJ and Federal Trade Commission on October 14. This is paperwork that must be filed and approved before mergers acquisitions or transfers of security and assets can be completed.

""On November 14 2022 the parties each received a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material (a 'second request') from the DoJ with respect to the transaction"" Adobe disclosed in the SEC filing.

As such the sale is not allowed to be completed until 30 days after Adobe and Figma have responded with additional data or answers to questions. The filing states: ""The HSR waiting period will expire 30 days after Adobe and Figma each certify their substantial compliance with the second request unless earlier terminated by the DOJ or extended by agreement of the parties or court order.""

If the DoJ and FTC aren't satisfied with the responses they could take action under antitrust laws including seeking divestitures of substantial assets of the two companies asking them to license assets or terminate the agreement.

Regulatory authorities in other regions may also decide to take a keener look at the $20 billion sale which would be among the largest takeovers of a private software developer on record.

Figma is a browser-based app built to manage file organization by showing projects and their files in a dedicated format. There's no installation no patching and no updates. It is a vector-based graphic editor and prototyping tool. The company launched in 2016 and has received $332.9 million funding to date.

It has an estimated 4 million users some of which are drawn by its freemium pricing and relatively lightweight interface. In contrast Adobe has more than 9900 companies using XD its rival software.

There are fears among some users that Adobe will combine the two and raise subscription costs something that Figma co-founder Dylan Field said isn't happening and that the platform will remain free for education users.

Should the deal not go ahead Adobe will potentially have to pay Figma a $1 billion termination fee under certain conditions. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzExLzE3L3N0b2NrLXNwbGl0LXdhdGNoLWlzLWFkb2JlLW5leHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock Split Watch: Is Adobe Next?,"Many high-profile names have split their stock this year. Is Adobe next?

There have been lots of stock splits this year: Amazon Alphabet and Tesla to name just a few. And these are no small potatoes; the combined market cap of these three companies alone exceeds $2.9 trillion.

More stock splits will probably happen next year. And when it comes to tech companies that might split their stock I have my eye on one name in particular: Adobe (ADBE -1.12%).

It's been 17 years since Adobe's last split

Public companies consider several factors before initiating a split: the stock's current price the size of the split (2 for 1 10 for 1 or whatever) and how much time has passed since its last split.

For Adobe it's been a while -- a long while -- since the company did a stock split. The last one was on May 24 2005. To give you a sense of how long ago that was Desperate Housewives was a top television drama and the first iPhone was still two years away from its debut.

So plenty of time has passed but that's not what's holding up Adobe. Its stock price on the other hand might be the problem. Shares are trading around $350 -- give or take a few dollars. That means the company could issue a 2-for-1 split bringing the share price down to around $175; or it could do a 3-for-1 split bringing the price down to about $115.

Both options would align Adobe more with the tech mega-caps it aspires to be. Amazon Alphabet and Apple all trade between $95 and $160.

Will Adobe do it?

One important thing to remember about stock splits is that they don't change a company's fundamentals. Because of that there's no reason to buy or sell a stock purely because of a split. In economic terms it's a nonevent.

However stock splits can (and do) generate increased interest from retail investors. Companies know this and often use stock splits to ensure that retail investors don't feel priced out of their stocks. But for Adobe with shares trading for less than $400 it's unlikely most investors feel priced out.

Yet if the stock were to rally -- perhaps above $500 -- there might be pressure to do a stock split. At that price many retail investors might balk at spending $500 for only a single share especially when they could potentially buy four or five shares of Alphabet or three shares of Apple for the same amount of cash.

Is Adobe a buy?

Make no mistake: I think Adobe is a great investment. That said I don't see a stock split coming anytime soon. I'd love to see the stock rally over $500 but with the Fed hiking interest rates the overall market environment remains challenging.

Adobe is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings next month and I'll be eager to see how the company performs. I'd love to see strong operating margins and revenue growth after both figures dipped in the third quarter.

This article explains how to stop Adobe Acrobat Reader from automatically opening PDF files in your web browser by default. Instructions in this article apply to Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.

How to Keep PDFs From Opening in a Browser

Follow these steps to prevent Adobe Acrobat Reader from opening PDFs within your web browser:

Open Adobe Acrobat Reader and select Edit > Preferences in the menu bar. You can also bring up the preferences menu with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K (or Command+K for Mac). Select Internet in the left pane of the preferences window and then select Internet Settings. Select the Programs tab. Select Manage Add-Ons. Select Adobe PDF Reader in the list of add-ons. If you don't see Adobe PDF Reader listed try selecting Run Without Permission from the Show drop-down menu. Select Disable so that the PDF Reader won't open PDFs in the browser.

Why You Should Disable Auto Open in Adobe Acrobat Reader

Attackers have exploited Adobe Reader's confirmation-free rendering to spread malware. Turning off the Adobe Reader add-on for your browser helps you avoid accidentally downloading a computer virus via the internet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzI0MDctYWRvYmUtcGRmLWZyZWUtdG9vbHMtZG8tbW9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Adobe PDF Reader Alternatives That Do More for Free,"These days you don't need an app just to view PDF files. Every web browser can do that. If you sometimes create PDF files out of Office documents you probably use Adobe's Acrobat Reader. After all Adobe is the company that invented the Portable Document Format (PDF) in 1993.

But when you want to use the Adobe app for something as simple as merging two PDFs or rotating a page you may find that you need to buy the Pro version. Web tools may seem like a solution but finding a reliable web application that works every time can be challenging plus they may not be available when you need them or cause privacy concerns.

You may face a similar problem if you want to create or edit a PDF file natively. If you are using LibreOffice or OpenOffice then you have apps that can edit PDFs but that's not their main purpose so they may not have the features you need or be too complex for simple PDF related tasks.

There are several PDF editors that offer free versions that include functionality that Acrobat Reader doesn't. This guide will help you choose the best tool for you.

Merge and Split PDFs

If you want to replace your current PDF viewer with one that's also able to rotate pages merge pages from different files and remove pages from a document PDF Studio is a great option. All of the app's functions are easy to find as most of them are found in the top toolbar.

Pick from the toolbar what to do with the mouse: select text and images scroll by dragging with the hand cursor zoom in by clicking highlight text strike through it or underline it.

To use the app's best feature choose ""Split & Merge."" You'll can select which files to include in the process or you can also add files by clicking ""open"" or by dragging and dropping. PDF Studio also lets you rotate pages or drag and drop pages to change their order.

With the left side panel you can view page thumbnails change their size attach files to the document or add and search in comments. Bullzip PDF Studio is only available for Windows if that's a problem for you you may prefer the next app in our list.

Merge split extract pages rotate and mix your PDFs + available for Windows/macOS/Linux

If you are happy with your current PDF reader and want a separate app for simple editing then PDF Split and Merge (PDFsam) Basic should be perfect. Upon launching the app you will be presented with different actions later on you can switch between tools without returning to the main screen.

The split tool lets you break a PDF into parts with any number of pages or on specific page numbers. With ""split by bookmark"" you'll be able to split the file at every bookmark of a specified hierarchical level or at every bookmark that contains a certain expression. The ""split by size"" tool will let you split the document into files of any size.

By default the app compresses the files it creates to make them lighter but if keeping the original quality is important you can disable that option under ""advanced settings.""

The merge tool lets you automatically create a table of contents normalize the width of pages add a footer with the name of the original file to each page add a blank page after documents with odd numbers (useful for double-sided printing) and create a bookmark at the beginning of each entry merge or discard interactive forms or make them ""flattened"" (i.e. read-only).

The rotate tool lets you quickly rotate all of the pages or just the ones with odd or even numbers. The extract tool is useful when you don't need the entire document. The alternate mix tool can help when you want to compare two documents page by page. PDF Split and Merge Basic is available for Windows macOS and Linux including 32-bit platforms there are portable versions available and on a variety of languages.

All of the above also cross-platform. Convert to Word Excel or JPG.

If you occasionally need to do more serious PDF editing but don't want to commit to paying for Acrobat Pro Sejda PDF may be a solid option for you. That's because the free version isn't feature-limited but quantity-limited. Every day it will let you perform up to 3 major actions on files of up to 200 pages and 50MB.

Editing text in PDF documents can be tricky because text isn't saved independently of its formatting. With Sejda every time you click on a line the app will replace it with editable text of the same font. In our testing of the app we found no errors in recognition of characters but Sejda wasn't able to recognize text boxes or lengths of spaces making the app more suitable for fixing small errors than for major rewrites. Adding or removing images or forms (if you click ""make fields editable"") is also easy.

Sejda PDF can convert PDF to Word Excel or simple text files or to JPEG images. Strangely it can only convert JPEG to PDF. Under ""security"" you can protect files with passwords selective permissions watermark or flatten files.

Under ""others"" the app has a few useful features such as straightening scanned pages (""deskew"") adding margins (""resize"") or removing them (""crop"") and recovering data from partially corrupt files (""repair""). Sejda can do pretty much everything that PDFsam can so it may be enough for you if you don't need to do those things in batches. The app is available for Windows macOS and Linux and has portable versions.

Create PDFs from scratch

If you want to create a PDF from scratch then Scribus may be the app for you. Text and images are added in frames which is useful for containing a text in a specific area or using only parts of images. By right-clicking on an item you'll be able to turn it into a frame edit the text in it move it to a different layer or mark it as a PDF annotation or bookmark.

The PDF-specific tools are on the right side of the toolbar by default and include push buttons checkboxes and annotations. You can save a document as a PDF but you should also save the file in another format because the Scribus stable release (1.4) can't natively open PDF files. If you don't want to switch between apps you can download the development branch (1.5) which supports PDF import.

Under ""edit"" in the main menu you can select all items of a specific type or attribute and replace one color with another throughout the document. Under ""script"" you'll find useful tools such as CalendarWizard or Align_image_in_frame and be able to add more from your computer. In the bottom-right corner you can preview what the document will look like to people with normal vision or to people with any of 4 types of color-blindness.

Like PDFsam the app can be installed in many languages. It's available for Windows macOS and Linux.

Additional tips for using Scribus:

If you don't have Ghostscript installed you should download it to avoid error messages.

If the app looks blurry in Windows right-click on the app's desktop shortcut and under Properties > Compatibility > Change High DPI Settings set the application to override high DPI scaling.

Vector graphics editor applied to PDFs

Inkscape is better known as an SVG editor but its scalable vector nature also makes it ideal for creating PDF pages with text and illustrations that look just as sharp on any size of paper. As a graphical editor it can add and remove images but also move and resize existing ones.

The app is only able to work a single page at a time so you'll need another app for merging everything later. When selecting a page make sure to choose ""internal import"" if you want to edit text. If you do all of the page's text will be recognized automatically.

In our testing the app ran into problems recognizing characters written in certain fonts often dropping the letter ""I"" but that can be mostly fixed easily: click Ctrl + Alt + K (or Text > Check Spelling in the top menu) and then ""start"" at the bottom of the pane to find all of the corrupt words.

Unlike Sejda Inkscape does recognize text boxes making it great for replacing or moving around large chunks of text. In order to edit text choose the A symbol on the right-hand toolbar. Adding text at the end of a box is simple and intuitive but if you want to change existing text click Text > Text and Font in the top menu and then select the ""text"" tab in the right-side pane and the text box in the document.

Inkscape is available for Windows macOS and Linux and in many many languages. Quick tip: don't keep several files open for longer than you need to as it can cause the app to crash.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbW1vYmlsZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hZG9iZS1hcHBzLXBlcmZvcm0tYmV0dGVyLXNhbXN1bmctbGFwdG9wcy1zbWFydHBob25lcy1xdWFsY29tbS1jaGlwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe apps will perform better on laptops smartphones with Qualcomm chips,"Besides announcing the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor Qualcomm unveiled various other products and partnerships during the Snapdragon Technology Summit 2022 event. The company also revealed two new audio chips a chipset for AR glasses and new branding (Oryon) for its desktop-grade processors.

During the event the company also revealed that it has collaborated with Adobe to bring improved performance and exclusive features to laptops smartphones and tablets using Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Fresco apps will soon run natively on Windows devices with Qualcomm's ARM-based chipsets. These apps will arrive sometime in 2023. While Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom run natively on ARM Windows natively they will get better in the future.

Qualcomm is also working with Adobe to bring improved performance on XR projects on laptops using its ARM chipsets through Adobe Aero its platform for building AR (Augmented Reality) experiences. Their goal is to offer creatives more ways to create content with Snapdragon Spaces. Additionally Adobe’s AI engine (Adobe Sensei) will soon work on the AI Engine inside Qualcomm’s processors to bring advanced features like automotive background removal color enhancement and super-resolution.

Alex Katouzian SVP & GM MCX Qualcomm Technologies Inc. said “Snapdragon continues to represent premium experiences across multiple product categories and we design our technology with users at the center to empower them to unleash their creativity from virtually anywhere and across their most personal devices. With Adobe we’re working to bring the world’s most advanced creative and document tools to Snapdragon-powered devices for creators to enable future digital experiences.”

Samsung currently has a couple of laptops—Galaxy Book S LTE and Galaxy Book Go 5G—featuring Windows and Snapdragon processors. These laptops will soon be able to run Adobe's creative and documentation apps in a better way."
AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzExLzE3L3dpbGwtYW1kLXN0b2NrLWZseS1vci1mYWxsLWluLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will AMD Stock Fly or Fall in 2023?,"There are signs that this high-flying chipmaker may regain its mojo after a terrible 2022.

So far in 2022 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.80%) investors have taken it on the chin with the stock for the chipmaker down roughly 47%. But recent stock price action suggests the year could end on a positive note with some level of recovery.

Share prices of AMD are up about 36% in the past month bringing some relief to investors who witnessed a brutal sell-off for most of the year. But will AMD be able to sustain this recovery momentum for the remainder of 2022 and into the new year? Let's take a closer look and see if we can find the answer.

Why AMD stock could fly in 2023

The data center business was a bright spot for AMD this year helping the company mitigate the negative impact of a weak personal computer (PC) market. Sales of data center chips produced $4.4 billion in revenue for AMD in the first nine months of 2022 up 74% from the same period last year. The segment's revenue increased 45% year over year in the recently reported third quarter to $1.6 billion driven by market share gains in the server processor space.

The strong showing from the data center business helped AMD finish Q3 with a 29% increase in revenue to $5.6 billion even though revenue from sales of desktop and notebook processors declined a whopping 40% year over year to $1 billion thanks to a soft PC market. Mercury Research estimates that AMD gained server processor market share for the 14th consecutive quarter in Q3. Its share reportedly increased 7.3 percentage points year over year to 17.5% last quarter.

It won't be surprising to see AMD sustain its server growth momentum in 2023 driven by the launch of its latest generation Epyc processors this month. The chipmaker is promising that its fourth-generation Epyc processors can deliver a 2.8 times increase in performance and a 54% reduction in power consumption over the prior generation.

More importantly AMD's new processors have already been chosen for deployment by major cloud service providers such as Alphabet's Google Microsoft and Oracle. Also server OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as Supermicro Lenovo and Dell will be making systems powered by AMD's latest chips.

Earlier this year Bank of America estimated that AMD's server market share could hit 35%. The pace at which AMD gained server share last quarter along with Intel's (INTC 0.30%) delays in bringing the next generation of its server processors to market could pave the way for AMD to substantially increase its share once again in 2023.

It is also worth noting that while AMD's data center revenue increased by around $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2022 to $4.4 billion Intel's data center revenue dropped to $14.9 billion over the same period. Chipzilla generated $16.2 billion in data center revenue during the same period in 2021. So Intel's loss was AMD's gain and a similar situation is likely to unfold in 2023 as AMD seems in a position to take more business from its bigger rival.

Another reason why AMD stock could step on the gas next year is because of an increase in the production of gaming consoles. Sony which uses AMD's semi-custom processors in the PlayStation 5 console aims to ship 30 million units in fiscal 2023 (which will end in March 2024). That would be a 64% jump from its estimate of 18.5 million units in fiscal 2022.

Meanwhile Microsoft's Xbox console shipments are expected to jump to 30 million units in 2023 up 42% from this year's estimate of 21 million. This bodes well for AMD as Microsoft is also using AMD's chips in its latest consoles. Throw in the company's solid growth and prospects in the embedded business that produced $1.3 billion in revenue last quarter an increase of 1549% over the prior year thanks to the acquisition of Xilinx and it is evident that a majority of AMD's business is built for growth.

The gaming data center and embedded businesses produced 82% of AMD's revenue last quarter. So there are multiple reasons why AMD stock could fly higher in 2023.

Why the stock could fall

There are two reasons why AMD's misfortune could continue in the new year.

The first is the continued weakness in the PC market that could keep the company's client processor business under pressure. Market research firm IDC forecasts that PC sales are on track to drop 12.8% this year which explains why AMD is experiencing weak sales of desktop and notebook processors. The market isn't expected to recover in 2023 with IDC estimating that the combined sales of tablets and PCs could drop 2.6% next year.

The second reason why AMD's latest rally could be under threat in 2023 is because of its rich valuation. AMD stock trades at 44 times trailing earnings which is rich when compared to the Nasdaq-100 index's multiple of 24. Richly valued stocks were hammered this year amid surging inflation that led the Federal Reserve to aggressively hike interest rates. A similar trend in 2023 could spell bad news for AMD.

What should investors do?

The reasons why AMD stock could fly higher in 2023 outweigh the reasons why it could fall which is why investors who hold this tech stock in their portfolios should continue doing so since it seems capable of sustaining its momentum.

That being said the stock remains richly valued and a small sign of weakness in the company's growth story could send its shares tumbling. However that could open an opportunity for savvy investors to buy shares of AMD given that it is built for long-term growth on account of the multiple catalysts that it is sitting on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vc29tLnlhbGUuZWR1L3N0b3J5LzIwMjIveWFsZS1zY2hvb2wtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1lc3RhYmxpc2hlcy1wcm9ncmFtLXN0YWtlaG9sZGVyLWlubm92YXRpb24tYW5kLW1hbmFnZW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Establishes Program on Stakeholder Innovation and Management | Yale School of Management,"All intellectual capital developed by the program will be made freely available.

Y-SIM’s mission is to develop new thinking that helps leaders become expert in creating long- term value for the stakeholders who matter to the success of their organizations. The program will do so by:

“This important new program is the latest manifestation of the Yale School of Management’s mission to educate leaders for business and society” said Kerwin Charles  the Indra K. Nooyi Dean and Frederic D. Wolfe Professor of Economics Policy and Management at Yale SOM. “The Yale Program on Stakeholder Innovation and Management will leverage scholarship across Yale SOM and play an important role both in educating future leaders and in helping to inform and operationalize the alignment of company priorities with stakeholder commitments. We are grateful for the generous support that makes the program possible. Its founding could not be more timely.”

The program begins its work at a time when the purpose of business and its responsibilities to customers employees investors civil society and other stakeholders are being reexamined. A major premise of Y-SIM is that this reexamination presents opportunities for innovations that will enhance the long-term success of all enterprises.

The Yale School of Management (SOM) announced the establishment of the Yale Program on Stakeholder Innovation and Management (Y-SIM) a comprehensive effort to develop and disseminate new knowledge that advances the practice of long-term stakeholder value creation.

Y-SIM is being led by:

Ravi Dhar Co-Faculty leader; the George Rogers Clark Professor of Management and Marketing and Director of the Yale Center for Customer Insights

Jon Iwata Practice Leader; Lecturer and Executive Fellow at Yale SOM and former IBM Senior Vice President and Chief Brand Officer

Edward A. Snyder co-faculty leader; the William S. Beinecke Professor of Economics and Management and former Dean of the Yale School of Management

“There is considerable discourse today on the responsibilities of business to its stakeholders” said Iwata. “This discourse is important but we believe that leaders’ most urgent need is the development of new skills capabilities and management systems. The result will be businesses that are at once more responsible and more enduring distinctive in character and authentic in action.”

According to Dhar “Consistent with Yale SOM’s mission we do not view the question of stakeholder management as an ‘or’ trading off shareholders versus other stakeholders but rather as an ‘and.’ Collaborating with and creating value for key stakeholders broadens the ways in which organizations can create and sustain value for their shareholders more effectively.”

“Y-SIM is not about endorsing a particular view about stakeholders” said Snyder. “Instead it is based on a recognition that current and future business leaders will operate in contexts that are complex and divergent. We intend to take a broad lens to stakeholders—in established and new ventures—and do so on a global basis.”

To guide the program Y-SIM has established an Advisory Board of experienced leaders.

John Seifert (Chair) former CEO Ogilvy Group

James Breyer Founder and CEO Breyer Capital

Kenneth I. Chenault Chairman and Managing Director General Catalyst; and former Chairman and CEO American Express

Louis V. Gerstner Jr. Chairman Gerstner Philanthropies; and Retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer IBM Corporation

Samuel J. Palmisano Chairman Center for Global Enterprise; and former Chairman and CEO IBM

Dr. Lisa Su Chair and CEO Advanced Micro Devices

“Today’s employees consumers shareholders and citizens expect more of companies and those who lead them” said Seifert. “The Yale Program on Stakeholder Innovation and Management will play an important role in helping leaders meet and exceed those expectations.”

“The scope of this program is both ambitious and pragmatic” said Chenault. “Supporting entrepreneurs to start and grow mission-driven companies is critical work. We have an opportunity to ensure that the next generation of leaders and businesses operates with responsible innovation at their core and to demonstrate that for companies to withstand the test of time it is not just possible but necessary to create both economic and societal value.”

“The proposition that an organization exists to create value for the stakeholders that matter to its success is hardly new” said Gerstner. “What is new is the landscape—one shaped by new levels of complexity interdependence speed and transparency. That calls for new leadership practices—new kinds of learning new management skills and systems new approaches to innovation. Y-SIM is a promising step toward addressing those needs.”

“Newly appointed CEOs are often surprised to learn how much of their role is to lead their organizations at the intersection of many stakeholders” said Palmisano. “That is not the time to learn how to manage this complex dynamic with skill and responsibility. Y-SIM will help address this need for students and for leaders rising in organizations.”

Y-SIM will foster collaboration among an interdisciplinary group of Faculty Fellows whose teaching and scholarship are aligned with the program’s mission. The Faculty Fellows are:

Y-SIM also collaborates with organizations in a Knowledge Network. Participants provide valuable industry expertise and experience in support of the program’s mission.

At the press conference on the occasion of the SPS automation trade fair in Nuremberg Germany Ulrich Leidecker Chief Operating Officer at Phoenix Contact talked about the company's economic development. Despite the continued tense situation in the raw materials markets and energy market the results of Phoenix Contact will be outstanding. It currently appears that Phoenix Contact will close the 2022 fiscal year with revenue growth of approx. 20 percent and total revenues of €3.58 billion. “Growth in all of our key regions including Germany Europe the Americas and Asia will continue at a high level of around 20 percent. All areas of our business have developed equally positively. Worldwide the number of Phoenix Contact employees has risen to almost 22000.”

Leidecker described the war in the heart of Europe as a situation with far-reaching consequences: “The impressions it has made on us personally and on Phoenix Contact as an internationally active company have not gone unnoticed.” Due to the continuing military attacks Phoenix Contact has sold its Russian subsidiary and abandoned its business activities in Russia. “That was not an easy decision as our company Group is in family hands and we all feel very connected to each other. However these underlying values are precisely what moved us to take that step” said Leidecker. Due to the impact on the energy supply the company has been preparing itself for various scenarios for a long time in order to safeguard its supply of power and heat with an emergency plan.

The biggest challenges continue to be on the material supply side. The tense situation in the semiconductor market which dominated last year also limited production this year and led to delivery problems. “On the other hand we are experiencing a significant increase in demand – partly driven by the shortage – that has led to unheard-of order backlogs” explained Leidecker. This provides stability for sales in 2023 but also distorts the estimates of actual demand keeping the situation risky.

Investments

Phoenix Contact is also making significant investments in 2022. The company will invest a total of around €240 million in buildings tools and machines worldwide. This year one focus was the further development of the location in Blomberg. There the investment for construction work alone will be around €40 million. In line with the situation last year the worldwide investment sum would have been much higher if shortages had not continued to cause bottlenecks for machines and plants.

To give the company space to grow and develop further in the future staffing levels have also become a focal area. “In conjunction with the shortage of skilled labor demographic change will become a limiting factor. This problem is not limited to one industry. Instead it affects all industries” said Leidecker.

Sustainability in personnel development

For several decades Phoenix Contact has relied on thoroughly training its own young talent. In the past two years the number of apprentices and students in cooperative education programs has almost doubled since training and cooperative education are key factors in countering the demographic change. Phoenix Contact is breaking ground in new fields such as e-mobility and cybersecurity both characterized by strong growth and highly dynamic content-related changes. The only way for the company to maintain and expand this position is to continue to develop sufficient specific capacities. “Consequently training is one of our roles in society that we are fulfilling on regional national and international levels” said Leidecker. For example Phoenix Contact has set up a new cooperative education program: Digitalization Engineering. It combines structures and areas of expertise from classical digitalization such as data models networking and algorithms with the still-real world of production and value creation.

Sustainability in the All Electric Society Park in Blomberg

On an area of 7590 m² a new entrance is currently being built along the access road to company headquarters. The traffic circle at the location in Blomberg will become the new gateway to Phoenix Contact. It is connected to a new park in which the future vision of the All Electric Society (AES) will be made accessible and explained concisely to everyone. Using the flow of energy – from generation through conversion storage and distribution right through to its optimized use – the park will demonstrate how the AES can become a reality. Real applications show how sector coupling can function. The park will be a scaled-down reflection of the real world. Cubes made of glass for each application open-field systems and a pavilion with meeting rooms are all part of the exhibition areas of the AES Park. The park coneys a holistic image of how to consume resources sparingly by using existing technologies. Its hallmark will be a solar tree with a diameter of 12 meters on the traffic circle rotating around its central axis to always be at the correct angle to the sun. The new gateway to Phoenix Contact will play an active role in the celebrations surrounding the company's 100-year anniversary and will be open to the general public.

Sustainability through power supply with renewable energy

Phoenix Contact has set itself the goal of mounting photovoltaic systems on the roofs of all German production locations by 2030 to continue increasing its supply of renewable energy-based power. Counting the roof surfaces in Blomberg alone around 93000 square meters are available. In the future solar power will be produced on all the roofs at all Phoenix Contact locations in Germany and worldwide.

Not all roofs can carry the load of conventional photovoltaic systems. The alternative is lightweight modules which have already been installed on the roofs of some buildings at the location in Blomberg. The flexible panels with surfaces that intelligently refract sunlight can be glued to the roof completely flat. With reference to the roof area of a building their electric capacity is 750 kilowatt-peak (kWp). In the best case they can produce about 700000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. On balance that would be enough to supply about 175 single-family homes with electricity in one year. The total capacity of all the roofs in Blomberg which will be equipped roof by roof will be between 7500 and 8000 kWp. All in all it will be possible to generate 6.5 to 7.5 MWh of electricity there in the future. This is equivalent to a consumption of around 1800 single-family houses.

In June an Aflac plush duck was recalled because it contained lead and another substance that’s toxic if ingested.

And in September there were new federal safety standards for small high-powered magnets that are extremely dangerous if ingested.

""Despite a lot of these toys being recalled we’re still finding them for sale and being able to purchase them"" said Katie Craig the State Director for North Carolina Public Interest Research Group (NCPIRG) Education Fund.

NO TITLE PROVIDED

An investigation by NCPIRG found the recalled Aflac duck and magnetic balls still for sale online.

""We’re seeing these pop up especially in second-hand retailers like Facebook marketplace eBay and some other online stores"" Craig said.

Investigators tried to find and buy 16 recalled toys online and they were able to find 11 of those toys.

To make sure what you’re buying is safe here are some simple steps to take when buying toys this holiday season:

- Read warning labels closely and inspect toys

- Be wary if the price of something is unusually cheap. It could be counterfeit.

- Search online for recalls.

- And a good test to tell if a toy is a choking hazard: if it fits through something the size of a toilet paper roll it’s a choking hazard for little kids.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLWxpdmUuY28udWsvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hZmxhYy1uaS1hcHBvaW50cy1uZXctYm9zcy0yNTU0NzI5MdIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLWxpdmUuY28udWsvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hZmxhYy1uaS1hcHBvaW50cy1uZXctYm9zcy0yNTU0NzI5MS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aflac NI appoints new boss ahead of office move,"Sign up to FREE email alerts from BusinessLive - Tech - the very latest innovations inspiration and business news every Tuesday

US health insurance company Aflac Northern Ireland has named Mark McCormack as its new managing director as it moves into new grade A offices in Belfast harbour.

Mr McCormack was previously head of technology and has been with the firm since it first set up a base in Belfast in 2019.

He succeeds Keith Farley the US Aflac executive who brought the company to Northern Ireland initially and who has been a strong advocate of the region as a base for overseas investment. Mr Farley is moving back to the US to become the firm’s Chief Customer Experience Officer.

“Mark is an exceptional leader a good friend and the perfect person to lead Aflac NI as we move into our next chapter” Mr Farley said. “He was our first local hire and was instrumental in making our vision a reality Keith said. “On a personal note my family and I have loved our time in Northern Ireland and will look forward to many return visits after we move this summer.”

Mc McCormack takes over the chief Belfast role at Georgia-headquartered Aflac as it confirms plans to move into City Quays 3 in Belfast harbour from its current accommodation at City Quays 2 expanding its footprint to 20000 square feet. It said it has reached its target to hire 150 techical staff two years ahead of schedule.

“Aflac Northern Ireland’s journey has been a resounding success and I’m delighted to lead a new and exciting phase of expansion with a strong experienced team that is delivering transformative technology solutions that make a global impact every day” he said. “As we celebrate three successful years in Northern Ireland I’m thrilled to confirm our move to a larger high-spec office space at City Quays 3 which is reflective of the exceptional growth and impact Aflac NI has made locally and abroad.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzUxMTkzNS9kYW5nZXJvdXMtcmVjYWxsZWQtdG95cy1hcmUtc3RpbGwtb24tc2FsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dangerous recalled toys are still on sale,"(CNN) — Parents shopping for their kids this holiday season need to be alert and carefully examine toys before they buy them because recalled and counterfeit toys are being sold online a consumer report said Thursday.

The 37th annual “Trouble in Toyland” toy safety report by Denver-based US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) warned parents to be especially mindful of this hidden danger.

PIRG said that in October it was able to buy more than 30 recalled toys from several US-based online sellers noting that it is illegal for retailers and online marketplaces to sell toys that have been recalled.

The report also said counterfeit toys that don’t necessarily meet mandatory US safety standards continue to be sold in stores and online.

The group was able to buy close to a dozen different types of toys that had been recalled — for reasons that ranged from choking hazards to laceration risk to potential poisoning — from sellers on Facebook Marketplace and eBay as well as several online toy shops.

The toys included stuffed animals action figures activity balls for infants musical toys bath toys and a toddler’s riding toy and a majority of them were bought new in the original packaging or new with tags.

“None of the other sellers flagged stopped or sent a warning about any of our other purchases of recalled toys” the report said.

The recalled toys that PIRG said it was able to purchase online included:

— DigitDots 3mm and 5mm Magnetic Balls from HD Premier: These were recalled in March 2022 for injury to the digestive system if two or more magnets are swallowed.

#Recall: About 119K HD Premier DigitDots magnetic ball sets.

When the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and a toy manufacturer announce a recall that means the toy must immediately be removed from store shelves and online marketplaces. Federal law prohibits the sale of products subject to a recall ordered by the CPSC or a voluntary recall by the company in consultation by the CPSC the report said.

PIRG offered this advice regarding the best way to avoid counterfeit toys: If the only place to buy a popular hard-to-find toy is a website you’ve never heard of or that looks sketchy there may be a reason for that.

The toys may not be genuine the report said and may not meet safety standards for parts that can break or levels of toxins which are common in plastic toys.

Katie Hobbs won a razor-thin victory last Tuesday over Lake a full-throated endorser of the Big Lie — although the former television anchor is refusing to concede.

The Republican Governors Association a political committee that combines corporate cash with dark money from politically oriented nonprofits that do not disclose their contributors spent at least $11 million on Lake’s campaign. The RGA is chaired by current Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey who backed her opponent in the primary. He told CNN in July “Kari Lake is misleading voters [about the 2020 election] with no evidence.”

After the Jan. 6 2021 insurrection many corporations paused their political giving to congressmembers who objected to the certification of the presidential election for Joe Biden. Most resumed their donations to those who voted to overturn the election. Microsoft is one of the companies that kept its finger on the pause button. The software giant also invested in a pro-democracy initiative called Democracy Forward which supports election security and local journalism in the U.S. and abroad.



Tech giant Google General Motors Aflac Wells Fargo Blue Cross Blue Shield FedEx and Walgreens all gave $100000 or more to the Republican Governors Association.



However on Aug. 18 a little more than two weeks after Lake became the nominee for governor Microsoft donated $150000 to the RGA. The software giant was not alone in donating to a committee that would go on to support election denying gubernatorial nominees across the country including Lake. Nor was Microsoft the RGA’s biggest corporate contributor.

In 2022 Missouri-based Centene Management Company donated $1.5 million to the RGA. Koch Industries the Kansas-based conglomerate donated $1.25 million. Philadelphia-based Comcast Financial Agency Corporation AT&T Pfizer and Nike co-founder Phil Knight all donated $250000 or more to the RGA. Tech giant Google General Motors Aflac Wells Fargo Blue Cross Blue Shield FedEx and Walgreens all gave $100000 or more to the RGA.

Capital & Main reached out to the companies for comment. Only Blue Cross Blue Shield responded by email before publication. “Our commitment is to improve the quality access and affordability of health care for every American and we support organizations to help meet that goal” the statement read. “While we do not agree on every issue or policy position nor do we direct where our support goes within those organizations we will continue to support policymakers in both political parties who will work with us to build a more affordable and equitable health care system for the nearly 115 million Blue Cross and Blue Shield members.”

The RGA has also received millions of dollars from Republican megadonors like Robert Bigelow Miriam Adelson Richard Uihlein as well as from the Concord Fund a dark money group connected to Leonard Leo who is credited with reshaping the U.S. Supreme Court.

The RGA funneled much of its spending on Lake’s campaign through the Yuma County Republican Central Committee Axios reported. The political organization’s coordinated campaign with Lake reserved airtime between Sept. 28 and Nov. 8. One of those ads featured a homophobic far right pastor named Justin Erickson. In the spot Erickson portrays himself as a small businessman dealing with inflation which he blames on liberal Democrats. Erickson’s views may rub some of RGA’s donors (and some Arizonans) the wrong way.



“Despite that spend Kari Lake still underperformed and underperformed most profoundly with Independents who are just done with crazy rhetoric.”

~ Stacy Pearson political strategist



In a 2014 sermon on homosexuality Erickson falsely said that “50 percent of the homosexual LGBT-Now-Q community 50 percent have AIDS. One in twenty are child molesters on the sex offender registry” Mother Jones reported. In a 2016 sermon he called Islam “satanic” and Erickson has argued that women should play a subservient role to men.

Evan Vorpahl is senior researcher for True North Research a nonprofit research firm that tracks the role of money in politics and assisted Capital & Main with the analysis of the campaign filings. In his view the corporations and right-wing donors are attacking “our democracy and freedoms.” He wrote in an email that “they should be held accountable for the extremism their dollars helped RGA buy.”

It’s not clear that the spending made the difference in an election where voters rejected extremism in close races according to Arizona-based political strategist Stacy Pearson.

“Despite that spend Kari Lake still underperformed and underperformed most profoundly with Independents who are just done with crazy rhetoric. They took their tinfoil hats off” Pearson said. Hobbs’ margin in Arizona though narrow was more than 60% larger than Biden’s in 2020.

If corporate cash and dark money could not “outspend Kari Lake’s crazy” as Pearson argues it could make more of a difference in low profile down ballot races like that of the state attorney general. Abe Hamadeh a former Army Reserve intelligence officer is a less flamboyant election denier than Lake or Mark Finchem the failed cowboy hat-wearing candidate for Arizona secretary of state who embraces QAnon conspiracy theories. Hamadeh is in a dead heat with is Democratic rival Kris Mayes who currently leads by a handful of votes. The attorney general’s office oversees the enforcement of the state’s election laws and is in charge of prosecuting election fraud in the state.

If Hamadeh wins he will have General Motors Comcast Pfizer Blue Cross Blue Shield and a long list of other corporate donors to thank — as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They all donated to the Republican Attorneys General Association another campaign committee that accepts unlimited corporate cash. RAGA contributed about $2.8 million to support Hamadeh’s candidacy according to OpenSecrets a nonprofit that tracks money in politics. “Those down ballot races — the more money you put in them the more attention that you’re going to get especially with attorney general secretary of state.” said Doug Wilson a Democratic campaign strategist based in North Carolina.

The recent funding round led by Intrinsic Capital Partners and the EU-GMP certification are milestones that will assist QNTM Labs in scaling their analytical capabilities through the pharmaceutical industry and unlock the bottlenecks caused by laboratories today. This recent EU-GMP certification supports QNTM Lab's mission to increase access to high-quality analysis and improve transparency in the pharmaceutical value chain.

According to CEO & co-founder Justin Ihnken the concept behind QNTM Labs began with identifying pharmaceutical producers' struggles when trying to find laboratories willing and capable of providing analysis for plant-based pharmaceutical products.

""We've examined every component of the contract laboratory revised and reinforced best practices to help close gaps in pharmaceutical production"" says Justin. We've handpicked nearly 20 full-time experts from across the globe to spearhead the highest standards of analytical testing research and development. Bringing on Intrinsic a strong capital partner with deep industry knowledge for our Series A will help us scale our operations ramp up capacity for our customers and ultimately bring us one step closer to our mission of becoming the leader in lab testing"" he adds.

QNTM Labs is hyper-focused on reinventing current Industry standards by working hand-in-hand with drug makers to help get their products to market swiftly. Unlike their contract lab competitors QNTM Labs is using this opportunity to establish a more flexible and innovative approach to stay ahead of the pace of rapidly advancing modern medicine.

""We quickly realized that the issues plant-based pharmaceutical producers were facing with laboratories weren't just due to the nature of their products but due to the outdated dynamic existing between drug developer and lab service provider"" says COO & co-founder Connor Murphy. ""The contract lab has become too far removed from production QNTM's approach brings the lab back as close as possible so we can intimately understand the needs of our customers ultimately leading to stronger results and faster turnaround times"" he states.

QNTM's value-driving approach has garnered support throughout the industry not only from Intrinsic Capital Partners but also key stakeholders within the research community API manufacturing and leading solution provider Agilent Technologies. Both of these stakeholders stand behind their ability to drive change and be a global leader in thought leadership and operational excellence.

""Our partnership with Connor Justin and the QNTM Labs team is a perfect reflection of Intrinsic's core strategy. We invest behind sophisticated and passionate management teams that are building companies that play an integral role in ensuring supply chain compliance product integrity stakeholder transparency and above all else patient safety"" said Intrinsic Managing Partner and QNTM Labs Board Member Cornelius Merlini. ""Through our deep operating network and lab testing segment expertise we look forward to providing QNTM Labs with capital and strategic resources to become the leading lab testing platform in Europe.""

Animals with myeloid-specific disruption of Tsc2 were sacrificed and their aortas compared with controls. Conditional myeloid deletion of Tsc2 in an ApoE–/– background induced swollen paws and tails (Fig. S1A and B) which was accordance with a previous report [11]. However Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice are viable and fertile with uncompromised vasculature development. Systemic infusion of AngII via osmotic mini-pumps into ApoE–/– mice for 4 weeks has been repeatedly demonstrated to cause aneurysmal pathology in both thoracic and abdominal aortas [13]. Subsequently to investigate whether macrophage Tsc2 is crucial to maintain vasculature homeostasis we crossed myeloid-specifc Tsc2MKO with hyperlipidemic ApoE–/– mice and established AngII-induced murine aortic aneurysm model. The absence of Tsc2 expression on myeloid cells in Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis in peritoneal macrophages (Fig. S1C and D).

After 4 weeks of AngII (1000 ng/kg/min) infusion systolic blood pressure increased similarly in conscious Tsc2MKOApoE–/– and Tsc2WTApoE–/– mice but no significant difference in body weight between the two groups was observed (Table S1). Morphologically the aortas of saline-infused Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice did not differ from those of saline-infused controls (Fig. 1A). No spontaneous aortic dilations and aneurysms were observed in the saline-infused mice (Fig. 1A). Although AngII treatment resulted in vascular expansion in both genotypes Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice exhibited significant increases in the maximal descending thoracic and abdominal aortic diameter compared to Tsc2WTApoE–/– mice (Fig. 1A–C). As well both the incidence of AAA and TAA were markedly increased in Tsc2MKOApoE−/− mice (83.3% and 55.6% respectively) than in Tsc2WTApoE–/– mice (47.1% and 11.8% Fig. 1B Table S2).

Myeloid-specific deletion of Tsc2 promotes AngII infusion–induced aortic structural and composition changes

Elastin fragmentation is considered crucial for aortic wall dilation and can be detected by Verhoeff-Van Giessen (VVG) staining. Histological analysis of the suprarenal aorta with VVG staining showed that elastin fibers were disrupted in AngII-infused arteries (Fig. 2A B). No obvious elastin breakage was identified in aortic sections from saline-infused Tsc2MKOApoE−/– and Tsc2WTApoE–/– mice. Notably disruption and degradation of medial elastic lamina were more severe in AngII-infused Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice compared with Tsc2WTApoE–/– mice (Fig. 2A B).

Full size image

We then checked the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp9) which have been repeatedly demonstrated to contribute to the pathogenesis of AAs in the aortas [14]. Tsc2 deletion in myeloid cells significantly increased the expression of IL-6 and IL1-β but not MCP-1 and Mmp9 expression in the saline-infused aortas compared with control mice (Fig. 2C). In addition AngII augmented the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 IL1-β and MCP-1 in the presence as well as in absence of Tsc2 (Fig. 2C and D). Consistently the aortas from Tsc2MKOApoE−/− mice infused with AngII displayed a marked upregulation of Mmp9 expression (Fig. 2C and D). Furthermore double immunofluorescence analysis detected increased F4/80+ macrophages infiltrating into aortas expressed IL1-β in the aortas from AngII-infused Tsc2MKOApoE−/− mice (Fig. 2E).

Moreover Tsc2 deletion in myeloid cells decreased the relative contents of collagen and smooth muscle cells but augmented macrophage infiltration in the aortic wall as determined by Masson’s trichrome staining and immunostaining (Fig. 3A). As proinflammatory macrophages could enhance the phenotypic changes of smooth muscle cells [15] and thus aggravate aortic aneurysm development [16] we performed co-immunostaining of mouse abdominal aortic tissues. As revealed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3B and C) Tsc2 deletion in myeloid cells significantly decreased the expression of contractile SMC phenotype marker sm22α but increased the synthetic phenotype marker vimentin in aneurysm tissues. These observations would indicate that the lack of myeloid Tsc2 could aggravate AngII-induced aortic inflammatory responses and structural remodeling.

Identification of Gpr68 up-regulation in Tsc2 deficient macrophages following AngII infusion

To clarify the mechanism whereby aneurysm development was exaggerated in AngII-infused Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice we first identified the genes that are regulated by Tsc2 in macrophages following AngII infusion. We performed RNA-Seq analysis on the peritoneal macrophages from Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice versus Tsc2WTApoE–/– infused with AngII for 7 days. As a result 488 genes were found to be differentially regulated by Tsc2 inactivation (twofold change in expression level; P < 0.05) (Fig. 4A Table S3). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was conducted on the genes related to Tsc2 expression and revealed that the genes were mainly enriched in several inflammation-related signaling pathways such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction the TNF signaling pathway and IL-17 signaling (Fig. 4B). Multiple pathways relevant to inflammation are activated in macrophages from Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice.

The volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is shown in Fig. 4C. We identified 216 positive-regulated DEGs which were significantly downregulated in Tsc2 deficient macrophages. And 272 genes were negative-regulated DEGs which were significantly upregulated in Tsc2 deficient macrophages (Fig. 4C). Among them we found 19 upregulated genes were associated with immune and inflammatory responses including IL-6 IL-1β MCP-1/Ccl2 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2) Ccl7 Ccl12. Besides MMP family members (Mmp9 Mmp10 Mmp13) Fos family members (Fosl1 Fos) and TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) also showed significantly induction with Tsc2 deletion (Fig. 4C Table S3) consistent with enhanced inflammatory responses in Tsc2 deficient macrophages and the consequent impact on AAs formation.

Notably Gpr68 a proton-sensing receptor for detecting the extracellular acidic pH which has increased potential for producing inflammatory cytokines [17] was identified as the most up-regulated gene in Tsc2 deficient macrophages compared with control macrophages (Fig. 4C and D). A database inquiry indicated that Gpr68 was expressed ubiquitously with relatively high expression in lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory macrophages (Fig. S2A). These changes in the mRNA expressions were further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4E). To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying Tsc2-mediated macrophage inflammation in vivo during aortic aneurysm formation we isolated aortic macrophages from digested whole aorta using a magnetic-activated cell sorting system on day 28 from mice infused with AngII as previously described [18 19]. Consistent with the studies in peritoneal macrophages Gpr68 and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 IL-1β MCP-1) expression were increased in aortic CD11b+ myeloid cells from AngII-infused Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice in comparison to controls (Fig. S2B). Taken together these findings from RNA-seq substantiate a crucial role for Tsc2 in regulating inflammatory phenotype of macrophages.

Myeloid-specific deletion of Tsc2 induces Gpr68 expression in AngII-infused aortas

To further unravel the potential contribution of Tsc2 deletion in the aortic response to AngII Gpr68 expression was detected in AngII-infused aortas. Immunoblotting and RT-PCR analysis confirmed the upregulation of Gpr68 in aortas from AngII-infused Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice compared with control mice (Fig. 5A and B). Furthermore increased F4/80+ macrophages infiltrating into aortas expressed Gpr68 in Tsc2MKOApoE–/– mice as revealed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that myeloid-specific deletion of Tsc2 induces high Gpr68-expressing macrophages in AngII-infused aortas.

Fig. 5: Myeloid-specific deletion of Tsc2 induces Gpr68 expression in AngII-infused aortas. A B Quantitative real-time PCR (n = 5) and western blot (n = 4) were performed to determine the expression of Gpr68 in abdominal aortas from AngII-infused Tsc2MKOApoE–/– and Tsc2WTApoE–/– mice on day 28. C Immunofluorescence staining of F4/80 (red) and Gpr68 (green) in abdominal aortic tissues from AngII-infused Tsc2MKOApoE–/– and Tsc2WTApoE–/– mice on day 28 (n = 5). Scale bar = 50 µm. *P < 0.05 vs. Tsc2WTApoE–/– mice infused with AngII. Full size image

We next examined how Tsc2 regulates the expression of Gpr68 in macrophages. As Gpr68 responds to extracellular acidosis we measured the cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in the peritoneal macrophages from AngII-infused mice. Consistent with the increased expression of Gpr68 Tsc2 deficient macrophages displayed higher glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration as evidenced by increased ECAR and OCR (Fig. S3A and B). Compared with wild-type macrophages Tsc2 deficient macrophages showed significantly increased migration (Fig. S3C). Of note 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG 2 mg/mL) treatment partially attenuated the expression of Gpr68 indicating that this increased Gpr68 expression seemed to be mediated partially by the enhanced glycolytic activity induced by Tsc2 deficiency (Fig. S3D).

Downregulation of Gpr68 alleviates the expression of inflammatory cytokines and Mmp9 in Tsc2 deficient macrophages

To further detect the role of elevated expression of Gpr68 macrophages from AngII-infused Tsc2MKOApoE−/− mice were transfected with shRNA-Gpr68 or negative control shRNA (shRNA-NC) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6A Gpr68 inhibition decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 IL-1β and MCP-1. In addition Gpr68 inhibition significantly suppressed Mmp9 expression and activity as determined by western blot and zymography (Fig. 6B-D).

Gpr68 reportedly can couple to heterotrimeric G proteins and mediates the cAMP-PKA (protein kinase A)-CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) pathway [20]. CREB functions as a transcription factor that can specifically bind to the cAMP response element (CRE) present in the promoter regions of downstream target genes [21]. Positive immunostaining of phosphorylated CREB has been observed in macrophages of AAs tissues [22] and the modulation of CREB on Mmp9 expression in macrophages has been reported [23] as well. Additionally recent study has shown that CREB promotes transactivation of Fos gene family (Fosb Fosl1 c-Fos) to enhance macrophage-mediated inflammation by directly binding to the promoters of these genes [24]. CREB also modulates the expression of TSP-1 [25] a member of the matricellular thrombospondin protein family which plays a key role in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory response and gelatinase activity during the pathogenesis of AAs [26]. We then further investigated the role of Gpr68 in the regulation of CREB activity. In macrophages from AngII-infused Tsc2MKOApoE−/− mice the level of phosphorylated CREB were increased than in macrophages from AngII-infused Tsc2WTApoE−/− mice (Fig. 6E). Gpr68 inhibition reduced the level of phosphorylated CREB (Fig. 6E). Morever CREB bound to the promoter region of Mmp9 and TSP-1 in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages according to the ChIP assay (Fig. 6F source data obtained from GEO data set GSM2663863). These data suggest that Tsc2 may mediates gene transcriptional activation through Gpr68/CREB pathway.

Downregulation of Gpr68 prevents aneurysm formation induced by AngII administration in Tsc2MKOApoE−/− mice

To investigate whether high Gpr68-expressing macrophages are involved in the exacerbation of AngII-induced AAs development Tsc2MKOApoE−/− mice were randomized to receive shRNA-Gpr68 or shRNA-NC before AngII pump implantation. Gpr68 inhibition resulted in a marked reduction in AAs incidence and diameter (Fig. 7A-C Table S2) without affecting blood pressure levels (Table S1). Histological analysis showed that aortas from shRNA-Gpr68 treated mice exhibited a moderate change in aortic architecture with reduced elastic fiber fragmentation (Fig. 7D). These observations indicate that the lack of myeloid Tsc2 could aggravate AngII-induced AAs formation by augmenting Gpr68-mediated macrophage inflammatory response and macrophage-derived Mmp9 expression.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9obmN1bWJlcnMvMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9zdGFydHVwLWNyYWRsZS1sZXRzLXlvdS1kZXNpZ24tY3VzdG9tLXByb3RlaW5zLWJ5LWp1c3QtdHlwaW5nLWluLWEtcHJvbXB0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Startup Cradle Lets You Design Custom Proteins By Just Typing In A Prompt,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johncumbers/2022/11/17/startup-cradle-lets-you-design-custom-proteins-by-just-typing-in-a-prompt/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9obmN1bWJlcnMvMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9zdGFydHVwLWNyYWRsZS1sZXRzLXlvdS1kZXNpZ24tY3VzdG9tLXByb3RlaW5zLWJ5LWp1c3QtdHlwaW5nLWluLWEtcHJvbXB0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

However the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or EPA recently registered Lysol Air Sanitizer a product full of unknown ingredients and could lead to harmful health effects.

Lysol Air Sanitizer is 14% dipropylene glycol — commonly found in antifreeze air fresheners cosmetic products solvents and plastics. There have not been enough long-term studies on the health effects when this chemical is inhaled as it will be when sprayed in indoor environments’ air.

Secret ingredients make up 86% of the product including fragrances. Because the EPA does not require companies to release what’s in fragrances little is known about what chemicals are in this product.

What do we know about fragrances? Exposures can cause headache eye nose and throat irritation nausea forgetfulness loss of coordination and other neurotoxic symptoms. Many fragrance ingredients are respiratory irritants and sensitizers which can trigger asthma attacks and aggravate sinus conditions.

“Together with Mabanaft we look forward to further progressing our plans of importing needed-renewable energy into Germany through our planned facility” said Air Products’ Chairman President and CEO Seifi Ghasemi.

“As the world’s largest producer of hydrogen Air Products is in an excellent position to meet demand having committed billions of dollars to produce renewable energy at locations around the world.”

The companies added that this project addresses the urgent task of decarbonising components of the mobility sector and industrial processes while paving a climate-conscious way for Mabanaft and Air Products’ respective customers.

“We will make significant investments and deploy our energy infrastructure capabilities and expertise to accelerate the energy transition in Hamburg as the key import gateway for Germany” commented Volker Ebeling Senior Vice President New Energy Chemicals & Gas at Mabanaft.

“This project underlines Mabanaft’s commitment to conducting our business in an economically environmentally and socially responsible way.”

The announcement follows a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that Air Products and the Hamburg Port Authority signed in February 2022.

Both parties committed to accelerate production supply chain and consumption of renewable hydrogen in the North of Germany and Free Hanseatic State of Hamburg.

The Port of Hamburg transported 6.3 million TEU through its quay walls for 2022 so far a fall of 2.7 per cent.

From January to September Port of Hamburg handled 91.8 million tons of seaborne cargo a 4.3 percent drop on the January-September 2021."

Earlier this year New York City had more Airbnb listings than apartments available to rent a bizarre turn of events that only added fuel to the debate over the short-term rental company’s impact on the housing-affordability crises in places like New York and the Bay Area. (It certainly seems to have had some impact on highly Instagrammable spots like Joshua Tree.) Now one of Airbnb’s co-founders is launching a start-up to capitalize on the problem the company maybe sort of possibly exacerbated.

This week Joe Gebbia who co-founded Aibnb with Brian Chesky and Mike McNamara the former chief executive of electronics manufacturer Flex Ltd debuted their new start-up to sell ADUs — that is the little housing units built in the backyards or garages of single-family homes to allow someone whether in-laws or complete strangers to live close by. Gebbia left his full-time role at Airbnb in July but the company does own a minority stake in the start-up according to The Wall Street Journal which first reported the launch. Gebbia’s new venture is called Samara (“We build homes that help people dream bigger”) which offers a prefab model known as “Backyard.” (Because you know it goes in your backyard.) The prefab houses will measure between 430 and 550 square feet and will start at $289000 for studios and $329000 for one-bedrooms. The designs look like Airbnb stock images — utilitarian but in a vaguely Scandinavian minimalist way that helps justify the high prices: cathedral ceilings lots of pale wood built-in storage sleek-looking all-electric appliances.

The company is launching in California first a state that has prioritized new home construction and issued nearly 20000 building permits for ADUs in 2021 up from 12520 in 2019 according to data collected by WSJ. A number of companies have since rushed into the market: A few months ago Dwell announced that it would be making ADUs. (“We’re not the first to offer a prefab ADU but so many prefab products being passed off as houses either look like a spaceship or a tool shed” Dwell CEO Zach Klein told Curbed at the time.) There’s also Cottage (a San Francisco-based start-up that connects homeowners with contractors) Abodu Rent the Backyard and Homestead to name just a few.

A release from Samara states that California was intentionally selected as the inaugural market because of the housing crisis rapidly increasing cost of living and new regulations that facilitate greater housing density across the state. Over the last ten years California added 3.2 times more people than housing units according to the Public Policy Institute of California and even before COVID and the rent increases that followed half of all households in the state were rent burdened meaning they paid more than 30 percent of their income for rent. In LA for instance the average cost for a one-bedroom hit $2500 this fall an increase of about 17 percent year over year.

But will ADUs do much — or anything — to help California’s housing crisis particularly when start-ups are coming out with design-forward units priced in the $300000s? They certainly won’t hurt but making any kind of a dent would mean using the tens of thousands of new units being built in the state to you know actually house people. It’s worth questioning because Samara also wants you to know that you can use these prefab structures for anything you want not just offering someone a nice place to live. “Backyard’s layouts were designed with a wide range of uses in mind” they note. So maybe the ADU will become long-term housing or an office or a nice spot to do yoga. And it should go without saying: These tidy little mini-homes look like they’d be great Airbnbs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNy90ZWNoL2JyaWFuLWNoZXNreS1haXJibmIvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBO2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvdGVjaC9icmlhbi1jaGVza3ktYWlyYm5i?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb CEO on the tech downturn: 'It's like we're all in a nightclub and the lights just came on',"CNN —

After years of seemingly unstoppable growth the tech industry is now facing the “ultimate reality check” as it confronts broader economic uncertainty and waves of layoffs Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told CNN on Thursday.

“It’s like we’re all in a nightclub and the lights just came on” Chesky said in an interview on “CNN This Morning.” After a period of “exuberance and euphoria” he added “now we all have to like take a hard look at things.”

His remarks come at a difficult moment for the tech industry. Facebook-parent Meta said last week it was cutting 11000 jobs after nearly doubling its staff during the pandemic. Amazon confirmed this week that lay offs had begun in its corporate workforce with reports saying it plans to cut 10000 positions. And Twitter recently cut approximately 50% of its staff as new owner Elon Musk races to bolster its bottom line.

Airbnb may be an exception. Chesky said the company is not undergoing layoffs at this time and in fact is hiring. But that is due in large part to the company cutting 25% of its staff at the start of the pandemic as the travel industry was clobbered and losing more employees by attrition after.

“Two-and-a-half years ago we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks” Chesky said. “People were predicting we were going to go out of business.”

“We just hunkered down” he added. “We rebuilt the company from the ground up and we stayed really lean.” Now Chesky said “we’re stepping on the gas we’re not putting on the brakes.”

While the reckoning hitting much of Silicon Valley is painful Chesky appeared to suggest that a more sober reassessment of the industry could also provide an opportunity for the tech sector to rethink its place in society after years of criticism for the impact its products can have on people.

“I think Silicon Valley has done so many amazing things for the world but we have to be careful having a fetishization of new technology as if the new technology is going to solve all the problems that the last technology created” Chesky said. “We need more diversity in Silicon Valley but that diversity should not just be demographic diversity. We need artists humanists in this industry.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE3L21leGljby1haXJibmItcmVudC13b3JrLWZyb20taG9tZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mexico City's Airbnb bet ruffles residents with spiking rents,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/11/17/mexico-airbnb-rent-work-from-home on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE3L21leGljby1haXJibmItcmVudC13b3JrLWZyb20taG9tZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvaG90ZWx0b25pZ2h0LWZvdW5kZXItc2FtLXNoYW5rLWxlYXZlcy1haXJibmItYWZ0ZXItYW4tZXh0ZW5kZWQtc3RheS_SAWVodHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4L2hvdGVsdG9uaWdodC1mb3VuZGVyLXNhbS1zaGFuay1sZWF2ZXMtYWlyYm5iLWFmdGVyLWFuLWV4dGVuZGVkLXN0YXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HotelTonight Founder Sam Shank Leaves Airbnb After an Extended Stay,"HotelTonight is the fastest and probably the most exquisite and feisty hotel booking app around. Regardless of its future with Airbnb it created dozens of imitators and set the standard.

HotelTonight founder and CEO Sam Shank helped build the fastest and easiest to use hotel booking app in the world — initially focused on guests booking last-minute and same-day hotel rooms sometimes from the local bar — but he hung around Airbnb for three years and eight months after the short-term rental site acquired the business and Thursday was his last day there.

A serial entrepreneur — SideStep TravelPost and DealBase before HotelTonight — and investor who Skift dubbed among a fab five quintet of travel angel investors in 2013 Shank announced on LinkedIn that he left Airbnb and would be taking some time off before figuring out what to do next outside of the travel industry.

Consider the context of 2010 when Shank and co-founders Jared Simon and Christopher Bailey were dreaming up HotelTonight. The iPhone had launched in 2007 and Shank had the audacity three years later to launch an app-only business — a very rare thing at the time — and it was focused solely on same-day hotel bookings. Years later it built a desktop website and expanded beyond same-night bookings.

HotelTonight was that fastest hotel booking app on earth at launch and even today after you submit your credit card and account information you can book a hotel with just three taps and then just trace your finger on the HotelTonight logo in the app and expect a booking confirmation lickety-split.

HotelTonight triggered a legion of copycats around the world and some of the large online travel agencies such as Priceline/Booking attempted to build similar apps. But the latter literally took dozens of taps to book compared with less than a handful on HotelTonight.

Specializing in discounted rates negotiated with hotels HotelTonight broke new ground with a curated selection of hotel choices — I’m viewing around 30 in Chicago right now but in other destinations there can be far fewer — and they are grouped into Hip Highroller Basic Luxe Solid Charming — and each comes with a few-paragraph description of Why We Like It.

“Formerly the Free Methodist Publishing House it’s no longer free” reads the HotelTonight description of The Publishing House Bed & Breakfast in the Windy City. “Or Methodist. Or a Publishing House. (It is however a great place for reading so bring some books!)”

One downside to the app and later the desktop website is you can’t choose your room type but have to settle for whatever beds the hotel has left although that usually isn’t a big problem.

Airbnb acquired HotelTonight in pre-pandemic 2019 for more than $400 million with about half in pre-Airbnb IPO shares and there were high hopes that Airbnb would invest in building a superior hotel vertical.

But then came the pandemic in early 2020 and Airbnb tabled investment in HotelTonight. In recent earnings calls Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has disparaged “cramped little hotels” as opposed to sometimes more spacious short-term rentals.

Chesky has lately positioned hotels on Airbnb as “strategic” but only as a means to fill gaps in destinations where there aren’t enough hosts and short-term rentals to meet demand.

Still Shank on LinkedIn credited Chesky for inviting him to Airbnb headquarters in 2010 and inspiring him to create “something that could make a bigger impact.”

It wasn’t always smooth sailing for HotelTonight. There were layoffs along the way and plenty of criticism that the San Francisco-based startup wouldn’t be able to chart a path toward profitability or have the resources to compete with the larger online travel agencies.

Still regardless of how HotelTonight fares within Airbnb in the future as it is now approaching four years after it became part of the Airbnb portfolio it will always be remembered for literally and quickly changing how people think about booking a place to stay.

HotelTonight indeed had the substantial impact that Shank aspired to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvc2VydmljZXMtYW5kLXNvZnR3YXJlL2FpcmJuYnMtYW50aS1wYXJ0eS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWlzLW5vdy1saXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb's Anti-Party Technology Is Now Live,"Good luck throwing a party at your next Airbnb. The vacation rental platform's party-quashing technology went live on Wednesday.

The reservation screening technology launched in the US Canada and Australia Airbnb said in a press release and the company plans to expand the technology worldwide in spring 2023.

Airbnb announced in August its plan to test and roll out anti-party tech. Two months earlier in June it permanently and globally banned parties thrown by guests. The ""proprietary reservation screening technology"" works by evaluating the history of positive reviews (or a lack thereof) length of time a guest has been on the platform length of stay distance to listing and whether the guest made a booking for a weekend or weekday an Airbnb spokesperson said.

In addition to reservation screenings the platform also expanded its guest identity verification. It may request a customer's legal name address phone number government ID or selfie Airbnb said. This applies to booking guests traveling to the top 35 countries and regions on the app and it will expand worldwide in the spring as well.

Both the reservation screening technology and guest identity verification are part of the app's efforts to protect hosts from party-related issues or damage to their property."

The kit uses multiple evasion detection techniques and incorporates several mechanisms to keep non-victims away from its phishing pages.

According to Akamai whose security researchers discovered the campaign one of the most interesting features of the kit is a token-based system that ensures each victim is redirected to a unique phishing page URL.

Campaign overview

The campaign spotted by Akamai started in September 2022 and continued throughout October preying on online shoppers looking for ""holiday specials.""

The central theme of the phishing emails sent to prospective victims is a chance to win a prize from a reputable brand.

The links in the email don't raise any alarms as they lead to the phishing site after a series of redirections while URL shorteners conceal most URLs.

Additionally the attackers abuse legitimate cloud services like Google AWS and Azure abusing their good reputation to bypass protection mechanisms.

Everyone visiting the phishing site wins the promised prize after completing a short survey. In addition a five-minute timer ensures those taking the survey are infused with a feeling of urgency.

Some impersonated brands include sporting goods firm Dick's high-end luggage maker Tumi Delta Airlines and the wholesale clubs Sam's Club and Costco.

To increase the campaign's effectiveness the phishing actors include fake user testimonials showcasing the received prizes.

After ""winning"" the prize the victim is requested to cover the shipping costs for receiving the prize for which they need to enter their payment card details.

Of course there is no prize to be shipped and the credit card details are stolen by the threat actors to be used for online purchases.

Akamai says roughly 89% of users landing on phishing domains are from the United States and Canada.

Depending on their exact location the redirection takes them to a different phishing site impersonating locally available brands.

Each victim gets a unique URL

Each phishing email contains a link to a landing page with an anchor (#) usually used to direct a visitor to a specific part of the linked-to page.

In this phishing campaign the anchor tag represents a token used by JavaScript on the phishing landing to reconstruct a URL to which the target will be redirected.

""The values being after the HTML anchor will not be considered as HTTP parameters and will not be sent to the server yet this value will be accessible by JavaScript code running on the victim's browser"" explains Akamai.

""In the context of a phishing scam the value placed after the HTML anchor might be ignored or overlooked when scanned by security products that are verifying whether it is malicious or not.""

""This value will also be missed if viewed by a traffic inspection tool.""

Akamai shared the following image showing how the phishing link anchor is used to create a redirection link.

Security products and network traffic inspection tools overlook this token so it doesn't introduce risks for the phishing actors.

Instead it helps keep unwanted traffic researchers analysts and random visitors away from the phishing landing pages.

Those without a valid token and browser redirections that don't use JavaScript for their rendering will fail to access the phishing site.

Apart from filtering non-victims the tokens can also be used for victim-specific tracking campaign performance measurement and more.

In summary the kit combines almost all known techniques for effectiveness and detection avoidance making it a potent threat to North Americans.

The site of a proposed lithium mine in western Nevada’s Silver Peak Range also happens to be the only known place on Earth where a rare wildflower grows in the wild. Environmentalists say the plant is on the verge of extinction and it’s being considered by the Fish and Wildlife Service for protection under the Endangered Species Act.

Tiehm’s buckwheat faces multiple threats to its survival including grazing invasive species and the effects of climate change but the service said the most pressing threat is posed by mineral exploration and development.

The Australian company proposing the mine Ioneer Ltd. says it believes it can harvest the lithium without harming the plant even if it is listed as protected under the act. But it has filed comments opposing the listing on technical grounds.

The Center for Biological Diversity first petitioned for the plant species to receive federal protection in 2019 citing the “dire threat” posed by further exploration of the site’s potential as a lithium mine “notwithstanding the broader overall threat of the mine actually being developed.”

“I would be hard-pressed to see how [FWS] could justify not listing it as endangered just based on the things the service has said” said Patrick Donnelly Great Basin director with the Center for Biological Diversity.

The situation for the species only grew worse after a mysterious event in 2020 killed over half the plants. The Fish and Wildlife Service ultimately blamed “small mammal herbivory” by rodents.

That same year the Center filed a complaint that the service was in violation of federal law by not acting on the initial petition. In April of 2021 the service settled with the group agreeing to propose a listing decision and in October 2021 it released a proposed rule that would list the species as endangered under the ESA.

Adaptation

First discovered in 1983 the plant can be found on an area of less than 10 acres administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The plant has adapted to live in boron and lithium-rich soil of the landscape and with only roughly 40000 existing plants in the wild biologists have said it warrants immediate protection under the ESA. A listing would then be considered during BLM’s determination on whether to permit the mine.

Demand for lithium-based batteries has been growing over the last decade. But it has been supercharged by the climate health care and tax law signed by President Joe Biden in August which provided tax incentives to boost the adoption of clean energy technologies including electric vehicles. To receive the full tax credit the law requires that critical minerals be mined within the U.S. or a nation with which it has a free trade agreement which excludes imports from some of the world’s largest producers led by China.

The U.S. produces less than 1 percent of the global supply of lithium and its entire supply comes from one facility operated by Albemarle Corp. roughly 80 miles south of the buckwheat habitat. If the mine were to open it would immediately fulfill growing demand. In July Ioneer signed an agreement with Ford Motor Co. to deliver 7000 tons annually of lithium carbonate for the company’s electric vehicles.

Ioneer has said throughout the listing process that it remains confident it would be able to develop the mine on the site. After the proposed listing Ioneer Managing Director Bernard Rowe said “We can achieve the successful coexistence of Tiehm’s buckwheat and our environmentally significant project which will supply critically needed lithium products in the U.S.”

Still the company has questioned the proposed ESA listing arguing in public comments that the service has not fulfilled its “statutory obligation to make its proposed listing decision based upon the best available scientific data.” This included challenging the results of Ioneer’s own study that suggested the plant could not survive if transported to different soils which the service used to support an assertion that the plant was a “soil specialist.”

Missed deadline

The FWS blew past the one-year timeline it had to evaluate the proposed listing drawing a notice of intent to sue from the Center for Biological Diversity on Oct. 25 to spur the issuance of a final rule. The service said it could not provide additional information on the proposed listing and that it does not comment on ongoing litigation.

While aiming to meet various domestic climate targets including reducing emissions by as much as 52 percent by the end of the decade policymakers have increasingly advocated for domestic mining as a way to reduce reliance on foreign powers and bring jobs to rural communities. But that push has raised questions about the environmental harms they may bring. Another mine proposed by Lithium Americas Corp. in northern Nevada’s Thacker Pass has also drawn criticism over its potential effect on the wider ecosystem.

However Donnelly said that ultimately there is no choice between lithium and Tiehm’s buckwheat.

“There’s sometimes this narrative put forward that ‘Well is Joe Biden going to choose lithium or is he going to choose endangered species here?’” said Donnelly. “And we would argue the Endangered Species Act does not allow you to make that choice. The Endangered Species Act makes the choice for us. It is the policy of this country: We don’t let species go extinct.”",,,,,,,,,

Just look at Amazon – the company’s AI-powered recommendation system generates tens of billions of dollars in yearly sales accounting for 35% of the company’s revenue.

When studying the impact of AI on business results one McKinsey & Company survey discovered that “63% of respondents report revenue increases from AI adoption in the business units where their companies use AI with respondents from high performers nearly three times likelier than those from other companies to report revenue gains of more than 10%.”

The right AI solution can help distributors better understand their customers make more effective upsell and cross-sell recommendations know when items are due to be reordered make their sales reps more productive and improve lifetime customer value. The case for artificial intelligence is so compelling that 88% of chief sales officers (CSOs) have or are considering investing in AI analytics tools and technologies according to Gartner research.

Implementing new technologies can be challenging – especially for businesses that have always done things the same way. Executives worry about wasting money on an unsuccessful deployment while employees can be hesitant to adopt new workflows. A lack of funding poor change management and low employee buy-in often contribute to a lackluster implementation.

Without taking the proper steps to implement this technology your business could fail to see the largest possible ROI from their AI investment.

Taking the right steps you can avoid common pitfalls and ensure your AI implementation is successful. In fact Deloitte found that reimagining workflows adopting new operational practices leveraging change management and implementing an enterprise-wide AI strategy can make AI deployment more successful.

To ensure your AI investment is effective and profitable follow these three principles:

Think Big Start Small

When implementing new technology it can be tempting to deploy it to your entire organization right from the start – especially if it presents the opportunity for high ROI and productivity improvements. But introducing technology too quickly can result in adoption challenges such as increased costs and lower buy-in from employees and C-Suite executives. To avoid this it is best to think big but start small.

For example our team at Proton recently worked with a multi-billion-dollar distributor to make their counter and inside salespeople more proactive and productive enabling them to sell more to each customer.

We thought big: what would it look like to do a company-wide deployment? What would that mean for the business in terms of revenue uplift? How would their sales reps be able to use our solution to be differentiated in the market?

We had big plans but knew the implementation would be more effective if we started small. So to begin we worked with about 150 of the company’s inside and branch salespeople before expanding. By training a small number of salespeople first we could ensure they were comfortable with their new tools and workflows.

We wanted to show that it works for these reps to build momentum within the rest of the company. So we deployed with those reps and the results were strong. Early on the reps using Proton grew 22% faster than other reps in the company. We had a meeting with the executive team including the CEO and by the end of the meeting the CEO said ‘Why are we not using this on every customer interaction?’

Another Proton client that found success with a phased integration approach was Benco Dental the largest privately owned and fastest-growing U.S. dental supplies distributor. By thinking big but starting small Benco Dental adopted AI in one sales channel. Once they mastered that channel they continued to add sales channels one at a time. This approach helped them improve customer service and grow ecommerce revenue dramatically.

Set Measurable Targets

As you begin your AI implementation define and set measurable metrics for success both leading indicators (input metrics) and lagging indicators (output metrics).

Examples of input metrics include the number of pitches site visits and how many people log on to the site.

Examples of output metrics include sales revenue profit numbers and expenses.

For instance look at how effective your salespeople are at upselling and cross-selling. What percentage of pitches are successful and what is the average revenue generated per pitch? After you understand where your organization is determine what outcome you want to see from your new technology.

Setting goals and metrics will help you measure the effectiveness of your integration and will give you insight into areas that may need improvement. Without measurable targets you won’t know how much progress you’re making or have the necessary data to grow.

It is important to remember that this is not a “set it and forget it” process. Because technology workflows business goals and metrics are constantly evolving your teams will need to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify fluctuations in performance.

In its most recent State of AI in the Enterprise report Deloitte discovered that “transformers” are three times more likely to have an AI strategy than businesses that struggle to implement artificial intelligence.

In the same report Deloitte recommends that “Organizations should develop dynamic ways of assessing their strategy to ensure it remains responsive to ever-changing market and technology developments. As the organization’s core business strategy and AI capabilities mature over time leaders should continually sharpen their goals moving beyond staying competitive to increasingly using AI and ML as competitive differentiators.”

When deploying your AI solution track metrics such as:

How many pitches are being made now vs. before implementation?

How successful are upsell and cross-sell efforts?

Is customer satisfaction improving?

How many users are logging in regularly?

In what areas could results be improved?

Align your KPIs across departments communicate goals and use measurable results to track performance. With this data you will have the knowledge to make critical adjustments and ensure your AI deployment is successful.

Align the Why

Once you have a plan and have set measurable targets it is time to introduce your AI solution to your teams. In this case proper change management is critical to success. Most salespeople and customer service reps (CSRs) are hesitant to change their workflows; they have done things the same way for years and are afraid that new technology will either replace them or make their jobs more difficult.

When it comes to technology you only get one chance for a great first impression with your sales reps. Explain why you are introducing a new workflow and how it will help them. Align the “why” to each team member’s role. For instance a sales rep may be more interested in raising their commissions while a CSR may need a more streamlined way to help their customers.

As an example the main implementation goal for one of Proton’s clients (a large industrial distributor) was to use AI to raise sales. But when Proton’s team approached the customer service team for training no one seemed interested in that goal. After spending considerable time training their team we looked at the usage data and noticed that no one in that department was logging in and using their new tools.

We were trying to figure out what we missed. We did the training with them and told them how it would help them sell more so what happened? Eventually through conversations with their managers we figured out that their team cares about the customer experience not about selling more. They weren’t paid commission so that’s not what they were focused on.

After realizing that the customer service team wasn’t driven by making sales the Proton team went back and retrained them. This time however we focused on aligning the technology to the team’s “why.”

Instead of saying “this is a software that can help you sell more stuff” we said “this is a software that can help you better help your customers.” That changed the game. They ended up selling more – a lot more. But it only came because we aligned the “why” with their “why.”

How to Ensure Ongoing Success

When implemented successfully artificial intelligence will enhance the customer experience and make your organization more profitable and productive.

However to ensure your business enjoys a successful AI deployment be careful not to overwhelm your systems by deploying AI to your entire staff simultaneously. Instead have a roadmap to implement new workflows in different departments over time. Set measurable targets offer incentives and align your culture around a unified “why.”

Dipak Chudasama BDS MSC MORTH RCS is one of the few orthodontists with a Wikipedia page.

While he has had a long career as a dental professional his biggest claim to fame and reason for having a Wikipedia page was his 19-year career as a cricket player for the Kenyan national team.

Born in May 1963 in Mombasa Kenya the same year that the country achieved independence from the British Empire he grew up in Nairobi the young nation’s capital and largest city. His father was a banker and the move to Nairobi afforded the athletically gifted Chudasama the opportunity to pursue his favorite sports cricket and table tennis both of which he played professionally.

As a child he had a hectic schedule. Every day after school he walked 10 minutes down the road to cricket practice. When cricket practice would end he walked another 30-45 minutes to his table tennis practice. His day finally ended at 9 pm and he would take two country buses home because his family didn’t own a car.

Despite the tumultuous nature of a newly independent nation finding its footing Chudasama describes his childhood in Kenya as “fantastic.”

“We would walk to school and the windows would be open. There was no crime or a minimum at that time. Things change” says Chudasama. “Life was good.”

Chudasama has lived on four continents Africa Asia Europe and North America. His cricket career included two World Cup appearances in 1996 and 1999 as a right-handed batsman nicknamed “The Doc” for his dual life as a practicing dentist. After retiring from professional sports Chudasama felt it was time for a change.

“I never dreamt of leaving Kenya to go overseas” he says. “But after my second World Cup I thought you know what Let’s start a new life. Let’s see what’s next.”

Chudasama was a dentist in a group practice in Kenya but opportunities were hard to come by in his home country he says. So when he retired from cricket he left for the U.S. at a friend’s suggestion eventually landing a faculty position at the Jacksonville University School of Orthodontics in Florida where he did research and taught students. Still despite being in his 40s he had yet to start a practice.

Chudasama enjoyed meeting new groups of students and teaching and called the experience “fantastic.” Still he says there wasn’t much opportunity to practice clinical orthodontics in the school nor was his pay commensurate with what a practicing orthodontist could make. So in 2009 he felt it was time to move on and start a practice.

Chudasama runs two practices in the Dallas-Ft Worth metropolitan area. He started his practice later in his career than most originally teaching at the Jacksonville University School of Orthodontics.

He moved to Texas and opened his first practice Orthodontic Avenue in Coppell a suburb in the Dallas-Ft Worth metropolitan area.

Getting his practice off the ground was difficult. While Chudasama had plenty of clinical experience as a professor and an MBA to help him manage the business side of things the obstacles he faced kept him from feeling like it was a total success.

Chudasama is a positive person—the glass is half full and not half empty. If you ask him to describe his past he often says it was “fantastic.” But in looking back he admits that where he is now is much easier than when he first began and was worrying about where the money would come from and how he would pay his bills.

In what is often a stressful situation trying to grow a new business from the ground up Chudasama says the pressure to perform didn’t affect him but that didn’t mean that things couldn’t be easier. Eventually his practice stabilized and grew and he opened a second location in nearby Flower Mound. But he still needed help to get new patients in the door and establish his practice’s brand.

“Playing two sports winning was normal. Losing was abnormal” says Chudasama. “From a young age when I was under pressure I was able to keep going. It doesn’t faze me. If I get knocked down I stand up and keep going. So was there pressure when I first started? I don’t know. My whole outlook on life is different.”

But a few years ago things changed for the better when Chudasama connected with Angela Weber chief marketing officer of OrthoSynetics and president of Smilebliss.

The collaboration that ensued over 3 years would become the basis for Smilebliss a direct-to-consumer practice model that optimizes key indicators that influence practice growth allowing orthodontists to focus their efforts on the clinical side.

The first positive change Chudasama saw from this collaboration was increased patient volume. Weber and her team used their expertise to create and implement a strategic marketing plan and were able to attract a larger pool of prospective customers. Weber estimates that Chudasama has experienced a 300% growth in new patient starts.

“We’ve perfected the direct-to-consumer approach in driving new patient growth” says Weber. “So we take that know-how and we can get a practice new patient leads and then help work them through the patient experience to get a better conversion of those new patient leads to starts.”

They instituted price transparency allowing patients to know how much it would cost upfront. It helped to eliminate the guesswork in the new patient process for easier conversion.

“For everything else in life we want somebody to tell us what it’s going to cost us” says Chudasama. “So I think fee transparency made sense for consumers.”

They also helped Chudasama with procurement finding better pricing for supplies and equipment. Smilebliss has an online procurement system called SAVE that allows practices to order from a single platform accessing various vendors with discounts of up to 20-30%.

The Smilebliss model includes marketing coaching and training procurement and revenue cycle management both patient and insurance-focused. It isn’t a DSO or OSO; the doctor retains 100% ownership of the practice. It isn’t a franchise either although Smilebliss maintains a consistency of branding and marketing that allows practices to access many of the benefits of the more committal corporate models without giving away control.

For new practices Smilebliss will also offer details like interior design that includes common branding elements but can be customized to a doctor’s liking or finding a productive site location for a new practice.

Smilebliss has partnered with Gaidge which allows practices to use the company’s dashboard for business insights. Its preferred practice management software vendor is Cloud 9 software and by using a single vendor Smilebliss can train staff on the most effective methods of using it.

“It’s a way for doctors to be in practice for themselves but not by themselves” says Weber. “You have a strategic support team behind you who are experts in all of these different business fields. We’ve provided an alternative [to DSOs] another option for a practitioner to stay in ownership and be that entrepreneur but then to have an expert team behind the scenes working with them.”

Smilebliss offers its services to both existing and startup practices. Practice owners sign a 3-year contract with a one-time licensing fee. After that practices pay a monthly service fee.

Smilebliss practice model helps doctors by optimizing the business side and allowing the orthodontist to focus on clinical matters. Smilebliss is not a DSO and doctors maintain complete ownership of their practice.

With the business side becoming more efficient Chudasama could fine-tune his practice the way he wanted one that has consideration for his patients staff and himself in ways that he could not previously. He calls it a lifestyle practice.

“I have a practice that fits into my lifestyle not a lifestyle that has to fit into a practice. The practice doesn’t dictate my lifestyle.”

Chudasama is a practicing Hindu whose faith guides how he runs his practice. His guru the late Pramukh Swami Maharaj’s mantra was “In the joy of others lies our own.” For Chudasama it meant approaching the orthodontics business with an abundance mindset. He wanted to increase access to orthodontic care for his community by creating a price model that could serve the most people. He also took on more staff expanding the team from four to 20 members so that if one or two people were out the rest could absorb the workload without strain.

For his part Chudasama can also be more efficient with his time. He has two locations one in Flower Mound and a new one in Grand Prairie relatively close towns divided by Dallas Ft Worth International Airport. His original location in Coppell was damaged by a flood last year.

“I think everything happens for a reason because I was looking at moving from that location” says Chudasama. “I’m a man of God. So it was a nice push towards starting the practice at Grand Prairie.”

He divides his time between the two locations evenly. Two days at Flower Mound and two days at Grand Prairie with Wednesday off and he works 10 am to 4 pm for a total of 24 hours a week give or take. He certainly could work more but approaching the age of 60 Chudasama has finally found a balance that he likes.

“Life’s been good. This is my fourth life within this life I feel after sports and everything” he says.

He has no plans for retirement now that he has found this equilibrium between success and happiness. Chudasama says he still enjoys the work and interacting with his patients so he figures he could continue working at this level for the foreseeable future. “Everything is fantastic” he says.

“I look at an orthodontic practice especially with Smilebliss as having a place near an ocean with a desalination plant” he says. “So even if there’s a drought you can still take as much water as you need from the ocean—it’s not going anywhere—but be sensible enough not to make pure water the entire day and instead balance your time between work and life and God.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx5bm4uZWR1L25ld3MvMjAyMi9zdGVtLWNvdXJzZXMtc2lnbmFsLXRlY2gtZXJh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Re-classified STEM courses signal technology era for creative fields,"For generations technological breakthroughs have helped advance human evolution.

David Jordan is the president of the Hutchinson-based United Methodist Health Ministry Fund.

Health care is vital for our communities — and under increasing pressure. In part 1 of this series we looked at challenges Kansas faces in supporting the health care systems and workforce needed for our communities to thrive.

By recognizing shifting demographics workforce challenges and changes in health care delivery we have the opportunity to build a sustainable health care system for the future.

To plan ahead and better understand the health care workforce crisis United Methodist Health Ministry Fund commissioned research examining the current health professional education pipeline in Kansas. KU School of Medicine and McPherson College researchers analyzed 2019 program completion data using the National Center for Education Statistics’ Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).

As health care faces significant staffing shortages the report illustrates an opportunity for Kansas — with health profession programs located throughout the state — to strengthen that foundation and increase our homegrown workforce.

In 2019 11804 students graduated from 459 health profession programs located across 51 Kansas institutions. Most (62.7%) completed degree programs of two years or less in duration. The largest number of graduates completed degree programs in nursing or allied health.

With most graduates from programs with two years or less of training to reduce credit loss and barriers to additional training and degree attainment we need to ensure accessible transfer pathways from two-year to four-year post-secondary institutions. We also should examine policies to require credit transfers between Kansas higher education institutions.

Likewise we need to align secondary technical education and postsecondary education programs and ensure health care training completed in high school is transferrable and aligned with degree programs and employer needs.

We should continue to invest in nontraditional workforce development programs such as Gov. Laura Kelly’s recently launched Office of Apprenticeship which seeks to develop and train new talent in critical industries such as healthcare.

We need to examine scope of practice and payment policies to best use our workforce and implement smart systems and policies enabling every provider on the team to practice to the top of their scope.

One example is the newly-recognized community health worker program in Kansas which trains community members in a certificate program to provide crucial health coaching resource and care coordination services education and navigation services. CHWs help consumers better navigate systems and reduce use of high-cost services. They allow providers to focus on practicing to the top of their scope reducing burdens on overworked staff. While CHWs are now certified we need to change Medicaid reimbursement policies to ensure providers can be paid for their services.

We have an opportunity to better leverage providers such as physician assistants dental therapists and others to provide care under doctor-led teams. Expanding team members’ scope of practice can increase capacity and address workforce challenges.

We can leverage technology to maximize our workforce and better serve Kansans. Telehealth provides that opportunity. Before COVID-19 just 11% of US consumers were using telehealth but in 2020 its unique advantages (especially in rural areas) became clear. Now consumers and providers agree telehealth is here to stay playing a key role in integrated patient-centered systems of care.

Ensuring all Kansans have access to reliable broadband allows us to distribute workforce and re-design our health system in a different way. Residents can access hard-to-recruit specialty care in their communities benefiting them while reducing burdens of recruitment. However we must change policies to foster this innovation for the long term.

Workforce competitiveness requires a financially viable system. Kansas is one of only 11 states that has not expanded Medicaid putting hospitals and other providers at financial risk. Expansion would eliminate high levels of uncompensated care helping prevent further hospital closures and benefitting all Kansas health providers.

Changing needs require new approaches. Under the Rural Emergency Hospital model hospitals continue providing emergency services and routine care but discontinue acute inpatient care.

Beyond direct workforce and health system issues we need to ensure Kansas has community supports to ensure health care workers remain in Kansas including child care. A 2020 study reported only 3% of Kansas counties met desired capacity — before COVID-19. While solving the child care crisis requires sustained work at all government levels we can take steps today including better use of child care subsidies.

There is no single solution. Increasing our health care workforce requires research collaboration policy change and willingness to change the status quo. Kansans working together can ensure our communities have health care and thrive for generations. Join the conversation at https://communityconversationsks.com.

The end of the year is fast approaching and like most corporate social responsibility (CSR) leaders you’re likely managing year-end giving campaigns developing next year’s corporate philanthropy strategy or taking a well-deserved vacation. But in the midst of all the festivities don’t forget to give thanks to your employees!

Showing gratitude is a key part of CSR and it's a great way to encourage employees to continue doing their best boost morale build a recurring donor base and show you recognize and appreciate your employees’ efforts. Plus with the holiday season around the corner it's the perfect way to spread cheer. So take some time to show your employees how grateful you are—they deserve it!

At CyberGrants we know that identifying the best ways to show gratitude can be difficult and you may not know where to begin. Luckily in this article we’ve removed the guesswork by outlining five unique ways you can give thanks to your employees for their CSR participation.

1. Gather Employee Feedback

After closing out a giving campaign or volunteer event your CSR team likely spends time evaluating the program’s success. During this process you probably look at the number of participants volunteer hours logged dollars donated and a variety of other data points. But do you ask your employees how they felt about the campaign? Not only is employee feedback an integral part of the evaluation process but your employees also offer a unique perspective that may inform next year’s program and help make it an even greater success.

Following your corporate giving program send a sentiment survey to participants so that they can share their feedback. Be sure to include a section that requests their ideas for making next year’s program even better! This will allow you to incorporate how and where your employees want to give in future initiatives. And when your employees see that you value their input and listen to their voices they’ll know how much you appreciate their efforts to get involved.

Wondering what questions to ask your employees? Check out our campaign evaluation worksheet and program checklist in our Impact Playbook: Diversity Equity Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB).

2. Make an Impact on Employer Branding and Gratitude

As any good marketer knows employer branding is essential for attracting and retaining top talent. Why? Because employees want to make a difference and feel that companies have an obligation to do good. In fact 75% of millennials would take a pay cut to work for a socially responsible company. And what better way to show off your company's commitment to social responsibility than by highlighting your employees' philanthropic efforts? Plus this is a great way to show you appreciate their dedication to giving back.

If you have access to a video production or a graphic design team ask them to film your volunteer event or interview employees about a recent giving campaign. If you can't capture the event or employee testimonials in a video format ask campaign participants if they’d be willing to offer a quote about their experience getting involved. Your team can use this content in a blog post or on social media to show your company’s impact in a digestible and shareable format—hello employer branding!

Not quite a social media savant? We’ve got you covered! Download our GivingTuesday Impact Playbook for social media best practices templates and sample posts.

No matter how you choose to socialize your employees’ efforts this is a great opportunity to show you've been paying attention to their commitment to giving and applaud the incredible impact they’ve made!

Quick Wins:

Get social: Give your employees a shout-out on social media. This is a great way to show appreciation and increase awareness of your company's CSR efforts.



Make it personal: It may seem old school but a handwritten note goes a long way. Thank your employees for their hard work and let them know how much you appreciate their efforts.

3. Empower and Strengthen Your Workforce

Showing your gratitude for employee participation is always important! It's especially impactful when you give a meaningful gift rather than a generic certificate or corporate gift box. Next time opt for something more long-lasting such as offering your employees learning and development opportunities. This way you can show your workforce you recognize their efforts while simultaneously supporting their career growth—a win-win!

Are there any upcoming industry events—virtual or in-person—that would be relevant to departments across your company? Offer a stipend to each person who participated in your volunteer or giving program to attend. Were there particular employees who went above and beyond your expectations? Allow them to take on a leadership role in the next volunteer or giving campaign hosted by your company. Not only will this show your appreciation for their hard work but it will also help them develop leadership skills and advance their careers.

Quick Wins:

Give a gift card: Who doesn't love a little extra spending money? Gift cards are a great way to show your appreciation and they can be used however the recipient chooses.



Give paid time off (PTO): Time is precious so give your employees the gift of time by offering them some extra PTO. This is a great way to show your appreciation and help them recharge.

4. Prioritize Health and Well-being

Your employees work hard and many go above and beyond to make a difference by participating in CSR. Show that you recognize their commitment to doing good and supporting others by offering a company-wide mental health day. Consider closing your office doors on an annual biannual or quarterly basis for your employees to spend time doing whatever it is that helps them recharge and de-stress. If possible plan the day off near a holiday so that it flows into family time.

Company-wide mental health days offer a myriad of benefits beyond showing employee appreciation. Don’t believe us? Mental health days are proven to:

Initiate conversations about mental health in the workplace.

Prevent burnout.

Improve work-life balance.

Increase corporate morale.

Boost productivity.

Increase employee retention.

Improve overall health and well-being.

Decrease absenteeism.

Quick Wins:

Download Headspace: Prevent employee burnout and support your team's mental health by offering your employees a Headspace for Work subscription. The result? Less stress and burnout—and that means fewer sick days better focus and more effective teamwork.



Partner with Gympass: It's no secret that physical and mental health go hand-in-hand. Unfortunately joining a gym or attending a workout class isn't accessible for everyone. Support your employees’ overall health by investing in a corporate well-being platform like Gympass!

5. Celebrate Your Success

There's nothing like a celebratory meal to bring people together and show your appreciation for a job well done. Following a volunteer event or a giving campaign plan to show your gratitude for employee participation with company-sponsored food and drinks.



If your company operates in person invite the program participants to gather in your office kitchen for a catered lunch. You can also take the party elsewhere and toast your impact at a nearby restaurant while enjoying cocktails and appetizers. As a CSR leader this is a great opportunity to give a speech expressing your gratitude and reflect on your program’s success by playing a slideshow of photos and videos from the event.



If your team is remote block off your participants’ calendars and reserve a time to gather virtually to celebrate the impact that everyone made possible. Schedule the celebration during lunch and offer attendees a stipend so that they can order a meal and have it delivered to their doorstep. Alternatively make it a happy hour and host a cocktail-making class. Your team can learn to make a signature cocktail (give it a catchy name!) and spend time sipping and reflecting on your campaign’s success.

Quick Wins:

Give an experience: What better way to show your gratitude for CSR participation than by giving your employees an unforgettable experience? Consider tickets to a sporting event concert or theatrical performance. This is a great way to show your appreciation and create some lasting memories.



Make a Donation: Donate to a charity of your employees' choice in their name. This is a great way to show you care about the causes they're passionate about.

Invest In A Giving Ecosystem

When it comes to building and scaling a successful CSR initiative encouraging employee participation can sometimes be the greatest challenge a management team faces. As a result express your sincere gratitude for those who do show up and they’ll be sure to come back next year. Plus once their colleagues hear about all the impact that was achieved (and the company-sponsored cocktail party) they’ll be eager to get involved too. And just like that you’ve made strides to build a long-term recurring donor base.



Beyond employee appreciation for CSR participation there’s a lot that goes into implementing a successful program. At CyberGrants we support your organization every step of the way.

The Bloodline rules the yard in today’s WWE and for all the right reasons they are at the center position in the poster of the Survivor Series WarGames 2022 premium live event set for late November.



The Men’s WarGames match is likely to headline the show with The Bloodline featuring Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions The Usos Solo Sikoa and Sami Zayn standing on one side of the match.



As seen on last week’s Smackdown The Brawling Brutes (Sheamus Butch and Ridge Holland) and Drew McIntyre will feature in the opposite team with one more name to be tagged to the newly formed group.



According to a report by PWInsider WWE’s original plan was to insert Kevin Owens in the mystery spot to complete The Bloodline’s opposition squad for WarGames Match at Survivor Series. However due to an injury suffered by Owens those plans had to be changed.





Dave Meltzer reported via Wrestling Observer Newsletter that the former WWE Universal Champion suffered an MCL sprain in his right knee after a nasty bump on his leg during a matchup against Austin Theory.This happened during this last Sunday night in a house show at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison Wisconsin. Owens was able to finish the match as he delivered a Stunner to get the pin-fall win. However fans in attendance confirmed that he had to be helped on his way to the backstage area.Meltzer reported that ""the way it was worded was that hopefully that is all the injury is with the idea it could be more than that."" It was also noted that an MCL sprain could cost 4 to 6 months of the top WWE Raw Superstar’s career.Originally the hope was that WWE will utilize Kevin Owens’ experience for WarGames as he’s previously competed in this gimmick match. However in changed circumstances the creative team led by Triple H will have to find out a replacement for The Prizefighter.Owens last appeared on WWE television during the September 30 episode in a six-man tag team match where he Johnny Gargano and Drew McIntyre defeated Theory and The Alpha Academy.Then he was supposed to make his TV return in time for Survivor Series WarGames but things will change due to the unfortunate injury. The alternate name for the Canadian wrestler should be revealed on this week’s Smackdown as WarGames’ build will continue.The 2022 Survivor Series WarGames 2022 Premium Live Event is scheduled for Saturday November 26th at the TD Garden in Boston Massachusetts. The updated match card for the event is given belowRaw Women’s Champion Bianca Belair Asuka Alexa Bliss Mia Yim and TBA participant vs. Bayley Dakota Kai IYO SKY Nikki Cross and Rhea RipleyRonda Rousey (c) vs Shotzi– AJ Styles vs Finn Balor

We lost Paul unexpectedly on Wednesday.

Paul was a New York native who played football at North Carolina and later served as athletic director at Vanderbilt.

In 1996 Hoolahan arrived in New Orleans to take over as CEO of the Allstate Sugar Bowl.

Hoolahan presided over the annual bowl game and all aspects of the Sugar Bowl until 2018.

It was a highly successful tenure.

Paul was a highly successful professional who helped usher in a new era for the big game as the college football landscape underwent dramatic change first with the Bowl Championship Series and later with the current playoff system which exists in college football.

Hoolahan deftly used his contacts and relationships locally statewide and nationally to keep what is now the Allstate Sugar Bowl on the front burner as an elite bowl game remaining one of the title rotation games annually.

That my friends was not an easy task.

Compared to its counterparts in southern California southern Florida north Texas Atlanta and in the Phoenix area New Orleans is a smaller market with far fewer corporate entities and monies to fund the massive amount needed to be part of the national playoff rotation.

Hoolahan adeptly positioned the Sugar Bowl properly and the game has remained highly competitive as one of the best of its kind nationally.

He ushered in the partnership between the Sugar Bowl and the SEC and Big 12 conferences for the matchup of top teams from those conferences annually. That move has proved quite beneficial to New Orleans.

Additionally Hoolahan presided over the Allstate Sugar Bowl championing the cause of prep sports in Louisiana sponsoring many LHSAA championship events during his tenure supporting an annual sailing regatta and even the Allstate Sugar Bowl National Prep Basketball Classic.

The Allstate Sugar Bowl has sponsored CrescentCitySports.com since its inception along with my Original Prep Football Report on radio for nearly two decades now airing locally on NASH ICON 106.1 FM.

Hoolahan was honored with induction into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 2015 a richly deserved honor.

Hoolahan handed over the keys to the Sugar Bowl kingdom to Jeff Hundley who was his most trusted most valuable most capable right hand during his time running the entity.

Hundley has continued the superb stewardship of the Sugar Bowl while paying homage regularly to Hoolihan.

On a personal level I have been blessed to be a member of the Allstate Sugar Bowl Media Selection Committee since 1980 annually nominating and awarding monthly amateur athlete accomplishments yearly award winners and nominating and selecting inductees into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame.

I was asked by then Sugar Bowl CEO Mickey Holmes to be part of the committee in 1980. It has been a humbling honor to be involved for over four decades.

Mickey was a wonderful man and friend whom I admired.

Troy Mathieu was a good man and friend who took over as the Executive Director in 1993.

Hoolahan then came in and the rest is history.

History will treat Hoolahan kindly.

It should.

Paul was simply outstanding in his job.

The Greater New Orleans area owes a debt of gratitude to him.

OBITUARY

Paul J. Hoolahan

March 12 1950 – November 16 2022

Paul John Hoolahan of Metairie La. was born on March 12 1950 in New York and passed away unexpectedly on November 16 2022 in Metairie at the age of 72. He is survived by his wife of 35 years Katherine and their three daughters: Kate Molly and Megan; siblings Priscilla Stewart (late Frank) Nancy Staab (Al) and Stephen Hoolahan (Amy) as well as many beloved nieces and nephews. He is preceded in death by his parents Stanley and Mary Hoolahan.

Hoolahan directed Sugar Bowl operations as the organization’s chief executive officer for 25 games including five national championship games. In over two decades with the Sugar Bowl Hoolahan directed organizational efforts which generated well over $3 billion for the local economy.

Hoolahan later returned to UNC where he would serve as a strength and conditioning coach an academic advisor an assistant athletic director and finally an associate athletic director. Hoolahan also served as Director of Athletics at Vanderbilt University.

Hoolahan coached and played high school football at his alma mater St. Francis Prep a perennial power one-time home to the late Vince Lombardi and was enshrined as an inaugural member of St. Francis Prep’s Athletics Ring of Honor.

Paul will be remembered for his generous spirit. He was a true leader and had a way of making everyone he met feel important and valued welcoming them as a friend. Despite his many professional accomplishments his greatest pride was his family. To his family Paul was thought of as one of the toughest people with the kindest heart. He taught his daughters the importance of hard work and dedication in each of their pursuits and showed them how to live a life full of courage compassion integrity and laughter.

Please join the family to celebrate his life. A visitation will be held on Monday November 21 2022 at St. Catherine of Siena 105 Bonnabel Blvd. Metairie Louisiana beginning at 12:00 followed by a Funeral Mass at 3:00pm. Interment will be private.

While we can’t experience all those little details when we shop online we’re making big improvements to AR shopping on Google to bring the most important part of a store — the product — to life.

Find your foundation shade

Foundation is the most-searched category within makeup. It’s also one of the most personal products you can buy — the slightest change in color or tone can make a big difference. But photos of foundation on models don’t always reflect the diversity of shoppers and other times you can only find images of the product’s packaging. This makes it especially hard to find the best shade and product. In fact among online beauty shoppers more than 60% have decided not to purchase a beauty or cosmetic item online because they didn’t know what color or shade to choose and 41% have decided to return an item because it was the wrong shade.

So today we’re announcing a new AR shopping feature that makes it much easier to find your foundation match. Developed with guidance from beauty brands our new photo library features 148 models representing a diverse spectrum of skin tones ages genders face shapes ethnicities and skin types. Backed by Google’s technology this library is a big step toward changing the way people shop for makeup online helping you better visualize what different products look like on you.

Here’s how it works: Search for a foundation shade on Google across a range of prices and brands like “Clinique Even Better Foundation.” You’ll see what that foundation looks like on models with a similar skin tone including before and after shots to help you decide which one works best for you. Once you’ve found one you like just select a retailer to buy."

GV previously named Google Ventures is the venture capital investment arm of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) which was founded in 2009 by Bill Maris. GV provides seed venture and growth stage funding to startups in the Internet software life science healthcare artificial intelligence transportation cyber security and agriculture sectors.

Though tech companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have well-rounded investment divisions others may not be as committed to their venture arms. With a US recession on the horizon some venture capitalists are hesitant to keep pouring into startups while their own revenues and profits are dwindling.

GV currently has more than $8 billion in assets under management with over 400 active portfolio investments across North America and Europe. Some of its prominent investment outcomes include Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLB) and Verve Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV). To date 65 of Alphabet-backed startups have had successful initial public offerings and 175 companies have been part of prominent M&A agreements.

Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a California-based company that provides sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic and genomic analysis. The genomic solutions are utilized in research and clinical settings for life sciences oncology reproductive health agriculture and other emerging applications.

The venture capital arm of Google first invested in Grail an American biotechnology company focusing on developing an early cancer screening test for people who do not have active symptoms. In September 2020 Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) announced an agreement to purchase Grail for $7.1 billion. Currently Alphabet’s GV Management holds a stake worth nearly $10 million in Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN).

Like Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLB) and Verve Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV) Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is one of the premier holdings in the Alphabet investment portfolio.

Story continues

Polen Capital made the following comment about Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) has had a very difficult year on what we believe are transitory issues. First the company closed its acquisition of Grail a startup early-stage cancer testing business it re-acquired (Grail was founded inside Illumina originally) for $8 billion without regulatory approval. Illumina management believes that European regulators have no jurisdiction over the transaction as Grail had no European presence or revenue and member states did not complain within the timeframe specified in applicable regulations. The regulators have challenged these assertions and are likely to try to require Illumina to divest Grail subject to Illumina’s appeal. In the meantime Grail has already been very dilutive to Illumina’s earnings and Illumina may have to sell the asset at the end of it all. It is unknown how much Grail could be sold for in this environment if Illumina is forced to divest. Second Illumina’s core sequencing business has also slowed. This is not unusual as the business has always been a bit lumpy but there are new competitors trying to prove that they can sequence genomes cheaper than Illumina without sacrificing accuracy. Our research here suggests: 1) competitor technologies do not seem to be as cost-effective or accurate in the real world as advertised providing limited risk to Illumina’s core business; 2) Illumina has unveiled its own next-generation technology which lowers the cost of sequencing the human genome to only $200 including data processing costs with world-class accuracy; 3) the slowdown in the core business is more macroeconomic as customers are looking to reduce consumables inventory levels in tough times and should pass quite quickly considering customers are continuing to use their sequencers at high levels; and 4) even if Illumina were forced to divest Grail we think they would likely be able to sell it for above what it purchased it for as all of the clinical data on the company’s Galleri cancer screen is now publicly available (it is very positive in our view). Grail has made significant commercial progress since its acquisition and the company should only be closer to U.S. regulatory approval. We believe we can buy the shares today at an extremely cheap valuation for the core business of a company that we view as having an unmatched position in a market that should be multiples of its current size in the years to come.”

“Beam Therapeutics Inc. is a biotechnology company pioneering a novel technology called base editing which allows for individual base pairs (the letters of DNA) to be modified. Shares fell along with other biotechnology stocks driven by a sudden rise in treasury yields. Early stage biotechnology stocks are particularly sensitive to interest rates because their cash flows are further in the future. We believe we are entering into a phase of significant advancement for the gene editing field that will eventually lead to curative therapies and we think Beam has a unique platform technology.”

As of November 15 Alphabet’s GV held a stake worth $18.5 million in Toast Inc. (NYSE:TOST).

Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund has to say about Toast Inc. (NYSE:TOST) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:

“Toast Inc. is a cloud-based end-to-end technology platform purpose-built for the restaurant industry. Its platform provides a comprehensive suite of cloud software products and financial technology solutions to its customers to connect front-of-house with back-of-house operations across all customer channels. Toast’s core module is its point-of-sale software solution and requires all customers to use Toast as their payment processor. Customers then have the option to bundle or add-on additional modules across operations digital ordering and delivery marketing and loyalty team management and back office. Toast today powers 48000 restaurants within the 860000 U.S. restaurant industry largely focusing on small- and medium-sized (“SMB”) restaurant customers (generally fewer than 10 locations but up to 50) with some larger enterprise customers as well. Toast is the clear market leader in SMB restaurant technology with the best product offering and only full end-to-end platform. We believe that as restaurants continue to invest in technology at an accelerated pace emerging from COVID Toast will be a big beneficiary given its leading market position and best-in-class product. At less than 6% penetration of U.S. restaurants and 3% penetration of its $15 billion recurring-revenue TAM Toast has a long runway for growth by signing on additional locations to the platform and increasing the attach rate of its value-add modules. Only 54% of customers today use 4 or more of Toast’s 10-plus modules each of which provide significant value to the customer and would drive Toast’s recurring revenue stream higher.”

While we can’t experience all those little details when we shop online we’re making big improvements to AR shopping on Google to bring the most important part of a store — the product — to life.

Find your foundation shade

Foundation is the most-searched category within makeup. It’s also one of the most personal products you can buy — the slightest change in color or tone can make a big difference. But photos of foundation on models don’t always reflect the diversity of shoppers and other times you can only find images of the product’s packaging. This makes it especially hard to find the best shade and product. In fact among online beauty shoppers more than 60% have decided not to purchase a beauty or cosmetic item online because they didn’t know what color or shade to choose and 41% have decided to return an item because it was the wrong shade.

So today we’re announcing a new AR shopping feature that makes it much easier to find your foundation match. Developed with guidance from beauty brands our new photo library features 148 models representing a diverse spectrum of skin tones ages genders face shapes ethnicities and skin types. Backed by Google’s technology this library is a big step toward changing the way people shop for makeup online helping you better visualize what different products look like on you.

Here’s how it works: Search for a foundation shade on Google across a range of prices and brands like “Clinique Even Better Foundation.” You’ll see what that foundation looks like on models with a similar skin tone including before and after shots to help you decide which one works best for you. Once you’ve found one you like just select a retailer to buy."

GETTYSBURG Pa. — At the Gateway mini mart here you can buy menthol-flavored hemp cigarettes an impressive 1-pound bag of pipe tobacco or a Dragon Ball Z-themed bong — or you can submit a formal comment to regulators at the Food and Drug Administration.

A sign on the door warns consumers: “The FDA Is Trying To Ban Menthol Cigarettes and Flavored Cigars.” Scan the QR code at the bottom of the poster and it’ll take you to the website for a group called Citizens for Tobacco Rights. There you can submit a comment opposing the FDA’s April proposal to ban menthol and flavored cigarettes and cigars which would still have to be finalized formally to take effect.

Citizens for Tobacco Rights is run by Philip Morris USA the maker of Marlboro cigarettes and other companies under the Altria corporate umbrella including John Middleton the makers of Black and Mild cigars. If you squint you’ll see at the bottom edge of the poster — printed in tiny white letters — that the poster itself was paid for by Altria on behalf of Philip Morris and John Middleton.

The poster is one of the many ways tobacco companies are drumming up opposition to the FDA’s controversial proposed ban of menthol and flavored tobacco products.

Marlboro has sent out emails to its customers too — even those who haven’t signed up for anything close to political advertising. Liz Overhiser a smoker in Michigan who supports the menthol ban told STAT she may have signed up for coupons “possibly a decade ago” but in May she received an email from Marlboro urging her to “Speak Out Against a Ban on Menthol Cigarettes.” The link included in that email directs to the Citizens for Tobacco Rights as well.

All told the cigarette company’s efforts appear to have netted at least 20000 comments opposing the proposed regulation. Those 20000 comments all state verbatim that “banning menthol cigarettes unfairly limits adult choices for tobacco products that are already highly regulated and age-restricted.”

Tobacco distributors like gas stations and smoke shops themselves have become a major force opposing the proposed ban too. Tobacco retailers have submitted more than 25000 nearly identical comments warning that flavored tobacco bans “could shift sales to illegal markets where many consumers can still get them but without any regulatory protection or underage prevention.” Organizations representing tobacco sellers in states like Texas and Arizona also met directly with FDA officials earlier this year opposing the ban.

The sheer volume of consumer and business interest has forced top FDA officials to take notice. Brian King the newly installed director of the FDA’s tobacco center has repeatedly emphasized the onslaught of input.

“We got about 250000 comments — so not a negligible amount — and the FDA goes through every single comment” King said during public remarks earlier this month. “We are committed to getting through those comments as quickly as possible.

Proponents of the ban say it will save hundreds of thousands of lives and help rectify racial disparities given Black smokers’ preference for menthol cigarettes. Opponents of the ban say it will limit adults’ choices and will lead to an illicit market for such products.

Steven Balla co-director of the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center and an expert on mass comment campaigns told STAT he was doubtful that the campaign itself would work to change the FDA’s mind.

“I suspect that the administration has pretty clear preferences and is going to go ahead [with its proposal]” said Balla who cited his research showing that mass comment campaigns have less of an impact on an agency’s rulemaking process than other substantive comments.

The comments are just one element of tobacco companies’ sweeping strategy to pressure regulators to abandon the plan.

A number of groups with financial ties to tobacco companies from conservative tax groups and business lobbies to law enforcement groups and Black farmers have also mobilized opposition to the menthol ban. These groups have filed comments with the FDA met directly with FDA officials and spoken publicly against the ban according to STAT’s review of federal records and public agendas.

Tobacco companies have also been aggressively courting the Black community more generally including reportedly offering a Black pastor $250000 to oppose the ban.

Even the libertarian think tank behind the federal “right to try” law the Goldwater Institute has been speaking out against the menthol ban. The Goldwater Institute has received funding from Altria since at least 2012.

Law enforcement groups with ties to the tobacco industry have been particularly active. The Law Enforcement Action Partnership and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives both which received funding from Altria last year have both spoken out against the ban.

The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives argued in its comments to the FDA that the proposed ban would create “a new category of criminal conduct into our neighborhoods which violate the state and local criminal laws we are obligated to enforce.” Current and former police officers involved in the groups also spoke at an FDA “listening session” this summer.

The National Sheriffs’ Association which also has received funding from Altria also met directly with FDA officials this spring.

An Altria spokesperson said in a statement that the group “inform[s] stakeholders of our public policy positions and when appropriate may ask them to share their views.”

“Many – including harm reduction advocates criminal justice reform groups law enforcement organizations regulated retailers voters farmers unions and adult consumers — share our opposition to a prohibition on menthol cigarettes and have decided to share their views” she added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZ3JlYXRub3J0aHdlc3R3aW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4L2EtdmluZS1zdGFydC1zdGUtbWljaGVsbGVzLW5ldy1vd25lcnMtYWRkLXJhdGhlci10aGFuLXN1YnRyYWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Vine Start: Ste. Michelle's new owners add rather than subtract,"The Rex Hill/A to Z Wineworks production facility is among the Chehalem Mountains near downtown Newberg Ore. (Photo courtesy of Ste. Michelle Wine Estates)

Ste. Michelle Wine Estates and its team have experienced turbulent times in recent years but Sept. 7 sparked some celebrations when the largest wine company in Washington state announced its acquisition of two of Oregon’s largest brands — A to Z Wineworks and Rex Hill.

The move makes Ste. Michelle Wine Estates the largest wine company in Oregon and the shock and awe generated by the news will reverberate. It also means greater responsibility for Juan Muñoz-Oca chief winemaker for Ste. Michelle Wine Estates but he doesn’t seem to mind spending a bit more time on the southern side of the Columbia River.

“The reactions from colleagues in the industry have all been of great excitement with international and U.S.-based colleagues alike being happy and excited for both A to Z and Ste. Michelle” Muñoz-Oca said.

A year ago private equity firm Sycamore Partners reportedly paid $1.2 billion to tobacco conglomerate Altria for Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. It was a deal orchestrated by Bank of the West.

It was no secret in the Oregon wine industry that A to Z Wineworks was on the market. Who provided financing for A to Z for the past 15 years? Bank of the West.

Considering that Adam Beak managing director of the bank’s beverage division knows the balance sheets and desires of both companies the September sale was a natural match. Much of A to Z’s production is dedicated to approachable Pinot Noir in the $20-$25 range — an attractive tier for Ste. Michelle.

Beak also has a sense of the value of the Woodinville real estate Ste. Michelle placed on the market not long before the A to Z sale was announced. Wine is no longer produced on the Woodinville campus and Ste. Michelle officials acknowledge the possibility that its tasting gallery connected to the iconic château could be leased back to Ste. Michelle as part of a deal.

So in less than a year of formal ownership Sycamore — with holdings that include Staples Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor — went big again in the Pacific Northwest wine industry.

Earlier this year Wine Business Monthly magazine research ranked Ste. Michelle at No. 8 in the U.S. for wine production with 8.2 million cases. Château Ste. Michelle accounted for 3.1 million cases. Next was 14 Hands at 1.3 million cases.

With the Oregon acquisitions — the two brands produce about 400000 cases — SMWE moves closer to No. 7 Bronco Wine Co. which WBM estimated produces 9 million cases. (Bronco founder Fred Franzia died Sept. 13 at the age of 79.)

E. & J. Gallo Winery which owns Columbia Winery across the street from Château Ste. Michelle dominates the U.S. industry with an estimated 100 million cases. The Wine Group is a distant second at 51 million.

Weighing in at No. 11 with 3.2 million cases is Seattle-based Precept the privately owned company led by Andrew Browne who grew up in Spokane. A substantial portion of its portfolio is in Oregon and in Pinot Noir.

A to Z Wineworks was created in 2002 and owned by Bill and Deb Hatcher Sam Tannahill and Cheryl Francis. Each came with a background of helping to lead some of Oregon’s most famous wineries. In 20 years they grew A to Z Wineworks to 365000 cases. Rex Hill a respected winery they purchased in 2006 makes about 30000 cases.

“We could not have found a better partner than Ste. Michelle to carry on the legacy of both A to Z and Rex Hill” Deb Hatcher stated in a news release. “They understand the Pacific Northwest better than anyone and they know what it takes to promote an entire region on the global stage.”

She Francis and Tannahill become consultants for Ste. Michelle. Bill Hatcher enters retirement. Amy Prosenjak president and CEO of A to Z joins SMWE as president of Oregon Brands. That includes Erath Winery which Ste. Michelle purchased in 2006. When combined it positions Ste. Michelle as the largest producer of Oregon wine at about 800000 cases. According to Wine Business Monthly reporting the state’s largest single vintner is Union Wine Co. at 480000 cases.

Ed King CEO and co-founder of King Estate Winery with 300000 cases to sell each year shared with me that he doesn’t view the acquisition by Ste. Michelle as the move of a competitor.

“This further establishes the value the wine world places on Oregon wines and is a strong testament to the success of our longtime friends and colleagues Deb Hatcher Sam Tannahill Bill Hatcher and Cheryl Francis” King said. “They have labored long and hard to get to this point and I personally doubt that these dynamos will stay on the sidelines for long.

“In the long term this can only bode well for the Oregon wine industry” King added. “King Estate is honored to continue working alongside these and so many other outstanding vintners for years to come.”

For decades critics of Ste. Michelle Wine Estates were quick to point out its links to the tobacco industry. It’s worth noting U.S. Tobacco of Connecticut which bought Ste. Michelle in 1974 replanted Cold Creek Vineyard after the devastating winter of 1978. At the time Cold Creek — a warm site west of the Wahluke Slope and recommended to Ste. Michelle by the late Walter Clore — was the state’s largest planting at 500 acres. It’s difficult to imagine anyone other than “Big Tobacco” being willing and able to invest twice in a vineyard that large.

We all know that anything is for sale — if the price is attractive enough. Right now though it would seem Ste. Michelle Wine Estates is charting a course as the largest wine company in the Pacific Northwest. And talented winemakers remain in place to do the work that matters most to consumers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vY3NuZXdzLmNvbS92aWRlby13b3Jkcy13aXNkb20tY29udmVuaWVuY2Utc3RvcmUtbmV3cy13b21lbi15ZWFy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VIDEO: Words of Wisdom From Convenience Store News' Women of the Year,"LAS VEGAS — Convenience Store News' 2022 Top Women in Convenience (TWIC) Awards Gala celebrated a record 91 honorees including 36 Senior-Level Leaders 40 Rising Stars 10 Mentors and five Women of the Year.

Two weeks ago Beth shared that S-team and I decided to pause new incremental hires in our corporate workforce. Today I want to share some information about role eliminations. We are in the middle of our annual operating planning review where we look at each of our businesses and make decisions about what we believe we should change. Leaders across the company are working with their teams and looking at their workforce levels investments they want to make in the future and prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. This year’s review is more difficult due to the fact that the economy remains in a challenging spot and we’ve hired rapidly the last several years.

Yesterday we communicated the difficult decision to eliminate a number of positions across our Devices and Books businesses and also announced a voluntary reduction offer for some employees in our People Experience and Technology (PXT) organization. Our annual planning process extends into the new year which means there will be more role reductions as leaders continue to make adjustments. Those decisions will be shared with impacted employees and organizations early in 2023. We haven’t concluded yet exactly how many other roles will be impacted (we know that there will be reductions in our Stores and PXT organizations) but each leader will communicate to their respective teams when we have the details nailed down. And as has been the case this week we will prioritize communicating directly with impacted employees before making broad public or internal announcements.

I’ve been in this role now for about a year and a half and without a doubt this is the most difficult decision we’ve made during that time (and we’ve had to make some very tough calls over the past couple of years particularly during the heart of the pandemic). It’s not lost on me or any of the leaders who make these decisions that these aren’t just roles we’re eliminating but rather people with emotions ambitions and responsibilities whose lives will be impacted. We are working to support those who are affected and trying to help them find new roles on teams that have a need; and in cases where that’s not possible we are offering packages that include a separation payment transitional health insurance benefits and external job placement support.

Amazon has weathered uncertainty and difficult economies in the past and we will continue to do so. We have big opportunities ahead both in our more established businesses like Stores Advertising and AWS but also in our newer initiatives that we’ve been working on for a number of years and have conviction in pursuing (e.g. Prime Video Alexa Kuiper Zoox and Healthcare). The key will be to do what Amazon does best – obsess over customers and invent relentlessly on their behalf – and if we do that we should all be very optimistic about Amazon’s future. I know I am.

I want to thank each of you for your continuing contributions during this challenging time and as we gear up to deliver for customers during the busy shopping season.

Thanks

And even when the company’s CEO finally commented on Thursday he said an unspecified number of additional layoffs would happen early in 2023 leaving many employees wondering if they would have a job in a few months.

The cycle began on Monday morning when the New York Times reported that Amazon would eliminate approximately 10000 jobs — or around 3 percent of its worldwide corporate staff. Amazon had recently frozen hiring in some divisions and axed some experimental initiatives and a company executive warned on recent calls with reporters and Wall Street analysts that shoppers are tightening their belts and Amazon would be too.

After the first report of expected layoffs many employees assumed they would soon hear from someone at the top of the company — either CEO Andy Jassy or one of his deputies. It didn’t happen. In the end 48 hours would pass between when news of the layoffs first broke in the press and when a top company executive acknowledged the tough reality to the rest of the company. It would take another day and half for acknowledgment from Jassy who wrote in a blog post on Thursday that the cuts were “the most difficult decision” Amazon has made during his year and a half as CEO. And even then it was unclear to many employees if they would soon lose their jobs too.

“I don’t even know if I want to work for this company any more” an Amazon senior manager who has worked at the company for more than 10 years told Recode on Wednesday afternoon referencing the lack of transparency from company leaders. “This is a horrendous way to treat people.”

The job cuts at Amazon are just the latest among the ruling class of tech companies used to years of dominant growth and convinced by pandemic-fueled business success that an economic pullback wasn’t on the horizon. The messiness of Amazon’s layoff rollout also underscores how rare such a moment is for the king of e-commerce. Amazon laid off several hundred employees in 2018 but its last significant job cuts date all the way back to 2001 when it axed 1500 people or 15 percent of its then-staff in the wake of the dot-com crash and amid a brief US recession.

This time around by the evening of the day the news first broke many employees had pushed aside the day’s work in favor of talking with colleagues to gather crumbs of intelligence about the future of their livelihoods. Some managers told employees they thought their division was safe but others said they knew little. A source familiar with the decisions said the company’s business leaders wanted to communicate the layoffs to those who were losing their job first before broadcasting a message to the entire company.

On Tuesday morning that began happening. Some Amazon employees — most notably those working in the flashy but unprofitable Alexa voice assistant division — found a calendar invitation for a 15-minute videoconference awaiting them. They were told the bad news via a script. Soon laid-off employees began flooding LinkedIn with their personal announcements. One employee in Alexa’s AI division said 60 percent of her team had been let go “attributed to downsizing/prioritizing projects.” While Alexa is one of the flagship brands that Amazon is best known for the company has been unable to generate significant revenue for the voice assistant service in the eight years since it launched and soared in popularity. The division that houses Alexa and Amazon’s own tech gadgets had lost more than $5 billion annually in recent years the Wall Street Journal reported in early November.

Meanwhile other employees compiled lists of those divisions that were experiencing cuts and those that might be safe based on a combination of the LinkedIn confessionals self-reported information and internal rumors.

Then on Tuesday evening large swaths of the company’s HR division including recruiters and software engineers alike received a buyout offer or voluntary release program. In exchange for voluntarily walking away from their job Amazon was offering employees three months of pay plus one week of salary for every six months of tenure at the company. Those who received it have two weeks to make a decision. The division’s leaders would not rule out involuntary layoffs in the new year if more cuts were deemed necessary. It’s unclear whether the severance package would be the same or different and that lack of clarity created more angst for employees and managers alike.

“They resent being given this ‘choice’ without any information about what the future holds” one manager told Recode.

By Wednesday morning most Amazon employees still had heard nothing from the top of the company despite the previous days’ cuts in Alexa and in some other areas like the cloud gaming business Amazon Luna. Employees said little work was getting done and business-oriented emails had slowed to a trickle.

“The truth of the matter is that if the company was more transparent we wouldn’t have this shitshow” another Amazon senior manager told Recode. “Now you have most of the population wondering if they are next.”

Finally around 11 am ET on Wednesday Amazon executive Dave Limp who oversees the company’s wide range of consumer electronic gadgets and the division that runs Alexa posted a message about the cuts that had started the previous day.

“After a deep set of reviews we recently decided to consolidate some teams and programs” he wrote. “One of the consequences of these decisions is that some roles will no longer be required. It pains me to have to deliver this news as we know we will lose talented Amazonians from the Devices & Services org as a result.”

Around the same time Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel released a public comment to reporters.

“As part of our annual operating planning review process we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change” it read. “As we’ve gone through this given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring) some teams are making adjustments which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don’t take these decisions lightly and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.”

Unfortunately for Amazon employees no layoff news in their division so far doesn’t mean it’s not coming. In Jassy’s note published around 5 pm ET on Thursday the CEO said that an undetermined number of additional “role reductions” would happen in early 2023. The New York Times previously reported that beyond the company’s Alexa and HR divisions Amazon’s core retail business would also eventually suffer cuts. Jassy called out HR and the company’s physical store group as divisions that are expected to experience future job cuts.

“[A]s has been the case this week we will prioritize communicating directly with impacted employees before making broad public or internal announcements” the CEO said.

Update November 17 6 pm ET: This story originally published on November 16 has been updated with new details about Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s comments on the layoffs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvYW1hem9uLWNlby1hbmR5LWphc3N5LXNheXMtbGF5b2Zmcy13aWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlLWludG8tbmV4dC15ZWFyLmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9hbWF6b24tY2VvLWFuZHktamFzc3ktc2F5cy1sYXlvZmZzLXdpbGwtY29udGludWUtaW50by1uZXh0LXllYXIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says layoffs will continue into next year,"Amazon had already implemented a hiring freeze in its corporate workforce as it looks to slow headcount growth. The company is still hiring warehouse workers to staff up for the holiday rush.

Job cuts are hitting the tech sector hard after years of unbridled growth. Facebook parent Meta last week laid off 13% of its staff while Twitter Shopify Salesforce and Stripe have also announced cuts.

Here's the full memo from Jassy:

Two weeks ago Beth shared that S-team and I decided to pause new incremental hires in our corporate workforce. Today I want to share some information about role eliminations. We are in the middle of our annual operating planning review where we look at each of our businesses and make decisions about what we believe we should change. Leaders across the company are working with their teams and looking at their workforce levels investments they want to make in the future and prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. This year's review is more difficult due to the fact that the economy remains in a challenging spot and we've hired rapidly the last several years.

Yesterday we communicated the difficult decision to eliminate a number of positions across our Devices and Books businesses and also announced a voluntary reduction offer for some employees in our People Experience and Technology (PXT) organization. Our annual planning process extends into the new year which means there will be more role reductions as leaders continue to make adjustments. Those decisions will be shared with impacted employees and organizations early in 2023. We haven't concluded yet exactly how many other roles will be impacted (we know that there will be reductions in our Stores and PXT organizations) but each leader will communicate to their respective teams when we have the details nailed down. And as has been the case this week we will prioritize communicating directly with impacted employees before making broad public or internal announcements.

I've been in this role now for about a year and a half and without a doubt this is the most difficult decision we've made during that time (and we've had to make some very tough calls over the past couple of years particularly during the heart of the pandemic). It's not lost on me or any of the leaders who make these decisions that these aren't just roles we're eliminating but rather people with emotions ambitions and responsibilities whose lives will be impacted. We are working to support those who are affected and trying to help them find new roles on teams that have a need; and in cases where that's not possible we are offering packages that include a separation payment transitional health insurance benefits and external job placement support.

Amazon has weathered uncertainty and difficult economies in the past and we will continue to do so. We have big opportunities ahead both in our more established businesses like Stores Advertising and AWS but also in our newer initiatives that we've been working on for a number of years and have conviction in pursuing (e.g. Prime Video Alexa Kuiper Zoox and Healthcare). The key will be to do what Amazon does best – obsess over customers and invent relentlessly on their behalf – and if we do that we should all be very optimistic about Amazon's future. I know I am.

I want to thank each of you for your continuing contributions during this challenging time and as we gear up to deliver for customers during the busy shopping season.

Thanks

Andy"

He still remembers when a soldier came into his home and shot his father in the leg. The incident helped solidify the family’s decision to flee to Uganda about 10 years ago when J.R. was just 13 years old.

“What made us move from the DRC to Uganda was insecurity” he recalled.

In June J.R. found asylum in the United States. Since arriving in Wisconsin the organization World Relief Fox Valley helped him find employment as an interpreter for the manufacturer Amcor Flexibles where he translates documents and interprets languages.

“It is so amazing living in Wisconsin” he said. “As somebody from Africa living here is like a dream to me. … My dreams are becoming true in the United States.”

J.R. now lives in Appleton but he isn’t the only refugee thriving in the Fox Valley. Many refugees are finding family-sustaining employment and helping address the labor shortage in Northeast Wisconsin.

The Fox Valley has seen an influx of almost 1400 refugees over the last decade including 181 people from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal last year according to Tami McLaughlin the director of World Relief Fox Valley.

The organization helps refugees secure housing employment and other necessities and works to educate local communities about the benefits of welcoming refugees McLaughlin noted. She said about 60 percent of refugees are placed in Oshkosh and around 40 percent go to Appleton.

After arrival World Relief Fox Valley’s employment specialist meets with adult refugees to discuss their skills interests and goals. The specialist generally tries to pair refugees with an employer around their first 30 to 60 days in Wisconsin McLaughlin noted.

She added that World Relief Fox Valley’s employment specialist receives at least one phone call a week from employers looking for workers.

“Refugees have good reputations for employment” McLaughlin said. “They desire to work. They want to work hard. They want to advance. They want the same things that we want.”

Many of World Relief Fox Valley’s refugees find employment in manufacturing she said while others work in health care retail and in other service industry jobs.

Manufacturing

One manufacturer that has benefited from the influx of refugees is Amcor Flexibles. In 2022 the company hired more than 50 refugees through its “Project Ally” program a collaboration with World Relief Fox Valley.

Antoinette Heenan Amcor’s talent acquisition manager said most of the company’s refugees work in production roles which includes running equipment driving forklifts and assisting on machines.

Heenan said the refugees have been a great addition to Amcor’s team.

“As we all know recruiting and retaining talent is tough nowadays” she said. “And these individuals have a great attitude great work ethic willingness and desire to grow.”

By working in manufacturing Heenan said many refugees have been able to purchase vehicles and rent larger apartments for themselves and their families as well as send money to family members still in their home country.

“How scary would it be to be pulled from your country and placed at a completely random place within the United States?” she said. “… These colleagues with the opportunities for growth that they do have they can make a better life not just for themselves here but for their family at home.”

While most of the refugees at Amcor are involved in the manufacturing side Heenan said there are three including J.R. who work as interpreters.

As an interpreter J.R. said he has the ability to help the Fox Valley community by assisting individuals who can’t speak or read English.

“I am not there for money” he said. “I first dedicate myself personally to the job by serving the community through that job. I enjoy serving the people at my work. That’s the part that I most enjoy.”

Trucking

Earlier this year Fox Valley Technical College launched a customized truck driver training program to help Somali and Afghan refugees earn a commercial driver’s license to become a semitruck driver.

The program was made possible through a partnership between Fox Valley Tech the Hidden Talent Project from the Bay Area Workforce Development Board and a $1.6 million grant from the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.

Rob Behnke director of trucking driving at Fox Valley Tech said the program was an expansion of the institution’s mission.

“With refugees coming to Wisconsin or coming to the United States that’s our business model: We’re here to help” he said. “There are a lot of jobs — especially in the trucking industry right now — if there’s people that are able willing have the credentials (and) are qualified. We provide skilled workers for these industry partners.”

One person who participated in the program was Asha Hirsi a Somali refugee who was passionate about becoming a truck driver.

“I have a husband who’s a truck driver and I used to go with him so I’ve seen how he works and sometimes I see the challenge” she told WLUK-TV in July. “I cannot wait to get behind the wheel. I think it would be a very exciting day.”

Community benefit

World Relief Fox Valley hopes to resettle another 300 refugees over the 2023 fiscal year which began last month.

Although refugees are helping to address the labor shortage in Northeast Wisconsin McLaughlin said they also help enrich communities.

“They make our area much more interesting” she said. “They bring a piece of the world to Northeast Wisconsin and help expand our worldview.”

Through working with refugees McLaughlin said she’s learned more about the value of relationships.

“Sitting down for a cup of coffee and taking that time to get to know people is much more important and much more fulfilling than always being on the clock and always worrying about that to-do checklist and where I have to be next” she said.

By working with people from different backgrounds she said individuals start to see that as humans we have much in common between cultures.

“We have some things to learn from them” she said. “If we allow those opportunities to happen I think we can change too. And that might make us a better community.”

Likewise J.R. said many refugees hope to give back to their new communities by helping to create positive change.

“We came not only to make money here or to change our life or to help our family back in our own country like Congo or Uganda but some of us came to make the United States very strong” he said. “Very strong how? By helping the community to change environments.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHA6Ly93d3cubGFiZWxzYW5kbGFiZWxpbmcuY29tL25ld3Mvc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHkvYW1jb3ItdHJpcGxlcy1yZWN5Y2xlZC1jb250ZW50LXRhcmdldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amcor triples recycled content target,"The new recycled content target which is three times its previous target of 10 percent comes as Amcor reflects on a landmark year for its efforts on sustainability. In fiscal year 2022 the company committed to net zero emissions by 2050 more than doubled post-consumer recycled material purchased since 2019 and achieved a Gold rating from EcoVadis for its industry-leading sustainability practices placing Amcor among the top 5 percent of all companies assessed.

The report highlights how Amcor has advanced on its pledge to make all products recyclable reusable or compostable by 2025 with 74 percent of total production by weight already designed to be recycled and the number of innovative products with more sustainable properties continually growing.

In 2022 the company launched a product rebrand that includes its new EcoGuard brand that makes it easier for customers to choose from a number of more sustainable solutions including products that reduce the carbon footprint of packaging are designed to be recycled and use recycled content or biomaterials.

Progress on Amcor’s EnviroAction program also continues with a 33 percent reduction in waste sent to disposal over the past three years and 121 Amcor sites achieving zero waste-to-disposal last year. All sites have water management plans in place and every site that uses plastic pellets granules or flakes has implemented Operation Clean Sweep methodology for preventing plastic pellet loss.

Ron Delia CEO at Amcor commented: ‘We’re continuing to show ambition and leadership to deliver better sustainability results for our people our customers our investors and the environment. We’re working with every part of the value chain to make this happen.

‘I am particularly proud of our colleagues around the world who are dedicated to delivering on our sustainability ambitions. We now have an exciting lineup of innovative packaging products and we keep raising the bar to deliver the very best solutions for our customers’ specific needs.’

David Clark vice president of sustainability at Amcor added: ‘At Amcor we’re proud of the work we’re doing to make our business and the packaging industry more sustainable.

‘In ramping up our targets for recycled content we’re helping radically scale the amount of recycled content coming into the market to create a circular economy for packaging. We do this by not only making sure that the packaging produced is designed to be recycled but also by boosting infrastructure and consumer awareness to ensure content gets recycled and stays in the economy.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzYW5kc3Rhci5jby51ay9uZXdzLzIzMTMxNDEzLjExMy1qb2JzLWxvc3QtYW1jb3ItZmxleGlibGVzLXdvcmtpbmd0b24tbmV4dC1tb250aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,113 jobs to be lost at Amcor Flexibles in Workington next month | Times and Star,"Amcor Flexibles based at Salterbeck Industrial Estate which makes packaging has informed staff of the cuts following a consultation period which started in July.

Bosses say the restructure will help the business to ensure it is “best positioned to serve customers” and will “succeed in the long-term”.

A spokesperson from Amcor Flexibles said: “From year to year we adapt our operations and capabilities to the changing market landscape and opportunities to ensure we are best positioned to serve our customers.

“To help us set up Amcor Flexibles Cumbria to succeed in the long-term on July 12 2022 Amcor announced the proposal to close one of the production units (Short Run Flexo) at AF Cumbria subject to consultation with workforce representatives.

“This proposal would mean that Amcor Flexibles Cumbria would remain focused on the site’s higher performing production areas - Amcell and Extrusion Portfolio.

“The consultation period with employee representatives around a social plan to support employees concluded in September 2022.

“Amcor Flexibles Cumbria is working towards closing the one production unit (Short Run Flexo) in December. The approximate number of co-workers leaving Amcor Flexibles Cumbria is 113 who we are supporting during this period of change.”

Amcor Flexibles dates back to the 1860s when Yorkshire stonemason Samuel Ramsden relocated to Australia and established Victoria's first paper mill.

In the 1970s and 1980s it diversified the range of packaging products it created.

It now operates more than 180 sites in more than 40 countries and describes itself as ""a global leader in responsible packaging solutions"".

The company supplies rigid and flexible packaging products into the food beverage healthcare home and personal care and tobacco industries.

Amcor Flexibles supplies packaging for Pepsico the company which owns the Walkers Crisps brand.

Since then the trend of gazing at lights while staying cozy in the car has picked up speed.

Six Flags St. Louis isn’t opening this year for its Holiday in the Park festival. A spokesperson said unpredictable weather has made it too tough to operate the park's rides so an outside company is putting on a drive-thru display in the parking lot.

Grant’s Farm started a drive-thru holiday light display in 2020 and this year it opens on select nights for spectators on foot. There are also chances to have breakfast with Santa and Mrs. Claus and to rent a fire pit alongside Mirror Lake.

Garden Glow at the Missouri Botanical Garden will bring back the holiday floral show in its new Emerson Conservatory. The exhibition had been on hiatus for two years while the Jack C. Taylor Visitor Center was under construction. There will be no trains this year as the employees — and plants and flowers — adjust to the new space. Organizers expect to bring back the miniature train displays next year.

“What’s most exciting is some of these plants we have not been able to have on display in a permanent spot” says Pat Scace floral display supervisor for the garden. “This is a highly climatically controlled space. We’re thinking the plant collection will be happy.”

Scace and the garden crew will have to work around the conservatory's permanent planter boxes to accommodate an array of poinsettias begonias trees lights and other holiday decor. And since the conservatory is on the same level as the garden it will be integrated into the surroundings with views of the Climatron and gardens from inside and views of the display from outside.

“It’s exciting” she says. “It’s refreshing to do something different and new.”

The 2022 Annual Chairman’s Award event recognized this year’s winners for their exemplary careers and unparalleled dedication to customers colleagues and the airline.

Honorees included team members from across the United States and seven other countries.

Hosting his first Annual Chairman’s Award gala since becoming CEO in March Robert Isom recognized these team members as long-time servant leaders and creative thinkers who were integral in helping the airline run reliably and profitably this year.

“Annual Chairman’s Award winners are truly the best of the best at our airline” he said. “I was honored to spend the evening recognizing their hard work.”

Honorees and their guests were treated to a reception and dinner followed by an award ceremony that included notes of congratulations from friends and family a special award pin and $10000. This year’s honorees and the important work they do span every aspect of operating a successful airline and represent each of American’s workgroups.

Winners expressed surprise at finding they’d been nominated along with a desire to draw attention to the careers of other team members they know. “I was in shock but also humbled knowing that I have an entire network of people who appreciate me this much” said Sheri McCrandall a senior analyst for technical publications in Tulsa who has been with American for 12 years. “I lead a team of five people and this award really trickles down to them and all the work we do together.”

Still others wanted their careers to be remembered for always having a spirit of both teacher and learner. “I mentor students from the aviation school to show them the real-world part of the job” explained Wendell Listhrop an aviation maintenance technician in Miami who has worked for American for 32 years. “I can pass my knowledge to the younger team members but I also let them know that they can still teach me. I’m always learning even after 32 years.”

Environmental Safety Specialist John Haney celebrates his award with wife Heather Haney also an American Airlines team member. He was nominated for professionalism commitment and dedication in managing environmental issues and supporting the airline’s commitment to the environment.

The Guardian reports that the move is the latest in a series of industrial actions and disputes to have hit the U.S. airlines industry as it recovers from the COVID pandemic. Workers and unions say that the industry has sought to return to normal without addressing serious problems especially around pay and staffing levels.

Negotiations were initially delayed due to COVID but restarted in August 2021. Since that time the company has rejected improvements sought by workers.

Julie Hedrick national president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants noted the union is pushing for pay rises better flexibility for flights and improved operational reliability as American Airlines reported a profit of $478m in the third quarter of 2022 including record revenue.

American Airlines is not the only U.S. carrier in conflict with its workers.

Nearly 10000 pilots at United Airlines voted down a tentative agreement on November 2 and picketed outside the United Airlines Flight Training Center in Denver Colorado on November 15 over delays in coming to an agreement acceptable to pilots.

In September flight attendants at Southwest Airlines and United Airlines held picket protests at airports around the U.S. to protest delays operational issues and the working conditions posed by the delays.

Power markets had clearly understood how tight circumstances would be in some of these areas with December-through-February on-peak forwards showing big year-on-year premiums over day-ahead on-peak prices for December 2021 through February 2022. Examples include:

Electric Reliability Council of Texas North Hub forwards: $72.86/MWh on Nov. 16 up from the $38.52/MWh average for day-ahead on-peak locational marginal prices for the 2021-22 winter

Indiana Hub forwards: $96.58/MWh up from $53.84/MWh for 2021-22 winter

Mass Hub forwards: $219.35/MWh up from the ISO New England Internal Hub's average of $116.46/MWh for 2021-22 winter

On the Intercontinental Exchange Nov. 17 the ERCOT North Hub January-February package traded around $85.50/MWh up about $2.75. Indiana Hub Jan-Feb forwards jumped almost $9 to $113/MWh while Mass Hub Jan-Feb rose $2 to about $267.75/MWh.

In a media conference call John Moura NERC director of reliability assessment and performance analysis presented the 2022-2023 Winter Reliability Assessment which showed the following negative reserve margins under extreme circumstances:

ERCOT: -21.4%

Canada's Maritime provinces: -8.6%

Midcontinent Independent System Operator: -7.6%

Alberta: -1.1%

In the power sector reserve margin is the percent by which forecast load is exceeded by expected resources. Negative numbers indicate that load would exceed resources by the percentages indicated.

The report also noted two areas with low but positive reserve margins that NERC considered to be at greater risk under extreme scenarios: 2.5% in ISO New England and 1% in the East part of NERC's SERC region formerly known as the Southeast Electric Reliability Council.

The report states that ""a large portion of the North American BPS is at risk of insufficient electricity supplies during peak winter conditions.""

Factors raising risks

""Higher peak-demand projections inadequate generator weatherization fuel supply risks and natural gas infrastructure are contributing risks seen"" the report states.

""Weather is really the most influential factor in operating a bulk power system"" Moura said. ""Our power plants our substations our transmission systems -- they're all exposed to the elements year round day in day out. Also weather affects everything from electricity demand to forcing generation offline and can also wreak havoc with our fuel systems. Natural gas infrastructure systems are prone to disruption especially during extreme and prolonged cold weather. We've seen that in the past.""

The ""extreme"" scenario incorporated in NERC's 2022-23 winter assessment is a result of the deadly mid-February 2021 winter storm that left about 4 million ERCOT customers without power some for days which the power sector refers to as Winter Storm Uri.

""Prior to Winter Storm Uri we would not have evaluated such an extreme case with such a large amount of generation dropping offline"" Moura said. ""Now we understand there's a vulnerability not only in the supply of fuel but also in equipment.""

However Moura emphasized that the assessment was not a prediction but an evaluation of risks which showed enhanced risks in those areas with low or negative reserve margins in extreme scenarios.

'Rolling the dice'

Higher peak demand projections inadequate weatherization fuel supply risks accelerated coal-fired plant retirements increased reliance on intermittent renewable resources have challenged grid operators' risk management skills according to the report.

For example the report cites increased power demand in Canada's Maritime provinces and Alberta.

While Texas has implemented enhanced winterization standards the power system they are yet unproven and gas infrastructure weatherization rules remain to be implemented.

Since the winter of 2021-22 MISO has had more than 4.2 GW of nuclear and coal-fired generation retire with ""few resource additions"" the report states.

""[If] we have mild weather if the natural gas system is reliable if we can fill tanks and replenish our liquid fuels the system is likely to remain reliable"" Moura said. ""But in areas where we have extreme weather cold widespread prolonged winter weather in those areas that are experiencing challenges … it sounds like they're a bit rolling the dice. And that's really sad.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS9ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhLXJpc2stdGlnaHQtZWxlY3RyaWMtc3VwcGxpZXMtdGhpcy13aW50ZXItbmVyYy0yMDIyLTExLTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United States at risk of tight electric supplies this winter -NERC,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/north-america-risk-tight-electric-supplies-this-winter-nerc-2022-11-17/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS9ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhLXJpc2stdGlnaHQtZWxlY3RyaWMtc3VwcGxpZXMtdGhpcy13aW50ZXItbmVyYy0yMDIyLTExLTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcmVuZXdzLmJpei84MTkxNC9wc28tYXNrcy1mb3ItcmVuZXdhYmxlLXBpcGVsaW5lLWFwcHJvdmFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PSO asks for renewable pipeline approval,"Power and distribution company plans to buy Texas and Kansas wind and solar projects

American Electric Power-backed Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) has asked the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) to approve its fuel-free power plan to purchase three new wind farms and three new solar facilities.

This proposed plan will help meet projected power needs while protecting customers from volatility in energy costs driven by high natural gas and power prices.

The fuel-free power plan would fund the purchase of a total of 995.5MW of new cost-effective renewable energy and includes a total Investment of $2.47bn. The six projects were chosen through a competitive bidding process.

The projects are the 265MW Lazbuddie wind in Texas and the 189MW Pixley solar in Kansas which are expected to be completed in April 2025.

Another four facilities are scheduled for completion in December 2025. These are the 135MW Flat Ridge IV wind 153MW Flat Ridge V wind the 103.5MW Chisholm Trail solar all in Kansas and the 150MW Algodon solar in Texas.

These resources will help provide long-term stability in electricity costs insulating customers from future market price volatility of natural gas and purchased power through the addition of fuel-free power generation.

After all the facilities are online by the end of 2025 an average residential customer would see an estimated initial monthly bill increase of $3.48 (2.6%).

Due to ongoing market volatility it is difficult to project the precise impact on customer bills as prices will continue to fluctuate based on variables like supply chain issues and fuel costs.

The additional generating capacity is needed to meet the energy needs of PSO customers. That need has increased due to new rules from the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) that require utilities to have available additional generation capacity to support reliability.

“At PSO we understand the importance of providing affordable service and through this plan we are excited to keep delivering on that commitment to our customers” said PSO President and Chief Operating Officer Leigh Anne Strahler.

“This investment in fuel-free power is another step in our efforts to shield our customers against high costs while meeting their energy needs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRwb3dlcm1vbnRobHkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTgwNTczOS9hZXAtYnV5LXRocmVlLXdpbmQtZmFybXMta2Fuc2FzLXRleGFz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AEP to buy three wind farms in Kansas and Texas,"Public Service Company of Oklahoma a subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP) is seeking approval for the acquisition of three new wind farms totalling 553MW as part of its effort to protect customers from high energy costs.

The three projects together with three solar facilities the company also plans to buy are due to begin operating in 2025.

The 265MW Lazbuddie wind farm in Parmer County Texas will begin operating in April 2025 while the 135MW Flat Ridge IV and 153MW Flatridge V wind farms in Kingman and Harper Counties Kansas are scheduled for completion in December that year.

Once the facilities are fully online in 2025 customers would see their bills increase by an average of just 2.6% PSO said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8va2Fuc2FzcmVmbGVjdG9yLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4L2thbnNhcy13ZXN0ZXJuLW1pc3NvdXJpLWF0LWxvdy1yaXNrLWZvci1pbnN1ZmZpY2llbnQtZWxlY3RyaWNhbC1zdXBwbHktdGhpcy13aW50ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kansas western Missouri at low risk for insufficient electrical supply this winter • Kansas Reflector,"The electrical grid that covers Kansas and western Missouri is expected to have plenty of power to keep up with demand this winter. But in the event of severe weather the St. Louis area could be at risk.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation released its winter outlook Thursday assessing potential vulnerabilities to the grid. The need for a more reliable grid has been a frequent topic of discussion for utilities since a cold snap in February 2021 knocked out power in Texas and forced rolling blackouts in the Midwest.

NERC found some areas including Texas still face the risk of not having enough power during peak demand.

“At a high level we found that a large portion of North America is at risk of insufficient electricity supplies during peak winter conditions” Mark Olson manager for reliability assessments at NERC said during a news conference.

He said the good news is that “almost all areas are well prepared for normally occurring or average winter years.”

In Kansas and western Missouri the Southwest Power Pool has added more natural gas generation since last winter and should have enough power even when demand is high and some power supplies are unavailable according to NERC.

Midcontinent System Operator — which covers eastern Missouri the upper midwest and parts of the south — has less reserve power than last year because of coal and nuclear power plants being retired.

Extreme weather the report says could force residents to reduce their energy use but it says load shedding is “unlikely.” Load shedding is when utilities force outages for a few hours to keep the grid from becoming overwhelmed and leading to a blackout.

SPP was forced to shed load during a historic cold snap in February 2021 largely because natural gas was difficult to come by."

Some folks think it's the best travel rewards card ever created. Others think it's a ""coupon book"" masquerading as a rewards card. And still others think it's overpriced junk not worth the application.

As a cardholder myself my opinion lies somewhere in the middle. I'm glad I applied for the card. I intend to keep it for at least another year. But it's definitely not the most laid-back card in my collection.

No like many pretty things The Platinum Card® from American Express with its $695 annual fee (rates and fees) is very high-maintenance. However if you're willing to put in the work -- and your shopping habits happen to line up with the card's offerings -- it can provide a lot of value.

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

Yes it's a ""coupon book"" -- and that's OK

Alright so one of the biggest negatives in any discussion of the card is that it's become a bit of a ""coupon book"" over the last few years. What do people mean by that? Essentially the card has a list of various statement credits (read: rebates) you can earn for specific types of spending. (Terms apply.) This includes:

Entertainment credits

Uber credits

Airline fee credits

Walmart+ credits

Hotel credits

Equinox credits

Saks Fifth Avenue credits

Clear credits

Most of the credits require some kind of enrollment (though you typically only have to do this once). Some of them reset monthly some are annual some reset with the calendar others with your card anniversary…it's a lot to keep track of.

And if you don't already spend in these areas the credits aren't exactly useful. For example Equinox is a very fancy-pants gym that doesn't have any locations within 300 miles of me. So no I don't use that credit. At all. It may as well not exist. (They are changing this from a monthly credit to an annual one next year -- and I still won't have an occasion to use it.)

All that being said despite the extra effort and some of the credits being absolutely useless I really don't mind the card's ""coupon book"" style. It lets me pick and choose the credits to use and I don't need to use them all to get value from them.

Would I trade some of the credits for a lower annual fee? Of course. But I wouldn't want them to get rid of all of the credits. When all is said I done I should come out ahead by a significant margin in part thanks to those credits. And that's without including less tangible value like lounge access and FHR perks. (Terms apply.)

You need to be organized

The key to making the most of The Platinum Card® from American Express is to be organized about it. You need to keep track of which credits you've used and which you haven't. This can get tricky at times especially for the monthly credits so I use a spreadsheet that gets updated every other month.

All of the credits post automatically when you make an eligible purchase. But as with anything else you need to keep an eye on them. Sometimes my monthly credits post the next day -- sometimes it takes weeks. (The terms and conditions say it can take up to eight weeks.)

Once a quarter I scroll through my transactions to make sure everything credited correctly. Overall the majority of credits post within days. I've had two credits that posted near the eight-week mark. I've only had one that didn't post at all. An online chat with a customer service representative can solve issues with credits not posting.

The annual and semi-annual credits are both easier and harder. You don't need to check them every month but you do need to remember they you know exist. I set reminders in my phone calendar to ensure I'm not leaving any credits behind.

This isn't a wallet card (unless you're traveling)

If it seems like I'm focusing a lot on the credits for what is ostensibly a rewards credit card -- you're right I am. But that's because The Platinum Card® from American Express is not an everyday rewards card.

On a day-to-day basis I don't keep this card in my wallet. (For one thing it's heavy!) I'm not using it at the grocery store or for take-out or even most retail purchases. There are really only three occasions I use The Platinum Card® from American Express to make a purchase:

If I'm going to earn a statement credit If I'm booking a flight with the airline and/or booking through Amex Travel If I'm buying something expensive and want the purchase protection

Outside of these situations I have cards with higher rewards rates that will provide a much better return on the purchase.

The only time I put this card in my wallet is when I'm traveling. Granted I haven't done a lot of that this year. But we've managed to put several of the card's credits to good use in the few trips we've made. And we have more travel already planned for next year.

I do have to say I'm disappointed that I'll be losing airport lounge guest passes next year. Lounge access (terms apply) was certainly a very enticing aspect of getting the card. And I think it's kind of steep to pay $175 a year to add an authorized user. If we end up traveling a lot next year though it could be worth it.

Even without that perk I'm still getting enough value from The Platinum Card® from American Express that I only cringe a little thinking about my upcoming annual fee. This card isn't for everyone -- by a long shot -- but I've been happy with it so far.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vZW4tdXMvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL2NyZWRpdC1pbnRlbC90cmF2ZWxpbmctd2l0aC1hLXBoeXNpY2FsLWRpc2FiaWxpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Tips for Traveling with a Physical Disability,"Before your flight take stock of what you’ll need and find out if the equipment can go in your carry-on or needs to be checked.

If you are traveling with a wheelchair airlines can only transport manual wheelchairs in the cabin but it’s not guaranteed that you’ll be able to safely store one in the seating portion of the aircraft. Similarly most battery-powered wheelchairs are too large and heavy to be safely stored in the cabin. Wheelchairs that cannot be safely stored are typically stowed in the cargo hold. If stored in the cargo hold the airline must return your wheelchair as close as possible to the exit door of the aircraft in a timely manner unless you ask to pick it up in baggage claim.

If you’re traveling with medical equipment or assistive devices it pays to tell the airline at booking and at check-in.

The Celtic Bank-issued card will be powered by i2c and will operate on the Amex network.

Why it matters: The Square credit card addresses two major small-business payment trends.

Small businesses are gravitating toward fintechs for their payment needs. Eighty-nine percent of small businesses felt underserved by their primary bank and had considered switching to a more accommodating payment fintech according to a Capgemini survey. As a prominent fintech in the payments space this works in Square’s favor.

felt underserved by their primary bank and had considered switching to a more accommodating payment fintech according to a Capgemini survey. As a prominent fintech in the payments space this works in Square’s favor. They also want integrated payment solutions. Forty-three percent of digital small-business decision-makers said managing payment operations and relationships takes up too many resources per Paysafe. Square may be an ideal credit card provider for small businesses trying to limit how many third-party businesses they work with. It already offers a bevy of commerce payment and management tools that small businesses can use alongside its credit card.

What's at stake: The card is a big opportunity for both Amex and Square to court small businesses which make up 99.9% of all US firms  according to the Small Business Administration.

The card can round out Square’s small-business payment tools. The tie-up with Amex is Square’s first major push into the small-business credit card space. It can help bolster Square’s seller revenues by tapping small-business demand for credit: Credit cards were the second-most sought-after financing and credit product by US small businesses last year per Federal Reserve data—and current economic challenges may heighten demand for financing solutions. Moving into the sector also helps Square keep up with PayPal which already offers credit card products for merchants .

It also complements Amex’s small-business tools. The firm has been trying to better serve small businesses which accounted for 27% of its total network volume in Q3 . It rolled out small-business checking accounts last year and a cross-border payments solution over the summer. More recently it partnered with TikTok on a campaign to help small businesses reach Gen Z customers . These moves reflect Amex’s desire to capture more small-business volume and diversify its revenues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcnRzdW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xmL2FtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3MtcGdhLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvcGdhLXRvdXJzLWFtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3MtZ29sZi1zZWVzLWJpZ2dlci1kYXlzLWFoZWFkLWFmdGVyLWRvbmF0aW5nLTEtbWlsbGlvbi82OTY1Nzk2NDAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PGA Tour's American Express golf sees bigger days ahead after donating $1 million,"Throughout the last few years even with restrictions because of COVID-19 the PGA Tour’s American Express tournament has been played each January in the desert.

As the tournament prepares for its 64th playing in two months another tradition continued Thursday with 37 desert charities taking home a total of $1 million in proceeds from last January.

“First and foremost the local aspect is what is important” said Pat McCabe executive director of The American Express at the distribution breakfast at La Quinta Country Club one of three courses played in the PGA Tour event. “Thirty-seven groups received the funds and we touched all of the desert cities. There are so many important groups that are doing such great work.”

Charities and non-profits working in the areas of health and wellness youth sports family support education and homelessness received funds from the tournament through the new Impact Through Golf foundation in its first year of managing the distributions. The Phil Mickelson Foundation had been the charitable arm but is no longer part of the event.

“We have some new board members who are going to make a significant contribution to the capacity for sponsors play and recognition for this PGA Tour event” said Linda Evans mayor of La Quinta and a board member of the old Mickelson Foundation and the new Impact Through Golf foundation. “This group of board members who are quite familiar with other PGA Tour events across the country and the contributions they make locally they have big plans on where they would like to take this tournament to where even more money is raised on an annual basis to make a consistent significant gift to the community.”

“We’re committed to backing our communities and continuing the longstanding legacy of supporting the Coachella Valley through the Impact Through Golf foundation and by enhancing the support of critical local organizations in the community"" said Shiz Suzuki vice president of Global Brand Sponsorships and Experiential Marketing at American Express in a statement announcing the donations.

Thursday’s $1 million brings the tournament’s charity donations to the desert to $64 million since the event debuted in 1960.

Each charity that has received money from the tournament Thursday went through a process of applying for the money and explaining what the money would go toward. One such charity is the John F. Kennedy Foundation/Ophelia Project based nationally in the desert but also with a desert chapter. It is a teen mentoring program for girls from eighth to 12th grades.

Local charities appreciate the donations

“It is a big deal for us because what that offers is a chance to impact more lives” said Peter Sturgeon president and chief executive officer of the JFK Foundation/Ophelia Project. “The more funding we can get the more schools we can get. We are currently in 14 schools in the Coachella Valley yet there are other schools that need our support and we don’t have the people to do that without funding.”

The Ophelia project has more than 60 volunteers in the desert Sturgeon said mostly experienced successful women who mentor the young girls.

The 64th annual tournament will be played Jan. 19-22 at PGA West and La Quinta Country Club in La Quinta and will feature concerts on Jan. 20 by pop star Gwen Stefani and Jan. 21 by country star Darius Rucker. McCabe said he believes the restrictions of the last few years won’t exist in 2023.

“I certainly anticipate that. Regardless of the things that were going on with the pandemic which first we want to thank the frontline workers and healthcare industry but we were still able to have golf tournaments” McCabe said. “If you look back on 2021 we were able to have a golf tournament with no fans. Last year we did have fans back but there were certain restrictions that were part of it. So 2023 we are optimistic that it will be more normal. We are trending that way.”

The World Cup is one of the few times that rugby gets mainstream attention in the United States and now the event will go on without the American team.

Although the U.S. has never fared that well at a World Cup — its overall record is 3-22 — it has almost always managed at least to get there. The United States had qualified for the past six World Cups and eight of nine in total. Portugal had only qualified for the Cup once before in 2007.

Going into the game Portugal was ranked 18th in the world and the U.S. 19th so a close contest seemed likely. And so the first half proved. The game went into the break 10-9 to Portugal. The American points came from three penalty kicks by the team captain and fly half A.J. MacGinty. Portugal’s came from a penalty plus the half’s lone try by Raffaele Storti scored while the Americans had a man in rugby’s equivalent of the penalty box the “sin bin.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdmVybmFuY2UtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLmNvbS9ib2FyZHJvb20vZ292ZXJuYW5jZS1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxzLWd1aWRlLXByZXBhcmluZy0yMDIzLXBhcnQtMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Governance professionals guide on preparing for 2023: Part 1 | Governance intelligence,"Industry experts at Corporate Secretary event discuss topics ranging from the proxy season to director training

Governance professionals met at the Corporate Secretary Forum in New York last week to share their expertise on issues affecting the community as 2023 looms.



One item under discussion was the increased pressure on companies to make statements about political issues and whether and when to do so. Timothy Ring senior vice president and corporate secretary with MetLife said it is important to have a robust and appropriate process in place that will help respond to such pressure regardless of the issue at hand. This process should include people who are forward-facing with employees customers and investors he advised.



Fellow panelist Alan Tse global chief legal officer and corporate secretary with Jones Lang LaSalle agreed with the idea of having a process but noted that making decisions on whether to speak out would not always be easy in practice. Although it has been straightforward to take a public stance on issues such as racial equity and the war in Ukraine other issues may be more complex and ‘everyone would like [companies] to take their stance’ Tse said.





BOARD SKILLS

On another panel at the forum looking at director skills and training speakers noted the importance of board members having ‘soft skills’.



‘You need people who are adaptive’ said Prabha Sipi Bhandari senior vice president deputy general counsel and corporate secretary at American International Group. This is because although the board may understand the risks the company faces at present it doesn’t know what risks may arise she noted. Alongside being adaptive soft skills that are useful in directors include being collaborative she added.

Fellow panelist Matthew Geekie senior vice president secretary and general counsel at Graybar agreed commenting that having the right chemistry is key for a board to function properly.



Bhandari also emphasized the importance of diversity on boards including in terms of skills. She cautioned however that while cyber-security is a risk all companies need to take seriously having a cyber-security expert on the board poses the danger that other directors will simply follow that person’s lead.

Key milestones in the evolution of modern mobile and tower cranes as noted by crane expert and long-time Cranes Today contributor Stuart Anderson.

When the first issue of Cranes appeared in 1966 there was already a well-established crane industry. In those days much of the news carried by the magazine focussed on the large and diverse UK crane industry. Even though the US and many European countries also had well-established crane manufacturing companies and cranes were being sold and used all over the world obtaining news of these activities in those days was a real challenge.

Since the 1930s crane hire (rental) had been well-established in the US and by the 1960s was fast-growing in the UK but much less-so in Europe. Since the turn of the century earlier steam-powered cranes had given way to petrol (gasoline) and diesel-powered cranes mounted on crawler bases as well as rubber-tyred self-propelled chassis with increasingly sophisticated power transmissions. While most cranes relied upon mechanical transmissions some makers such as Coles Cranes Gottwald and others preferred diesel electric systems.

The use of crawler undercarriages was pioneered by Bucyrus of the US with its type 14 dragline of 1911. It was 1914 when the first gasoline engine-powered excavator/crane was introduced by P&H with their Model 210. As diesel engines emerged it would be 1932 when excavator/crane market-leader Lorain installed a Cat diesel. In 1934 Eisenwerk Rothe Erde introduced a ball-bearing slew ring as an advanced option to the hook-and-roller swing systems that were the industry norm. In 1941 Manitowoc introduced the 65-ton capacity 3900 as one of the first purpose-designed crawler cranes and in 1945 Lorain’s new TL series was the first with a completely welded upper works (rather than one employing castings and riveting).

Although Coles Cranes had been a pioneer with its first truck crane of 1922 across the Atlantic such developments also soared ahead in the hands of companies like Universal (later Lorain) Harnischfeger P&H Bay City and Orton & Steinbrenner.

The first tower cranes had been also developed in France by Jules Weitz and Grues Besnard and in Germany by Julius Wolff and Carl Peschke and Peschke’s son Karl. These were small cranes typically of one tonne capacity or less and a reach of between 5 and 16 metres.

EARLY INFLUENCERS

American mechanical crane and excavator technology became dominant worldwide during the post-war building boom.

In addition to their sales and marketing efforts which were far more advanced than those of Europe US manufacturers spread their influence around the world by establishing joint-venture manufacturing or granting licenses in markets as far afield as Germany France Japan India Australia Mexico Canada and Brazil.

Though virtually every European country by then had its own crane and excavator manufacturing industry US manufacturers continued unheeded to expand their European market presence. New licenses were established in Spain (Koehring - 1952) Germany (P&H - with Rheinstahl: 1955) France (Marion - 1960) and the UK (Unit - with Coles/Neals - 1960). In Italy Link-Belt acquired the former O&K excavator plant in Milan in 1964 forming Link-Belt SpA.

Another company which had grown very strong though acquisitions Koehring Company acquired 40% of the UK’s Ransomes & Rapier forming NCKRapier in 1964 and two years later bought 70% of one of German’s oldest excavator/crane producers: Menck & Hambrock of Hamburg.

Even in the 1960s Chinese enterprises were already developing small tower cranes.

During the first half of the 20th century mobile cranes had grown ever-larger and more powerful. Before cranes achieved independent mobility however as early as the late 19th century small tower cranes were at work in some of Europe’s leading cities. Amongst their builders were Carl Peschke and Julius Wolff both of Germany. By 1927 they had been joined by Pekazette of Zweibrucken Germany and Carlo Ferro of Milan Italy.

These early tower cranes were small bottom-slewers with offset luffing jibs and lifting capacities of between one and three tonnes and working radii of from five to 15 metres. As these small tower cranes were developed they quickly became a staple for house-builders across Europe and in turn created a new and dynamic manufacturing industry that especially took root in France Germany Italy Portugal and Switzerland.

However even as tower cranes proliferated across Europe their use in the UK was severely limited. This in part was due to the prevailing ‘not invented here’ attitude. Britain’s hand-built brick-and-mortar house building approach also played a role as did the widely-used locally-manufactured Scotch-derricks (or stiff-leg derricks) that had become a staple for long reach lifting in ports quarries dockyards and shipyards. The leading manufacturer was Butters Brothers of Glasgow which succeeded in selling thousands of these simple cranes throughout the British Empire and beyond.

Elsewhere hydraulic crane development and demand continued around the world. Some traditional mechanical crane and excavators were drawn in.

Amongst the first was Bucyrus- Erie the leading excavator maker which in 1948 acquired a small local firm Milwaukee Hydraulics which had developed the world’s first telescopic truck-mounted cranes of two- to five-tonnes capacity. These cranes were mounted on two-axle commercial trucks and featured a threesection cantilevered telescopic 35 ft. (10.7m) boom.

Of the first Mechanical Handling Exhibition held at Crystal Palace London UK in 1948 the August journal of Commercial Motor made the somewhat exaggerated boast “during the past two years the mechanical handling industry has seen considerable expansion with the result that this country [UK] can now boast of equipment as good as any to be found in the world”. Exhibits included a one-tonne capacity Coles all-electric full-slew mobile crane and Jones mobile cranes with capacities of two and four tonnes.

Fifteen years later in 1963 the dominant exhibit was a Coles Centurion lattice truck crane rated 75 tons (100 US tons) at 12ft (3.66m) radius heralded as the largest truck crane in the world.

ROUGH TERRAIN AND TOWER CRANE DEVELOPMENT

The first rough terrain cranes were developed during the mid-1950s. Austin-Western Co. developed the first five-tonne capacity rough terrain crane with the operator’s seat (no cab) located at the front just ahead of the front axle and featuring 4x4 wheel steer and 4x4 wheel drive.

In 1957 Grove introduced its first rough terrain crane – this time with a capacity of 12t and with a cab mounted on the chassis to the side of the boom. Similarly telescopic truck-mounted cranes of small capacity (one to three tonnes) would soon be developed in 1955 by Japan’s first telescopic crane manufacturers Tadano and Unic and in 1958 by Kato.

American companies primarily Austin-Western Grove Bucyrus- Erie and Drott pioneered many of the early technical innovations and concepts in hydraulic crane development. Even so as early as 1956 the UK’s F. Taylor & Sons (later part of Coles Cranes) and the British Hoist & Crane Co. (Iron Fairy) developed small pick-and-carry mobile telescopics.

By 1958 Coles Cranes had adopted diesel-electric transmissions as standard and offered a line of 15 models of up to 45t capacity available in self-propelled truck-mounted and rail-mounted versions.

By the 1950s tower cranes had also developed in capacity and reach and the first saddlejib cranes using trolley-mounted hooks from Potain Linden and others were arriving to supersede the needle type cranes that had been the staple for some 50 years.

Considering all of the main varieties of crane for the tower crane industry the late 1940s and early 1950s were the most tumultuous. Across Europe new manufacturers cropped up with breath taking regularity.

Soon after the end of the second world war in 1945 Braud & Faucheux of Ancenis in the Loire region of France developed their first small ‘tower’ crane. Its designer was killed during the liberation of Ancenis leaving the company to be managed for many years by his widow. In 1949 Hans Liebherr had built his first and the world’s first self-erecting crane the TK 10 and by 1952 new tower crane businesses had been started in the shape of Cadillon Konig Ferro Boilot Hilgers Simma Reich Pekazette Schwing and in Finland Betox.

By the mid-1950s small tower cranes were increasingly used in residential construction in mainland Europe and manufacturers began to focus on particular size and type categories.

THE 1950S AND 1960S

During the 1950s the development of the purpose-built crane carrier chassis had revolutionised lattice truck crane development and soon larger size telescopic truck cranes (on crane carrier chassis) were also being built.

Specialist vehicle manufacturers Faun and Atkinson were joined in 1963 by Foden which brought enhanced levels of quality and sophistication to the crane industry. By that time lattice boom cranes had reached an advanced level of technical maturity. Meanwhile during the 1960s the number of US manufacturers of telescopic cranes grew with well-over 20 firms entering to industry including Pettibone (1961) Galion (1963) Lorain and Shield Bantam (1967) P&H (1968) and Link-Belt (1969).

GAME CHANGER

The world’s first 25 ton tele truck crane was introduced by Grove in 1964 followed in 1966 by the first 30-tonner from Pettibone the first 45-tonner from Grove also in 1966 a 50-ton Pettibone in 1967 a 65-tonner from P&H in 1969 and the 80-ton Grove TM 800 in 1970. In particular the TM 800 was a real game-changer featuring the patented Trapezoidal boom.

Meanwhile in In Japan Kato introduced a 32-tonne truck crane in 1967 and in 1969 the NK75 – a 75-tonne capacity truck crane mounted on a four-axle Mitsubishi Fuso carrier and with a 43m four-section full power boom – claimed to be the longest in the world.

In Germany Demag introduced its rounded ‘Ovaloid’ boom in 1970 and in 1975 introduced the world’s largest tele boom crane in the shape of the 140-tonne capacity HC 500.

As had been the case pre-war the European crane market of the 1960s remained dominated by small mechanical crawler and increasingly truck-mounted excavator/cranes of nine to 15 tonnes capacity. Industry leader was UK-based Ruston-Bucyrus (R-B) which produced as many as 1800 units per year and ultimately 10246 between 1950 and 1985.

R-B was the UK affiliate of Bucyrus-Erie and by-far Europe’s largest manufacturer of these machines which were offered with a variety of ‘front-end’ attachments ranging from lift crane to dragline clamshell/ grab backhoe face shovel and piledriver. In this business other long-established major British players included NCK-Ransoms & Rapier Thos. Smith & Sons (Rodley) Ltd. Priestman Brothers Ltd. John Allen & Sons (Oxford) Ltd. Babcock-Marion and Jones Cranes Ltd. Across the channel markets were served by the likes of Demag Menck Gottwald of Germany Fiorentini of Milan and Pinguely and Nordest of France.

During these post-war years there was a serious shortage of cranes of all types with construction work and especially building construction often still dependent on manual labour operation from scaffolding.

Almost all of these machines were initially designed and manufactured to be tough and reliable to withstand the rigours of arduous excavating work. Machine weight was rarely a consideration. Indeed it was not until much later typically the late 1960s that the first crawler-mounted machines were specifically designed to optimise their crane lifting performance. It was only by then that some companies began to focus on the use of lighter steels to optimise lifting capacity and reach. Since the 1800s crane and excavator controls were long mechanical levers and foot pedals demanding significant exertion.

Indeed it was the 1960s and especially 1970s before power-assisted controls became the norm.

In central Europe in countries like France Italy Germany and Switzerland small self-erecting tower cranes replaced mobile cranes as the preferred type for residential construction. By the 1970s new manufacturers had emerged in the markets they served.

France’s Potain and Germany’s Liebherr had reinforced their market leading positions but were joined in competition by dozens of local manufacturers. By the mid-1970s a thriving tower crane industry had developed in Italy joined by likes of Conedil Simma Trojsi FM Gru Fergru Alfa and Fergru.

In rough terrains Pettibone set the pace with the first 15-tonner in 1961 leaping to the first 35-tonner in 1965 and first 40-tonner in 1969. All of these were cab-down cranes. In the US Sargent introduced the world’s first swing cab rough terrain in 1967 with an 18-ton model. It was followed in 1968 by Grove with a 25-tonner.

Even though the lifting capacity and reach of these early hydraulic cranes was very limited and their reliability unproven by virtue of their operating speeds and relative ease of use they met with immediate market demand and sales growth was dramatic.

During the late 1960s the output of the US industry telescopic cranes grew rapidly – from 2000 in 1967 to 2400 in 1968 to 3700 in 1969 – with approximately 55% being rough terrains 10% Industrial cranes and 35% truck cranes. By then approximately 20-25% of US production was for export mainly to Europe.

DEVELOPING MARKETS

In the early 1960s Japan remained a market dominated by lattice boom cranes – especially crawlers. Under a series of license agreements the Japanese had been afforded access to US technology with deals struck between Kobelco and P&H Sumitomo and Link-Belt Yutani and Northwest and IHI and Koehring.

They joined Hitachi’s own-designed products and by the mid-1960s the Japanese industry was producing nearly 2000 lattice cranes. 85% of these were crawlers. During the second half of the 1960s Japanese demand for lattice cranes grew to nearly 3000 units with 30% now being truck cranes of up to 150 tonnes capacity. By this time however domestic Japanese demand for telescopic truck cranes had begun to develop and from being almost non-existent in 1965 had grown to 1500 units in 1970.

At that time the rough terrain crane was unknown in Japan - Tadano developing Japan’s very first rough terrain in 1970. Also as the decade drew to a close Japan’s hydraulic crane makers were only just beginning to explore overseas markets for their cranes.

In the 1960s like Japan Europe was also a market where truck cranes and roadable pick-and-carry industrial cranes were popular. UK producers dominated European production with their total mobile crane output rising to approximately 500 units in 1969. There were also numerous new manufacturers of telescopic cranes in Germany Italy France and elsewhere. The Italian Industry grew dramatically with almost 100 manufacturers. The leader Ormig produced no less than 5000 of its best-selling 75M pick-and-carry model.

Tower cranes had also developed and become suitable for hi-rise and industrial construction. The predominant types were bottom-slewing cranes with saddle jibs being used as the primary building construction tool across central and west Europe.

During the five years to 1969 alone some 7800 US crawler cranes were sold in North America with 5400 being very small machines of up to 45 US ton (41 tonne) capacity. While truck cranes were generally of limited lifting capacity due primarily to the strength limitations of vehicles of the day development continued.

In 1965 Germany’s Demag introduced its own 100-tonne lattice truck crane in the shape of their TC 400. While crawlers were favoured by contractors crane hirers preferred the mobility of the truck crane.

In addition to the various ‘mobile’ telescopic cranes (rough terrains truck cranes and industrials) some of the early manufacturers of small truck-mounted telescopic concentrated their efforts on this ‘small’ end of the market developing today’s boom truck industry. Amongst these were Pitman (RO) National Crane (previously Burg) and such companies as the Hiab in Sweden and Unic in Japan.

As the 1960s drew to a close the hydraulic mobile crane industry (excluding the manufacturers of small truck-mounted cranes) comprised some 70 manufacturers producing a total of about 6300 cranes per year.

In an effort to solve housing shortages in the UK and Europe during the 1960s modular house-building systems often based on Scandinavian and German designs grew in popularity across Europe and the UK. This fostered a demand for small tower cranes and led to crawler-mounted tower cranes produced by Liebherr Munster and others being widely employed by British building contractors.

In 1954 Liebherr established a plant in Bischofshofen Austria where its smaller tower cranes would be built and then in 1960 opened a major plant in Biberach- Ris which would become its primary tower crane plant.

As early as 1965 Liebherr Werk Biberach began producing truck-mounted lattice boom strut jib and tower cranes of the AUK Series. Eventually the series extended to 13 models – all available as tower cranes. In 1969 production of these cranes was transferred to the new Liebherr-Werk Ehingen factory where the 125-tonne capacity AUK 220 and 79 of the small AUK 40T-60 were produced.

During the mid-1960s as buildings and industrial facilities grew ever-taller large American lattice boom truck and crawler cranes were developed into tower configurations. In particular Manitowoc’s 150-ton 4000W crawler and starting in 1963 Lorain’s larger-sized truck-mounted Moto-tower cranes of 50 to 150-ton capacity became rental favourites.

While these proved particularly popular in North America European tower cranes had failed to make a breakthrough – mainly due to lack of local support and concerns over their electrics. Even so in 1961 Harnischfeger P&H struck a deal with Liebherr to handle the North American marketing of large tower cranes produced in Liebherr’s plant in Killarney Ireland. It didn’t work.

In 1961 the Killarney plant had opened as Liebherr’s first overseas plant to make tower cranes quickly followed by a plant in Spring South Africa also making tower cranes.

Across Europe however Coles found significant success amongst crane hirers with tower versions of its larger-sized Ranger Zealous Valiant Gargantua Centurion and Colossus truck models of 30-to 170-tonnes capacity while Demag and Gottwald developed luffing jib models of their larger truck cranes.

In 1972 Priestman Brothers took a misjudged stab at the UK pre-fab market with a tower version of its 32-tonne BC 72 crawler crane which proved too small for the market.

Technical limitations in hydraulic and automotive components severely limited hydraulic crane development throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s thus prolonging the life of mechanical lattice boom truck and crawler cranes. In fact during the late 1960s sales of lattice crane worldwide continued to grow – reaching 12000-15000 a year. At that time telescopic boom cranes were still limited in capacity and reach. During the late 1960s Germany’s leading lattice truck crane manufacturers were already producing 300-tonne capacity cranes and developing 500-tonners. The lifting performance and length of lattice booms had been significantly improved with the development by US Steel of T-1 alloy steel in the early 1950s.

Using T-1 US manufacturers particularly Manitowoc and American Hoist introduced 200 ton crawler cranes during the late 1960s. By the late 1960s German’s Gottwald was building 300-tonne capacity truck cranes available with strut or tower configurations.

From the early years the US lattice boom crane and excavator industry had been quick to exploit overseas market opportunities and to capitalise on this. They and several UK crane makers established joint-venture manufacturing subsidiaries or licensed manufacturing operations overseas. From the 1930s onward they established manufacturing operations around the world – often in countries protected by tariff barriers and import controls or with limited foreign currency availability.

TELESCOPIC CRANES

Starting in the 1950s Japan had rapidly taken to the telescopic truck crane concept creating strong domestic demand dominated by three suppliers: Tadano Kato and Unic.

In that regard these manufacturers produced only ‘the crane’ soliciting the vital support of the country’s strengthening truck industry to provide its vehicle. The first purpose-designed crane carrier chassis were built by Mitsubishi Fuso and Nissan in 1960 and 1961 respectively and during the mid-1960s Kato. Tadano then added carrier-mounted truck cranes to their (commercial) truck-mounted crane lines. In 1969 Japanese domestic demand for (carrier-mounted) truck cranes quadrupled to 1100 units and in 1970 hit 1500.

Mitsubishi and Nissan were the first large-scale commercial truck builders to produce specialist crane carrier chassis. At that time only a few of the world’s crane makers produced their own carriers - Coles of the UK and P&H of the US being notable exceptions

In the US with many more manufacturers fighting for market share Grove Pettibone and P&H became the leaders whilst in Europe Coles Cranes was by far the strongest supplier.

In Europe the struggle for the world’s tallest mobile crane was won hands down by Leo Gottwald of Dusseldorf with its 400-tonne capacity MK 600 introduced in 1968. A mobile (rather than truck-mounted) crane on eight-axles the MK 600 offered boom lengths to 100m or tower lengths to 83m plus a 75m luffing jib for maximum heights of 160m.

During the 1970s telescopic cranes gradually took over as the preferred type of mobile crane in the small-medium capacity classes (10-100-tons).

In Germany Leo Gottwald established market leadership with its well-engineered lattice and telescopic boom truck cranes. In 1966 Gottwald introduced its 18-tonne capacity AMK 45-21 two-axle telescopic which would later be recognised as a pioneer of all terrain cranes.

Having at first scorned the potential of the hydraulic crane as a passing fancy many of the large and well-established mechanical/ lattice boom crane manufacturers belatedly began to develop their own telescopics as sales of small to medium size lattice cranes steadily declined. However since demand for large-size lattice cranes increased the leading lattice crane manufacturers focussed on the development of the upper-end of their product ranges rather than on the telescopic developments.

In 1975 Gottwald took the crown with the world’s largest telescopic with their 140-tonne AMK 155-53 – the first units being purchased by Scotts of the UK and Sarens of Belgium. Although a relatively small company Gottwald established itself for its outstanding design and engineering capabilities. In 1978 the company again topped the industry with its 200-tonne capacity AMK 200-103 tele truck crane.

American Hoist and Manitowoc dominated worldwide demand for large size lattice cranes and from 1970 to 1975 American’s sales of over 100 tons capacity increased from $20m to $84m (including large offshore barge and ship-mounted cranes).

By the mid-1970s the number of hydraulic crane manufacturers grew to an estimated 140 companies manufactured in 25 countries. The pace and volume of new product development increased with the ever-broadening number of competitive suppliers. Although many had considered the telescopic crane fundamentally limited in terms of reach and capacity the first 100-ton truck crane (Grove TM 1075) was introduced in 1974 and the following year the first 52.7m telescopic boom was introduced again by Grove on the 125-ton (113-tonne) TM 1275 truck crane.

BLACK GOLD

The opening up of the Prudhoe Bay oil field and subsequent construction of the Trans-Alaskan pipeline during the early 1970s was the first major petrochemical project to employ over 100 hydraulic cranes. It would not be the last. Thanks to the efforts of the Grove/Caterpillar pipeline distributor – Fabbick Tractor of St Louis MO and Grove distributor Gleason Cranes of Chicago the vast majority of the 200 cranes employed on this challenging project were Groves.

Larger-size swing cab rough terrain cranes of 50-tons (1975) and 80-tons (1978) capacity were pioneered by Grove and became viable alternatives to crawler cranes on unmade construction sizes further broadening the application potential of the telescopic crane.

As the 1970s drew to a close Germany’s manufacturers began to fully exercise their engineering talent introducing 150-200-tonne capacity telescopic truck cranes as well as truck cranes with better off-road travel performance which would a few years later be renamed all terrain cranes.

During the early 1970s North American market demand for telescopics continued to grow reaching over 4000 units in 1974 and 1975 – with about two-thirds of these being (mainly small) rough terrains one-quarter truck cranes and the remainder industrials.

Meanwhile in West Europe crane demand was strong during the early 1970s before softening markedly in 1974 and remaining relatively weak for most of the rest of the decade.

However Europe’s fast-expanding number of telescopic crane manufacturers and their broadening range of types and sizes provided attractive openings both to replace lattice cranes and to exploit export opportunities.

By this time the Comecon countries of Eastern Europe were generating significant demand for cranes. Coles Grove and P&H were amongst the most successful players in this region. The USSR also placed very large orders for telescopic truck cranes with Kato winning orders for over 2000 cranes in the mid-1970s. China was also emerging as a significant market served primarily by Kato and Tadano of Japan and Coles of the UK. Another communist country Cuba bought over 1000 cranes during the mid-1970s mainly from Kato and Coles.

In 1972 Grove acquired a majority holding in John Allen Ltd of Oxford the company they had licensed to market and mount its crane uppers on Allen-designed European truck carriers. However the move that caused the greatest ripples occurred in 1975 when Clark Equipment Company and Richards & Wallington of the UK the world’s largest crane rental company each invested 45% of the equity in a new British crane manufacturing company named Crown Cranes staffed notoriously by ex-Coles executives. This bold initiative however ran out of steam and into receivership within two-years.

The first oil price shock of late 1973 created a dramatic increase in crane demand from the OPEC countries contributing significantly to a major increase in world demand. Very quickly these countries became major crane markets as they raced to develop modern industrial and urban infrastructures with their new-found wealth.

These markets really took off in 1975 and US crane makers were the first into them augmented by through their existing ties with the oil companies. Grove proceeded to win a 250-plus rough terrain crane order from Saudi Arabia’s Aramco in 1975 (again with the invaluable participation of Bob Gleason).

Indeed the oil boom that spread through all of the OPEC countries during the mid-1970s created a huge new market for the world’s crane makers.

Through the 1970s demand for cranes continued to increase reaching some 2500 large telescopic cranes shipped to the oil-producing countries of the Middle East and Africa. Though Europe’s crane makers did quite well it was American rough terrains and Japanese truck cranes which won the lion’s share of demand.

Demand in Iran soared taking 400 hydraulic cranes in 1976 followed by Saudi Arabia with some 250 and Iraq with 280.

In total that year some 850 tele truck cranes and almost 600 rough terrains were sold in the Middle East and North and West Africa. Business in these markets was also strong for the lattice crane builders with almost 600 of mainly US-built crawler cranes as well as a similar volume of large tower cranes supplied to the region – led by Liebherr and Potain. P&H seemed to have greatly benefitted from its deep ties and investment in Iran until 1979 with the overthrow of the Shah they suffered huge losses. By the early 1980s crane demand in these markets had contracted markedly.

LATE SEVENTIES

The domestic demand in North America rose to peak levels in 1978 and 1979 returning to the 4000-unit level. At the same time Japanese domestic demand reached new heights of 2500 telescopics as the decade came to a close.

Europe was a different story. From a peak of over 4000 telescopics sold in 1974 demand fell steadily to about 3000 units in 1978/79. However demand in Germany strengthened during these years in contrast to that in the UK and France. With numerous local manufacturers active in each of the large European markets as well as all of the major US and Japanese manufacturers something had to give. The UK crane industry was hardest hit with manufacturers such as Hydrocon Cosmos and Smith going out of business and Coles and Jones closing some plants. In France Italy and Germany there were also limited casualties and product changes too. During the 1970s Japan’s crane makers began adding rough terrain cranes to their lines and in the late 1970s manufacturers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe introduced the first all terrain cranes.

Telescopic crane demand peaked in 1977 and 1979 at around the 14000-unit level as demand for lattice cranes became more and more limited to the larger-size classes where telescopics were not yet fully developed.

By the mid-late 1970s Japan became the world’s largest market for telescopic truck cranes and the world’s largest supplier. 1991 was the best year to date for Japan’s mobile crane makers. Kato sold around 3500 cranes (of over five-tonnes capacity) and had revenues of about Y104 billion ($810m) while Tadano notched up sales of Y1426 billion ($1.01 billion).

At the same time the Japanese had developed new hydraulic lattice boom designs ditching the original mechanical crane technology they had licensed from the Americans.

These cleaner quieter cranes were easier to operate and soon found ready markets not just at home but around the world just as the originators back in the US went out of business stuck with outdated technology.

ROAD REGULATIONS

During the 1970s and 1980s enforcement of European road regulations became stricter demanding lower road-weights and smaller dimensions. This challenged all manufacturers but especially the US companies to modify truck cranes into compliance. Fortunately Europe was well served with local manufacturers of crane carrier truck chassis most notably Faun Mol Foden and CVS.

Using these as a base for their cranes became an established and easy way for American and Japanese crane makers to comply with European road regulations. Meeting stringent road regulations became a key factor in achieving European truck crane sales. At the upper end of size classes the use of Faun carriers became a critical factor. At that time Mannesmann- Demag employed Faun carriers on its large cranes including the very-successful 250-tonne TC 1200 lattice introduced in 1973.

The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the market recognise the benefits of large crawler cranes of 250 to 800-tonnes capacity over lattice truck cranes of similar size. This especially benefitted the new Demag which found a ready market in the USSR where 11 300-tonne CC 2000s and 7 800-tonne CC 4000s were purchased for nuclear power plant construction.

Rough terrains had largely failed to catch-on in Europe which looked to develop the more versatile all terrain cranes and which leant themselves to crane hire (rental) application. Accordingly Europe became the industry’s battleground contested by about 100 manufacturers from around the world.

1981: THE PIVOTAL YEAR

While most of Europe started the 1980s in recession demand remained very strong in North America Japan Asia and Latin America and was again growing in Africa and the Middle East.

During the heady days of 1980 the world’s crane and construction machinery manufacturers prepared for the upcoming Conexpo ’81 to be held in Houston Texas. Grove dominated the show with a giant outdoor display which featured no less than 70 cranes and aerial lifts and introduced the new TM 2500 telescopic truck crane at 250-tons capacity the world’s largest.

Also in the Houston Astrodome P&H displayed it’s innovate new Alpha 100 100-ton light-weight truck crane. The show was a spectacular success but within 30 days of its closing the US economy plunged into what would become the deepest recession since the 1930s. By 1982 US domestic mobile crane demand had fallen by 80% of 1991 levels.

The 1980s also saw Tadano Kato and Komatsu introducing their new rough terrains to the North American market. The mid-1980s had seen the first entry into the US market of the Japanese telescopic crane makers – Tadano Kato and (briefly) Komatsu.

By this time the Japanese crane industry had developed a hybrid variety of the rough terrain crane which offered limited road travel performance sufficient for domestic Japanese demand to begin to switch from truck cranes to these new rough terrains. However attempts to export this new variety of rough terrain had at best mixed results and only Tadano persisted in its North American marketing efforts with a more conventional rough terrain crane concept.

By the mid-1970s the ‘new’ markets of SE Asia including Singapore were being approached by Potain. Alimak the Swedish hoist manufacturer having acquired the rights to Sweden’s Linden Cranes in 1973 introduced the ground-breaking 8000 series of super-large flat top tower cranes in 1974.

At the same time Demag introduced its 800-ton capacity lattice truck crane while Liebherr also introduced its new 200-tonne telescopic truck crane which would go on to significantly outsell the big Grove TM a harbinger of things to come in the heavy lift segment of the market.

The US economy was drawn into recession by the continuing oil crisis political uncertainty over Iran and record high interest rates which proved a double-edged sword for US capital goods manufacturers – diminishing domestic capital investment at the same time as making US exports very expensive. Even worse the artificially low foreign exchange value of the Japanese Yen made their products very cheap to US buyers causing for the first time a flood of construction machinery imports from the Far East.

This economic turmoil had the effect of bringing about major structural changes in the world’s crane and construction machinery industries. It would cause many in the US to feel that the days of America leading the world as a machinery supplier were over – that the steel and heavy industry of the future could only thrive in the Far East.

Domestic US lattice crane makers already hurt from a decade of technological change to hydraulics found themselves with no remaining markets and some 17 of 22 US lattice crane plants were closed from 1981 to 1985. Similarly between 1981 and 1985 ten US manufacturers of telescopic cranes went out of business unable to keep pace with the rapid technical developments. As the US recession and high dollar dragged on US manufacturers moved production overseas. P&H closed its US plants and transferred production to Kobe Steel its Japanese licensee. In 1984 Grove acquired Coles Cranes Ltd. of the UK out of receivership. Similarly recessions in France Italy and Scandinavia saw numerous crane manufacturers close their doors.

In 1981 Maschinoimport of the USSR ordered 333 Liebherr truck and all terrain cranes plus some 30 big Demags. The truck-mounted cranes were specified with cold-weather protection for -40C.

Two further orders for some 40 large Liebherr cranes followed in 1983. During these years Liebherr placed increasing emphasis on its growing line of all terrains and in 1987 introduced the 800t capacity LTM 1800.

During the 1970s and 1980s Mannesmann-Demag strengthened its position as leader in the market for high-capacity lattice cranes. In 1980 the company had set a new benchmark with its 800-tonne CC 4000 – soon surpassed by their CC 4800 and then in 1996 by the 1600-tonne CC 12600. As global demand for super-heavy crawler cranes expanded in 2001 Demag added the 1250-tonne CC 8800 which matured into the 1600-tonne capacity CC 8800-1 and was then ‘literally’ doubled with the 2008 introduction of the CC 8800-1 TWIN.

However no discussion of large crawler cranes could be complete without mention of the Lampson Transi-Lift.

Originally designed by Neil F. Lampson in 1974 over the last 40- plus years Transi-Lifts have grown in size to 3000 tons capacity.

New competition in this size class comes from the 3000-tonne capacity Liebherr LR 13000. This monster is the largest crane available on ‘conventional’ twin crawlers (as opposed to the two-sets of four crawlers of the Demag CC 8800-1 ‘TWIN’. With 4-5 LR 13000s already in service this crane – as well as its newly-announced 2500-tonne LR 12500- 1.0 - seeks to build on Liebherr’s already dominant position in the heavy crawler crane league with its 1000-tonne LR 11000 and 1350-tonne LR 13500.

Further emphasising its technology in 1989 Liebherr unveiled its LICCON system for monitoring and controlling its mobile cranes. In 1990 the German economy was picking-up and Liebherr was awarded a contract for no less than 459 all terrain cranes from the German military.

Markets for tower cranes across the world opened up during the 1970s and 1980s.

In the early 1980s a new ‘variety’ – the City Crane emerged. This concept was quickly adopted by most European makers. They were distinguished by towers (masts) of reduced cross-section dimensions and their appeal was related to the congestion of urban construction sites where accidents due to collisions were becoming a serious issue.

On the self-erecting crane front manufacturers were increasingly adopting hydraulic drives. By the 1990s the size and capacity of self-erectors had increased substantially. The largest cranes now offered 100 tonne-metres load moment or more and reaches extending past 50m and hook heights exceeding 40m. Able to handle work previously the domain of standard saddle jib cranes these versatile cranes continued to extend their applications and demand.

At Bauma ’98 Liebherr again extended its technical talents with the introduction of ‘Litronic’ – a frequency converter crane control and management system which has initially made standard on its larger top-slewing tower cranes and subsequently proliferated across the Liebherr crane lines.

That year’s show was dominated by the introduction of Liebherr’s largest telescopic to date – the 500-tonne capacity LTM 1500-8.1. This eight-axle crane would go on to become the best-selling large mobile crane of all time with 626 units sold until the end of 2021 when it was discontinued and superseded by the 650-tonne LTM 1650-8.1.

In 2001 when Ameco won the project to extend the Syncrude oil sands plant in Western Canada it ordered 100 Terex machines. Clearly oil has always primed the crane industry’s pump.

Even as demand and sales soared the Japanese were constrained by component shortages stretching delivery times to six-months and longer.

By then Kato’s production was 60% rough terrains and nearly 40% truck cranes. Unlike Europe all terrains featured marginally in Japanese mobile crane production. Nevertheless the Japanese were able to tap into the fast-growing markets of Asia and SE Asia. As demand had stabilised and then declined in the Middle East the markets of the Pacific Rim and ultimately China compensated.

But this growing demand was not simply in the traditional 15-to-50-tonne classes but also for so-called ‘mini cranes’. These were the small rough terrains and tele boom crawler cranes of up to 4.9-tonnes capacity which proved perfectly suited to Japan’s congested urban infrastructure.

On the other side of the world crane makers were preoccupied with local issues. The all terrain crane started to become a significant factor during the late 1970s and early 1980s and by the mid-1980s it had replaced the truck crane as the preferred crane hire tool throughout most of mainland Europe.

The German manufactures also made their first tentative steps into the North American and Japanese markets. Of particular importance in these new market entries were the larger capacity telescopic truck and all terrain cranes of 80 to 300 tonnes capacity.

By this time both the American and Japanese crane industries had lost their early leadership in the design of competitive large size telescopic cranes.

In 1978 Gottwald again upped the ante with the 200-tonne AMK 200-103 tele truck crane only to re-double its challenge with the 400-tonne AMK 400-93. While the 200-tonner was a significant success only a handful of 400-tonners were sold.

DEEP RECESSION

The ravages of the deep and long recession of the 1980s took a severe toll on the crane and construction equipment manufacturing industries of the US and Europe burdened by massive over-capacity.

By the late 1970s there were about 150 manufacturers of mobile cranes in the world with upwards of 75% of these based in North America and Europe. From 1982 through 1987 about one third of the companies ceased crane manufacture and every other manufacturer in the industry either made dramatic cutbacks or closed some of their plants. During this period the Japanese intensified their export efforts in order to maintain employment.

The relative strength of the dollar made US exports expensive and imports cheap opening the market to the Japanese and German machines as well as making US cranes too expensive in export markets. This double-edged sword closed down much of the US industry stifling new product development investments in the US and eroding the US industry’s hard-earned share of the depressed world market. So harsh was the downturn in US crane production and so daunting a challenge to compensate for the strength of the dollar that America’s leading crane makers were driven to survival strategies.

In 1983 Harnischfeger P&H decided to close its US factories and made an agreement to transfer all of its mobile crane production to its Japanese licensee partner Kobe Steel (Kobelco) or to its subsidiary in Germany. In 1982 Kidde Inc. declared its subsidiary market leading Grove Manufacturing a discontinued operation but later decided to retain it and in 1984 acquired one of Europe’s leading manufacturers – Coles Cranes of the UK whose parent Acrow had taken the group into receivership. In 1986 FMC Corporation sold its Link-Belt subsidiary to its Japanese licensee partner Sumitomo Heavy Industries.

In 1987 the French Legris industrial group acquired control of Potain. As the market recovered in the late 1980s the number of participants had reduced and the Japanese industry had grown to be the most powerful in the world. 1990 saw Tadano make the first ever European crane industry acquisition (Faun) by a Japanese company. Several major Japanese construction equipment manufacturers - Kobelco Hitachi and Komatsu - established new excavator manufacturing plants in the US thus providing a bridgehead for later entry into the crane market.

With Liebherr established as the all terrain market leader in 1988 they unveiled the 400-tonne LTM 1400 which became a best seller. That year Krupp acquired the rights to pioneering Gottwald’s lines of truck and all terrains. The following year Krupp introduced their ‘Megatrack’ independent wheel suspension for their growing line of all terrains.

When the downturn in the Japanese economy began in 1992 it was not seen as some cataclysmic event and most Japanese manufacturers carried on in anticipation of a near-term recovery. Obviously this did not happen and year-upon-year what is now by far the longest recession in modern Japanese history has worn down the domestic industry. As always however Japan has managed to keep a near strangle hold on its domestic market. The earlier threat of German imports having been cooled by the development of Japanese all terrains which though too heavy for export had met with approval at home.

By the late 1980s the days of the truck crane in Europe were numbered. Manufacturer by manufacturer domestic European production of truck cranes diminished leaving only reduced sales of Japanese truck cranes in the 25- to 50-tonne classes. Meanwhile hydraulic lattice boom truck and crawler cranes had grown in capacity with Demag emerging as market leader with crawlers.

The ever-present demand for improved load handling precision was a factor in all varieties of construction cranes. This was especially the case as tower cranes inexorably grew in height reach and capacity. As early as 1966 Potain followed the example of leading mobile crane makers in making electronic crane controls standard. During the early 1990s the European tower crane industry gradually adopted various types of frequency control systems – at first applied to individual crane functions and then to entire crane systems.

From 1992 until 1999 the American market enjoyed eight years of expansion – the longest in history and the US crane industry returned strongly to health.

In 1995 Grove acquired Germany’s Krupp in another attempt to regain its former strength in Europe as well as to access the German prowess in all terrains and large-size telescopic crane technology. By then Grove’s other European ‘possession’ the former Coles Cranes business in the UK had continued its downward slide and in 1998 when its former British owners Hanson sold Grove it was politically acceptable to close the last remnants of Coles UK operations.

NEW PLAYER

The 1990s also saw the rise of a new power in the mobile crane industry - Terex Corporation of Westport Connecticut USA.

In 1987 Terex had acquired Koehring – Lorain’s weakened operations in Waverly Iowa but it wasn’t until 1992 when a new CEO Fil Filipov was recruited that it began to show signs of life. In 1994 Terex acquired PPM the leading French crane manufacturer which had acquired the Bendini SpA of Italy in 1988 and then the Century II-P&H operations in the US and Germany in 1991.

With this critical mass Terex slashed operating costs to the bone rationalised its product line and adopted the most aggressive pricing and marketing policy the industry had ever seen. With prices 20% or more below the competition Terex began to win market share and by 1997 had become North American market leader. Terex then proceeded to expand into the crawler crane business with the acquisition of American Crane and into the tower crane business with the purchase of Peiner in Germany and Comedil in Italy.

The competition had been slow to react and by the time the old market leader Grove had woken up it was too late to recover. Having been sold by Hanson to Keystone a US financial investor in 1998 for the high price of over $600million the following year Grove plunged into losses.

While it’s German (ex-Krupp) operations continued to perform well in a healthy all terrain crane market Grove’s core US operations were bleeding badly. In 2001 Grove sought protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code but within months a reorganization plan under which Grove’s primary creditors Chase Manhattan Bank became majority owner was accepted by the courts.

The 1990s were a challenging decade for Europe’s tower crane industry. In 1993 France was in deep recession and in 1995 the German economy drifted into a downturn. Things improved in 1997 with Potain’s sales increasing 14% to FF57 billion.

In 1998 Potain acquired the emerging German manufacturer BKT bringing topless and luffing boom tower cranes to the French company’s line. Potain’s crane sales increased from 2100 in 1998 to 2600 in 1999. By 2000 over some three years Potain had renewed some 80% of its crane line.

Meanwhile in Europe as worldwide demand for all terrains had gone from strength to strength Liebherr reinforced its leadership of this important sector. In 2001 the firm opened a massive extension to its Ehingen factory – enough to increase capacity from 800 to 1400 new all terrains per years.

Even so during the late-1990s and early 2000s the leading German manufacturers continued to exert their technical prowess. In 1996 Liebherr introduced its oval-shaped ‘Oviform’ boom with its single tele cylinder ‘Telematik’ extension system that would become a hallmark of all Liebherr telescopics for decades to come.

A year later Mannesmann Demag introduced another groundbreaking new design the first ‘City’ type compact all terrain: the 25-tonne AC 75. It was soon followed by the three-axle the 40-tonne AC 40-1 which went on to sell more than a thousand units.

In 2001 Demag followed up with the Sideways Superlift (SSL) that would revolutionise the lifting performance of large-sized telescopics. This led to a patent dispute with Liebherr over their ‘Y Guy’ which was subsequently settled out of court.

GLOBAL ALLIANCE

In 2001 the Japanese crane manufacturers Tadano Sumitomo and Hitachi formed a global alliance. Though this revolved primarily around lattice boom mobile cranes it also involved the hydraulic mobile crane businesses of Tadano in Japan Tadano-Faun in Germany and Link-Belt in the US.

In March 2002 it was announced that the Sumitomo and Hitachi crane businesses would merge. The following year a supply agreement for Kobelco crawler cranes to Manitowoc was announced. This proved highly successful and was only terminated in 2018.

Following Keystone’s failure to turnaround Grove it sold the business for $270 million in March 2002 to the leading US lattice boom crane manufacturer Manitowoc who the previous year had acquired the leading French tower crane manufacturer Potain.

Changes in the ownership of Mannesmann saw the Demag crane business become an unwanted division of Siemens- Bosch and the acquisition of Grove with its German (ex-Krupp) unit by Manitowoc polarised the industry. In May 2002 Siemens agreed to sell the Demag mobile crane business to Terex for $150 million.

Beginning in the mid-2000s the crane world found itself exposed to the first rumblings of an offensive from the emerging Chinese crane industry. This should not have come as a shock to experienced executives as many had already seen limited access to the Chinese. The first Chinese truck cranes from XCMG and Zoomlion and tower cranes from Yongmao and Zoomlion arrived courtesy of Dutch crane traders and were notable for inflated claims and low prices. Unfortunately some rather naïve European crane buyers were sucked in by the apparently attractive offers and soon found themselves with products with at-best scant service support.

TOWER POWER

By the mid-2010s construction methods of the leading nations of SE Asia were strongly evolving to PVVC (Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction) with the motive of improving safety and productivity in building construction by using pre-cast concrete elements of up to 40-tonnes weight.

Naturally this drove demand for significantly larger tower cranes. As well as Potain and Liebherr Yongmao was a beneficiary – especially in Singapore Hong Kong and Malaysia.

New luffing boom cranes of 20 to 25-tonnes capacity and flat tops of 40 50 and 60 tonnes capacity quickly emerged and proved very popular. For local rental companies their rates were under pressure from the growing challenge of low-cost Chinese tower cranes. Business also remained healthy in the region’s petro-chem oil and gas and offshore industries which continued to employ large crawler and all terrain cranes from the leading crane hirers.

Developments in self-erecting tower cranes included the broadening use of trolley-hoists that can ride up and down steep jib angles.

TEREX AND LOAD KING

In 2010 Manitex International acquired trailer manufacturer Load King from Terex and in 2015 the business was acquired by Custom Truck One Source.

In mid-2016 Terex announced it would close its mobile crane and boom truck plant in Waverly Iowa and transfer production to the Terex plant in Oklahoma City Oklahoma. In 2019 Terex sold its truck crane and boom truck product lines to Load King. The former Terex boom truck and truck crane lines of up to 80-tons (72-tonnes) capacity would be branded Load King ‘Stinger’.

Terex US rough terrain crane production was discontinued with rough terrain production continuing in Crespellano Italy. In 2022 Terex announced it would close its Oklahoma City plant and that it would transfer production of its line of Genie telehandlers to a new plant in Monterrey Mexico.

LIGHT FANTASTIC

After decades of dependence on wire ropes in 2012 the first signs of fundamental change emerged in 2012. That year the US rope maker Samson announced its K-100 fibre rope product line which would soon be made available as an option on Manitowoc lattice boom crawler cranes and then Grove rough terrains truck cranes and boom trucks.

In 2019 Liebherr introduced the EC-B series of eight flat tops with three of them available with soLITE high-tensile fibre ropes developed in collaboration with Teufelberger. In 2019 Wolffkran acquired an interest in German’s Trowic GmbH – a fibre rope company.

POTAIN IN PUNE

In 2019 Manitowoc announced a new Potain manufacturing plant in Pune India where for many years it had been producing Potain towers with former licence Shirke. Added to its plant in Zhangjiagang China this gave Potain ‘two bites’ at emerging markets from Asian sources. Originally the joint venture plant in Zhangjiagang opened in 1980 but the current 56000m2 plant was opened in 2012 and by the end of 2018 had produced over 6000 cranes.

Soon after Bauma 2019 Arcomet and Matebat announced their new name Uperio managed by Phiippe Cohet former Manitowoc executive and now chairman of Matebat and CEO of Arcomet. Uperio’s main business would be tower crane rental with a worldwide fleet of 2200 cranes and it would also operate as a Potain distributor in France a Terex Towers distributor and as the Zoomlion distributor in the US through its P&J Arcomet business. One of Cohet’s expressed ambitions was to rationalise this diverse crane fleet through telematic connectivity and machine controls.

At Bauma XCMG chairman Wang Min said “at the very beginning of our exports first we aimed for medium and low-end markets such as Asia SE Asia and Africa… We realise parts supply and service support have been an issue. We have not been very strong at our management of aftersales service. It has been hard for customers to find the exact parts.”

2019 saw early North American installations of AMCS Technologies DCS 60 devices to management of prohibited overflight zones and avoid the interference of two luffing boom tower cranes. The DCS 60 operates in real time and in 3D to calculate the distance between each crane as well as movement speed.

Amongst the first to employ the AMCS devices were two Jaso J380PA luffers operating in Seattle and Vancouver followed by Comedil CTL 272-18 luffers and CTT 202 flat tops.

Meanwhile Comansa’s plant in Hangzhou was also expanded to meet demand and introduced several new models. As was also the case in SE Asian countries like Singpore Hong Kong and Korea China was demanding significantly larger tower cranes – as big as 25- to 50-tonnes capacity – to meet demand for PPVC pre-fabricated construction. Responding to this trend Zhangjiagang introduced its largest flat top crane – the MCT 565 with a choice of 20t 25t and32t winches at Bauma China 2019.

While flat top (topless) cranes continued to grow in popularity in China and worldwide in some countries like Korea traditional hammerhead cranes like the Potain MC 310 remained very popular.

Just as flat-top tower cranes had carved out a significant market niche during the 2000s and 2010s as manufacturers sought to balance the benefits of hammerheads versus this ‘new’ variety a third variety emerged bearing the rather cumbersome name of ‘low-tops’ as a kind of in between category – albeit with clearly definable benefits. Meanwhile in 2019 Liebherr introduced its largest flat top in the shape of the 1000 EC-B 125 of 125-tonnes max capacity.

In 2019 Zoomlion now China and the world’s largest tower crane manufacturer opened a huge new factory in Changde. It was the result of a RMB 780 million €100 million investment programme that started in 2016. It included 12 automated production lines more than 10000 sensors over 100 industrial robots and 16 CNC processing centres.

BENCHMARK MODELS

Beginning in the early 1970s Grove made a strong push to develop demand for larger-size rough terrains. The 35-ton RT 65S and 50-ton RT 75S were the first rough terrains to feature trapezoidal booms and established themselves as benchmarks.

Some 1400 RT 65Ss were sold worldwide. Grove upped the ante in 1978 with the 80-ton RT 980 which confounded critics by becoming a runaway success and for the first time became a viable alternative to lattice crawler cranes. Hopes were high in 1982 when Grove introduced the massive 8x8x8 150-tonne capacity RT 1650.

Unfortunately the crane was too far ahead of its hydraulic and automotive component technology which proved unreliable. To this time the competition had steered clear of competing with Grove.

In 1993 Grove returned to a more conventional approach with its 100-ton RT 9100 and in 2001 added the 120-tonne capacity RT 9130E. Throughout the decades of Grove market dominance Link-Belt and Lorain had persisted as significant US competitors but strong rough terrain crane competition also persisted from Japan’s Tadano and Kato and most recently from the all terrain crane market leader Liebherr.

Always innovative Link-Belt broke the traditional mould of two-axle rough terrains in 2002 with the 100-ton RTC 80100. This three-axle model afforded lower transport heights than the big two-axle RTs allowing them to be legally low-bedded at under 4m. The new 6x6 Link-Belts quickly found a willing market and Link-Belt has subsequently developed 130 and 160-tonne models

Unlike Grove’s RT 1650 when Tadano developed its largest rough terrain to date the 160-ton (145-tonne) GR 1600XL - albeit some 25-years later they selected a three-axle carrier. Meanwhile with its latest 165-ton (150-tonne) GRT 9165 Grove adopted a similar 6x4x6 configuration.

By the 1990s demand for rough terrains cranes of 15 to 30 tonnes capacity for generations the workhorse crane in countries like the US and Middle East found reducing demand. The trend wasn’t just in conventional small rough terrains which progressively had been replaced in the market by larger rough terrains of 4050 60 and 65 tonne capacity.

In addition telehandlers with similar boom reach of up to 18 to 23 metres and able to handle loads of one to four tonnes had become the preferred small-size high-reach option. Japan’s mini rough terrains of seven to ten tonne capacity that had become such a phenomenon in the 1990s and 2000s had been replaced by similarly compact cranes of 13 to 16 tonne capacity while in the UK the small seven to ten tonne Coles Speedcranes and Iron Fairies were long gone.

TELE BOOM CRAWLERS

Adding new competition to rough terrains tele boom crawler cranes continued to grow in popularity and capabilities.

First introduced by Grove and Coles in the early 1960s for decades this variety had remained a niche market product essentially kept alive by manufacturers such as Mantis of the US.

One of Germany’s most famous and respected makers of crawler cranes and excavators – Sennebogen – was an early proponent of tele boom crawler cranes and has subsequently developed as a leading full-line supplier which today also provides its products through an OEM branding agreement with Grove for the North American market.

In 2007 Link-Belt joined the fray and has since become the US market leader with a full range of cranes up to 250-tons (220-tonnes) and in 2006 Liebherr also added a 100-tonne model and has since become a strong force in the segment with a range of cranes up to 220-tonnes capacity.

After a couple of years during the early 2000s the efforts to establish Chinese cranes in the mainstream truck crane and tower crane markets of Europe and Australia diminished. While this left some crane dealers in various levels of financial distress all the while the Chinese were redoubling their product development efforts and preparing for their next foray.

At each edition of Bauma China new improved and larger cranes continued to appear.

In 2013 China’s President Xi introduced the Belt & Road initiative which through loan programmes has since funded numerous infrastructure development project in the world’s emerging nations. This provided a massive vehicle for China’s contractors and crane and machinery makers with a Government-funded access to foreign markets. For example Zoomlion established over 20 trading platforms and nine production bases overseas with over 120 dealer sales and service outlets.

In 2019 at the Bauma show in Munich Tadano announced that it was acquiring the Demag mobile crane business from Terex. The announced cost was $215m.

In 2021 to the surprise of many Tadano announced it would drop the Demag brand name just as president and CEO Koichi Tadano stepped down from his leadership role.

ELECTRIC DREAMS

Major changes are also evident in the power sources of mobile cranes. As far back as the 1970s Italy’s leading manufacturer of industrial pick-and-carry mobile cranes – Valla – had developed a full-line of battery-electric models. Back then few manufacturers followed Valla’s lead but recently their former general manager founded JMG as a competitor.

In recent years the employment of battery-electric technology in mobile cranes and tele handlers has developed quite dramatically. Primary usage in mobile cranes has been on tele boom crawler cranes (Marchetti and Sany) and lattice boom cranes (Liebherr and PVE) as well as mobile industrial pick-and-carry cranes including Valla and their Italian competitors Ormig JMG Sard Omar Galizia and Lige.

In addition mini crawler crane makers such as Maeda and Furukawa-Unic have long had battery-electric powered models and more recently makers of aluminium truck-mounted cranes such as Klaas and Bocker have added electric models.

In 2021 Zoomlion introduced its 25-tonne capacity ZTC 250N-EV battery electric truck crane. The world’s first ‘unmanned’ crane it has laser scanning obstacle-avoidance 3D scene creation working while charging capability anti-sway hoisting 150kw/100km power usage equivalent to 19.5 litres fuel consumption per 100 kms and 230 kms endurance range.

In 2021 Zoomlion introduced the world’s largest tower crane in the form of the 12000tm capacity W 12000 flat top of 450-tonnes capacity and with a maximum hook height of 400-metres.

Predictably fast on its heels arch-rival XCMG trumped its nemesis with the announcement of the 15000tm XGT 15000-600.

With a maximum lifting capacity of 600-tonnes and 92.5m freestanding height the crane was developed in conjunction with China Major Bridge Engineering Co. Like other large Chinese tower cranes it was designed for the construction of large modular bridges. With an annual production of over 10000 tower cranes XCMG is also in the running for the top spot in tower crane output with revenues in excess of RMB 5 billion.

As these two Chinese players continue to compete for supremacy in 2022 Zoomlion held open-days for its 2400-tonne capacity ZAT 24000H ‘all terrain’.

In this respect the use of the term ‘all terrain’ truly is a stretch. However like Zoomlion’s earlier so-called 2000-tonne QAY 2000 displayed at Bauma China 2012 it will be surprising if this new model ever sees the light of day outside of China! However the same cannot be said for monster Chinese crawler cranes. Sany and Zoomlion’s sharp pricing has opened doors for their 40- to 2000-tonne crawlers in markets as diverse as Turkey Thailand Vietnam India and Russia."

Lea este artículo en español.

The California Coastal Commission tonight approved another desalination plant despite citing its high costs risks to Monterey Bay’s environment and “the most significant environmental justice issues” the commission has faced in recent years.

The commission’s divided 8-to-2 vote came after 13 hours of debate at a Salinas public hearing packed with several hundred people plus more crammed into overflow space. Many of the 375 who signed up to speak opposed the project — some in tears.

Much of the debate focused on the fairness of locating a for-profit company’s facility in the Monterey County city of Marina — which does not need the water and is home to designated disadvantaged neighborhoods. The expensive supply will flow to other communities including the whiter wealthy enclaves of Carmel-by-the-Sea Pacific Grove and Pebble Beach.

“It’s our city our water our beaches our wildlife — so that Cal-Am can send the water to another wealthier community who don’t even want it” Marina Mayor Bruce Delgado told commissioners his voice breaking.

California American Water the nation’s largest publicly traded water and wastewater company plans to build the plant to pump ocean water desalinate it and provide drinking water to 100000 people on the Monterey Peninsula. The largely Latino agricultural community of Castroville would also receive the water at a discount.

Today nine years after the project was first proposed commissioners approved the plant along with a long list of conditions aimed at limiting the harm to dunes and wetlands groundwater stores and local communities. The company must still obtain an array of local state and federal permits and resolve a court battle over groundwater rights before construction could begin.

Coastal Commission staff warned that the plant would require overriding parts of the state’s Coastal Act and would have “substantial impacts” to sensitive habitat areas for threatened and endangered species such as the Western snowy plover which nests in dunes there.

“It’s our city our water our beaches our wildlife — so that Cal-Am can send the water to another wealthier community who don’t even want it.”

Marina Mayor Bruce Delgado

The approval is a pivot from the staff’s 2020 recommendation to reject the company’s proposal to build a larger plant. Since then California has faced its driest three-year stretch on record and a fourth drought year is looming making the need for new drinking water supplies more urgent.

The decision pits environmental justice concerns and ecological impacts against the precarious water supply of the Monterey Peninsula which does not receive imported water and relies instead on over-pumped groundwater the overtaxed Carmel River and highly-treated wastewater. Parts of the peninsula have been under a moratorium for new water connections for longer than a decade.

“There’s just too much uncertainty regarding the future of the water supply in this region” Coastal Commission Executive Director Jack Ainsworth said at the hearing. “History will judge us harshly if we do not take a precautionary approach on water supplies in this community.”

But Commissioner Linda Escalante one of the two voices of dissent said she could not support the project because of the “overwhelming uncertainty of need cost and feasibility.”

The plant would produce about 4.8 million gallons of water per day when it begins operating with the possibility of increasing production later. California American Water hopes to have it operating by the end of 2027. The water company is seeking to bolster local supplies after state regulators ordered it to stop its decades-old practice of unlawfully diverting more than its share from the Carmel River.

Supporters of the desalination project include Gov. Gavin Newsom state water agencies and local businesses with hotels and inns in the region writing letters of support and some saying it would ease housing shortages in the region.

“The Monterey Peninsula has been in dire need of additional drought-proof reliable water supplies for over 25 years. There’s no time left to wait” wrote Amy Herzog executive director of Visit Carmel in a letter to the commission.

Newsom “supports the staff recommendation and appreciates their work to ensure the project protects the coastal environment and addresses environmental justice issues” Newsom Communications Director Erin Mellon told CalMatters.

But Coastal Commission staff acknowledged that even if the company meets the conditions the environmental justice impacts remain in Marina and elsewhere.

“The simple fact the project is sited within a community that doesn’t want it and won’t benefit from it means that these impacts cannot be fully eliminated” Kate Huckelbridge a senior deputy director told the commissioners.

Customers could face bill hikes of $50 per month about a 50% increase over the average residential bill California American Water estimates.

“If Cal Am is allowed to build their desal plant and my water bill increases by 50% I will have to choose between eating and buying water” one commenter Tammy Jennings told commissioners adding that even with the company’s low-income assistance program the bill runs more than $40 a month. “No one should be allowed to make a profit on something we all need to live.”

California American Water proposed increasing its low-income discounts to 50% and expanding eligibility for its assistance program. But the commissioners at the last minute tonight added provisions ordering the company to improve plans for assisting low-income ratepayers and capping rate hikes at $10 a month for eligible customers.

Just before 10 p.m. after 13 hours in an attempt to soften the blow the commissioners also asked the company to pay $3 million to the city of Marina and fund a full-time employee to oversee a public access and amenities plan.

Residents and officials from Marina — where 62% of residents are people of color and the average annual income is under $33000 — said the facility would add to their environmental burdens which already include a Superfund site and landfill.

They worry it would harm their shoreline and imperil precious groundwater supplies. Others questioned whether there is even a need for the water on the peninsula given its high cost and efforts to expand local recycled water production.

Delgado showed commissioners a picture of a rusted pipeline rising above sand dunes. “Would you want this on the beach that you go to? Is this what the Coastal Commission envisions?”

“The Monterey Peninsula has been in dire need of additional drought-proof reliable water supplies for over 25 years. There’s no time left to wait.” Amy Herzon Visit Carmel

The decision was closely watched as the state weighs how desalination will fit into its parched future. Currently four desalination plants provide drinking water in California.

The Coastal Commission staff in its support of the project cited “the increased pressure from the historic drought for new sources of water in a region already struggling with longstanding critical water shortages.” Though recycled water provides a “feasible and less environmentally damaging alternative” in the near term “staff concludes that the Project is needed in the longer term.”

In May the commissioners unanimously rejected another controversial plant proposed by developer Poseidon Water in Huntington Beach citing environmental harms high costs and lack of local demand. But a smaller less-expensive plant proposed by a public water agency in Dana Point sailed through the approval process in October.

The Monterey County plant brings the battle north. Its size more closely resembles the Dana Point plant and it too would suck water from beneath the sea floor adding a buffer between the intakes and sea life.

But instead of a public agency a massive water utility would construct and operate the Monterey Bay plant. And it would produce the “most costly water of any of the desalination projects the Commission has considered recently” staff wrote in their assessment.

“The question I pose to the Commission today is how they want to be remembered” California State University Monterey Bay graduate student Liz Smith said at the hearing. “You have a chance to stand against environmental injustice to stand beside the community and environment you claim to support and to be on the right side of history.”

Endangered species dunes and groundwater at risk

Home to charismatic sea otters and other marine creatures Monterey Bay is highly prized and protected for its kelp forests and deep underwater canyons. The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary reaches from north of the Golden Gate Bridge to Cambria spanning a 4601 square nautical mile stretch about the size of Connecticut.

Constructing the well pads an access road and part of the pipeline — plus ongoing maintenance — would disturb coastal dune habitat that still supports two dozen sensitive species despite a century of sand mining commission staff reported.

Nearby wetlands and vernal ponds too could see the groundwater beneath them drawn down by as much as four feet according to an earlier independent review from the Coastal Commission. What’s unclear is how this would affect the wetlands: if they’re connected to the groundwater “this amount of drawdown could cause adverse effects to up to several dozen acres of these important habitat areas” the review says.

The commission tasked the company with keeping a close watch on how the wetlands respond to pumping and developing a plan if they find any harm. Commissioners also responded to residents’ complaints by adding last-minute requirements for the company to prioritize purchasing other dune habitat in an effort to offset ecological harm.

It’s not enough Delgado said.

“The first thing that would happen is that those vernal pools and wetlands would dry up” the mayor said. Only then would the monitoring “tell us what that cure is somewhere down the road someplace probably outside Marina.”

Supporters said a desalination plant could offset harm to the Carmel River which California American Water has been illegally pumping from in excess of its water right for decades.

DJ Moore an attorney representing California American Water said the company has shrunk the footprint of permanently fenced area on the shore to 7400 square feet. Staff said the company’s plans to use tunneling techniques for pipelines would also reduce harm to sensitive ecosystems.

Even more controversial is how the facility could affect local groundwater supplies which Marina relies on for drinking water.

The wells would stretch at least 1000 feet seaward from a former sand mining facility in Marina on the shore of Monterey Bay to suck in water from beneath the sea floor and then pipe it to a new treatment facility adjacent to an existing wastewater plant. The leftover brine would be co-mingled with the wastewater and discharged about two miles offshore in the National Marine Sanctuary.

In addition to seawater the wells will pull “some percentage of water from nearby aquifers” said Tom Luster the Coastal Commission’s senior environmental scientist. That groundwater must be returned to the basin in the form of discounted supplies for Castroville.

Marina officials and residents have raised concerns that the wells could degrade their own groundwater stores and cause saltwater to seep into the aquifer.

Previous reviews found “limited to negligible” effects on seawater intrusion and that the plant’s capture area “would likely not extend to near the City’s wells.” The Marina Coastal Water District which contests that assessment is embroiled in a court battle with the company over its rights to pump groundwater.

Coastal commission staff acknowledged the uncertainties and the severe consequences if desalination did harm local groundwater supplies.

“We took the precautionary approach of requiring a very robust groundwater monitoring plan … meant to be an early warning system” Huckelbridge said.

Costs could “burden low-income ratepayers”

Costs of construction remain unknown because the company says it is waiting for the commission’s approval before bidding the construction and material costs. But the company’s previous estimate is around $330 million; the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District estimates more than $420 million.

The desalinated water could cost more than $6000 per acre-foot. The estimated 50% increase in rates will “disproportionately burden low-income ratepayers in the service area and residents in the City of Marina” according to commission staff.

Eric Tynan general manager of the Castroville Community Services District whose groundwater supplies are already tainted by seawater supports the project and the discounted water supplies it would bring.

“Castroville really needs it. We’re the canary in the coal mine. And this has been a slow moving trainwreck coming at us” Tynan said.

Others questioned the need for the pricey water particularly given efforts by Pure Water Monterey to recycle more water.

“It’s more than enough water for thirty-plus years so you don’t need a desal plant today” David Stoldt general manager of the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District which is tasked with managing the region’s ground and surface water supplies told CalMatters.

You go there last.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGljazJob3VzdG9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ludmVzdGlnYXRlcy8yMDIyLzExLzE4L2twcmMtMi1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMtaG93LWRvZXMtaG91c3RvbnMtd2F0ZXItZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1jb21wYXJlLXRvLW90aGVyLW1ham9yLWNpdGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KPRC 2 Investigates: How does Houston Water Department compare to other major cities?,"HOUSTON – Inaccurate meter readings and soaring high water bills are leaving many Houston water customers feeling drained. In our KPRC 2 Investigates ‘DRAINED’ series we have explained the problems. We wanted to know how the City of Houston’s water department compares to other cities. Global research firm J.D. Power has surveyed water customers of municipal utilities for an annual study every year since 2016.

J.D. Power customer satisfaction survey compares Houston water department to other cities.

It’s called the U.S. water utility residential customer satisfaction study. J.D. Power looked at 89 municipal water departments and it says Houston scores below average. The company surveys thousands of people in each city asking questions about water quality billing and customer service online and by phone.

The highest possible score is 1000. Houston’s score for 2022 is just 716.

Biggest concern? Houston customers surveyed said some of the biggest concerns are the quality of the water. About 42% of people said they never drink tap water in Houston. We introduced you to Houston customers surveyed said some of the biggest concerns are theAbout42% of people said they never drink tap water in Houston. We introduced you to people in one community who have been dealing with murky brown water for months.

Water pressure is also a big concern. More people in Houston said they have low water pressure than anywhere else in the country.

Other survey complaints include long wait times by phone and a poor digital experience. And J.D. Power said Houston scores have dropped every year for the last four years.

“We’re seeing satisfaction getting lower and as a consequence of that we are seeing results get lower and lower for the City of Houston. It used to be not so bad more recently we’ve been reporting the results to the lower end of the performance when I compare that to everyone else in the nation” said Andrew Heath Managing Director Utilities Intelligence.

Water from snow and streams collects in lakes and reservoirs and cities pump it through complex filtration systems to make it pure enough to drink. The particular balance of invisible minerals in each pour from your kitchen tap makes for subtle differences in every glass. One might call it the terroir of tap water.

In a bustling hotel ballroom surrounded by exhibition booths showing off the latest pipes pumps and filters a panel of judges gathered to spot those differences.

I was one of them.

The American Water Works Association assembled a panel of water wonks for its Rocky Mountain regional meeting in the ski resort town of Keystone. Here we put tap water to the test blind tasting samples from six cities across Colorado to crown a winner.

I’ll be honest I don’t know a lick about water tasting. I’m an avid water enjoyer that’s for sure. Just ask any waiter who’s made four or five return trips to top up my glass during dinner or any of my friends who rarely see me without my liter Nalgene. I guzzle enough water to make a camel blush but my taste buds aren’t nearly refined enough to spot the difference between water from Denver and Durango.

Fortunately the panel was replete with experts. Besides myself a reporter on the water beat there were people who have made a career out of studying water taste and odor. One of them was Victor Sam an engineer for the consulting firm Stantec.

I leaned to my right where Sam was seated for some pre-competition advice: What am I even supposed to be looking for?

“Overall you just want to have a pleasant experience” he said. “Does it quench you? Does it taste good to you? Does it feel good? But from a more scientific part of it you can judge by mouthfeel. Is it slippery or is it grainy? Is it maybe dry? So it's kind of like wine tasting.”

Ashley Waldron / City of Englewood Utilities KUNC reporter Alex Hager interviews Victor Sam while judging the water taste test. ""It's kind of like wine tasting"" Sam said.

The event organizers brought by a “taste and odor wheel” a neatly charted list of all the notes you might pick up from a glass of water. Of course there was chlorine and bleach but also a lot of the same terms you might hear on a Saturday afternoon in Napa Valley – fruity grassy and earthy.

The wheel wasn’t much help for me and the judge seated to my right.

Colin Chung a member of the American Water Works Association Board is a celebrity around these parts. Even so he’s neither a scientist nor a sommelier.

“I can't tell the difference between a $10 bottle of wine and a $500 bottle of wine” he said with a chuckle. “They all taste good to me.”

While the tap water selection was by no means wine it was treated with the same ceremony and elegant touch as a nice cabernet.

The judges opened up heavy glass bottles brought to the competition by municipal water departments decanting samples into stemmed glasses. Each judge received six along with a grading sheet where we marked down scores from one to ten.

I delicately sipped a little from each glass. In the early going not much stood out. I could tell that one sample was different from another but couldn’t exactly describe how. Sam the taste and odor expert said good-tasting water is typically laden with minerals.

“A lot of times if you actually drink pure water” he explained “it doesn't taste good because what's happening is you're just drinking H2O – no minerals – and you're essentially tasting your own tongue.”

Because of that he said bottled water companies will brag about added minerals that make their water taste more “quenching” and less like your own tongue.

The panel of judges was given a ""taste and odor wheel"" a neat list of notes they might pick up from each sample. Those flavors ranged from chemical – chlorine and bleach – to terms more commonly associated with wine – fruity grassy and earthy.

After a first pass at the six waters it was time to take a second lap and jot down some scores. That’s no small feat when each tastes so refreshingly bland. It was tough to cleanse my palate in between samples when the usual go-to palate cleanser is the very thing I’m supposed to be judging. The organizers put a few sleeves of saltines on the table to help.

I took a few stabs at describing the taste of water in the comment section of my scoring sheet.

“Smooth soft airy.” That doesn’t say much I realize but they’re all fairly positive remarks. So is “plain” I suppose and I used that label for Sample D.

The only one that received negative comments was Sample F which I called “thin and rubbery.” Expert Sam agreed.

For some additional comfort from my non-expert neighbor Chung I asked if he’s picking up on any of the nuances we saw highlighted in the taste and odor wheel.

“I'm trying and I'm trying to differentiate between the two” he said. “And that's very hard to do right now.”

But then on my third or fourth sip from the Sample E glass I had a breakthrough. Finally a distinctive flavor. Citrus. The faintest whisper of tangerine or grapefruit. Like one tenth of a La Croix.

I ran the revelation past Sam but his fine-tuned taste buds did not come to the same conclusion.

“I think that one gave me the most slipperiness” he remarked. “Did you eat something sweet for lunch?”

Seeing as I hadn’t had a bite of anything besides saltines since my breakfast burrito I was elated that I’d picked up something so subtle that even my eagle-eyed (anteater-nosed? hummingbird-tongued?) neighbor couldn’t.

It was only a few minutes later when that jubilation came crashing down. Imagine my surprise when a routine key-check pat of my pockets revealed a forgotten tube of sweet mandarin chapstick.

Alex Hager / KUNC Organizers tally scores at an American Water Works Association regional meeting. Judges compared tap water samples from six different cities across Colorado.

After seeing the rest of the judges turn in their score sheets I scribbled down some shot-in-the-dark scores and turned in my sheet dejectedly coming to terms with my newfound cluelessness when it comes to scrutinizing my all-time favorite beverage. The organizers carefully tallied the votes and passed those findings along to the emcee.

Our winner? Grand Junction Colorado.

The Western Slope community is a well-watered oasis in the desert. It’s the first decent-sized city you hit on the drive west from the mountains. The dramatic peaks of the Rockies and the lush valleys below slowly unravel into dusty cliffs and sprawling red-dirt desert as you approach the Utah border. Grand Junction’s city pipes are filled with melted snow before it has a chance to flow further south.

After the dust settled I caught up with the winning city’s water department and they gave all the credit to their location.

“It comes straight from the Grand Mesa the world's largest flattop mountain” said Amy Brown of Grand Junction’s water department. “Gorgeous place great water pristine snowmelt.”

At the end of the day that could’ve been enough to make the difference. Judging water or even just finding the particular brand or city tap that appeals to you is far from an exact science. Just ask Susheera Pochiraju one of the other judges. She’s an environmental engineer at the firm Hazen and Sawyer and she literally has a Ph.D in this kind of thing. The emcee called her “Dr. Taste and Odor.”

Ashley Waldron / City of Englewood Utilities Susheera Pochiraju sips tap water from a selection of samples at the American Water Works Association Rocky Mountain meeting. A panel of judges compared water from six different Colorado cities to pick the best-tasting.

“I feel like taste and odor is really subjective to people” she said. “People have differing opinions. Sitting right next to each other me and my partners had different opinions. So I think it would be hard to come to a consensus.”

Pochiraju said you can be an effective judge of tap water even without any expertise.

“My point of view is that it shouldn't have any significant flavor” she said. “It should just taste clean and not dry your mouth. No one needs a Ph.D. All we need is to kind of calibrate ourselves.”

Next Grand Junction will take its water to the American Water Works Association annual meeting in Toronto where it’ll face off against the best tasting taps from all across the continent.

ARIZONA USA — The driest grounds California ever experienced were perfectly fertile for conspiracy theories.

The state was in the midst of its worst water crisis in over 1200 years during a mid-2010s drought. California's governor in response put a mandatory 25% water cut across the board affecting countless residents. Farmers were fighting farmers after pumping restrictions were placed on rivers and groundwater. Fishers protested after officials banned the practice in the name of conservation.

Fear anger and conspiracy beliefs were flowing in California when water wasn't. The debunked ""chemtrail"" conspiracy theory was searched more in the state and the nation as a whole during the midst of the water cuts when compared to any other time before or after Google Trends data shows.

Arizona may be headed in the same direction.

Researchers who study conspiracy theories said the state is ripe for new water-based misinformation to spread as the Southwest U.S. water crisis worsens. Those researchers also said understanding three reasons behind why the beliefs spread may be the key to preventing them.

Theories about ""unlimited water"" are slowly making their way from the fringes of the Internet to more prominent places on social media. Here's how experts say officials can stop the lies from flowing.

1) ""Conspiracy thrives in uncertainty""

Saying Arizona water rights are complicated is an understatement.

The ""mind-numbing"" nature of water law a lengthy history of complex legal agreements and disputes and thousands of wells and pumping stations with different regulations turn every drop of Arizona's water into a multi-group collaboration.

Water officials know how elaborate the state's water system is. The Arizona Department of Water Resources's website said ""nothing is more complicated than water.""

""Water is a very complex adaptive system and it's hard to understand"" Kyl Center for Water Policy Director Sarah Porter said. ""The misunderstanding has to do with people not having a chance to learn all the intricacies of the complex system.""

But researchers say the void that misunderstanding creates can be filled by the more dramatic and digestible stories that conspiracy theories offer.

""Conspiratorial explanations work because they can tell a coherent story... in spaces where reality is too complex to build a good story"" ASU researcher Anna Muldoon said.

Muldoon's current focus is conspiracy misinformation and apocalypticism around infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. But she recently fell down the rabbit hole of looking into utopian water conspiracy theories.

Conspiracy theories were given an easy way into the mainstream thanks to the chaos and lack of information during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic Muldoon said. A systemic lack of public health policies is what allowed COVID-19 to spread into a global endemic. Conspiracy theories however told a much simpler story of there being one person or one group of people controlling the virus in the shadows.

There are similar trends happening in the budding water conspiracy theories surrounding the Southwest's megadrought. The theories point to one simple solution to Arizona's water crisis and are often much more appealing than the real but complex issues surrounding the state's water supply.

""Frankly everyday people couldn't care less about how water gets into their taps...until it stops"" said Kristy Roschke a media literacy expert and managing director of the News Co/Lab at ASU.

""Then all of a sudden we need to learn why and how the water is getting cut. This process of trying to make sense of complicated things in a complicated world with special interests and a lot of obscuring of knowledge...is the primary pursuit of most people.""

Roschke is currently teaching a class on misinformation to prepare students to fight against it as it evolves. In a world where misinformation is becoming more difficult to spot she sees conspiracy theories being more than just some people believing wacky things.

""It's a disservice to segment a whole population and say 'What's wrong with them? Why can't they understand this is a conspiracy theory?'. Even if the belief isn't logical believing in a conspiracy theory is a real response to the complicated times we live in.""

That's a signal for Muldoon that water experts need to not only continue being truthful but also need to get rid of the jargon and technical terms when delivering updates to the public on the water crisis. As long as conspiracies provide better stories they will win out.

""Conspiracy thrives in uncertainty"" Muldoon said. ""If we could build better stories about what's real we'd have an easier time cutting off the conspiratorial explanations.""

2) As distrust rises so do conspiracy beliefs

It's unreasonable to expect people who don't have years of experience in Arizona water policy to have the resources or time to learn the intricacies of how water works in the state.

Elected water officials and water researchers have historically been the ones people turn to for the most accurate information.

But what happens when trust in the experts goes away?

Distrust in government mainstream media and/or accredited researchers is a common trait among conspiracy believers. A study looking into the beliefs and worldviews of people who believe in the ""chemtrail"" conspiracy theory found people used the belief as a piece of supporting evidence for their larger ideas around society.

The distrust towards authority mostly comes from past experiences including witnessing corruption or dysfunction in local government disagreements on how national governments have handled situations historically and family members' own distrust.

A good story alone isn't what makes conspiracy theories spread like wildfire. When someone is wronged or harmed by the actions of official sources they become more susceptible to buying into false beliefs.

""Yes it's necessary for people to be exposed to information in order to start believing in the conspiracy theory but it doesn't work alone"" co-author of the chemtrail belief study Sijia Xiao said. ""When people interpret the information it's always within their existing beliefs and worldviews.""

That distrust may worsen in Arizona as more at-risk and impoverished communities are harmed by water cuts.

Upcoming restrictions in the state's water supply and water deliveries are expected to hit farmers and their rural communities' economies the hardest.

""The biggest impacts of water cuts will probably be felt by Arizona's rural communities"" Porter said. ""A large cut in water could mean a big cut in economic activity. There are ramifications for the whole community because there's less employment there's less money to spend and food prices see increases.""

If conditions continue to worsen and further water cuts are implemented research shows minimizing harm among the people most affected by the cuts should be officials' top priority.

When more people are harmed feelings of distrust rise and clear the way for conspiracy beliefs to fester. When the conspiracy takes hold and people do believe there are false simple solutions to complex issues the believers feel they have a moral obligation to spread the theory to as many people as they can.

If you thought what you knew could save the world wouldn't you do the same?

3) When grifting turns into proselytizing

The water conspiracy theory gaining the most traction in Arizona is a perfect example of the ""simple solution"" trend that these conspiracies share and it's gaining influence.

First off here's what is true.

The way water works on the Earth's surface is known as the rain cycle. Water evaporates from the planet's oceans lakes and rivers rises into the atmosphere cools and condenses into clouds which then falls back to Earth as either rain or snow.

Arizona has an immense amount of groundwater beneath the surface but it acts a bit differently than surface water replenished by the rain cycle. The Valley is known for its arid climate so aquifers are hardly ever replenished by rain.

The vast majority of water in aquifers across the state can be described as ""old savings"" with the average water age being around 10000 years old.

While aquifers are artificially replenished today by cities and businesses research shows the last time aquifers were majorly replenished was during the last ice age when large amounts of ice melted and seeped into the ground.

Now the misinformation.

A Scottsdale resident named Matt has gotten millions of views and over 100000 followers spreading the theory on TikTok. We reached out to Matt multiple times for comment but he never responded.

Matt has been sharing a conspiracy theory that claims the Earth naturally creates an endless supply of clean water underground that can be easily reached by humans. Matt also claims the government and mainstream media don't want people to know about the water source so they can ""control"" the population.

He's not the only one sharing the conspiracy theory. Numerous ""institutes"" online are also spreading misinformation.

There are numerous falsehoods in this claim.

The first false claim: No Earth does not naturally regenerate water underground. Modern hydrologists agree that there is a large amount of groundwater throughout the Earth. Hydrologists have also found that groundwater is recycled water from the surface that has ended up underground due to shifting plate tectonics throughout Earth's 4.6 billion-year history.

Additionally there are countless examples of groundwater being used faster than it can be naturally replenished indicating that the Earth doesn't create the resource out of thin air.

The second false claim: No much of the water underground is not readily fit for human consumption. A great deal of water pumped from underground needs to be treated before being used by humans due to having too high of mineral content or having naturally occurring contaminants.

The third false claim: No a large portion of groundwater can't be reached by humans easily. Groundwater can be found up to 30000 feet underground and with wells on average costing around $20-$44 per foot in Arizona the price can start adding up.

The situation gets worse as groundwater is used faster than it is replenished. As underground water levels get lower the sediment and rock that has to be drilled through get deeper and tougher further increasing drilling costs.

Even though Matt has created a large following by pushing this conspiracy theory and others online Muldoon is hesitant to label him as a ""bad actor"" or someone knowingly pushing false information for their own gain.

""These are people that have bought into stories that make more sense to them than crisis"" Muldoon said. ""I'm not sure that most of these believers are bad actors because they can't possibly make enough money off of it. They sell everything they own and move to lakes in California that are supposedly the best spot to get to this water. The people who push QAnon make so much money. But these water conspiracy theorists are so committed and so obscure I think they really believe it.""

Once this kind of utopian water conspiracy belief takes hold the people who have bought into it feel a moral obligation to spread what they see as ""the answer"" to as many people as possible.

Muldoon found there is already a group of people who believe in this conspiracy and have a utopian vision of the water crisis ending if the government would spread this information. As the crisis worsens she expects the belief to get more popular.

""Because we're in this moment of fear it's spreading"" Muldoon said. ""The conspiracy belief is a real response to this fear uncertainty and constant anxiety people have about whether we're going to have water.""

Roschke knows there are difficult decisions coming in Arizona's water crisis whether that be how much water to cut or who gets hit the hardest. But she said government officials researchers and journalists need to be prepared to deal with the rising tide of water conspiracy theories as those decisions are made.

""If the folks in charge of helping society aren't prepared with compelling credible easily-digestible information...that's on the experts"" Roschke said. ""We've seen the failure of public health officials federal government officials and local officials during COVID in handling conspiracy theories. We're going to see this again and again if the officials aren't equipped to compete.""

This Report summarizes cases granted review on November 4 and 10 2022

Case Granted Review: Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi 21-757

Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi 21-757. Section 112 of the Patent Act requires an inventor applying for a patent to provide a “written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it” that is sufficiently clear “to enable any person skilled in the art . . . to make and use the” invention. 35 U.S.C. §112(a). This requirement to provide directions for skilled artisans to make and use the invention is called the “enablement” requirement. Markman v. Westview Instruments Inc. 517 U.S. 370 379 (1996). The Court limited the cert grant to the second question presented which is: “Whether enablement is governed by the statutory requirement that the specification teach those skilled in the art to ‘make and use’ the claimed invention 35 U.S.C. §112 or whether” as the Federal Circuit held it must enable those skilled in the art “to reach the full scope of claimed embodiments” without undue experimentation—in other words without substantial “time and effort.” 987 F.3d 1080 1088 (emphasis added).

The case concerns Amgen’s patents for antibodies that lower cholesterol. Amgen sued respondents Sanofi and Regeneron for patent infringement. Sanofi and Regeneron stipulated to infringement but asserted invalidity defenses under §112 including lack of enablement. The case went to trial and the jury found the patents valid. Sanofi appealed and the Federal Circuit reversed holding that the district court had erred in its evidentiary rulings and jury instructions on enablement. After a second trial the jury again found the patents valid. Sanofi then moved for judgment as a matter of law on lack of enablement and the district court granted the motion and held the patents invalid. Amgen appealed to the Federal Circuit which affirmed. 987 F.3d 1080. It recited its precedent holding that a claim satisfies the enablement requirement only if its disclosures enable skilled artisans “to make and use the full scope of the claimed” invention without “undue experimentation.” It explained that although an inventor need not “describe how to make and use every possible variant of the claimed invention when a range is claimed there must be reasonable enablement of the scope of the range.” The court added that the parties disputed exactly how broad Amgen’s patent claims were but held it was clear that Amgen had provided directions for recreating too small a portion of the antibodies covered by its claims.

Amgen argues that the Federal Circuit is imposing a requirement not contained in the Patent Act. This atextual “reach the full scope” requirement it argues “frustrates the purposes of patent law” because “[i]t invalidates patents for breakthrough inventions” by “demanding disclosure about theoretical ‘far corners.’” Further Amgen argues the Federal Circuit’s test cannot be reconciled with Supreme Court precedent. In a case called Minerals Separation v. Hyde the patent concerned “‘improvements in the process for the concentration’” of metallic ores. 242 U.S. 261 263 (1916). The invention involved adding oil to ore and agitating it. The “amount of oil and the extent of agitation necessary” varied depending on the metal but the patent did not explain how to adjust these variables for each of the “infinite[]” varieties of ore. Nonetheless the Court upheld that patent. Amgen argues the same result should obtain here. Finally it claims that reversing the Federal Circuit will not lead to overbroad patents because if a patent is truly overbroad the challenger should be able to point to embodiments that the claim does not provide directions for. Sanofi and Regeneron did not do that here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnV0c291dGh3ZXN0ZXJuLmVkdS9jdHBsdXMvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyL3N1bW1lci1yZXNlYXJjaC1wcm9ncmFtcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UTSW summer research programs provide undergrads valuable experience - CT Plus - UT Southwestern,"Undergraduates from across the country received valuable laboratory experience with leading UT Southwestern scientists through biomedical research training programs over the summer. In all 22 Amgen Scholars and 43 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellows were introduced to the kinds of projects that they might one day encounter in biomedical research careers.

Both programs are designed to inspire future biomedical investigators by providing opportunities for participants to conduct research analyze data present results develop relationships with faculty mentors and network.

UT Southwestern was selected to join the Amgen Scholars Program in 2019 when it was awarded a four-year grant from the Amgen Foundation. At the time it was one of only 13 institutions in the U.S. selected to host the program. (Amgen is a vendor for UT Southwestern and also supports UTSW research.)

Amgen Scholar Keerthana Stanley works in the lab of Todd Roberts Ph.D. Associate Professor of Neuroscience.

The SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship) program is a 10-week fellowship program for college students pursuing Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D. careers that the UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences started in 1984.

“The Amgen Scholars and SURF programs have given a platform to many students from different walks of life to gain meaningful research experiences and leverage the skills to take their careers to the next level” said Arnaldo Díaz Vázquez Ph.D. Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion and Director of the two programs.

The programs encourage students from backgrounds historically underrepresented in the sciences to apply including African-American Hispanic Native American and Pacific Islander as well as first generation and socioeconomically disadvantaged students and those who are studying at small liberal art colleges enabling opportunities for students who otherwise might not get a chance to work at a top biomedical institution.

The Amgen program is funded with a grant from the Amgen Foundation while SURF is supported by funds from UT Southwestern. In addition the SURF-Stem Cell program receives support from the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine and Eric Olson Ph.D. Chair of Molecular Biology and Director of the Hamon Center while the Summer Undergraduate Research Institute for the Study of Kidney Disease (SURISKD) is funded through a National Institutes of Health grant under the direction of Principal Investigator Thomas Carroll Ph.D. Professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Biology. SURF-Stem Cell and SURISKD programs are both subsets of the SURF program the first focused on studies of tissue formation and regeneration of damaged organs while the latter specializes in kidney-related research.

“The summer research opportunities at the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences align perfectly with our mission and commitment to diversity and inclusion. We celebrate and acknowledge the value of each scholar’s culture and perspectives and understand that we must continue increasing our reach and cultivating individual talents to diversify the STEM workplace which will ultimately translate into advancements in science and human health” Dr. Díaz Vázquez said.

UT Southwestern’s third class of Amgen Scholars experienced a summer filled with activities designed to promote scholarly advancement professional growth and a sense of community.

For University of California San Diego senior Maddie Brown becoming an Amgen Scholar fulfilled a dream. Growing up in Dallas she became fascinated by science and in particular by research at UT Southwestern which was in her neighborhood.

“The program here has fostered the notion that if you are curious about a subject never hesitate to reach out to an expert to learn more” said Amgen Scholar Maddie Brown.

When she became an Amgen Scholar Ms. Brown was elated to train in her hometown. Working in the lab of Daniel Siegwart Ph.D. Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Biomedical Engineering provided many opportunities. One of the most rewarding has been speaking with a wide array of faculty members Ms. Brown said.

“The program here has fostered the notion that if you are curious about a subject never hesitate to reach out to an expert to learn more” she said. “As a result I have been able to explore many new and interesting concepts in biology – from cell metabolism to drug targeting.”

The highly competitive Amgen Scholars program is a tremendous honor for recipients said Dr. Siegwart who also holds an appointment in the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Dr. Siegwart’s laboratory has worked on messenger RNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) similar to those used in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for the last decade. His lab discovered unique versions of LNPs that can target and deliver genetic medicines to the lungs called selective organ targeting (SORT) LNPs. SORT LNPs are being further developed by ReCode Therapeutics a UT Southwestern spinout company that was cofounded by Dr. Siegwart with multiple clinical trials on track to start in 2023 for treatment of genetic respiratory diseases.

“This summer Maddie worked diligently to elucidate important details of the mechanism – how and why Lung SORT LNPs target the lungs” he said. “Through scientific insights hard work and a diverse collection of biochemical assays she revealed key aspects of how Lung SORT LNPs bind specific proteins in the blood to transport genetic medicines inside of lung cells.”

SURF gives undergrads a taste of research life

Each summer the SURF program gives participants the chance to explore careers as researchers assigning these fellows to laboratories and research projects according to their training and science interests.

Like Amgen scholars SURF fellows maintain a busy schedule of conducting research working with mentors and preparing to present their research. UT Southwestern provides housing at a local hotel for SURF fellows.

“The fact that UT Southwestern is an esteemed biomedical research institution and the home of six Nobel Prize recipients and some of the world’s top scientists and medical professionals makes it exciting for me and keeps me motivated to grow” said SURF fellow Raul Caballero Montes.

“The opportunity to cultivate a scientific mindset – and the feeling of contributing to something enormous – is more than you could possibly imagine” said SURF fellow Raul Caballero Montes who studied cancer metabolism in a UTSW lab this past summer.

Working in the lab of Javier Garcia Bermudez Ph.D. this past summer Mr. Caballero Montes conducted research in cancer metabolism. Dr. Bermudez is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and in the Children’s Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern. The research of Mr. Caballero Montes focused on understanding mechanisms that rescue cancer cells from oxidative stress and damage and how to use this knowledge to induce a type of cell death called ferroptosis. Mr. Caballero Montes hopes to improve cancer treatments and prevent cancer spread.

“All the expertise that you get in your lab is combined with the learning experience that you get from the weekly scientific seminars and from speaking with other principal investigators summer fellows postdoctoral researchers and others you have the chance to network with” said Mr. Caballero Montes. “The opportunity to cultivate a scientific mindset – and the feeling of contributing to something enormous – is more than you could possibly imagine.”

A foundation for career success

After completing the summer training programs at UT Southwestern undergraduates leave with a sharp vision of what to expect from a career in research. For Lupita Rios who grew up in Guatemala and moved to the U.S. at age 12 SURF opened her eyes to dreams she never imagined.

Lupita Rios a current UTSW graduate student and former SURF fellow said her experience working in the University’s labs in 2015 and 2016 inspired her to pursue a career in neuroscience.

“Up until high school I had no idea that becoming a scientist was even a possibility” said the 2015 and 2016 SURF fellow. “I was the first in my family to attend a university. Therefore I was not aware of all the awesome career choices available for me.”

Working in the lab of former faculty member David Self Ph.D. inspired her to pursue a career in neuroscience she said.

“This experience was amazing!” said Ms. Rios who as a SURF student worked in the Department of Psychiatry focusing on studies of cocaine addiction in rat models. “I was able to do a lot of hands-on work that is difficult to learn in classes alone. I learned a lot of valuable skills such as developing and designing my own experiments and I got to use cutting-edge scientific tools.”

Participation in the SURF program solidified her decision to pursue a Ph.D. in neuroscience at UT Southwestern.

“After graduating my plans are to continue my path in research and help pave the way in STEM careers for other students like me” she said.

Now a UTSW graduate student Usman Hyder credits his 2017 SURF experience with providing the foundation to help him achieve his career goals.

Similarly SURF reinforced Usman Hyder’s desire to become a scientist. As a 2017 participant Mr. Hyder learned how to manage multiple experiments to think critically about experimental design and to understand what it meant to both fail and succeed at experiments.

The program helped him gain confidence and learn to be an independent scientist said Mr. Hyder who worked that summer in the lab of Ivan D’Orso Ph.D. Associate Professor of Microbiology.

“SURF solidified that I had the capacity to go to grad school and that becoming a principal investigator was a goal that I wanted to achieve” he said. “The critical thinking skills gained during SURF have been important for me to stay focused in the research path.”

Now in his fifth and final year of a Ph.D. program in Genetics Development and Disease at UT Southwestern he credits SURF and Dr. D’Orso with providing the foundation to help him achieve his career goals.

“Because of my experience both during SURF and now five years later it remains a dream to come back to UT Southwestern and start a lab here” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpkc3VwcmEuY29tL2xlZ2FsbmV3cy91LXMtc3VwcmVtZS1jb3VydC10by1jb25zaWRlci1mdWxsLTQwMTYyNzEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Supreme Court to Consider “Full Scope” Enablement of Claims,"On November 4 the United States Supreme Court granted a petition for writ of certiorari to review the Federal Circuit’s decision in Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi . Certiorari was limited to the question of whether the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112 requires patent specifications to enable the “full scope” of the claims or rather whether it is sufficient that the specification teach those skilled in the art to “make and use” the claimed invention. The Supreme Court will review the Federal Circuit’s holding that Amgen’s patent claims fail to satisfy the enablement requirement of § 112. This “full scope” enablement question has come up in several Federal Circuit cases before Amgen but this is the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue.

Amgen’s patents are directed to antibodies that reduce low-density lipoprotein (“LDL”) cholesterol which is linked to heart disease. LDL receptors in cells remove LDL cholesterol from the blood stream. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (“PCSK9”) enzyme facilitates LDL receptor degradation by binding to the LDL receptors thus decreasing the number of LDL receptors available in cells to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood stream. Certain antibodies may bind to and block PCSK9 to prevent this degradation of LDL receptors allowing LDL receptors to continue removing LDL cholesterol.

The antibodies claimed in Amgen’s patents are defined by their function which is to bind to a combination of sites on the PCSK9 protein thus blocking the PCSK9 protein from binding to LDL receptors. The claims are “genus”-type claims that are defined by their function and broader in functional diversity than the examples disclosed in the patent specification.

In the district court proceeding a jury found that Sanofi had failed to prove that Amgen’s patent claims are invalid for lack of written description and enablement. However the district court granted Sanofi’s motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law finding the claims invalid for failing to meet the requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112 that a patent’s specification must enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the claimed invention. The purpose of the enablement requirement is to ensure that the public is told how to carry out the invention. To prove that a claim is invalid for lack of enablement a challenger must show by clear and convincing evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not be able to practice the claimed invention without undue experimentation.

Amgen appealed the trial judge’s ruling to the Federal Circuit arguing that its patent claims are enabled because no undue experimentation is required to obtain antibodies within the scope of the claims. Sanofi responded that the claims are not enabled because there are millions of antibody candidates within the scope of the claims the disclosures do not provide sufficient guidance antibody generation is unpredictable and practicing the full scope of the claims requires substantial trial and error.

The Federal Circuit agreed with Sanofi. The court found that while the “full scope” of the genus claims was broad the examples disclosed in the specification were narrow. The court held that under those facts and given the broad “full scope” of the claims the trial judge did not err by concluding that undue experimentation would be required to practice the full scope of the claims.

This is not the first time the Federal Circuit has held that the enablement requirement applies to the full scope of the claims and it has done so most often in biopharma cases. For example in Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. v. Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc. a case on which we have previously provided commentary  the Federal Circuit upheld a jury verdict of invalidity for lack of enablement after determining there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the full scope of claims directed to methods for sequencing a nucleic acid using nanopore technology had not been enabled. In our analysis we noted that patent applicants should take care in how broadly they draft their claims in view of the disclosure and advised that depending on the circumstances applicants may want to take steps to include claims of different scope or consider whether a slight delay in filing is warranted to conduct more testing and provide additional disclosure in the application.

Amgen petitioned the Supreme Court for review of the Federal Circuit’s decision and the Supreme Court granted certiorari on Amgen’s question of:

Whether enablement is governed by the statutory requirement that the specification teach those skilled in the art to make and use the claimed invention 35 U.S.C. §112 or whether it must instead enable those skilled in the art to reach the full scope of claimed embodiments without undue experimentation—i.e. to cumulatively identify and make all or nearly all embodiments of the invention without substantial time and effort.

Amgen and others in the industry do not want to delay patent filings so that they can clear the “high hurdle” of showing full-scope enablement of a genus claim. They believe that having to enable the “full scope” of a claim will allow competitors to leapfrog the original innovator by focusing on minor changes that avoid infringement without having to invest in the same R&D. They argue that innovators faced with the elevated enablement standard that the Federal Circuit applied in Amgen and earlier cases will divert resources away from making new discoveries or advancing discoveries to market devoting them instead to making and testing additional embodiments of their invention to satisfy the “full scope” enablement requirement slowing the pace of research and development and hindering innovation to the detriment of the public.

Sanofi and its supporters argue that the Federal Circuit has it correct and that genus claims when properly supported are alive and well. Broad unsupported genus claims they argue would have an even more chilling impact on innovation. For example other companies would have less incentive to develop new therapeutics within the scope of such broad functional claims even if those therapeutics might prove more effective for patients.

Until now the Supreme Court has repeatedly denied petitions raising this question so it is interesting that the Court is now taking on the issue. Indeed the United States Solicitor General argued in an amicus curiae brief that Amgen’s challenge to the Federal Circuit’s enablement holding did not warrant further review. Perhaps the Court simply seeks to end the debate by reinforcing the Federal Circuit’s interpretation of the enablement requirement for functional genus claims. On the other hand the Supreme Court’s decision to review the Amgen case may signal a shift in favor of functional genus claims without the requirement of enabling the “full-scope” of the claims in the specification. It is also intriguing that the Supreme Court did not follow the recommendation of the Solicitor General. In any event patent owners inventors and patent practitioners now await briefing oral argument and the Supreme Court’s decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvYWNvcm4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2Jpb3RlY2gtYnVpbGRlci1nZXRzLWdyZWVuLWxpZ2h0LWZyb20tY29tbWlzc2lvbi1mb3ItbmV3LWNhbXB1cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biotech builder gets green light from commission for new campus,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGluaWNhbHBhaW5hZHZpc29yLmNvbS9taWdyYWluZS1oZWFkYWNoZS9jb25zdGlwYXRpb24tcmlzay1mb3ItZXJlbnVtYWItYW50aWVwaWxlcHRpYy1kcnVncy1mb3ItbWlncmFpbmUtcHJldmVudGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Assessment of Risk for Constipation With Erenumab Antiepileptic Drugs for Migraine Prevention,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='accounts.haymarketmedia.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /authcheck?gn=101&retUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicalpainadvisor.com%2Fmigraine-headache%2Fconstipation-risk-for-erenumab-antiepileptic-drugs-for-migraine-prevention%2F&NoCheck=true (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60F39F7C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGluaWNhbHBhaW5hZHZpc29yLmNvbS9taWdyYWluZS1oZWFkYWNoZS9jb25zdGlwYXRpb24tcmlzay1mb3ItZXJlbnVtYWItYW50aWVwaWxlcHRpYy1kcnVncy1mb3ItbWlncmFpbmUtcHJldmVudGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

""The Intelligent Edge is one of the most exciting developments of the digital era as computing power is pushed to previously inaccessible applications and locations"" claims Leo McHugh vice president of industrial automation at Analog Devices. ""Analog Devices is committed to delivering the unrivaled technology and solutions our customers need to leverage the full potential of the Intelligent Edge in smart buildings and factories as well as many more applications in the future.""

Analog Devices is aiming to boost edge intelligence with a new single-pair Power over Ethernet (SPoE) product line. (📷: Analog Devices)

Having intelligent devices at the edge is only any good of course if you can actually power them. Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a popular way to do so allowing for a single Ethernet cable to both connect a device to the network and feed it power — while single-pair PoE (SPoE) took the original standard which offered up to 15.4W measured at-transmission per port and reduced it from two wire pairs to a single pair while offering up to 52W measured at-transmission.

It's the latter Analog Devices has launched gadgets to support in two variants: the earlier Power over Data Line (PoDL) and newer SPoE. Designed with industrial use in mind the company claims its SPoE implementation can offer data and power over a one kilometer (around 0.6 mile) range — representing a big boost over previous versions.

The LTC9111 is designed for installation into devices to-be-powered which can be up to 0.6 miles away from the power supply. (📷: Analog Devices)

The launch covers two parts: the LTC4296-1 a five-port SPoE power-sourcing equipment (PSE) chip to be built into power transmission devices; and the LTC9111 SPoE Power Device (PD) to be built into whatever the PSE is attempting to power. For the maximum 0.6-mile power-and-data performance though they must be combined with the company's ADIN1100 or ADIN1110 industrial Ethernet chips.

The University of Massachusetts in Amherst Mass. (UMass Amherst) located in the Pioneer Valley maintains a sharp focus on security and safety of the campus population of more than 32000 and has been executing a strategic shift from analog to Internet Protocol (IP) video integrated with access control and intrusion detection.

As technology has progressed so has UMass Amherst seeking solutions to effectively leverage current components while migrating to networking technologies and future-proofing surveillance recording solutions with the ability to incorporate the latest high-resolution megapixel cameras.

When the university’s legacy siloed recording system was nearing its end of life several years ago and would no longer be supported it was time to re-evaluate the present with an eye to the future. UMass needed to incorporate existing analog where necessary yet add the highest quality IP video when and where it was needed as the campus continued to grow.

The UMass video strategy is purposeful and planned – with the evaluation of new products focusing on the openness of solutions ease of use and keeping bandwidth from being taxed as the security department and police department pull video locally across the LAN for investigations and forensics.

Eyeing the Future Today

UMass Amherst sits on nearly 1450 acres in western Massachusetts 90 miles from Boston and 175 miles from New York City. The campus provides a rich cultural environment in a rural setting close to several major urban centers. The UMass Amherst Police Department (UMPD) located on campus works in partnership with the staff of the Residential Life Operation Center to ensure that its residence halls are safe places to live. The UMPD is a full-service police department with sworn officers police dispatchers non-sworn professional staff and over 200 student security employees.

The university first piloted video monitoring and recording beginning in 2001 in several buildings with different footprints and configurations to see how it would be managed.

“I was then tasked with installing cameras in the residence halls over a 10-year-period starting in 2003 to 2004” said Jim Meade Residence Hall Security Manager UMPD. ” It was originally a 10-year plan which we accelerated to three years and coincided with the rise of the Boston Red Sox. For excited fans at the college their behavior wasn’t always ideal. By the end of the summer of 2006 we had cameras in all of the 45 residence halls at the time.”

When the process first began in 2004 there was no network. Cameras were analog recorded locally at the building where the devices were located. As networking caught up Meade said campus connectivity was built to support networking on personal computers and desktops.

“We originally built our system in an architecture that wasn’t reliant on an IT network that may or may not be there or backed up and since then we’ve maintained the distributed/decentralized model of recording” Meade said.

“With the distributed model if there’s a power failure or network equipment goes down as long as it’s connected to the UPS it stays up and is operational” said Peter Ferguson Senior Electronics Security Engineer Electronic Security Systems (ESS) A&F Information Technology (AFIT) UMass. “It’s not reliant on things outside of our control to be able to communicate so we can maintain video recording in the event of a network or power failure.”

In 2017 UMass learned its legacy video recording and camera system was going to be retired. With that date looming the University began conducting technology evaluations to assess the best path forward under the guidance of Meade the in-house systems integration department headed by Peter Ferguson and other campus stakeholders.

UMass Wish List

The University of Massachusetts required an open scalable platform to incorporate legacy cameras as well as connect the latest high-definition IP networking cameras. Related: Enhancing Residence Hall Security with Modern Technology

Some of the wish list must-haves included:

Robust Software Development Kit (SDK) and system programming openness

Integration with Active Directory to manage groups and users centrally

Ability to install third-party applications on the VMS recorders to meet compliance with university policies

Centralized monitoring platform for cameras and recorders and

Automatic software and firmware updates

To address these unique challenges the university opted for a video management system that would incorporate all of these elements under an open-platform approach. Open platform provides the required flexibility of higher education organizations in managing multiple buildings by allowing them to integrate different access control systems and cameras all under one view. The scalability of this approach also saves the organization from replacing everything at once and enables the opportunity for future upgrades.

Vetting solutions involved nearly a dozen stakeholders representing various parts of the campus and included creating a spreadsheet with some 75 different criteria about necessary features and functionality and inviting vendors to discuss how their solutions would meet these requirements. Once the vendor was selected the plan was to migrate to the new video management and recording platform deploying the solution in all new installations as a campus security standard.

Intrusion Marries with Video

The video solution at UMass has always focused on security – leveraging access control and intrusion detection to proactively assess alerts and initiate appropriate responses. That main directive hasn’t changed. Open platform introduces additional capabilities in substantiating and verifying door alarms when integrated with an access control event management system.

“The ability to have a ‘marriage’ between a door alarm and associated video was big for us” said Meade. “For example to be able to ascertain why an alert was occurring without having to deploy resources to drive across campus to visually assess the situation was huge. An example is a resident hall located near a bus stop. When it’s cold or rainy the door will go in and out of alarm frequently. What we’ve come to learn from reviewing the video is that people are standing in the doorway to stay warm and dry and repeatedly opening the door to see if the bus is coming. That was one of those situations where the video saved us time and resources in investigation when it was actually a non-alarm.”

System Footprint Grows

With some 51 resident halls and 225 buildings the campus at Amherst continues to grow. Anything built acquired or renovated in the last 10 years has access control and video. The university maintains a decentralized video surveillance recording model but intrusion and video monitoring is centralized and operated by UMPD. Related: Survey: K-12 Schools Prioritizing Physical Security Colleges Lagging Behind

Currently a combination of access control and VMS platforms are working together in an integrated fashion. Alarms from the access control and door systems in the residence halls are enunciated in the Residential Life Operation Center where video pops up on desktops with the associated alarm and alerts recorded locally with no active monitoring. Video exceptions and alarms are viewed monitored and managed through the VMS platform at the police department where operators have the video feed on desktops.

The university currently has some 1685 video cameras deployed on campus with newer installations deploying IP Axis cameras and some locations retaining older analog cameras until upgraded. Other surveillance locations include the Mullins Center 10000-seat arena and an 18000-seat football stadium. In addition to onsite locations UMass has satellite locations in Hadley Mass. as well as an Aviation Research and Training Center in Chicopee with two new building purchases underway.

UMass is looking to the future with its flexible technology footprint: as new video management recording systems come online they are designed to handle both analog cameras as well as accommodate newer IP devices.

The university is designing the system in a manner in which they can easily scale up and add cameras over time without having to incur the cost of a second or third recording server at that individual site. Part of the university’s standard for camera deployment includes ease of use and being able to operate the system without an arduous learning curve for its many different users with various levels of IT and computer expertise.

The future-proofed migration path provides UMass with the framework to move from an analog infrastructure to IP.

The sensing approach described here is based on metalized PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) film and patterned by UV laser ablation and cutting. The material is the same as commonly used for reflective window films and helium party balloons. By controlling the power of a UV laser we can both create sensor patterns ablating metal without damaging the plastic beneath and then cut the film to create highly stretchable interconnects. We fabricated a robotic skin that consists of sensors connected by Kirigami wire traces expanded and embedded in soft and stretchable silicone rubber (Fig. 1a). The skin is then stretched and wrapped around the soft fingers to keep it attached without wrinkles as the fingers flex and extend (Fig. 1b c).

To enhance the sensing ability of a soft robotic hand (Soft Robotics Inc.) a sensor network is embedded in a transparent silicone skin and stretched around it. a Image of the sensor network on a soft robotic finger. b c Network accommodates large bending deflections as shown in Supplementary Movie 1 and 2. d Magnified view of a thermal sensing unit (130 μm wide traces × 330 mm trace length) and stretchable interconnects (40–250 μm wide traces × 30 mm trace length) (e). Detail of interconnects embedded in a silicone skin. Full size image

The example network shown in Fig. 1a consists of 4 temperature sensors and 4 proximity sensors with interconnects that provide 8 signals and 2 ground wires routed to the backs of the fingers. The sensors occupy discrete pads (Fig. 1d) that are flexible but not locally stretchable (maximum strain is 0.03 with impedance change of <0.01% for 60 cyclic tests.). Stretching occurs in the serpentine interconnects (Fig. 1e) which expand without substantially affecting sensor readings. The serpentine connectors can contain multiple conductive traces which is useful for connecting multiple sensors to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

Material and methods

Ultraviolet lasers are a popular choice for cutting and patterning thin films of many materials including plastics metals and composites34. We use a diode UV laser (2.66 W 354.7 nm DPSS Laser Inc.) for creating the sensors and cutting the film in a single setting (Fig. 2a). For the network reported here we start with readily available sheets of 50 μm thick clear PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) film with 50 nm thick reflective aluminum coating. We performed a parametric study over a range of laser settings to meet the following objectives: make traces as thin as possible while also ensuring complete removal of metal from gaps between traces and preventing damage to the underlying film. We obtained the best patterning results with the following settings: a single pass at 100% of the rated power of 2.66 W with a scan rate of 2000 mm s−1 and a frequency of 60 kHz. Under these conditions the minimum trace width is 30 μm and the minimum gap width between traces is 20 μm. For different metals (e.g. copper) and film thicknesses these settings and dimensions may change.

Heavy black bars show a 200 μm length scale. c Diagrams and images showing Kirigami interconnect stretching. d Electrical and (e) mechanical properties of stretchable interconnects with different wire widths (traces fill the entire film width). Full size image

After patterning we cut the film to create a Kirigami structure. After testing various cutting parameters to achieve clean cutting without carbonized edges that could produce shorting we obtained the best results with the following settings: 7 times pass at 100% of the rated power of 2.66 W with a scan rate of 150 mm s−1 and frequency of 30 kHz. For different plastics (e.g. polyimide) and film thicknesses these settings will change. With these settings it is possible to cut strips as thin as 50 μm (removal width of 50 μm) with aluminum traces as thin as 30 μm wide (removal width of 20 μm). Figure 2b shows four sequential segments of a typical interconnect before expansion. The segments are 350 μm wide and separated by 50 μm gaps that cut through the PET layer to create parallel strips. On each strip are three parallel conductive traces with 20 μm gaps of ablated aluminum.

The fabrication process for creating the sensor network is fast and inexpensive. The film cost is less than $2 (USD) per square meter and it takes about 3 min to fabricate 50 × 50 mm of sensing devices and interconnects in an unexpanded configuration. Adding a horizontal stage or feeding rollers to the laser would allow larger areas to be fabricated in a single setup.

Interconnects

Figure 2c shows schematically how the interconnects stretch accompanied by images of interconnects stretched 30x and 70x. We note that the UV laser beam has a circular focal pattern that makes rounded edges when cutting serpentine patterns; this is beneficial for stress distribution.

For simplicity we create sensors and interconnects in a tiled pattern with 10 × 10 mm regions interspersed with 10 × 10 mm interconnects. Thus for a given 10 × 10 mm initial area of film the design of the interconnect involves a tradeoff (Fig. 2d). In essence patterns for thin traces (50 μm wide interconnect with 50 μm wide conductive trace) have higher resistance but can also stretch further before becoming taut at which point the resistance starts to change. The trace resistance is given by

$$R = \frac{\rho }{A}$$ (1)

Initial resistances of the 50 150 250 350 and 450 μm traces are 14.4 3.4 1.3 0.85 and 0.51 kΩ (standard deviation of ±2 to 10%) respectively. The thinnest trace also shows the least change in resistance for stretching up to 70x because it undergoes the least material strain at the corners as the interconnect expands and straightens (see Fig. 2c). For the 50 μm traces the change in resistance is approximately 1% when the interconnect is stretched 70x; less than 17% for 80x of stretch. The resistance changes of the 150 250 350 and 450 μm wide Kirigami interconnects remain below 1% at strains of 3500% 2000% 1600% and 1400% respectively.

Figure 2e shows the force/extension behavior of the interconnects during stretching. All the interconnect patterns have relatively low stiffness (approximately 0.1 N per 0.4 m) until they become taut.

Proximity sensor

The proximity sensor is made by patterning two interdigitated comb electrodes (Fig. 3a). The fringe field generated between electrodes changes as a conductive object (e.g. a human finger or metal rod) approaches the sensor. The range and resolution of the sensor are tunable by the width and length of the pattern35:

$$\frac{c}{L} = \varepsilon \left[ {\frac{t}{h} + \frac{{\pi \left( {1 - 0.0543 \cdot \frac{W}{{2h}}} \right)}}{{\ln \left( {1 + \frac{{2h}}{W} + \sqrt {\frac{{2h}}{W}\left( {\frac{{2h}}{W} + 2} \right)} } \right)}} + 1.47} \right]$$ (2)

where C is fringe capacitance and ε is the dielectric constant. The width (W) of the electrode is adjustable the thickness (t) is 50 nm and the gap (h) is 20 μm set by manufacturing limitations. If the comb electrodes are thinner and denser in designated sensor areas a larger initial capacitance is obtained which increases sensitivity (Fig. 3b). For the sensor network a 130 μm wide comb pattern is chosen since it has less than 10% variation in line width due to manufacturing tolerances. Finite element simulation of the fringe capacitance for approaching objects was conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics® v. 5.4. and showed that a 130 μm wide trace pattern with 20 μm gaps should have an initial capacitance of 1.85 pF for an object that is 3 mm distant. As the object draws closer the capacitance increases by approximately 2 pF as the gap approaches zero.

Fig. 3: Characteristics of proximity and temperature sensors. Theoretical solutions computed in COMSOL. a The proximity sensor is made of interdigitated comb patterns of aluminum on PET film. b Sensing resolution and range are tunable by initial capacitance which depends on the number and dimensions of the traces; results match numerical simulations in COMSOL. c Distance from an approaching object (<3 mm) is measured by the change of fringing capacitance. d The temperature sensor is made of a meandering pattern with a 60000:1 length: width ratio. e Temperature sensing resolution and range vary with initial resistance that depends on trace width and length; results match the theoretical calculation. f Temperature from 0 to 60 °C is measured by resistance which changes approximately linearly with temperature. Full size image

Temperature sensor

The temperature sensor is made by patterning a meandering trace (Fig. 3d). Since aluminum is a thermoresistive metal its resistance increases with temperature:

$$R = R_0\left[ {1 + \alpha \left( {T - T_0} \right)} \right]$$ (3)

where α is the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the material used as the electrode R 0 is the initial resistance at the reference temperature and R is the resistance at temperature T. Range and resolution of the sensor are tunable by the width (W) and length (L) of the pattern:

$$\frac{{{\rm{d}}R}}{{{\rm{d}}T}}\sim \alpha \rho \frac{L}{{Wt}}$$ (4)

Sensors with a thinner and denser pattern have a larger initial resistance and higher sensitivity as seen in Fig. 3e; theoretical and empirical results match within 7%. For the sensor network a 130 μm wide meandering wire pattern is chosen from theoretical analysis. Given the resistance and change in resistance a 130 μm wide with a 20 μm gap meandering electrode can detect 0.1 °C. When the fabricated sensor is placed in an oven the resistance of 130 μm wide trace increases almost linearly with temperature over a range from 0 to 60 °C (Fig. 3f). Thus there is approximately 600 Ω resistance difference over 0 to 60 °C. Fitting a curve defined by Eq. (3) to the data results in a measured TCR of 3.14 × 10−3 which is comparable to the reported TCR of aluminum (3.9 × 10−3)36; some difference is expected given the very thin aluminum layer on PET film.

Design and integration of a sensor network

Figure 4 shows networks of temperature and temperature and proximity sensors mounted on robotic fingertips (Soft Robotics Inc.). The interconnects are routed to the back of the hand and connected using conductive silver epoxy (Chemtronics CW2400) to wires and an analog to digital converter. The 5 × 10 mm sensors are mounted using soft 1 mm thick VHB tape (3 M) to ridges on the insides of the fingers where contact generally occurs. These ridges undergo somewhat less strain than other parts of the fingers. Nonetheless it is of interest to know whether the temperature sensors which are also strain sensitive are affected by opening and closing the fingers. Figures 4c d show that the sensor readings change little (0.024% and 0.026%. respectively) over two successive opening and closing cycles. Supplementary Fig. 1 in the supplementary material shows that these changes remain constant over 30 opening and closing cycles.

Interconnects are as in (a). c d Measured resistance change is small when closing and opening the fingers. Full size image

Application—grasping warm and cool objects

Figure 5 shows how the contact sensors respond while acquiring grasping and moving cool and warm aluminum water bottles. The proximity sensor is used to detect an object approaching without touching it thereby avoiding abrasion or damage to the object. Approaching distance between a soft robot and an object supports to control the soft robotic actuation. When the proximity sensing indicates the contact of the soft gripper it stops grasping and stays the position while temperature sensors measure the temperature. During the approach the eight sensors all show a reading of (24.9 °C). The pair T2 and T6 are closest to the maximum bottle surface and initially have the largest contact areas so they respond quickly. Subsequently as the fingers continue to close the other sensors that are in contact (T3 T7) approach the same temperature while the proximal sensors (T4 T8) show a small increase in temperature. As a result the measured temperature was 5.48 °C as compared to the temperature (5.5 °C) measured with a thermometer immersed in the water. The results with a hot water bottle are similar. The measured temperature with the gripper is 55.2 °C while the actual temperature is 55.7 °C.

Fig. 5: Contact temperature sensing for cool and warm objects. (a) Images of (i) approaching (ii) touching (iii) grasping and (iv) carrying a cool (5.5 °C) aluminum bottle filled with water. Diagrams (ii) and (iii) show which sensors are in contact for the corresponding phases. (c) shows the corresponding sensor readings. (b d) show the same sequence as (a c) but with a hot water bottle (55.7 °C). Full size image

Figure 6 illustrates the degree of repeatability to be expected for contact temperature and proximity sensors over multiple actuation cycles. The figures show the results as the finger contacts and conforms six times to a glass jar filled with warm water. While the finger contacts the jar the strain on the robotic finger surface is 4.3% (71% of the maximum strain). To process data and report a temperature measurement we converted measured resistance to temperature by using Eq. (3). The temperature of the object is provided by the temperature from a contact which could be provided by proximity sensors on the network. Sensors P1 and P2 and corresponding temperature sensors T1 and T2 make contact with the jar and therefore show a much larger response than the other sensors. The measured temperature from the network is 38 °C which is close to the water temperature 39 °C.

The previous results suggest an application involving prepared food handling. To examine this application further we use the sensor network to grasp a warm or cool burrito wrapped in foil. In this application the proximity sensors are useful to ensure firm contact without excessive pressure and the temperature sensors are useful to monitor the temperature. Because the burrito is wrapped in foil an optical thermometer does not give a reliable temperature reading. Infrared (IR) thermometry has routinely been used in robotics to detect the temperature of a target object37. However IR thermometer detection is dependent on the emissivity of the material38; for example the emissivity is 1.2 for aluminum and only 0.1 for water. As shown in Supplementary Movie 3 the temperatures measured by an IR thermometer are not reliable since the measured temperatures at the outer and inner surfaces of the burrito are different. Direct contact temperature sensing can be a more reliable alternative in such applications.

Figure 7 shows the results of the burrito-handling task. The contact is primarily at the distal sensors P1 and to a lesser extent P2. As the first sensors make contact we stop increasing the pressure to avoid crushing the burrito; hence the proximity signals remain constant. The temperature sensors show a similar trend. The measured temperature is 38.6 °C which is close to the burrito temperature 39.1 °C.

Fig. 7: Food handling demonstration using proximity and temperature sensing. a Images from left to right show the finger approaching contacting conforming to and releasing from a foil-wrapped burrito. Plots (b c) show the corresponding proximity and temperature readings. The contact is primarily at P1 and T1 with partial contact at P2 and T2. After initial contact is detected the pressure is held constant. Robotic actuation and sensing are done simultaneously. The sequence is shown in Supplementary Movie 3. Full size image

Application for human–robot interaction

The combination of proximity and temperature sensing is particularly useful for soft robot–human contact allowing the robot to make gentle contact and allowing it to distinguish between living and nonliving surfaces or even to check for an elevated temperature. As a demonstration Fig. 8 and Supplementary Movie 4 presents results for contacting the forehead of a doll. The forehead has been warmed to a temperature of 37.5 °C measured by an IR thermometer. In this demonstration the thermal contact sensors estimate the temperature as 36.8 °C (Fig. 8b). In this demonstration proximity sensors are again used to control the finger to maintain a constant light pressure of approximately 1kPa after initial contact is detected."

Everything you need to know,"The Aon Risk Reward Challenge is a season-long competition that stretches across the PGA as well as LPGA Tour. The challenge runs across regular PGA and LPGA tour events with CBS Sports and Golf Channel as its official broadcast partners. It's a unique challenge that takes into consideration the two best scores on every designated hole from every participating event a player competes in.

Expand Tweet

Inaugurated in 2019 the event gets its name from a leading global financial services company named Aon headquartered in the UK. The company focuses on providing health retirement and risk solutions for its customers. Along with golf the company has been associated with other sports like being the game shirt sponsor for Manchester United for several years.

Aon Risk Reward Challenge format

At each PGA and LPGA Tour event Aon and the tour select a hole to be the risk-reward challenge hole for the week. For each tournament a player's two best scores on that week's decided hole will count towards the season-long score. This means that players who make a cut in a particular tournament have a higher chance of improving their score on the risk-reward hole as compared to players who do not make the cut.

At the end of the season each player's top 40 holes measured against their pars will count towards their total score for the risk-reward challenge. To be eligible for the challenge a player must play a minimum of 40 rounds at tournaments designated as the Aon Risk Reward Challenge.

The golfer with the lowest average score to par will win the $1 million prize.

One thing that sets apart the risk reward challenge from other tournaments is the equality in payments it offers to both male and female winners.

Pixelligent raised $38 million

Pixelligent a nanotechnology firm that produces materials used in augmented reality displays and sensors recently raised $38 million in IP-backed financing from a funding vehicle by MVolution Partners LLC. These funds brings the total raised this round of funding to $45 million with the other $7 million coming from existing investors.

The company is known for the PixClearProcess which synthesizes materials at the nano-level as opposed to breaking down larger materials into nano-sized materials. It manufactures all of its materials in Baltimore and has 25 tons of capacity. Current CEO Craig Bandes took control of the company in 2009 as the chief restructuring officer appointed by a bankruptcy judge. In that time Pixelligent raised $100 million to get to its current place in the market.

Bandes accredited the new funds raised to its PixClearProcess nearly 90 patents and “dozens”of trade secrets.

“The funding will help us support our customers as we bring numerous mass-production applications to market in 2023 and beyond” he said in a statement.

IP-backed financing is a relatively new funding structure that Bandes has seen used only starting within the last 18 months or so and by larger companies with significant knowhow and intellectual property. The loans process was facilitated by Aon which had an expert team that valued Pixelligent’s IP portfolio and brought in MVolution Partners as the provider of funds Bandes told Technical.ly.

“Innovation is a critical ingredient for the growth economy but intellectual property is its foundation” said Lewis Lee CEO of Aon’s Intellectual Property Solutions in a statement. “Aon is working with IP-rich companies like Pixelligent to help leverage the value of their intangible assets.”

In September Holabird Business Park-based Pixelligent also received a $1.9 million grant from the US Department of Energy to support commercialization of its lubricant nanotechnology.

“Thankfully we raised enough that we don’t need to think about fundraising for the foreseeable future” Bandes told Technical.ly.

Galen Robotics raised $15 million

Surgical robotics company Galen Robotics recently closed a Series A with an oversubscribed $15 million investment from Ambix Healthcare Partners.

Galen Robotics headquartered at 1100 Wicomico announced that the funds have already supported building the final robot prototype and its submission to the FDA. Funds will also be used for building sales engineering product development and consumer education (“surgical training programs”).

The company’s surgical robot model has received attention for its technological innovations as well as for its trademarked “digital surgery-as-a-service” business model in which hospitals pay per use and commit to using the device a minimum number of times. Galen Robotics claims to be the first surgical robotics company to launch this sort of pay-per-use model.

According to President and CEO Brian Lichorowic this model shifts the focus to medical need over getting one’s money’s worth from purchasing a machine and democratizes access to advanced technology for healthcare providers.

Earlier this year Galen Robotics made headlines for securing Moderna cofounder Robert Langer on its board of directors. Langer whom Lichorowic describes as a “legend” has been involved in founding over 40 biotech companies and holds over 1300 patents. Langer has praised Galen Robotics’s product telling The Baltimore Sun: “I thought it was really cool and I think it could help a lot of people. They’re bringing robotic surgery into areas that could make a huge impact.”

Galen Robotics’ research began at John Hopkins University although the company itself was based in Silicon Valley until 2019 when it was attracted back to Maryland with $9 million worth of incentives.

Employers are allowing employees to work beyond the retirement age on mutual agreement and providing additional support around retirement options and financial wellbeing.

Pandemic the emigration wave and an ageing population have all intensified the talent crunch in Hong Kong. However a silver lining has seemingly been found among older employees in the workforce according to a recent study by Aon.

Aon’s 2022 Older Age Workforce Study revealed that 44% of surveyed employers in Hong Kong see an increased business need to retain older employees in the workforce and expect this to be a key focus over the next five years.

Since there is no statutory retirement age in Hong Kong more than half (57%) of employers allow employees to work beyond retirement age on mutual agreement.

Among employers that have increased or are considering increasing the retirement age the majority (56%) cited the need to retain employees’ experience in their Hong Kong workforce and are monitoring public sector retirement age trends.

Ashley Palmer Regional Managing Partner and Head of Wealth Solutions Asia Pacific at Aon believed that organisations need to be more proactive in retaining and engaging the talent they already have and showing their care for more experienced talent by investing in specifically designed employee benefits.

“Employers with an effective older workforce strategy are able to drive agile succession planning retain key skills and provide a soft-exit through flexible retirement options” he said. “These are all critical to further accelerating talent pipelines and organisational people objectives such as to increase diversity and gender representation in leadership roles.”

In this sense the survey found that one-third (34%) of Hong Kong employers are providing employees with additional support around retirement options and financial wellbeing. In addition 17% of employers demonstrate their appreciation to retiring employees by providing an ex gratia “golden handshake” which can include a cash bonus gold gift coupons and celebratory meals.

Stella Ho Head of Wealth Solutions Hong Kong at Aon suggested employers should increase focus on communication and ensure sufficient working/retirement flexibilities within competitive employee benefits and retirement practices to optimise their older talent.

“Business leaders typically underestimate employees’ need for wellbeing support especially for retirement and financial wellbeing” she highlighted.

“Financial stress is not based on income or age but is closely linked to mental health and in times of increasing costs of living supporting employees to make better financial decisions has never been more important to drive workforce resilience and productivity.”

The revelation was made by Dr. Grace Ssekakubo the Chairman Board of Directors UTCL the newly formed government-owned telecom on Friday November 18th 2022 while taking over the assets from UTL Administration.

UTL was owned by the governments of Libya and Uganda with 69% and 31% shares respectively.

UTCL was incorporated on 8th April 2021 and on 23rd February 2022 entered into an Asset Sale and Purchase Agreement to buy the assets and not debts and or liabilities of Uganda Telecom.

Now the company is a fully-government of Uganda owned with 60% owned by the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) and 40% by the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance (MolCT&NG)

“As a Board we are positive that ours will be a service that not only makes Ugandans happy but one that elates them a service that not only satisfies them but one that leaves them ecstatic” remarked Dr. Ssekakubo.

He noted that the Board that he heads was appointed 3 months ago and it has worked relentlessly to put UTCL in a position to be able to receive the Assets and Business of UTL and ensure business continuity.

“I am privileged to lead this team of patriotic and dedicated Ugandans with a special assignment to deliver to Ugandans.”

“This Board knows what Uganda needs because we are the Uganda. We know what the public wants because we are part of the public. Uganda needs affordable and reliable access to secure telecom and related services across the country. The public wants value for money” he added.

Mr. Chairman noted that as a company they will focus on superior internet of up to 5G+ grade bespoke digital services and safe mobile money services.

“Our service will be a safe space a space you can trust – your space.”

Basing on the recent World Bank report that for every 10 percentage-point increase in high-speed Internet connections there is an increase in the economic growth of 1.3 percentage points. Mr. Chairman pledged world-class internet service provision.

On how the company is ready to face the dominance in the sector Dr. Ssekakubo said “Well the answer lies in the market realities today – in latest market performance report from the UCC 232000 new broadband subscriptions were recorded between April-June 2022 bringing the total broadband connections in Uganda to 23.7 million. In a year-on-year comparison the 12 months ended June 2022 recorded 1.9 million new broadband subscriptions – an 8% year-on-year growth in broadband subscriptions. The 23.7 million broadband subscriptions translate into a broadband penetration of 55 internet connections for every 100 Ugandans. The broadband market is viable and growing.”

The company he says will in the coming months work on various initiatives including; Investing in the latest technology-5G+ Attracting the best talent in the market and upskilling the internal staff they have inherited.

Dr. Ssekakubo an ICT specialist and Head of Centetech the ICT arm of Centenary Group will serve with other Board Directors including Mr. Jimmy Adiga the former CEO of BRAC Microfinance Mr Tom Sekakuto a former technician with Uganda Posts and Telecommunications Corporation Ms Maximilia Byenkya a corporate lawyer Ms Agnes Ojambo – an Auditor Ramathan Ggoobi the Permanent Secretary and Secretary to the Treasury (PSST) as well as Ms. Aminah Zawedde the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance.

Ms. Ruth Sebatindira who was appointed the Administrator of Uganda Telecom by the High Court on 2nd January 2020 revealed that during administration creditors were stopped from taking action against a company such as winding it up and forcing it into compulsory liquidation.

This is known as the moratorium whose purpose is to give the company that is in financial difficulty a breathing space to attempt to rescue it as a going concern and restructure so that it can be returned to profitability.

She however noted that the Administrator was challenged with a responsibility to the commercial community to not continue trading while making losses.

“For various reasons the revenues generated by the company could no longer support continued trading under Administration.”

Today she notes that the company has a client base majorly Ministries Departments and Agencies and a 9.13% shareholding in West Indian Ocean Cable Corporation (WIOCC).

“This has enabled UTL to buy internet at fairly favorable prices and be able to sell competitively in the market. About 75% of UTL’s revenues come from Internet Service Provision (ISP) services” she noted.

According to Ms. Sebatindira the company’s debt is estimated at UGX Trillion Assets valued at UGX 250 billion with an average gross revenue of UGX 3 Billion per month average operating expenses of UGX 4.5 Billion per month average monthly deficit of UGX1.5 Billion and that 317 sites/masts countrywide out of 472 are non-profitable.

The Deal

On 23 February 2022 the Administrator executed an Asset Sale and Purchase Agreement (APA) with the Uganda Telecommunications Corporation (UTCL) at a Consideration of UGX 256892142642 and USD 15643151. These sums are to be applied towards some of the liabilities namely: the Trade Development Bank loan WIOCC investment pension (Uganda Communications Employees Contributory Pension Scheme (UCECPS) & NSSF) and Administration debts. The last payment under the APA is expected by June 2023 Payment of pre-Administration debts is in accordance with the ranking provided under the Insolvency laws

Status of the Administration

The Administration has been extended by Court for only 8 months with effect from 2nd November 2022 until June 2023 for only residual matters and to receive amounts that remain unpaid under the Asset Sale and Purchase Agreement. Once all sums have been paid in accordance with the APA the Administrator will report to Court and seek that the Administration be terminated. The petition for winding up of UTL has to be determined.

Creditors Report

Verification of Creditors was carried out and a Creditors report has been sent to all Creditors. Creditors should address their concerns with the Administrator

Status of Employees

Effective 30th November all employees shall cease to be employees of Uganda Telecom in Administration. They will all be employed by UTCL on fresh terms with effect on 1 December 2022.

Following this sentiment Apple is the largest stock holding that Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway has in its portfolio.

That's high praise from a well known and highly successful investor but the tech giant's stock has been declining this year. While that might worry some investors now could actually be an opportune time to add it to your portfolio. After all the business's fundamentals are solid and impressive despite the adversity in the economy right now. Here are four charts that help illustrate why this is a fantastic stock for investors to buy and hold.

1. Revenue has continued to grow amid inflation

One thing that never ceases to amaze me over the years is that despite its products not being cheap or even changing all that much consumers still are continually eager to buy Apple's iPhones and other products. The company's top line has generated impressive growth even now with inflation testing consumers' budgets.

This resilience in the business demonstrates the brand loyalty the company enjoys and why it could continue to do well next year even if inflation doesn't go away. If not for the impact of foreign exchange the company's growth rate last quarter (for the period ending Sept. 24) would have been in the double digits.

Some analysts are worried that Apple's sales will decline next year especially with production issues in China impacting iPhone shipments. And while that could happen based on Apple's track record I wouldn't expect to see a huge drop in revenue. It's still likely to do better than other tech companies.

2. Free cash flow has been rising in recent years

Investors should always focus on free cash flow. That can tell investors how safe a dividend is and how likely it is that a company can afford to buy back shares (which has a bullish impact on the stock) or pursue growth opportunities. In Apple's case free cash flow has been stellar.

3. High profit margin gives the company flexibility

Thanks to its high-priced products Apple also rakes in some terrific profits with its net margin normally at 20% or better of revenue.

Margins like these give the company the flexibility to battle inflation and absorb the impact of higher costs without necessarily passing that off to customers in the way of price increases.

4. Its earnings multiple is at a more reasonable valuation

Since the start of the year shares of Apple have fallen 17% which is about in line with the S&P 500's performance. Investors may want to consider buying the stock on the dip because with respect to earnings Apple is trading right around its five-year average which may be a deal for this top growth stock.

Apple's stock isn't trading at a huge discount by any means. But at the same time investors could be waiting a long time if they expect a strong business like Apple's to fall much lower than where it is. A lower valuation could entice more investors to buy shares of Apple.

Apple is a safe stock to park your money in right now

A business with a strong cash position and brand loyalty like Apple's makes for a no-brainer type of investment. Although its yield of 0.6% isn't significant between the buybacks and continued new iPhones growth in Apple+ and the entire Apple ecosystem there are plenty of reasons to be bullish on the company's future. Its fundamentals are sound and with a loyal fanbase Apple is a safe stock to buy and hold for years.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)

[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]

Applied Materials Inc. the biggest maker of chip manufacturing equipment gave a better-than-feared sales forecast for the current quarter as supply chain improvements help offset an economic slowdown.

Fiscal first-quarter sales will be roughly $6.7 billion up from a year earlier the company said in a statement Nov. 17. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $6.34 billion.

The outlook brings fresh optimism that Applied Materials can weather a tumultuous stretch for the chip industry. The company like its peers is facing twin headwinds: a collapse in orders for some types of chips and an escalating standoff between China and the U.S. Large customers such as Micron Technology Inc. and Intel Corp. have said they will cut budgets to cope with weaker demand.

On the China front Applied Materials expects to lose as much as $2.5 billion in fiscal 2023 revenue due to new trade restrictions. If the U.S. government expedites licenses needed to sell in China the impact could be $1.5 billion to $2 billion the company said.

The outlook was reassuring enough to send Applied Materials shares up more than 2% in extended trading Nov. 17. They’d earlier closed at $104.45 leaving them down 34% in 2022.

CEO Gary Dickerson expressed confidence that Applied Materials could outperform the broader industry and said that untangling supply snags will help it fill more orders. Though the economic environment is worsening chipmakers are still spending money on new technology that can help them keep up with competitors he said.

“That race is relentless for our customers” he said.

Fourth-quarter profit was $2.03 a share excluding some items. Sales rose 10% to $6.75 billion in the period marking the 12th straight quarterly expansion. Analysts predicted a profit of $1.68 a share and revenue of $6.38 billion.

In October Applied Materials slashed its forecast for the fourth quarter warning that the new export regulations would reduce sales by about $400 million. The Santa Clara Calif.-based company projected revenue of about $6.4 billion and said the rules would continue to weigh on its financial performance in the fiscal first quarter ending in January.

The Biden White House announced the latest export curbs Oct. 7 part of a campaign to halt China’s ability to develop the most advanced chips and equip its military. Applied Materials and a handful of companies — U.S. peers KLA Corp. and Lam Research Corp. the Netherlands’ ASML NV and Japan’s Tokyo Electron Ltd. — totally dominate the market for machines needed to make semiconductors. In addition to imposing rules on U.S. companies the administration is negotiating with European and Japanese governments to get them to do the same with their businesses.

The restrictions come at a tough time for the industry. After shortages during the pandemic chipmakers had rushed to build new production. But now companies are looking to trim their budgets. The demand for PC-related chips has fallen as customers shun big-ticket purchases and that’s weighed on chip stocks. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index a key benchmark has dropped 31% this year.

Companies such as Applied Materials and Intel can’t easily walk away from China which is the biggest single market for their products and part of a global supply chain for electronics.

Like other tech companies Applied Materials also is reining in job growth. The company is limiting hiring to “strategic positions” it said Nov. 17.

Pacific Time. Please stay tuned for an invitation to join our presenter Keith Wells who is group vice president and general manager of our imaging and process control group. And with that introduction I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you Mike. Applied Materials delivered a strong finish to our fiscal year with record quarterly performance. Throughout 2022 the company has demonstrated solid execution while navigating COVID-related restrictions supply chain shortages in a challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. I would like to recognize the hard work and commitment of our global team and our suppliers who are doing everything possible to meet our customers' needs.

As this is our year-end call I'll begin my prepared remarks with a quick review of our performance and progress over the past 12 months. I'll then give our latest outlook for 2023 before describing our longer-term growth thesis for the industry and Applied. After that Brice will provide more color on our financial performance and key areas of operational focus. Like many others in the technology sector our performance and priorities in 2022 have been shaped by an unprecedented set of challenges.

Our top priority has been mitigating supply chain constraints that prevented us from fully meeting customer demand. In Q4 we made incremental progress and we expect to continue closing supply gaps over the next few quarters. As well as finding creative short-term solutions our team has been addressing root causes and building a more resilient scalable supply chain and stronger strategic relationships with our suppliers. In addition we are strengthening our own manufacturing logistics and supply chain management.

While I'm pleased with the recent improvements in supply chain performance we are still supply chain limited across a number of key product lines and our backlog grew in Q4. The biggest supply constraints are in our metal deposition business where customer demand is very strong. This is our largest business unit and where we have highly differentiated solutions for advanced foundry-logic and DRAM. The market for these products which enable next-generation wiring is expanding considerably.

In addition to supply shortages we're also navigating a difficult geopolitical environment as reflected in the new export control regulations enacted by the U.S. government on October 7. These new rules are complex and cover a broad range of semiconductor technology that includes wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services. We have taken all the necessary actions to comply with these new rules including suspending shipments and support where required.

We estimate that the unmitigated impact to our fiscal 2023 revenues could be up to $2.5 billion. We believe the actual impact can be reduced to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This will depend in part on how quickly the government provides licenses and approvals as well as how impacted companies refocus their investments. We are also mindful of the macroeconomic headwinds including inflation and softening consumer demand.

To offset the inflationary cost increases we are facing we are driving multiple initiatives that include reengineering our products and implementing price adjustments. While it's too early to forecast 2023 with any precision I can describe what we're currently seeing in the market and hearing from our customers. Starting with memory spending is expected to be down year on year as weakness in consumer electronics and PCs prompts some customers to defer capacity additions. In leading-edge foundry-logic demand looks strong with customers racing for leadership and driving major technology inflections that determine their relative competitive positions.

In ICAPS chips for the IoT communications auto power and sensor markets demand is mixed. Consumer-driven markets are clearly softer while the automotive industrial and power markets remain robust. Those investments are underpinned by large inflections including the transition to electric vehicles accelerated adoption of industrial automation and growing demand for renewable energy solutions especially in Europe. While all of this adds up to an expected pullback in overall wafer fab equipment spending next year we believe that Applied's business will be more resilient than the underlying market for three key reasons: First we have a significant backlog the highest in our history measured on both an absolute and percentage of revenue basis; second demand for some of our most differentiated product lines where we have uniquely enabling technology remains much higher than our capacity to fulfill that demand; and third our service business is positioned for steady growth with an increasingly large portion of this business being converted to subscriptions.

Over the past 12 months our installed base of systems grew 8% and the number of tools under comprehensive long-term service contracts grew 16%. The renewal rate for these agreements is well over 90% which demonstrates the value customers see in our subscription services. Looking further ahead our long-term growth thesis for the industry and Applied Materials has not changed. Semiconductors are the foundation of digital transformation that will touch almost every sector of the economy over the coming years.

This puts the semiconductor industry on a path to a $1 trillion market by the end of the decade. And while every year will not be an up year the overall trajectory is clear. We also like where Applied Materials plays within the ecosystem. As technology complexity is increasing we expect equipment intensity to remain at today's levels or rise further.

This means wafer fab equipment is likely to grow faster than the overall semiconductor market. Within equipment spending major technology inflections are enabled by materials engineering shifting more dollars to Applied's available markets over time. We think about the industry's future road map in terms of power performance area cost and time to market. The PPACt playbook has five pillars: new architectures new 3D structures new materials new ways to shrink and advanced packaging with each pillar made up of multiple technology inflections.

For example new 3D structures like gate-all-around transistors and backside power distribution networks are materials engineering-enabled inflections that grow Applied's total available market. As I referenced earlier wiring is a key bottleneck for chip performance and power at advanced nodes. And this is driving significant innovation in new materials. Between the seven- and three-nanometer node contact metallization steps are growing more than 50% and our total available market is expanding almost 80%.

For interconnect layers process steps are being added even faster and we expect our revenue opportunity to approximately triple through these node transitions. Advanced packaging represents a new era for integrated circuit design that opens major new vectors of innovation for chip designers. Advanced packaging is also enabled by new materials engineering solutions. Although the industry is still in the early stages of adoption we have already grown our packaging equipment business to nearly $1 billion.

Our process diagnostics and controls business also has broad exposure to these inflections and delivered significant growth in 2022. Our progress and opportunities in e-beam will be the focus of our December technology briefing. Given our positive long-term view of the semiconductor market the outsized opportunities for Applied Materials within the market and favorable global government incentives we are making investments in R&D and infrastructure to support industry growth and position the company for future success. We will provide more details about our specific plans in the coming months.

At the same time with the current macroeconomic conditions we are carefully managing discretionary spending and limiting hiring to only strategic positions. Before I hand the call over to Brice I'll quickly summarize. Applied Materials ended the year strong with record performance. In the past quarter we made incremental progress overcoming the supply challenges that have constrained our performance in fiscal 2022.

However there is still work to do and our backlog continues to grow. We expect 2023 to be a down year for wafer fab equipment spending but we believe that Applied's business will be more resilient thanks to our large backlog growing service business and strong customer demand for our leadership products that enable key technology inflections. Longer-term secular trends create opportunities for Applied to outgrow the semiconductor market by enabling the PPACt roadmap with our differentiated portfolio of materials engineering solutions. We are making strategic investments for the future while slowing spending growth in the near term.

Now I'll hand over to Brice.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you Gary. I'd like to start by thanking our team and our supply chain partners for helping to further increase our output for our customers. On today's call I'll summarize our results for the fiscal year and Q4 as well as provide our guidance for Q1. I'll also discuss the impact of recent U.S.

export regulations on our revenue and gross margin. Before going into the results I'd like to make three points. First despite a weaker customer demand outlook we generated strong orders in Q4 and ended the year with record backlog particularly in some of our leadership product areas. Combined with the resiliency of our AGS business the strong backlog puts us in a good position to offset some of the market weakness expected next year.

Second we have not changed our view of a $1 trillion semiconductor market by 2030 with a high single-digit CAGR for semiconductors and similar or faster growth for equipment due to added process complexity. We grew our headcount in R&D spending significantly in 2022 to develop new leadership products and further expand our broad portfolio. While we are slowing our spending growth in the current environment we remain committed to research and development enabling critical inflections that support our customers' road maps. And third we returned nearly $7 billion to shareholders this past year including buybacks equivalent to 6% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the period.

With record demand and financial results in 2022 a strong growth opportunity through 2030 and our broad and unique portfolio of systems and services we're confident in our financial position and our future. Next I'll summarize our fiscal year results. Although supply chain constraints impacted our output all year we delivered record annual revenue and EPS. On a year-over-year basis revenue increased nearly 12% to $25.8 billion.

Non-GAAP gross margin decreased by around 90 basis points to 46.6%. Non-GAAP operating profit grew by over 7% to $7.86 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin decreased by 120 basis points to 30.5%. And non-GAAP EPS increased nearly 13% to $7.70.

We generated about $5.4 billion in operating cash flow this past year and over $4.6 billion in free cash flow. We returned 151% of free cash flow to shareholders including $873 million in dividends and $6.1 billion in share repurchases. Our cash returns for the past three years were equivalent to over 100% of free cash flow. In the year demand for our products and services was very strong with record annual bookings in semi systems and AGS.

On a year-over-year basis our total ending backlog increased 62% to $19 billion. Our semi systems backlog increased 90% to nearly $12.7 billion. We expect to reduce our semi systems backlog as supply chain performance improves. Our AGS backlog increased 30% to over $5.6 billion.

The strong AGS backlog reflects a large increase in long-term service agreements which gives us confidence in the continued growth of this business. Moving to our Q4 results. We delivered record quarterly net sales of nearly $6.75 billion and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.03. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially to 46% and non-GAAP opex grew 3.5% sequentially to nearly $1.1 billion with most of the increase in R&D.

Turning to the segments. Semi systems revenue grew more than 6% sequentially to $5.04 billion. Segment non-GAAP operating margin increased 80 basis points sequentially to 36.9%. AGS revenue was flat quarter over quarter at $1.42 billion.

Segment non-GAAP operating margin declined to 28.3%. AGS key performance indicators continue to be positive with strong year-over-year growth in installed base systems service intensity and subscription agreements. As a result AGS continues to grow faster than the pace needed to achieve our long-term revenue targets. Moving on to display.

Revenue declined as expected to $251 million. Segment non-GAAP operating margin also declined to 13.5%. Turning to our cash flows. We generated $857 million in operating cash flow during the quarter which was 13% of revenue.

We returned over $1.72 billion to shareholders including $223 million in dividends and $1.5 billion in buybacks. We repurchased 17 million shares at an average price of $88.05. Next I'll discuss the impact of the new U.S. export regulations to Applied Materials.

We currently expect that the unmitigated revenue impact of the new rules could be up to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2023. We continue to work through the regulatory requirements including seeking licenses and approvals where appropriate. We hope to reduce the revenue impact by between $500 million and $1 billion to a net impact of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We also expect the rules to reduce our non-GAAP gross margin by up to 1 percentage point.

While this creates a headwind to meeting our gross margin targets for 2024 we remain committed to our goals and believe we can even exceed them over time. In Q4 the new rules reduced our semi systems and AGS revenue by approximately $280 million which is in the range of our expectation on October 12. Inventory charges in Q4 were lower than our preliminary assessment. In Q1 we expect the new rules to reduce semi systems and AGS revenue by approximately $490 million combined and reduce our gross margin by around 1 percentage point both on an unmitigated basis.

Now I'll share our guidance for Q1. We expect revenue to be $6.7 billion plus or minus $400 million and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.93 plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook we expect semi systems revenue to be about $5.15 billion which is up nearly 13% year over year. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.33 billion which is slightly up year over year.

Display revenue should be around $170 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46.1% and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be $1.16 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 13% which is up from 11.8% last year primarily due to mandatory capitalization of R&D expenses effective in our new fiscal year. Before we begin the Q&A I'd like to summarize our company's position in the current environment.

We have record backlog notably in the highly enabling technologies for next-generation nodes. Our supply chain and manufacturing output are incrementally improving. We expect our services business will continue to grow and generate strong recurring revenue and free cash flow. And the longer-term growth outlook for the semiconductor industry remains strong.

Applied is in a great position to invest in future growth and deliver strong profitability free cash flow and shareholder returns. Now Mike please begin the Q&A.

Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President

Thanks Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can please ask just one question on today's call. If you have another question please requeue and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator let's please begin.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.

C. J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping to clarify one thing first on China.

And really the question is what changed between October 12 with your press release and then October 30 where it looks like there really wasn't much of an impact at all? And then my I guess real question is as you think about calendar '23 WFE it sounds like companies are providing kind of a top-down view that things for WFE are -- look weak and declining. However every company bottoms up based on deferred revenues and backlogs are much more optimistic on the outlook. So can you kind of talk through the moving parts there? And what kind of range or outcome you see today for year-over-year silicon declines in calendar '23? Thanks so much.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Hi C.J. it's Brice. I'll start on this one. So relative to the preannouncement that we did we talked about a $400 million impact plus or minus $150 million for the China trade change.

And then as we work through it that impact ended up being less around $280 million. And it's just estimating the transactional elements at the end of the quarter. It was an initial element estimate so we did a little bit better from that perspective. The other thing that really happened was execution in the end of the quarter was almost flawless from a logistics perspective.

We got more supply chain parts in at the end of the quarter. And so over $200 million of good news from an execution and delivery perspective finishing product and completions in the field. So it was really those two things. It was little bit better than our initial estimate and execution was excellent in the last couple of weeks of the quarter.

And then on '23 the WFE question for '23 we think that it's preliminary. It's too early to give an estimate of '23. So what we're trying to share is what we're seeing in our order patterns and in our business for Q1 and Q2. We talked about in the script how in Q1 -- or in our bookings for Q4 they were really solid.

We did see pushouts. We did see weakness in the memory business but our backlog has grown to a record level of backlog. So when we think about our Q1 and Q2 we're still supply constrained. We still have a number of different equipment lines that we have significant backlog.

We're trying to catch up to customer orders. And so the signals to us really are that we have to work on supply chain work on improving our output and work on catching up with our customers. So beyond that we're just not able to make a call yet on WFE for '23.

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. C.J. this is Gary. As Brice said the -- we can certainly give a perspective on our business. We're not going to guide on overall WFE for '23.

But we're in a very strong position. If you look at the kind of profile of the business it's more weighted toward foundry-logic versus memory. And we have some very strong products where we have significant backlog and we're still working to close the supply demand gaps in those areas. So from Applied's standpoint as you know it's all about the race for power and performance for all of our customers and we're really well-positioned with leading products and those big inflections.

And again our No. 1 focus is on closing the supply chain gaps.

C. J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.

Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst

Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask you about the mitigated versus unmitigated impact from China. So you gave the numbers $2.5 billion and hoping to bring that down to like $1.5 billion.

But I gathered a big element of that was getting licenses. Where do you expect those licenses to be gotten? Is that only to the multinational? Do you guys expect licenses to be given to some of the Chinese folks? I mean how could that happen? What is the mechanism by which you come in at the unmitigated number versus the -- coming to the mitigated number versus the unmitigated number?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Hi Stacy it's Brice. Yeah and it's important probably to say that this unmitigated versus mitigated it has everything to do with the impact to the China shipments and Chinese customers. In other words it's not referring to whether we can ship a product we are making for those customers to non-China customers. So the unmitigated the way we calculated this is we looked at the orders that we have for the affected customers and that's what you see as the total $2.5 billion.

In order to mitigate that --

Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst

Does that include multinationals too?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Say again?

Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst

I'm sorry. Does that include multinationals too? Or is that just the local Chinese guys [Inaudible]?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

It does not. It does not.

Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst

[Inaudible]

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. And so the way we looked at that there are some customers that we're trying to clarify that we can apply for licenses for or we can get authorizations for once they establish that their technology is within the guidelines. So we have a process to do that. And on the other side we expect some customers may decide to change their plan or change their technology so it does not go above the threshold that's affected by the rules at this point.

So it's really those two elements that we'll be able to clarify that some customers were able to ship with or ship to or some customers changing their plans on the technology side that would allow them to qualify for shipments.

Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst

So what would that mean though? Would that suck up like supply that would have ordinarily gotten built by somebody else though? Because otherwise you're just adding like lagging-edge supply into a vacuum essentially. How do we think about like the second-order effects here?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. We don't think so. We expect all that equipment to be utilized. And so if that equipment has moved to a different use then we expect it will be backfilled somewhere else for its original demand purpose if that makes sense.

Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst

Got it. And I guess just one last one. Right now I guess you're running at the unmitigated level. When do you think it will be at a mitigated level? Like how likely do you think it will be that you end up at the mitigated level at some point?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

It's hard to say. It's a process. You can imagine there's a large number of people working on this. In fact the whole industry is working on this.

So it's job two at this point behind increasing output. So I would say it's still a good estimate today and we're -- we'll be working throughout the year on improving the number of customers and plants that we can ship to.

Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst

Got it. OK. Thank you guys.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yup.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.

Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify. I thought Brice you said somewhere that you provided some look for Q2. I don't think I caught that.

And then several of your memory customers that said that their spending could be down over 50% next year. Recently Micron said it could be down even more than that. Have you noticed almost 50% cancellation of orders from them? Because I'm just trying to reconcile your commentary that sounds outside of China of course more benign and more supportive versus just the very horrific guidance that your memory customers are providing. I understand you're less exposed to memory versus foundry-logic but still it's a reasonable size exposure.

I'm curious has that 50% cut in capex translated to any reduction in your backlog or any change in your thinking about memory for next year?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

OK. Thanks Vivek. So we're not giving a guide for Q2. We are highlighting the record backlog and the fact that we're constrained and the fact that in several equipment lines we're behind on customer orders.

So we're going to try to increase output. And I'd say that comment is true for both Q1 and Q2. So that's as much shaping as we're providing for Q2. On the memory side just to kind of click back and think about the overall demand environment we positioned last quarter that we had a significant amount more demand than we have the ability to supply for '23.

What did happen during the course of this quarter is there is a significant amount of pushouts and reductions in that demand. Now you can see the end result. We still had solid bookings in Q4. We still -- we created a record backlog that's now disclosed.

So I would say that some of those pushouts and some of those reductions were definitely in the memory space. And I wouldn't -- I'm not going to characterize what percentage it was but I would say that that's the most affected area in the business in terms of pushouts and reductions for '23.

Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

So you are seeing a 50% type reduction? I'm just trying to align what we are hearing from those customers versus what you are seeing on the ground in your business.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Sorry I can't quantify exactly what it is. I'll just say that that is what -- it's biased the reductions were biased in that area.

Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

OK. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen.

Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Yeah hi. Thanks for taking my question. Brice or Gary I just wanted to find out you mentioned how lagging edge is still pretty strong especially auto analog in China. And I wonder like do you ever think that auto analog could be the next thing to drop.

But in other words if memory is going to be down next year but lagging edge holds up what is the risk that lagging edge rolls over in 2024 and you have two years of lackluster WFE? Thank you.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

OK. I'll start maybe Gary wants to say something. We don't have a specific guide for what we call ICAPS our mature node businesses. What we would say is there was significant growth in 2022.

And when we think about all the end markets we think the end markets are mixed. We know some of the consumer markets and even industrial have seen some weakening. But on the positive side automotive and the power market that feeds EV and solar and other areas has been really strong. So for us this is a critical market.

We're continuing to invest and continuing to focus in this area and we would just highlight to investors that the growth has been very strong.

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Krish the other thing I would add is that we're -- we've made a change in our organization more than three years ago forming our ICAPS group. And we have just very very deep engagements with our customers both on a technical and a support side of our business. And we have the broadest set of innovative products for ICAPS.

If I look at where we're at today those are some of the areas that -- where we have a significant backlog. MDP and implant in FY '23 are very very strong for us. Those are areas where we have significant demand from customers. And ICAPS is similar in that to the -- all of the rest of our business.

This is always a race for all of these customers relative to power performance and cost. And ICAPS is really materials enabled. We have a really strong team there. We have a great pipeline of products.

I will guarantee you every year will not be up. That's for sure. We're not going to guide '24 but we are in a very good position in ICAPS relative to enabling technology for future inflections.

Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Thanks a lot Gary. Thanks Brice.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.

Mark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary maybe for you. It seems like the consensus for WFE this year is somewhere in the $65 billion to $75 billion range.

And I'm not asking you to give a guidance or an outlook for next year. But I'm wondering in the scenario where that is proven to be too cautious of an outlook for next year. Based on the conversations that you have with your customers would you say that that would be because lead times are long and customers just -- they don't want to cancel orders or there's new secular drivers like bigger chips or advanced packaging or trailing node like some of the things you've talked about or just competition at the leading edge is driving people to invest more enabled by subsidies? What are your customers suggesting to you or what -- I mean your backlog grew even as memory came down like what do you think are the biggest drivers into next year regardless of whatever the end number is? And what could surprise on the upside? Thank you.

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah Mark thanks for the question. So all of our customers in any of these different markets the technology is moving very very quickly. So they're all racing against each other for power performance cost their relative competitive position. So certainly as you mentioned in the leading edge foundry-logic there's a tremendous amount of focus there high-performance computing and a number of those different markets.

And again for Applied what we've talked about is real strength in enabling new structures that are critical to competitive positions for our customers. Gate-all-around is an incremental $1 billion for Applied for 100000 wafer starts more than what we're currently capturing with FinFET. We're on path to gain 5 points of share in the transition from FinFET to gate-all-around. Wiring is probably the No.

1 focus and I don't know that everyone really understands how important that inflection is for our customers. That's an area where we have tremendous strength. We're enabling a 50% reduction in wiring resistance with integrated platforms that combine many technologies together. So that's another one where Applied is really well-positioned.

Packaging has grown for Applied to nearly $1 billion and we have over 50% share in the broad -- in our served market. And we have by far the broadest position in advanced packaging and we're still in the early innings of that inflection. But again that's all part of this technology race for all of our customers. ICAPS I mentioned that earlier on the call.

Those are also markets where I think it's surprising to people including -- you've seen some of our peers talking about ICAPS growth over a longer period of time there are technology inflections there. And that's as I mentioned earlier metal deposition implant. Those are areas where we're very very -- in very strong enabling positions with our customers. I think -- the other thing for Applied beyond all of these different areas high-speed DRAM with logic-like structures all of those big inflections our PDC business grew I think it was 67% in FY '21.

We're up around 35% in FY '22. That business is also outperforming and we think that will continue to outperform as we go forward. So. at least -- from an Applied standpoint it's really all around those big inflections and how we're positioned for those major inflections.

So I don't know if -- Brice if you want to add anything?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

No. I would just comment that the -- we highlighted that we still have to catch up to customer demand in several areas. So that adds some momentum into '23. And then the other piece is just -- it seems clear that productivity -- to drive productivity in the world a lot of these things like in the energy market data center market etc. still have resilient demand.

Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Thank you. Very helpful.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.

Atif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst

Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Gary I have a question on long-term impact of China restrictions to both domestic and multinational spend. If I look at China spending over the last five years it has outgrown WFE by three to four times.

What replaces this in terms of pending capital intensity and above-average profitability for you?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Hi Atif I'll start. This is Brice. I think on the China side when we look at that impact the larger part of the business has been on the trailing nodes for us and we expect that to still be a very strong business for Applied.

And we see that in both the factory projects that we monitor and also in the different end markets where there's investments. And then on the leading edge if it's a question of do we expect that demand to be taken away from WFE demand globally and permanently? We don't. It will either be satisfied in some way in China either by multinationals or in some other way or it will move to another geography. So we don't believe that that will be an impact.

And just circling back around I would just focus on over time we expect the China market to be a strong grower especially in the ICAPS mature node space.

Atif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshi Hari with Goldman Sachs.

Toshi Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the AGS business going into next fiscal year and calendar year. Obviously it's been a very steady grower for you guys and for the overall industry.

Many of your leading-edge memory customers and logic and foundry customers I believe are in the process of [Inaudible] wafer starts potentially over the next couple of quarters. So I guess the question is when you cite services as one of the reasons why you'll outperform into next year is the baseline assumption that business continues to grow given the installed base growth and given how you transform the mix of that business? Or could it be down but it's down less? Thank you.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

OK. Thanks Toshi. Thank you. Yeah.

A couple of drivers here. You'll see in our outlook for Q1 that we have a down quarter for AGS which is unusual. And the reason is we've got a full quarter impact approximately $100 million for the reduction of the China customers that we won't be able to serve for the rest of the year. So that's definitely a headwind in Q1.

But you hit the nail on the head with respect to the dynamics thereafter. Every time we ship a tool it grows our installed base of equipment. We grew the installed base 8% last year. Beyond -- or after that our ability to provide services and put those services on subscription agreements we typically outgrow the installed base than we did last year.

So that is the driver for the reason the services business is sticky. We have more equipment to serve. The equipment becomes more intensive in terms of service needs. And over time that grows the business.

Now to your point a portion of the business is transactional. We do see lower utilization this quarter and next quarter. What we would point to -- what we have pointed to is even in '19 where there was lower utilization we still grew the services business. And besides the headwind of China that I pointed out we expect that to be the dynamic this year and going forward.

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Toshiya this is Gary. I'll add a little bit more color. So we do expect services to be up in '23. The -- as Brice mentioned transactional will be down based on capacity utilization.

But our profile with a significant amount of our service and spares business being agreements gives us stickiness going forward. And that is continuing to increase the comprehensive agreements up 16% last year. The tenure of our agreements the length of the agreements are up to 2.6 years renewal rates at 93%. So we're -- and it was an interesting thing through the -- all of the chip shortage period of time.

We were able to demonstrate value for customers with ramp services to accelerate chip output managed part services so that people could increase tool availability and output managed services for yield and optimizing productivity. So all of that helped us position our service business in a higher value for our customers. And again that's what gives us the ability to continue to grow into '23. And then the longer-term model we've communicated is double-digit growth and we still have high confidence we'll achieve that.

Toshi Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Thank you so much.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.

Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

Hi and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Yeah. Another follow-up on AGS.

So looking back on fiscal '22 your semi systems operating margin declined about 200 basis points on strong revenue growth obviously due to the inflationary cost pressures. But your AGS business sustained near-record operating margins at 30%. So I guess how has the team been able to sustain the record or near-record AGS operating profitability in this inflationary environment? And more importantly in a down year or potential down year next year you guys talked last call this call on sustainability of AGS from a revenue perspective. How should we think about the sustainability of operating margins for AGS?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Harlan it's -- thank you. So one thing I would call out is we did have lower gross margins and operating margins in Q4 and that's largely due to looking at the specific inventory we had for China customers that will have to either reposition or move somewhere else or scrap. But to your point on operating profit one of the plans the business has there is to improve the amount of repair that we do for products that we bring back to customers.

And so that helps us lower the cost and cost of goods sold with customers. And that's one of the ways that we improve our gross margins and the ultimate profit of that business. And the other is just increased efficiency. As we demonstrate more and more capability with the customers and we provide more services with the same spending profile then that helps us maintain the profitability.

Those are the two key drivers.

Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.

Joe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the gross margin impact from the China restriction. Can you talk about what's driving that 1 percentage point impact? And then how do we think about what you could potentially recapture in the mitigated scenario that you outlined?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thank you. So two things. And it depends on which time period you look at.

But if we look forward the gross margin impact is really that they're generally smaller customers. So the profitability of those customers for Applied is higher. And when we talk about mitigation as we go forward it's going to be TBD as to who we sell that product to and what the profitability is. So at this point we're expecting the impact that we described.

And if you look at the current quarter we did have specific inventory for customers that's unique. We are working to qualify some of that inventory and we were successful to a degree but we did have specific inventory that we had to take a demand reserve on.

Joe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yup.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS Securities.

Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst

Thanks a lot. Gary I had a question about WFE intensity. So we're exiting this year at 15.5% and you were saying that through 2030 you think WFE is going to grow faster than semiconductors. You've certainly been beating that drum now for a while that WFE intensity is going to keep going up.

And obviously there are some underlying upward pressures. But China has obviously been ordering tools and building capacity well ahead of demand now in part due to the fear of these bans. So if China becomes a little more of a lagging-tier region wouldn't that lower WFE intensity a bit and maybe argue that maybe it has to reset a bit? Thanks Gary.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah Tim I'll jump in for a second here just because I have the picture of the graph in my mind that we use. So we do think intensity is gradually increasing and it's because of the reasons Gary described. A lot of steps in the process are becoming more complex and require more equipment and we see that. And then when we think about China and ICAPS specifically in the past there's been a lot of reuse of existing fabs and existing process tools.

And that allowed for a low intensity. And that's not been what's happening in the past few years and with recent additions. We've talked about the number of factory projects that we see. So as capacity gets added even in the ICAPS space what you see is an intensity level that's more like what we were experiencing on the leading edge just a few years ago.

And that's also serving to raise the overall average of intensity. So we're pretty confident that intensity will continue to rise.

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Tim on the -- relative to ICAPS just reminding people that there was a time period where you had a lot of movement of business to foundries. And during that time period there were many factories and tools that came on the market all of that stuff is gone. So that's what Brice was referring to relative to ICAPS capital intensities. And then if you look at all of the -- I went through a list of key inflections -- technology inflections for customers and I gave some color around wiring and the number of steps that are increasing.

That's what we're seeing really in all of the different segments of the business. So I think that capital intensity is probably the right ZIP code if we look through 2030.

Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst

Thanks Gary and Brice.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Joseph Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the environment in China with the multinationals. Obviously they need to get a license they did immediately get a license but it's a 12-month license.

So would you say that you generally see the footprint moving away from China with those multinational customers? Do you see any potential for that to become an issue down the road? Can you just talk generally to the fact that the multinationals were included in this?

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah Joe this is Gary. Thanks for the question. The multinationals are not impacted today. Relative to their strategies we'd really rather have them comment on that.

So again just today they're not impacted. How they position their businesses geographically that's really up to them.

Joseph Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.

Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow up on the earlier question on the longer-term WFE. As you think about the growth of WFE in the next call it three to five years how do you think about the mix between the different type of tools how that could change? Meaning deposition and edge versus litho versus process control as you talk to your customers about the road map and technology inflections. And I also want to ask about -- I assume your served addressable market will continue to expand but maybe help us understand how much would that grow.

Thanks.

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Sidney thanks for the question. So if you look at what our customers are talking about relative to their road maps really there are five big drivers of the technologies going forward workload-specific architectures. There are new structures new materials new ways to shrink new advanced packaging inflections for our customers.

And so what we see if you look at the advanced foundry-logic road map you see a tremendous focus on new structures and new materials. The transistor innovations around gate-all-around are essential relative to power and performance. Wiring I talked a lot about wiring. Our largest business is metal deposition and the wires are getting thinner and resistance goes up.

So you're seeing more dollars moving in that direction. Advanced packaging is an area where we see -- for sure that's another big -- one of the big five drivers for the road maps for our customers. And that's still in the early innings around $1 billion business for us today over 50% served market for the areas we participate. And so we see that one.

That's an area that will attract a tremendous amount of investment. And relative to competition between customers is very very important. In memory you certainly see material scaling in 3D NAND as customers are moving to more layers or other ways to include logic and memory together through different technology inflections. DRAM is moving to high speed.

And so you have high-K metal gate and logic-like structures there. So a lot of that investment is moving more toward materials-enabled technologies and that's where Applied has really a tremendous strength. I don't know Brice if you want to add anything there?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

No. Good. Thanks.

Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

All right. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Thanks for taking my question. Just had a question with the CHIPS Act applications expected to be received or submitted beginning sort of the February time frame. I'm wondering as you look at your '23 WFE outlook do you expect to see any benefits from CHIPS Act spending in '23? Or do you think it's really more of a '24 and beyond before it hits WFE spending? Thanks.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

We do expect Quinn a small -- really small amount in '23. On the equipment side it will likely really start in '24 as a number of those projects are -- start with construction. There are a few that will start with equipment but it will really for us be more the '24 time frame.

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Quinn one thing I'd add is that those investments are time bound. And so as Brice said not so much in '23 starting in but there are -- there is timing associated with those incentives.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you.

Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President

Thanks Quinn. And operator we have time for two more questions today.

Operator

Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street.

Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- Analyst

Thank you for taking my question. Gary I'd like to come back to the comments you made about capital intensity and the specifics that the trailing edge part of your portfolio. And so you described there I think like three reasons why capital intensity -- I mean two reasons why capital intensity is very high there. I mean higher than the past.

The first one is that there is no innovation going on. So like that drives capital intensity up. And then you mentioned the fact that there used to be like a secondhand market that was feeling the trailing edge that is kind of going away. And my question is there must be also a third element that justifies a very high capital intensity today which is that we've been growing capacity very very fast this year and last year.

And there is a significant chance that the capacity growth is at some point going to slow down or even to pause. And so I'd like to hear your thoughts about that and maybe a sense of how much it could impact in the shorter-term capital intensity.

Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Hi Pierre this is Gary. Thanks for the question. So I will say that we're 100% certain that all of these markets will not be up every year. But what we do see if you think about pick a number in terms of edge computing devices by 2030 these technologies are becoming much much more pervasive.

They're really -- if you think about industrial automation or gas to smart electric vehicles a number of different inflections a lot of these ICAPS technologies are going to grow at a fair compound annual growth rate. I think that's what other people are seeing also. So how that -- what the shape of that looks like every single year we're not going to forecast that. But we do think that that business is going to see healthy growth.

And that's why also we formed the ICAPS organization three years ago. We saw that that market was going to be significant from a growth perspective and pulled together all of our different technologies. So again if I look across all of those segments within ICAPS we think over the longer term there will be significant compound annual growth rates. We have very very strong positions in enabling some of those technology inflections in ICAP but we're not going to give a specific profile on a year-by-year basis.

Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of David O'Connor with Exane BNP.

David O'Connor -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst

Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A follow-up on the backlog to a previous question.

Gary or Brice how should we think about the time frame of getting the backlog back to a kind of more normalized level or -- when do you expect to get caught up on demand for those products that are running pretty hot on the PPACt side? Thank you.

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Thanks David. We're expecting it's going to take us more than two quarters. So depending on the line of equipment I would say between two and four quarters is our internal estimate.

And so that's what we're focused on. We are behind with the customers and we're working on increasing output every week. Thanks for the question.

David O'Connor -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst

Thank you.

Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President

Yeah. Thanks David for your question. And Brice would you like to give us your closing thoughts today?

Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah absolutely. Clearly there are questions about the market in the near term. But for our part we had healthy Q4 orders and we have record backlog that we described and it's mostly in our leadership product areas that drive the big technology inflections. Job one for us is increasing our output to meet customer demand.

We're in a strong financial position to continue to develop our broad portfolio of technology and to drive the critical inflections and to support eventually a $1 trillion semiconductor market. I hope we get to see many of you at the upcoming Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo conferences. In the meantime we hope you enjoy a safe and happy Thanksgiving. Thank you.

Mike let's close it up.

Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President

OK. Great Brice. So we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 Pacific Time and we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

The service is comprised of Motional’s fleet of Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric vehicles which will be fully autonomous at the time of launch and not require a human safety driver behind the wheel.

The company would not say when exactly the service will go live though. “We plan to reveal timing when we are closer to launch” a Motional spokesperson said. Previously Motional said it wouldn’t deploy fully autonomous vehicles until 2023 so it’s probably safe to assume that LA residents won’t be able to hail one of the company’s vehicles until at least January.

LA will be Motional and Lyft’s second market after launching a robotaxi service in Las Vegas earlier this year. Motional says that when the service goes live it will be “the first time that residents in Los Angeles can request an autonomous vehicle in the Lyft app.”

LA will be Motional and Lyft’s second market after launching a robotaxi service in Las Vegas earlier this year.

LA isn’t uncharted territory for the companies. Motional has been testing its vehicles there since at least last year when it announced that it would be expanding its operations in California. The company has had an office in LA since 2016.

Still Motional will need to get all of its permits in order before accepting passengers into its vehicles. California requires AV companies obtain a series of permits from the Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Utilities Commission before they are legally approved to ferry passengers and accept money for trips.

“Motional has applied for a permit with the California DMV to begin driverless testing. Motional has been testing in Southern California for over a year and we look forward to working with local partners to expand our activity to include driverless operation” the spokesperson said. “We expect to have the appropriate permits to charge for rides ahead of the commercial launch.”

“Motional has applied for a permit with the California DMV to begin driverless testing.”

Motional was first announced in March 2020 when Hyundai said it would spend $1.6 billion to catch up to its rivals in the autonomous vehicle space along with Aptiv a technology company formerly known as Delphi which owns 50 percent of the venture. (The spend has since grown to $4 billion.) The company currently has facilities in Las Vegas Singapore and Seoul and has also tested its vehicles in Boston and Pittsburgh.

Meanwhile Lyft is positioning itself as a platform in which customers in cities across the country can arrange rides in autonomous vehicles. The ride-hailing company once aspired to build its own self-driving cars before pivoting and selling off its AV research and development division to a subsidiary of Toyota. Since then Lyft has struck deals with Motional Waymo and Argo a self-driving company backed by Ford and Volkswagen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL2x5ZnQtbW90aW9uYWwtbGF1bmNoLXJvYm90YXhpLXNlcnZpY2UtbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtMjAyMi0xMS0xNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lyft Motional to launch robotaxi service in Los Angeles,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/lyft-motional-launch-robotaxi-service-los-angeles-2022-11-17/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL2x5ZnQtbW90aW9uYWwtbGF1bmNoLXJvYm90YXhpLXNlcnZpY2UtbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtMjAyMi0xMS0xNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9seWZ0LWFuZC1tb3Rpb25hbC1hcmUtbGF1bmNoaW5nLWEtZHJpdmVybGVzcy1yaWRlLXNlcnZpY2UtaW4tbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtMTMwMDA0MzQwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lyft and Motional to offer driverless taxi rides in Los Angeles,"Lyft and Motional have announced plans to launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Los Angeles using Ioniq 5 EV Level 4 robotaxis. Los Angeles will be the second city serviced by the two companies which started offering public rides in Las Vegas earlier this year.

Motional a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv has been testing autonomous vehicles without safety drivers for exactly two years. As with the Las Vegas service the Ioniq 5 vehicles will be integrated into Lyft's Los Angeles network. When the car arrives you can unlock the doors using the Lyft app and each vehicle has a dedicated passenger display that can be used to contact a remote agent at any time.

""Los Angeles was the second city Lyft launched back in 2013 and it’s only fitting that it will be the second AV market we launch with our partner Motional"" said Lyft CEO Logan Green in a statement. ""Los Angeles is the second most populated city in the U.S. and represents a huge market opportunity for AV adoption"" added Motional CEO Karl Iagnemma.

Motional says it has given 100000-plus rides in Las Vegas with Lyft and received over 95 percent five-star ratings. The company recently signed a 10-year agreement with Uber as well saying its vehicles will be ""strategically deployed"" in cities around the US and that it will start offering passenger rides later this year.

Apart from Motional only Alphabet division Waymo and GM's Cruise are offering true driverless services at a reasonably large scale. The Waymo One service is operating in Phoenix and San Francisco while Cruise rides are currently limited to San Francisco. Both operate only in specific areas of cities and some vehicles still use safety riders.",,,,,,

A tall order of topics; this panel was eager to engage.

“So how are we doing with modernization in these environments?” asked O’Sullivan. Farach replied that while many in the chemical space are embracing programs to modernize and digitalize their operations there are still those who don’t even want to consider artificial intelligence or advanced data analytics or any of this IIoT stuff. “They think it’s hocus pocus” he said blaming these laggards for the chemical industry trailing oil & gas and pharma in pursuing digital transformation. “And some of these systems in chemical factories are from the 1960s. There are elements of these plants that are not talking to each other. And since digitalization requires having access to data we’ve got to start with modernizing these systems first. We’ve got to have a modern control system in place.”

A company can be very interested in evolving to Industry 4.0 Dotson added but if they are trying to perform data analytics on systems that are 40 years old and don’t have the required horsepower it ain’t gonna happen. “The underlying infrastructure is essential to modernization” she concurred.

Heads on the dais nodded in agreement. Abril added that the chemical industry is booming particularly in North America and leaders are having a hard time accepting the idea of taking their plants (no matter how antiquated) offline for a few weeks to make modernization upgrades. “Lack of labor is also really hitting these decision-makers” she added. “They just don’t have the bandwidth to consider these changes.”

But they should the panelists agreed. At some point dated control systems dusty machines and running lean with just-in-time/just-in-case approaches will prove untenable for many in the chemical space. Dotson warned that modernization programs can take many years to develop. Digitalization campaigns don’t provide immediate returns. And current challenges will only worsen over time. “We’re now at the point with the workforce-shortage problem that we have to get more efficient” stressed Farach. “We don’t have the people to run the plants. We need to automate.”

With the motivations clearly established the panelists explored solutions. Rivera advised creating teams of what he calls “bilingual” workers within chemical facilities who can communicate with seasoned workers about existing processes but also spearhead adoption efforts with modern digital tools and systems. Rodenfels added that highlighting the value components with these enterprise-wide updates is critical for buy-in. For example—connecting different digitalization efforts while improving say the cybersecurity or ESG postures. “If planned properly” he said “modernization can be a means to drive additional value. It can be profitable.”

The moderator inquired how to prove that profitability to doubtful purse-string holders. Panelists suggested using existing customer-success stories as proof or referencing consulting-firm studies that prove the benefits of digitalization—think increased throughput reduced downtime less maintenance. “Those stories are out there” Farach insisted.

Abril dove deeper on this front listing three hot-button areas that will prompt chemical-company CEOs to sit up listen and truly consider modernization programs. The first is any safety concerns related to dated workplaces. The second is if quality is being compromised by current systems. And lastly batch integrity. “If batches are spoiled that costs money. CEOs will be eager to find ways to get ahead of that.”

The good news? The biggest wins are among the most simple. Installing variable-speed drives on pumps for example or monitoring the electricity demands of each asset (rather than the entire facility) to pinpoint areas for optimization. “As you modernize it’s like you can put some of your processes on autopilot” explained Rodenfels. “Your operators are still there but they can be doing other more important things.”

Or they can be doing other less important things like browsing eBay for Christmas presents rather than industrial assets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNS1sYXJnZXN0LWZlcnRpbGl6ZXItY29tcGFuaWVzLXdvcmxkLTEyMzU0ODEyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World,"In this article we will take a look at the 15 largest fertilizer companies in the world. To skip our analysis of the recent market trends you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World.

The Fertilizer Industry: An Analysis

The growing global population climate change and water scarcity problems have joined forces to put a strain on the production of agricultural products globally. With a growing demand the need to generate higher crop yields from the existing arable land is rising. This is where fertilizer companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (NYSE:ADM) CF Industries Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CF) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) enter the picture. For healthy growth plants require three main nutrients: Nitrogen Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK). Farmers use fertilizers to fill the soil deficiencies in these nutrients for healthy growth of their crops.

Before we delve into the recent market trends for the fertilizer industry we need to understand the basics of how fertilizers are made. Basic Nitrogen-based fertilizers such as urea urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) and ammonium nitrate require ammonia as a feedstock produced most commonly from natural gas and coal in some cases. On the other hand Phosphorus and Potassium based fertilizers require mineral deposits of these elements.

Fertilizer prices have risen significantly in the recent past and may remain elevated at least in the near-term. Urea prices surpassed their 2008 peaks while phosphates and potash prices are close to 2008 levels according to the World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook. The Russia-Ukraine conflict led to sanctions on Russia and Belarus the two leading producers of fertilizers. The crisis was further exacerbated with the reduction in ammonia production due to higher natural gas prices. In addition China the largest producer of Nitrogen and Phosphorus imposed export restrictions to cater to domestic demand.

We have picked the top 15 fertilizer companies based on their market capitalization that are involved in the production and delivery of fertilizers.

Durham director of the Iowa Economic Development Authority as well as the Finance Authority touted the state’s “This Is Iowa” campaign — its tagline is “A Secret Worth Sharing” — as one of a number of initiatives the state uses to promote economic development.

“This Is Iowa’s” website includes a link to the IEDA site along with information on visiting and moving to Iowa.

Durham was one of eight speakers and presenters during the 2022 annual meeting for the New Bohemian Innovation Collaborative or NewBoCo Tuesday afternoon at the Olympic South Side Theater in Cedar Rapids’ NewBo District.

Speaking to how the state and IEDA “lean in” to help businesses she touted the “continuum of funding” available from proof of commercial relevance through receiving demonstration funding and other later assistance and on to possible expansion aid.

Durham mentioned as one example the impending distribution of some $96 million from the U.S. Department of Treasury announced last month through the State Small Business Credit Initiative that will be made available for start-ups and small and veteran-owned businesses.

The economic development director also emphasized the “tremendous potential” for developing the bioscience industry in Iowa citing its cluster of Ingredion Cargill Archer Daniels Midland Diamond V and other big corporations already in those sectors.

“Iowa should own this space” she said.

Durham told The Gazette after the NewBoCo meeting that she’d never seen “this bio space ... so energized.” The state is looking at a “$7 billion portfolio of prospects“ she added.

“Companies need to source this green energy.”

And she’s always up to talk to companies about the positives of doing business Iowa.

“I give my cellphone number to everyone” she said.

Other presenters who took the stage during the meeting were:

Coe College President David Hayes talking about innovation

Lynn Allendorf John Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Center director promoting NewBoCo’s annual Entrefest conference

Rochelle Claude Kotar UFG Insurance senior I.T. manager on the DeltaV code school

NewBoCo’s K-12 Education Director Samantha Dahlby and Capital Access Manager for its Kiva Iowa loan program Kaitlin Byers gave updates on their programs

NewBoCo Community Engagement Manager Anthony Betters Jr. announced a new partnership with Council Bluffs. Mount Pleasant has been a community partner since this summer NewBoCo Chief Operating Officer Jill Wilkins said.

Cedar Raids Mayor Tiffany O’Donnell also took to the stage to thank the organization for its work through its many programs.

NewBoCo a not-for-profit was established in 2014.

Guests arrived at the multilevel home grounds and cultural hub to see a grand piano filled with bottles of the estate’s Pink Moon wine before walking a windy path to a mirrored studio with a jazz songstress belting out “It Had to Be You.”

Past the “bath cathedral” with its famed outdoor concrete bathtub a bubbling fountain was filled with Mytheresa present boxes hinting at the holiday theme.

Upstairs at the main house guests gathered around the pool for a water ballet performance recording video of the swimmers in their glam white one-piece bathing suits and red lipstick.

“Last year when we were first building our business in the U.S. we worked with Richard and did a dinner here” said Heather Kaminetsky North America president of Mytheresa admitting that such a good time was had some guests ended up in the concrete bathtub. The love fest has continued and the brands decided to host a second party. “He is everything lifestyle and we dress everyone so there’s synergy. It’s the same consumer we are just taking care of them differently in their lives” she added praising Christiansen’s vision which has spun the allure of Flamingo Estate with its lush gardens beehive and sheep farm into a luxury lifestyle brand of farm boxes products for the pantry bath and home. “We connect with the passion behind Flamingo Estate and what they stand for.”

Aaron Alexander and Heather Kaminetsky

The dress code for the evening was black tie and “no sensible shoes” and guests took it to heart.

NJ Falk managing partner in Athletic Propulsion Labs (founders Adam and Ryan Goldston are her sons) left the sneakers at home shimmying around in a glam silver sequin Rick Owens gown instead. “I feel like Morticia Addams” she joked of the long look with train.

Designer Scott Sternberg was ever preppy in his well-loved tuxedo. “I’m just trying to keep myself from starting another business” he said of what he’s been up to since closing Entireworld. “I’m probably not going to be able to help it.”

Actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish designer Aurora James and her beau Benjamin Bronfman director Aaron Harvey designer Humberto Leon influencer Aimee Song and stylist Erin Walsh were also among the crowd.

Aurora James and Benjamin Bronfman

Ever the impeccable host Christiansen ran around greeting guests who indulged in pretty much anything their hearts desired — oysters shrimp and grits margaritas Champagne and cups of Marlboro cigarettes.

Built in the 1940s and sitting on seven acres Flamingo Estates is said to have been an erotic film studio a pirate radio station and artist commune at various times in the past. In 2013 Christiansen owner of Chandelier Creative Agency began renovating it with the help of architects Karl Fournier and Olivier Marty of Paris-based Studio KO. They were inspired by Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé’s Majorelle Garden in Marrakech.

Through the art-filled living room and out on the front porch was one a banquet-sized charcuterie table filled with meats cheeses Caviar Kaspia caviar potato chips and Flamingo Estate’s own stone fruit and fig snack mix and winter harvest persimmon vinegar and jam — but alas no Flamingo Estate x LeBron James Honey.

The limited-edition honey made from a hive sent to the basketball legend’s home is one of the brand’s signature gifts of the season at $250 with all proceeds going to the LeBron James Family Foundation.

It was backordered online at press time but the Ai Weiwei honey from Portugal Julianne Moore honey from Montauk Tiffany Haddish honey from South Central L.A. and Will Ferrell honey from Laurel Canyon were on offer.

After all in Hollywood there’s always another celebrity honey.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Cette reconduction attendue n'est pas une surprise le mode électoral de la Fifa – une fédération une voix – ayant permis à ses ex-présidents d'enchaîner les mandats en s'assurant du soutien d'une majorité de votants: le Brésilien Joao Havelange a ainsi dirigé la planète foot de 1974 à 1998 et le Suisse Sepp Blatter de 1998 à 2015.

Elu en 2016 avec la promesse de ""restaurer l'image de la Fifa"" alors engluée dans un scandale planétaire de corruption le dirigeant italo-suisse de 52 ans avait officialisé sa candidature le 31 mars dernier à Doha sans qu'aucun adversaire ne se soit déclaré depuis.

A son actif Infantino peut avancer le gonflement constant des recettes de la Fifa qui prévoit un chiffre d'affaires record de 7 milliards de dollars (63 milliards d'euros) sur le cycle de quatre ans s'achevant en 2022.

N'ayant pas pu pousser le sommet à condamner la normalisation le président de l’Assemblée populaire nationale algérienne Ibrahim Bougali a reçu le «calife général de la tariqa Tijaniyya» Sidi Ali Belarabi Tijani.

Cette réunion a également coïncidé mercredi avec les préparatifs en cours pour l’organisation de la 17e Conférence de l’Union des conseils des Etats membres de l’Organisation de la conférence islamique (OCI) que l’Algérie abritera dans les mois à venir. «Boghali a présenté une proposition visant à programmer une visite au profit des participants à cette conférence au siège du califat de Tijani en tant que repère religieux rayonnant source de connaissance et de rayonnement spirituel pour des milliers d’adeptes et de fidèles dans diverses parties du continent et à l’étranger» selon l’agence de presse algérienne.

En outre «une autre proposition a été faite pour traduire en français et en anglais le livret qui fait connaître le fondateur de l’ordre le cheikh Abu al-Abbas Ahmed al-Tijani afin d’en faire un guide de présentation aux participants à la conférence pendant leur visite d’Ain Madi chef-lieu du califat général de l’ordre» ajoute la même source.

Un vieux conflit renouvelé

Par cette démarche l’Algérie tente de s’attribuer l’ordre Tijani suivi par des millions de personnes sur le continent africain et dans le monde. Elle insiste pour affirmer que son siège est dans la ville algérienne d’Ain Madi et que la zawya située au Maroc n’en est qu’une branche.

Les médias proches du pouvoir algérien avaient précédemment indiqué que leur pays tentait de «barrer la route à la mainmise sur le califat de Tijani par le Makhzen» (sic) et travaillait à «confirmer Ain Madi en Algérie comme référence de la tariqa Tijaniyya» sous-entendant que «le reste des zawya à travers le monde ne sont que des branches».

Le fondateur de la zawya cheikh Ahmad al-Tijani est né en Algérie. Il a fait son instruction religieuse au Maroc où il s’est installé et a été inhumé à sa mort. Le différend maroco-algérien autour de la zawya remonte à des décennies. Dans les années 1980 l’Algérie avait déjà tenté de tenir une conférence qui a été finalement boycottée par les cheikhs et les moqaddems après que le ministre marocain des Habous et affaires islamiques de l’époque Abdelkabir Mdaghri Alaoui a réussi à les convaincre. En 1986 le Maroc a ainsi accueilli un grand forum à Fès. Par la même occasion les participants ont déclaré leur soutien à la marocanité du Sahara.

En 2006 l’Algérie a organisé un autre forum qui a été boycotté par le Maroc et un certain nombre de cheikhs de cet ordre soufi. Un an plus tard le royaume a organisé un autre forum que l’Algérie a boycotté à son tour. Cette dernière rencontre a été marquée par la forte participation des adeptes de la méthode de divers pays africains.

En 2014 la ville de Fès a accueilli un forum international de l’ordre Tijani avec la participation de plus de 1 000 représentants issus de 47 pays à travers le monde malgré la tentative de l’Algérie qui a boycotté le forum de décourager des centaines des fidèles du Sénégal de la Gambie de la Mauritanie du Bénin de la Guinée et du Mali de se rendre au Maroc.

Des membres de la zawya en Algérie ont déclaré à l’époque avoir boycotté le forum en protestation contre l’invitation de l’ambassade du Maroc adressée à Ali Tijani qui s’autoproclame calife général de l’ordre. En octobre 2021 l’Algérie a organisé sous les auspices du président Abdelmadjid Tebboune un forum international à la mosquée Sidi Abdel Jabbar dans la ville d’Ain Madi sous le thème «La biographie du bien-aimé Mustafa en les mystiques du pôle caché Sidi Ahmed Tijani».

Au mois de mars 2022 le cheikh de la zawya Sidi Mohamed Kabir ben Sidi Ahmed Tijani s'est rendu au Sénégal accompagné d’une délégation de haut rang parmi les petits-fils de Cheikh Tijani et les savants de la tariqa. Des mois plus tard l’Algérie a envoyé le cheikh Ali Belarabi Tijani au Sénégal où le président Macky Sall l’a reçu.

Le Maroc a une longueur d’avance

Malgré les tentatives algériennes le rayonnement de la zawya tijania de Fès reste grand à rebours de l’Algérie. La zawya d’Ain Madi reste plutôt une branche de l’école spirituelle marocaine Sidi Mohamed Kabir Tijani est considéré comme le cheikh de l’ordre alors qu’Alger promeut Sidi Ali Belarbi Tijani.

Contrairement à la zawia algérienne l’influence de la zawia marocaine reste importante sur le continent africain. En novembre 2016 le président nigérian Mahamadou Buhari a rencontré le cheikh de la zawia marocaine à Abuja dans le cadre des efforts des autorités algériennes pour affronter le groupe terroriste Boko Haram.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vZnIuaGVzcHJlc3MuY29tLzI4OTc1NS1uYXJzYS1sZS1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0LWRhcHRpdHVkZS1wb3VyLWxlLXBlcm1pcy1kZS1jb25kdWlyZS1iaWVudG90LWVuLXZlcnNpb24tbnVtZXJpcXVlLmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL2ZyLmhlc3ByZXNzLmNvbS8yODk3NTUtbmFyc2EtbGUtY2VydGlmaWNhdC1kYXB0aXR1ZGUtcG91ci1sZS1wZXJtaXMtZGUtY29uZHVpcmUtYmllbnRvdC1lbi12ZXJzaW9uLW51bWVyaXF1ZS5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NARSA: Le certificat d'aptitude pour le permis de conduire bientôt en version numérique,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='fr.hespress.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /289755-narsa-le-certificat-daptitude-pour-le-permis-de-conduire-bientot-en-version-numerique.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E610169480>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vZnIuaGVzcHJlc3MuY29tLzI4OTc1NS1uYXJzYS1sZS1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0LWRhcHRpdHVkZS1wb3VyLWxlLXBlcm1pcy1kZS1jb25kdWlyZS1iaWVudG90LWVuLXZlcnNpb24tbnVtZXJpcXVlLmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL2ZyLmhlc3ByZXNzLmNvbS8yODk3NTUtbmFyc2EtbGUtY2VydGlmaWNhdC1kYXB0aXR1ZGUtcG91ci1sZS1wZXJtaXMtZGUtY29uZHVpcmUtYmllbnRvdC1lbi12ZXJzaW9uLW51bWVyaXF1ZS5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Pro-Palestinian protesters returned to the George Washington University and pitched tents on campus Thursday night just one day after police cleared an encampment on the D.C. campus arresting dozens of people.

A group of around 100 pro-Palestinian protesters linked arms and encircled several tents along F Street in Foggy Bottom on Thursday night. Demonstrators chanted for around five hours at times in heavy rain.

Around 11:30 p.m. D.C. Police gave its first warning to the demonstrators to disperse from the area or face arrests for unlawful entry and trespassing on campus property. Many protesters could be seen collecting their signs and packing up tents and leaving the area.

After the sixth warning MPD officers linked arms and began advancing on the protesters until 19th and F streets according to 7News’ Christian Flores who was on the scene and told WTOP. He said many of the organizers and protesters decided to leave on their own.

“We haven’t seen any [response from university officials] late this evening. It is pretty calm” Flores said as protestors were leaving the area of the university. “So it does appear that there was a plan in place by MPD to not only disperse the protesters but also to make sure there wasn’t any sort of second gathering after that dispersal order.”

Police confirmed to WTOP that one arrest was made for assault on an officer.

As the campus encampment crossed the two-week mark overnight Wednesday D.C. police broke up the gathering and arrested 33 pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Six of those arrested are current students the university said in a statement Thursday.

After that clearing of the tents dozens of protesters came back to campus and gathered at the intersection of 21st and H Street early Thursday evening before marching to F Street at around 8 p.m.

Seemingly peaceful

The group carried signs that read “We are not leaving” and chanted “Free free Palestine.” Marchers paused in front of the residence that’s traditionally occupied by the university’s president and chanted outside the home.

Then they marched down F Street where several administrative offices are also located — including the office of university President Ellen Granberg.

That’s where protesters put up several tents — the university’s student newspaper The Hatchet reported saying nine tents were pitched. Some participants also climbed the brick entrance to a university building nearby the tents.

WTOP's Scott Gelman reports from George Washington University as pro-Palestinian protesters return to campus.

Dozens of D.C. police officers some on bikes gathered on F Street and the surrounding area.

WTOP’s Scott Gelman reported a brief moment of pushing and shoving earlier in the evening when police on bicycles appeared to be attempting to control a sidewalk in front of a university building.

Outside of that scuffle the protest appeared to have remained peaceful.

WTOP has reached out to the university for comment. D.C. police told WTOP the department is monitoring the First Amendment activity.

All roads are open as of 1 a.m.

Protesters are back. Here’s how students are reacting

Among those in the crowd on H Street was GW student Reem Lababdi who told WTOP she was pepper sprayed in the back by D.C. police but not arrested Wednesday.

“We said we weren’t leaving and we meant it” Lababdi said in reference to the encampment. “We will not be pushed aside when our administration is funding the genocide of our people.”

The encampment which had been in place for 13 days was cleared early Wednesday morning by officers that deployed pepper spray and arrested 33 protesters who police said refused to vacate after six warnings.

Students from other nearby colleges including American University George Mason and the University of Maryland took part in the protests on GW’s campus.

Lababdi said protesters are there to send a message to Mayor Muriel Bowser congressional lawmakers and Granberg whom she criticized for allegedly declining to meet with student protesters.

“She would sooner brutalize her own students than come to the negotiating table with them” Lababdi said.

But there’s division among GW students about the protests.

David Delarosa a GW student told WTOP he encountered protesters on H Street while returning home from work Thursday.

“We have students here who just want to go to work want to go finish their finals go home enjoy their summer” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”

Protest organizers have called accusations that the demonstrations are antisemitic “baseless.” But some Jewish students have said they feel intimidated by the protests.

“Jews like myself feel threatened they feel scared and we just want to live our lives” he said.

Barriers around site of former encampment

The events Thursday come after fencing was installed around the GW’s University Yard. The fence barriers standing over 10 feet tall resemble those put in place around the Capitol building after the Jan. 6 2021 insurrection — and are now blocking all entrances of University Yard.

It is unclear how long the fences are expected to remain around the area.

When asked at a Wednesday news conference whether the encampment clearing meant there would be no more protests on GW’s campus D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said it was Granberg’s decision “to determine if she will allow protests in other areas of the campus.”

Smith said that no protests will take place in the now-secured area.

Smith said there were many indicators that the protests were becoming more volatile outlining intelligence that officers had been collecting over the days leading up to Wednesday. One of the concerning indicators Smith mentioned was that non-students were joining the protests on campus and had been found in secure campus buildings.

Granberg also said in a statement over the weekend that the protest had “been co-opted by individuals who are largely unaffiliated with our community and do not have our community’s best interest in mind.”

Arrest records show that the 33 arrested protesters ranged in age from 18 to 33 years old with most of them college-age.

Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the U.S. — and increasingly in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University in New York.

Some colleges cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war. Among those that have tolerated the tent encampments some universities have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life safety and the involvement of nonstudents.

Since April 18 just over 2600 people have been arrested on 50 campuses according to figures based on reporting by The Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.

It was nebulous in both the literal and figurative senses: amorphous still taking shaping edging on the precipice of potential. And it was being crushed under its own weight—until this nebula finally collapsed under its own gravity causing it to swirl faster and faster until it spun out into a flattened disk. As it did so the majority of its mass (99.8%) was pulled toward its center where it heated into a core and something bright hot and new was born: a star.

That particular star was the Sun the very same one that may be shining or setting outside your window wherever on Earth you are reading these words. As for the rest of the matter that made up the solar nebula—that tiny figure less than half of a percentage—some of it was whisked away on the star’s solar winds. The remainder scattered into the Sun’s newly-formed orbit eventually arranging into rocks and planets plants and animals people and all our plights.

Despite how our lives revolve around it the Sun is an average star (size-wise). It sustains itself the way all stars do through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms which create other elements in their cores. The energy from these reactions keeps the star from collapsing in on itself. After a star fuses all of its hydrogen its core starts to collapse and become even hotter; expanding outward average stars become red giants. Over time they eject their outermost layers until their cores are exposed becoming white dwarfs that will cool and fade away into the night sky.

Massive stars—those that are five times the mass of the Sun— meet a different fate. As their hotter cores collapse nuclear reactions will produce iron using so much energy that the star has nothing left to protect itself from collapsing completely. In the blink of an eye it shrinks from 5000 to 12 miles wide. Temperatures hit over 100 billion degrees as the core explodes releasing a dazzling burst of energy and light: what’s known as a supernova. The iron and other elements are scattered across the galaxy to reform in new combinations: new nebulas new stars new life.

And so stars are the building blocks of the universe. They create and disseminate the heavier elements that allow for life as we know it: carbon nitrogen oxygen iron and so on. You have likely heard that you are stardust and it’s true. The iron in your blood the oxygen in your lungs the carbon that is found in all life on Earth—these elements only came to be during the life and death of these celestial phenomena these forces that hang suspended in the sky.

Humanity has always searched the stars for answers whether through navigation prophecy or clues to our wider universe. They are the lights we look up to find our way stories we have drawn in the lines between them. What we are seeing is ourselves our makers. When I feel overwhelmed by my own daily dramas when I am on the verge of collapsing under their gravity I remind myself of this: that I am here because of exploding supernovas. That I can be light when I need to and that I can also be iron. That I am still shaping still expanding. That someday I too will burn out and become part of everything else but burn so brightly before I do.

The image at the start of this newsletter was taken by NASA’s James Webb telescope of a star being formed: the disk suspended there in the center. When I look at it I see time and an hourglass. I see endlessness the infinite cosmic recycling system of unimaginable proportions that binds this universe. I see all of it—everything ancient and new matter scattered across the void across nothing into something something spectacular. Something like you and me.",,,,,,,,,

We’ve all been through disruption recently. It feels like a decade of change crammed into a couple of years. But change has always been a constant and we’re all deeply curious about the future of technology. It’s important to know how your industry is changing and what you can do to equip yourself and your business with the resilience to adapt to this changing landscape.

Making your businesses more resilient is critical. Maybe it’s managing through a labor shortage or dealing with supply chain disruptions. We’ve all experienced difficulty in the last few years and we’ve all learned lessons.

In a world where things are constantly changing we need to be willing to change how we get things done. We need to acknowledge that how we’ve done things in the past may not be what’s needed for the future. It’s time to imagine new ways of working to enable us and our businesses to thrive.

Embracing digital transformation

You may already be embracing digital transformation – connecting your data your processes and most importantly your people. The way we collaborate has changed — and it’s changed forever. It’s about time that the software tools you rely on keep up.

There are many tools available today from so many providers. Some of them are closed and leave processes disconnected. They force you to build manual workflows and figure out how to pass huge files back and forth. As you do this may overshare valuable data – your intellectual property. And let’s face it: no one likes an over-sharer.

Data gets lost in translation and needs to be patched back together — over and over again. And when data and processes are disconnected teams are too. People stay stuck in their silos confined to whatever phase of the project lifecycle they work on. And so do the unique insights they bring to the table.

It’s time for us to disrupt ourselves and pursue different ways of working.

Introducing Autodesk Platform Services

Last year Autodesk started to build a platform that helps connect your processes and data in the cloud. We recently announced at Autodesk University 2022 that we’re now well on our way.

We’re making great progress in building three industry clouds:

Autodesk Fusion for Manufacturing Autodesk Flow for Media and Entertainment Autodesk Forma for Architecture Engineering and Construction

Each cloud will enable you to manage your assets and workflows more efficiently to connect the right people to the right data at the right time.

These Autodesk industry clouds aren’t simply incremental improvements to the software you already have. They will help drive an entirely new way of working. Helping you connect the entire lifecycle of your projects. They’ll bring the capabilities you know and love from the current Autodesk portfolio together in new and powerful ways that will transform the way you work.

Autodesk Fusion

For decades manufacturing companies have locked down their processes making their production as lean and efficient as possible. But with the pandemic teams who were used to working in person were suddenly distributed. Standalone tools serving standalone departments couldn’t flex to meet everyone’s needs.

Today manufacturing requires tools that are fluid not rigid. Tools that enable teams to work with agility and with all their stakeholders. This is the vision for our manufacturing cloud Autodesk Fusion.

If you’re currently using Fusion 360 you know how quickly it helps you iterate. That’s because we’ve worked hard to unify design simulation electronics CAM – and of course data management. And with your project data unified in the cloud we’re automating many processes to eliminate both guesswork and grunt work.

Soon you’ll be able to create part designs and generate toolpaths automatically. You’ll even be able to generate drawings and dimensions automatically. But the cloud is going to take Fusion much further.

Connecting the top floor to the shop floor

We want all data relevant to a product’s development – how it’s designed how it performs how it’s manufactured – to be unified and flow throughout your organization. From the top floor to the shop floor.

Shop floors are tremendously dynamic environments where downtime is costly. In addition to manufacturing processes we’re also digitizing shop floor scheduling purchasing and inventory management with Fusion Operations which we’re integrating into the Fusion cloud. Additionally we’re bringing Fusion to mobile devices that shop floor staff rely on.

Building fluid tools that span every phase of a project takes time but we’re making huge progress on the foundation — the shared set of services and APIs that will make all three industry clouds accessible extensible and open.

Open standards for a flexible future

We’ll be building a lot more functionality into the services over time so that you can use them to extend and connect our products streamline your workflows and integrate other tools you rely on.

And you can take advantage of the applications and extensions that third parties have built to remove friction and add value to your business today. For example a Fusion plugin for immediate feedback on the cost and manufacturability of your parts. There are many great options that are ready for you to use.

Platform services and APIs sit at the heart of our cloud environments. And so does a central cloud information model. It’s where the different representations of a product come together in one central location.

And each collaborator can access just the data that they need when they need it share it with the right stakeholders and move it between solutions critical to your operations. Whether that’s Autodesk tools or other products you rely on.

Open standards make that possible. They’re a key area of investment for Autodesk because we want your teams to be connected throughout the entire project lifecycle and beyond no matter what software you use. Open standards ensure our platform remains an open ecosystem that our tools — as well as third-party tools — can plug into.

This is about more than your adoption of digital tools. It’s about transforming the way you work with more fluid connected and informed workflows.

The Autodesk Health Dashboard listed most cloud applications such as Fusion and Autodesk Construction Cloud applications as ""degraded performance"" for most of the day. But two virtual design and construction professionals for major U.S. contractors that ENR spoke with said the applications were completely inaccessible and not having them working interrupted collaboration and work on some of their firms' projects.

""This issue has now been resolved and all Autodesk Products and Services were returned to full service. We are sorry for the frustration this caused customers and are immediately taking steps to ensure we prevent this from occurring again in the future.""

One contractor ENR spoke to said all of the services it uses were back up and running by the morning of Nov. 18 after a ""brief hiccup"" interrupted service that morning as well. Another VDC professional said it was impossible to continue work on their projects on Nov. 17 because of the nature of the cloud services it uses as any changes made offline in its Autodesk products could not be saved and would be overwritten when the cloud services came back online.

Other users wrote to @Autodesk about getting reimbursed a portion of their subscription costs for losing a day of work.

The Autodesk Identity Authorization Service is a cloud-based service that stores and manages login information for all of Autodesk's cloud products. Autodesk described the problem as a ""degradation"" of the service which could have been caused by anything from errors on the servers to too many individual cloud servers going offline.

Those extreme conditions don’t allow for humans to live there permanently but there are scientists and staff who spend part of the year there at stations conducting research—learning about the impact of climate change on Antarctica can help better understand and protect the environment.

British Antarctic Survey (BAS) the UK’s national polar research institute needed to replace six existing buildings that had reached their end of life. But construction in such an extreme climate is subject to numerous challenges. “Cambridge is a long way away from Antarctica about 15000 kilometers” says David Brand senior project manager at BAS. “If we miss something it’s not as though we could pop down to the local hardware store.”

In such tricky unforgiving and remote conditions what does it take to sustainably replace these important research buildings in Antarctica? Watch the video to find out how BAS along with technical advisor Ramboll construction partner BAM and engineering consultant Sweco is sustainably building for the future of research—and humankind.

[Video Transcript]

David Brand Senior Project Manager BAS: My first trip to Antarctica I was stunned by the immense vastness of the place. You can see for miles: icebergs mountains and also just the numerous amounts of wildlife that live in their natural habitat. It was truly remarkable. Antarctica holds the majority of the fresh water on this planet locked up in ice sheets and glaciers. We don’t want to see that melt into the oceans because one of the major impacts of climate change will be rising sea levels.

The British Antarctic Survey BAS has undertaken a 10-year program of construction. The Discovery building will replace six existing buildings that have reached the end of their life. These buildings provide the operational capability to ensure that more time is spent in delivery of science. Understanding the impacts that climate change will have in the Antarctic will enable us to better protect that environment to safeguard the world.

Cambridge is a long way away from Antarctica about 15000 kilometers. If we miss something it’s not as though we could pop down to the local hardware store. That presents a number of challenges namely it’s distance and logistics of getting materials equipment down there. There’s also a limited amount of resource that we can actually deploy. Each season we have a cap of about 50 construction workers. We really need to think carefully about how we could become more efficient at how we deliver our construction activity. It’s really important to BAS that we have a strong and long program of partnership because of the challenges that building in the Antarctic presents. Our three main partners are Ramboll our technical adviser; BAM our construction partner; and Sweco who works on really understanding the importance of how we can reduce our carbon emissions through smart engineering.

Bruce Wulff Framework Manager Ramboll: With so many different partners working on it and so many different engineers it’s imperative that we have a single model that everybody can relate to.

Stewart Craigie Technical Director Sweco: We use [Autodesk] BIM 360 because it gives us that collaborative way of working. It gives us a joint access to the model and it gives us the clear sequence of delivery.

Neil Irving Digital Construction Manager BAM: One of the main aspects of working in Antarctica is making things predictable and repeatable. The approach that we take is that we build it before we build it. We use digital tools as much as we can really to rehearse before we arrive on scene. Another way of rehearsing was to utilize the models in different ways. We were able to create a game whereby our excavator operatives were able to practice excavating around the tie rods which made up the wharf.

Wulff: We’re really breaking ground with a lot of this design. There’s no real design standards for Antarctica. You can’t really design a wharf to withstand a 40 megaton iceberg the size of a large building so you just have to weigh the risk with impact and come up with the most pragmatic solution.

Natalia Ford Sustainability Manager BAS: We’d like the Discovery building to be designed so that we use approximately 25% less marine gas oil across the site whilst we slowly transition using other projects to more renewable energy sources. BAS has a huge wealth of knowledge. There’s a message there for contractors designers project managers to start early with their sustainability thinking.

Irving: Understanding the behavior of the icebergs and floating sea ice we’re actually able to reduce the steel used in the wharf construction by 50%.

Ford: The partnership team that’s helping to create those buildings had to come at things differently in order to reach the kind of goals that we’ve set out to achieve.

Irving: Everybody is pulling in the same direction regardless of the company that we work for. We’ve had suppliers come into here in Cambridge in meetings with all four partners present and remarked that they actually can’t tell who works for who.

Wulff: A lot of clients talk about working collaboratively and in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. But it truly feels like we’re walking the walk here. There is no us and them. Hopefully it’s the way the industry is going to move to the next 10 years.

Brand: The drive towards achieving the best is felt amongst all the team and it fills me with huge excitements as well achievements actually delivering a new building which I can’t wait to see BAS operations and scientists use in their daily lives and hopefully make the world a better place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZ2Z4c3BlYWsuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVkL2F1dG9kZXNrLXR3aW5tb3Rpb24taW50ZXJvcGVyYWJpbGl0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Autodesk opts for Twinmotion for interoperability – GfxSpeak,"The move opens doors wide for metaverse applications.

Autodesk has been on board with metaverse since Autodesk University 2021 and the company furthered its commitment at AU 22 with its announced plan to provide teams with Twinmotion for its Revit users. Twinmotion is Epic Games’ visualization tool created for CAD designers. The idea is that it lets users create dynamic visualizations of projects with just a few settings.

Autodesk’s work with Epic is part of the company’s ongoing work to further integrate the digital and physical worlds but more to the point in this case Autodesk has pledged to increase interoperability between third-party tools for better workflows.

Autodesk and Epic announced the first fruits of their collaboration in 2021 with the revelation of an Unreal Live Link for Maya plug-in which allowed content creators to stream data from Maya to Unreal in real-time.

The latest release of Revit Revit 2023.1 with Twinmotion access represents the first integration of Autodesk’s planned integrations of complementary tools for extended reality workflows.

All Revit subscribers will have access to Twinmotion. That includes stand-alone Revit AEC Collection Flex (Autodesk’s pay-as-you-go option) and Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) subscriptions. Customers will be able to launch Twinmotion for Revit directly from the Revit ribbon.

This AEC Autodesk Twinmotion relationship is a first step but the companies are also planning to develop experiences for M&E and manufacturing. Both are members of the industrywide Metaverse Standards Forum.

For more information see Autodesk’s Revit blog and the Epic blog.

What do we think?

The metaverse is coming. Sure sure there are many who put it in the same category as cryptoanything but Twinmotion is an example of something that can create an immersive experience almost instantly. That is invaluable in industry and in art. Game engines are demonstrating their flexibility for multiple uses and the Metaverse Standards Forum is committed to smoothing the way for developers… all steps on the way to new metaverse applications.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9kZXNrLmNvbS9ibG9ncy9jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24vYnVpbGRpbmctcXVhbGl0eS1hc3N1cmFuY2UtYWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What the Building Quality Assurance Act means for Dutch construction – and how to prepare - Digital Builder,"The Building Quality Assurance Act Wet Kwaliteitsborging voor het Bouwen is set to be introduced in mid 2023 and will radically change the building system regulations for the Dutch built environment. The new legislation will impact many stakeholders from construction businesses and municipalities to building owners and consumers.

The objective of the act is to produce better quality buildings with fewer issues – especially when it comes to delivering much needed housing supply in the Netherlands. It also aims to put Dutch consumers in a much clearer position and unite the building supply chain to deliver better outcomes on construction projects.

We’ve developed a white paper to help organisations understand the impact of the Building Quality Assurance Act – and propose how to prepare today.

Download the full white paper How the Dutch construction industry can prepare for The Building Quality Assurance Act

The key changes

Changes to licensing and enforcement of building permits and liabilities are the main drivers of the act. For Dutch contractors they will experience the biggest impact as they will now hold greater responsibility for meeting regulatory requirements.

For the Dutch government enforcing better standards when it comes to construction will not only help to deliver better quality buildings but it will also support fire safety measures and support sustainability ambitions to help create more energy efficient buildings.

But the new changes will go further than quality and safety alone. These regulations will transform the way construction is approached – with a requirement for a shared thread of information to be captured from planning right through to execution.

The act will be introduced in gradual phases – allowing the industry to adjust to the new ways of working. Until 2025 the changes will only apply to simple structures. These are for example single-family homes and smaller business premises.

How will this impact my business?

Owners: Whether an individual or a large entity knowing your responsibilities when it comes to obtaining environmental permits is important.

It’s critical to check if the building falls under the consequence class 1 and engage an independent quality assurance officer if this is the case before building commences. They will also supply an assurance plan based on the risk assessment carried out. The responsibility lies with the project owner to supply this document to the municipality.

Main contractors: Many main contractors have been looking to improve the quality and depth of information they provide to owners for some time. But the new regulations will require an even greater level of transparency and information sharing. These changes will help contractors to build right first time – ultimately reducing delays costly rework and waste as well as improving on-site safety. It is the responsibility of main contractors to understand the risks and measures needed for the successful compliance to the new system on any given project.

Subcontractors and supply chain partners: Contractors will pass on these extra responsibilities and increased liability to their subcontractors. This may drive changes in how new contracts are drawn up. All supply chain partners will be expected to improve their internal quality controls to meet the additional requirements. All subcontractors will need to provide good evidence that their workforce is properly skilled to deliver on a project and that all work is completed and compliant. Capturing information digitally means key project data will become more accessible for the first time which could bring a number of benefits.

How technology can help

Technology will be critical for all construction stakeholders. It can play a key role in enabling construction companies to meet the Wet Kwaliteitsborging voor het Bouwen requirements whilst improving how teams work. There are some capabilities that will be central for companies to comply with and others that will enhance workflows and add value.

Positively there are tried and tested workflows and tools that can help firms of every size to prepare – and firms that are just starting on their digital journeys can learn from those that have been there before.

Common data environments (CDEs) can provide a secure accessible place to store all project data plans photos forms and certificates. A strong CDE solution will include approval controls and offer an audit trail to support sign off procedures of documents and certificates.

Construction management software can help to prove compliance during the build phase and connect the design and build phases more seamlessly.

Importantly technology can not only enable businesses to demonstrate their compliance with the new legislation but also gives firms the data needed to improve outcomes like productivity and sustainability.

It is also possible to continue to add high value capabilities like design coordination tools or digital twins so organisations can keep improving their performance and be ready for future developments.

The foundations for better

By requiring a far greater level of information-sharing and transparency across the industry the Dutch government is paving the way for better outcomes for all. By establishing best practices now companies can not only meet the needs of the Wet Kwaliteitsborging voor het Bouwen but also prepare themselves for additional future trends. By introducing more efficient and productive ways of working there is no doubt we’ll build a safer and stronger industry for all.

It's critical that every construction stakeholder understands the changes ahead and gets prepared. While the legislation will initially apply to simple structures it will be extended to all structures by 2025 – and the changes will impact everyone in the industry in some way.

It’s also important to embrace the positives that the legislation offers. We have a chance to evaluate how we work and establish best practice in construction creating an industry we’re all proud to work in and deliver better outcomes for society in the Netherlands overall."

By combining the power of a cloud-based data ecosystem with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 3M HIS is transforming physician workflows and laborious “back office” processes to help healthcare organizations streamline clinical documentation and billing enhance security and compliance and redesign the physician-patient experience.

The cloud served as the foundation for this transformation. Migrating its 3MTM 360 EncompassTM System clients to Amazon Web Services (AWS) is helping 3M HIS improve the capture management and analysis of patient information across the continuum of care. 3M 360 Encompass is a collection of applications that work together to help hospitals streamline processes receive accurate reimbursement promote compliance and make data-informed decisions. The cloud-based version of the platform has helped 3M HIS and its clients address three primary challenges: a disjointed patient care journey; the byzantine processes that often inhibit timely and accurate billing reimbursement and other record-keeping; and the ongoing need to protect and properly use patient data.

Improving the patient care journey with data and the cloud

The broader objective of 3M HIS’s evolving cloud transformation strategy is to help caregivers improve patient outcomes and staff efficiencies by removing barriers to care and providing access to contextually relevant insights at the time of care according to Detlef Koll Vice President of Product Development with 3M HIS. Caregivers now work with consistent reliable tools within 3M 360 Encompass that improve communication and reduce the types of errors and delays that cause patient anxiety and revenue cycle inefficiencies.

The journey a patient takes through the healthcare system can span years and touch multiple providers from primary care to specialists test labs medical imaging and pharmacies. During each step multiple types of data are captured in the patient’s medical record which serves as an ongoing “narrative” of the patient’s clinical condition and the care delivered. Physician notes from visits and procedures test results and prescriptions are captured and added to the patient’s chart and reviewed by medical coding specialists who work with tens of thousands of codes used by insurance companies to authorize billing and reimbursement.

A complete compliant structured and timely clinical note created in the electronic health record (EHR) empowers many downstream users and is essential for delivering collaborative care and driving appropriate reimbursement. Supporting physicians with cloud-based speech-enabled documentation workflows 3M HIS further creates time to care by delivering proactive patient-specific and in-workflow clinical insights as the note is being created.

The goal of this automated computer-assisted physician documentation (CAPD) technology is to reduce the cognitive overload on physicians regarding coding requirements while closing gaps in patient care and clinical documentation. Without CAPD closing that loop in real time errors or ambiguities in the clinical note lead to what Koll describes as an “asynchronous” process requiring physicians to review and correct the note on a patient seen days earlier thus taking the physician’s time away from patient care and causing delays in the revenue cycle.

To address the issue 3M HIS needed a way to semantically integrate information from multiple data sources based on the needs of various use cases so it deployed AWS data management tools and services including Amazon RDS Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena for what Koll calls “opportunistic aggregation of information.” For example for billing coding the platform extracts only the relevant billable elements such as an office visit for which a claim will be submitted. This type of flexible cloud-based data management allows 3M HIS to aggregate different data sets for different purposes ensuring both data integrity and faster processing. “This is a dynamic view on data that evolves over time” said Koll.

Improving workflows through intelligent automated processes

The process for gathering data about a patient’s care then extracting the billable elements to submit to an insurance company for reimbursement has long been handled by professional coders who can accurately tag each medical procedure with the correct code out of tens of thousands of possibilities. Errors in that process can lead to rejected claims and additional time required by caregivers to correct any gaps or inconsistencies in clinical documentation which in turn delays cash flows across the complex network of physicians hospitals labs pharmacies suppliers and insurers.

3M HIS’s cloud transformation strategy addressed this challenge by giving clients access to a new suite of data management and AI/ML tools that deliver levels of processing power functionality and scale unthinkable in the former on-premises model.

“If you had to build some of the capabilities yourself you would probably never get there”

said Michael Dolezal Vice President of 3M Digital Science Community. With AWS tools such as Amazon QuickSight and Amazon SageMaker 3M HIS’s clients can “get there” today: “Now our clients not only have a cloud-based instance for their data but they gain access to tools they never had before and get the ability to do things they otherwise wouldn’t” Dolezal said. By bringing 3M 360 Encompass to the AWS Cloud 3M HIS has been able to scale natural language processing and automation capabilities and leverage tools such as Amazon Textract to improve data input and processing to more efficiently organize a patient’s chart.

Automatic speech recognition to capture the clinical narrative at the point of care along with AWS AI/ML services helps 3M HIS aggregate structure and contextualize data to enable the development of task-specific workflow applications. For instance to mitigate the administrative burden on physicians real-time dictation and transcription workflows can be enhanced with automated closed-loop CAPD whereby a physician dictating an admit note can be “nudged” that a certain condition is not fully specified in the note and can fix the gap in real time.

Taking frontline physician-assistive solutions to the next level embedded virtual assistant technology can automate everyday tasks like placing orders for medications and tests. Innovating incrementally toward smarter and more automated workstreams the 3M HIS ambient clinical documentation solution makes documentation in the EHR a byproduct of the natural patient-physician conversation and not a separate onerous task for the doctor. This frees the physician to focus completely on the patient during the visit thereby transforming the experience of healthcare for all stakeholders.

“We want to reduce the inefficient steps in the old model by unifying and information-enabling workflows so that documentation of the procedure and the coding of that procedure are no longer separate work steps” said Koll. “It has the potential to save hours of time per day for a doctor.”

Enhancing the security of patient data

The security and governance of patient data is non-negotiable in healthcare an industry subject to the most stringent data privacy regulations. Administrators are obligated to make sure patient data is consistently used only for its intended purpose is processed only by the application it was collected for and stored and retained according to the specific national regulations involved. The cloud gives 3M HIS more confidence that the data passing through its platform remains secure throughout its journey.

“Using a cloud-based solution means you can apply the same security practices and protocol monitoring across all of your data in a very consistent way” said Dolezal. The platform ensures a shared responsibility for security across 3M HIS its clients and AWS.

Securing patient data in an on-premises health information system puts the onus to protect that information on the client’s infosec team with risks compounded by each client’s unique IT infrastructure and internal data access policies. Security by design is one of the underlying operating principles for AWS. With a single set of code to monitor maintain and patch 3M HIS is able to keep its platform current quickly respond to new threats and vigorously protect patient data centrally with more certainty that its clients are protected as well.

4 best practices for data-driven transformation

Dolezal and Koll advise anyone considering moving large sets of data to the cloud to follow some fundamental precepts in designing a new solution:

Start with the client and work backward to a solution: Be clear on the problem you want to solve and the outcomes you want to deliver to the caregiver and patient and work backward from there to identify the right technology tools and services to help achieve those goals. Don’t over-engineer the solution: Many IT organizations are moving away from traditional point solutions for collecting storing and analyzing patient information. To reduce complexity enhance security and improve flexibility consider an end-to-end solution that is easier to deploy and update than traditional on-premises solutions and lets organizations add new functionality incrementally. Bake in security from the start: In highly regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services security regulations demand high levels of security and personal privacy protection. These capabilities must be built in as foundational components of any system used to collect manage and analyze that data. Don’t constrain native data: Create a data management strategy that accommodates all types of data and isn’t confined to a specific set of use cases today. With both structured and unstructured data flowing into the system the future ability to analyze the past means having data schema that doesn’t need to be re-architected.

In an intense environment with a relentless focus on cost reduction and improved clinical outcomes in conjunction with greater patient and physician well-being 3M HIS helps clients efficiently capture and access patient data gain meaningful insights from all the data and drive high-value action to meet complex goals.

These tools differ from traditional observability tools that focus on troubleshooting application performance or security issues and offer budget friendly alternatives.

Data observability is not only monitoring and logging collecting metrics and being able to trace metrics over time. It interprets and makes sense of the data tracked and monitored and the created relationships between various data sources.

""Data observability tools allow organizations to solve problems by using integrated single-source-of-truth data stores"" said Cindy LaChapelle principal consultant at ISG a global technology research and advisory firm.

These tools use automation and artificial intelligence technologies to sift through large amounts of seemingly disparate data streams analyze them and centralize and integrate the results into a single source of truth.

With the growing amount of diverse data sources businesses must provide big-picture views of their environments and enable faster more automated solutions for identifying and fixing issues.

""Data observability tools allow businesses to be proactive whereas today they are mainly reactive"" LaChapelle said.

Why choose data observability open source tools Enterprises have plenty of commercial data observability tools to choose from. Commercial tools have some key advantages in terms of scalability automation and support. However data observability open source tools allow teams to experiment with data observability capabilities with no upfront licensing costs. They might also do a better job at complementing existing data engineering workflows and tools. ""If an organization has highly customized observability needs it's often easiest to meet these demands with a combination of in-house development and open source resources"" said Steven Zhang director of data engineering at Hippo Insurance. Open source platforms tend to have a more flexible architecture than commercial options but the open source platform might also require deeper business knowledge and skills to customize and evolve the platform over time. Open source tools also allow enterprises to experiment with basic data observability features to see what capabilities provide the most value and how they can complement existing workflows. This can help teams evaluate commercial tools once they understand what they need. Open source tools could help address cost concerns and prevent vendor lock-in LaChapelle said. Over time the requirements and needs of the business change and open source solutions offer more flexibility over premium tools. Open source platforms tend to have a more flexible architecture than commercial solutions but the open source platform might also require deeper business knowledge and skills to customize and evolve the platform over time.

Setting up open source tools Some organizations prefer to explore and build their own data observability practices when they operate on a large scale have mature IT processes and have a good critical mass of data engineering talent in-house said Sumit Misra vice president of data engineering at LatentView Analytics an analytics consultancy. However teams should plan for a considerable engineering effort to bring all the right pieces together. ""A single open source data observability tool usually doesn't have all the features required to enable complete visibility into an enterprise's data systems"" said Alisha Mittal vice president at Everest Group an advisory firm. Some tools are helpful for log and metric collection while others specialize in log and event tracing. Similarly some are good at visualization while others efficiently store event and metrics data. Enterprises usually must use a few of these tools in confluence to get that visibility. Teams need to look at more tools and components when they have a multi-lingual data architecture. Also though there are no licensing costs enterprises need to budget for restructuring and upskilling their workforce. ""The key here is to identify which tools complement each other and work well together"" Mittal said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0yNDExOC000gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Machine learning and ontology in eCoaching for personalized activity level monitoring and recommendation ...,"In this study we have established a theoretical eCoaching concept for personalized activity monitoring goal management and lifestyle recommendation generation following the standard guidelines. For the same we have used established statistical methods and ML models to analyze both public and private activity datasets for adults (age range 18–64). Afterwards we have shown a direction to combine the result of the classifiers with semantic rules to generate personalized recommendation for automatic activity coaching.

The overall process (see Fig. 5) includes data collection data pre-processing semantic presentation of data statistical analysis data visualization feature ranking and selection ML model training testing and evaluation and semantic rules for personalized recommendation generation. Activity data for elderly children athlete bodybuilder and pregnant women are beyond the scope of this study as we have not collected data for them. We have followed the Standards for Reporting Implementation (StaRI) for this study (see “Appendix B”). All methods have been carried out following the regulations and relevant guidelines in the “Ethical approval and consent to participate” section.

Data collection

Public fitbit dataset

We have used an anonymous Fitbit dataset (“dailyActivity_merged”) for adults available via “Zenodo”42 for the initial ML model training and testing. The description of the dataset is outlined in “Appendix A.4”. We found two datasets from: mturkfitbit_export_3.12.16-4.11.16 and mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16. Therefore we have merged two datasets into a single dataset. The dataset has various features related to the activity; however we have selected the following relevant features—timestamp total daily steps LPA minutes MPA minutes VPA minutes and sedentary minutes based on feature analysis to maintain the focus of this study. We have used this public dataset to discover the best-performing classifiers with the defined features in a multiclass classification problem. Then we applied the best performing model to the real-time datasets using transfer learning and an incremental learning approach for daily activity level classification.

Private MOX2-5 dataset

We have collected anonymous activity data from sixteen adults in Sothern-Norway (Agder region) for one month using the MOX2-5 wearable medical-grade (CE approved) activity sensor43 following the ethical guidelines and a signed consent. Based on an agreement with “University of Agder Grimstad Norway” NSD—The Norwegian Centre for Research Data AS has assessed that the processing of personal data in this project is in accordance with data protection legislation. The detailed description of the MOX2-5 dataset is summarized in “Appendix A.5”.

After feature analysis the selected features are timestamp activity intensity (IMA) sedentary seconds weight-bearing seconds standing seconds LPA seconds MPA seconds VPA seconds and steps per minute. The “step” and “IMA” are the most valuable and strong features of the MOX2-5 datasets as other attributes (except the timestamp) are almost derived (e.g. LPA MPA and VPA are derived from IMA as defined in Table 5). IMA has a strong relation with steps. In MOX2-5 sensor sedentary time refers to the non-activity duration including leisure time and sleep time. The relation between sedentary and active (LPA/MPA/VPA) can be written as—

$$\sum \left( {{\text{sedentary}}\;{\text{active}}\;{\text{weight}} - {\text{bearing}}\{\text{standing}}} \right) = 60\{\text{seconds}}$$ (1)

Data processing and preparation

Nature of data and data volume

The selected temporal activity data are continuous for both datasets. The detailed descriptions about the data attributes can be found in “Appendices A.6” and “A.7”. For the classification we have converted the continuous data to discrete form by removing the timestamp feature. Furthermore we have removed participants' data which are less than one month redundant noisy incomplete or missing. In the public Fitbit datasets we have decided to consider activity data for 33 participants as they have performed activities for more than a month resulting in 1397 records in total. In the MOX2-5 private datasets we have considered data for 16 participants as they have performed activities more than a month resulting in 539 records in total (see details in “Appendix A.6”).

Statistical testing

Normality test with methods such as Shapiro–Wilk D’Agostino’s Kˆ2 and Anderson–Darling test44 on each feature of the datasets have revealed that data samples do not have Gaussian characteristics. The normality test has been performed following the hypothesis testing method with P value > α = 0.05 (i.e. sample looks like gaussian) and P value < α = 0.05 (i.e. sample does not look like gaussian)44.

Feature selection for individual datasets

For the feature selection we have performed methods such as SelectKBest recursive feature elimination (RFE) principal component analysis (PCA) ExtraTreesClassifier ML pipeline with PCA and SelectKBest and the correlation analysis. SelectKBest is a univariate feature selection and feature ranking method with statistical testing (e.g. chi-squared). RFE selects optimal features and assigns a rank after removing redundant features recursively. PCA is an unsupervised data reduction method that uses linear algebra to reduce data dimensions. It ranks features based on variance ratio. ExtraTreesClassifier is a bagging-based feature importance (or ranking) method.

Moreover correlation analysis is a statistical method used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two variables and compute their association. A high correlation signifies a strong relationship between the two variables and a low correlation means that the variables are weakly related. The sample correlation coefficient (r) measures the closeness of association of the variables. ""r"" ranges from − 1 to + 1 where − 1 indicates a perfectly linear negative i.e. inverse correlation (sloping downward) and + 1 shows a linear positive correlation. ""r"" close to 0 suggests little if any correlation. Correlation methods are of the following two types: (a) Pearson correlation: it evaluates the linear relationship between two continuous variables (b) Spearman correlation: It considers the monotonic or non-Gaussian relationship. Our used datasets have shown a non-Gaussian relationship with normality testing methods. The correlation analysis45 with the “spearman” method revealed the strength of the linear relationship between features and helped to determine which feature to retain or not4446474849. We have considered removing features if they showed a powerful dependency score (r ≥ 0.72).

Combining features from datasets

First we have performed feature ranking and feature selection from public Fitbit datasets based on adopted correlation method and created an optimal feature-set (FS-1). Second we have performed the same feature selection method on private MOX2-5 datasets and created an optimal feature-set (FS-2). Then we have performed an intersection of FS-1 and FS-2 to create a common feature space (or final feature-set) to make transfer learning approach relevant for this study (see Fig. 6).

Figure 6 Combining features from both the datasets to prepare final feature-set. Full size image

Data labeling for classification

The “active” feature represents five classes—sedentary (0) low active (1) active (2) medium active (3) and highly active (4). The rule for the “Activity Level” feature class creation is defined in Table 2. We have created the feature class “Activity Level” based on the daily step-count following the standard guidelines505152. In the multi-feature-based classification problem we have derived the feature class “Activity Level” based on the steps LPA MPA and VPA following the WHO activity guidelines for adults5. The features such as age gender weight weight-bearing standing are out of the scope. The class distributions in multi-class classification for both the datasets are depicted in Figs. 7 and 8.

Model training and testing

ML models

This study has performed multi-class classification with standard ML algorithms as in Table 6 and followed by an empirical comparison testing. We have used ML classifiers instead of deep learning classifiers because of the following reasons: convex optimization technique in gradient descent to find global minima small amounts of training data lesser model training time training on a central processing unit (CPU) computationally inexpensive in terms of time and space and transparency.

Table 6 Machine learning classifier models with optimization algorithms. Full size table

Regularizations (L1-norm and L2-norm) have not been added to the models due to the limited set of features. Support vector classifier (SVC)53 is a supervised learning method to classify support vectors (or data points) using a decision plane or hyperplane to maximize the margin. It follows an iterative approach to generate the best hyperplane. SVC uses the “kernel” trick to convert low-dimensional input space to high-dimensional input space to make datapoints separable. The Linear kernel uses dot (.) product in two observation vectors. Radial basis function (RBF) kernel uses gamma (γ) (⋲ {01}) to map input datapoint space to infinite-dimensional space. Naïve Bayes (NB)54 is a supervised classification method based on the Bayes theorem assuming that features are independent of each other. In Bayesian classification posterior probabilities are determined to decide which feature-set will belong to which class based on the prior probabilities. NB can be classified into the following categories based on the nature of datasets: Gaussian multinomial and Bernoulli. Both SVC and NB are efficient classifiers on low data volume. K-nearest neighbors (KNN)55 is a supervised non-parametric method to cluster similar group data points based on different distance metrics such as Euclidean Hamming Manhattan and Minkowski. Decision Tree (DT)5455 is a supervised predictive model to classify datasets based on the conditions. In classification DT the decision variables at each node are categorical. It uses either “Gini” or “Entropy” criteria to generate binary splits. Random forest (RF)55 classifier uses a bagging ensemble learning method that combines multitude of decision trees during training time to improve prediction accuracy and reduce model variance. The final prediction of RF model is determined by estimating the average of all predictions from the individual estimators.

Furthermore we have used a DummyClassifier as a simple baseline to compare against other more complex classifiers as mentioned in Table 6. It makes predictions that ignore the input features. We have used its strategy parameter as “most_frequent”.

Training and testing

To better utilize the data initially we have shuffled the dataset then split the dataset into training and testing. To boost the performance of the machine learning model we have used a k-fold cross-validation where k ≥ 5. Furthermore we have used Grid Search56 hyperparameter optimization technique for model tuning. The technique has helped in an appropriate selection of learning rate (alpha (α)) in the gradient descent algorithm and a proper selection of other components such as criterion and max_depth in the tree-based models. Gradient descent follows a convex optimization technique with an upper limit (L) and a lower limit (µ) on curvature f:

$$\upmu {\text{I}}_{{\text{d}}} \le {\text{d}}^{2} {\text{f}}\left( {\text{x}} \right) \le {\text{LI}}_{{\text{d}}} $$ (2)

where d2f.(x) is the Hessian (H) µ > 0 I = Identity matrix and L = Lipschitz continuous.

We have executed each ML classification model for five times and calculated their mean performance scores for a comparative analysis. The general pseudocode we have used to train and test the classifier models is stated as follows:

Evaluation metrics

In this multi-class classification problem we have focused only on discrimination analysis. The discrimination analysis metrics are precision recall specificity accuracy score F1 score classification report and confusion matrix. A confusion matrix is a 2-dimensional table (“actual” vs “predicted”) and both dimensions have “True Positives (TP)” “False Positives (FP)” “True Negatives (TN)” and “False Negatives (FN)”4446474849. Equations to calculate classification metrices are:

$${\text{Accuracy}}\left( {\text{A}} \right) = \frac{{\left( {{\text{TP}} + {\text{TN}}} \right) }}{{\left( {{\text{TP}} + {\text{FP}} + {\text{FN}} + {\text{TN}}} \right)}}\;0 \le \frac{{\left( {\text{A}} \right) }}{{\left( {100} \right)}} \le 1$$ (3)

$${\text{Precision}}\\left( {\text{P}} \right) = \frac{{\left( {{\text{TP}}} \right){ }}}{{\left( {{\text{TP}} + {\text{FP}}} \right)}}$$ (4)

$${\text{Recall}}\\left( {\text{R}} \right)\;{\text{or}}\;{\text{Sensitivity}}\;\left( {\text{S}} \right)\;{\text{or}}\;{\text{True}}\;{\text{positive}}\;{\text{rate}} = \frac{{\left( {{\text{TP}}} \right){ }}}{{\left( {{\text{TP}} + {\text{FN}}} \right)}}$$ (5)

$${\text{Specificity}}\\left( {\text{S}} \right) = \left( {{1} - {\text{Sensitivity}}} \right) = \frac{{\left( {{\text{TN}}} \right){ }}}{{\left( {{\text{TN}} + {\text{FP}}} \right)}}$$ (6)

$${\text{F}}1\;{\text{score}}\\left( {{\text{F}}1} \right) = \frac{{\left( {2*{\text{P}}*{\text{R}}} \right) }}{{\left( {{\text{P}} + {\text{R}}} \right)}}\quad 0 \le \frac{{\left( {{\text{F}}1} \right) }}{{\left( {100} \right)}} \le 1$$ (7)

$${\text{Matthew's}}\;{\text{correlation}}\;{\text{coefficient}}\left( {{\text{MCC}}} \right) = \frac{{\left( {{\text{TP}}\left( {{\text{TP}}*{\text{TN}} - {\text{FP}}*{\text{FN}}} \right) } \right) }}{{\surd \left( {\left( {{\text{TP}} + {\text{FP}}} \right)\left( {{\text{TP}} + {\text{FN}}} \right)\left( {{\text{TN}} + {\text{FP}}} \right)\left( {{\text{TN}} + {\text{FN}}} \right)} \right) }} - 1 \le \frac{{\left( {{\text{MCC}}} \right) }}{{\left( {100} \right)}} \le + 1.$$ (8)

Accuracy tells how close a measured value is to the actual one. Recall or sensitivity suggests the exact number of positive measures. Precision means how relative the measured value is to the actual one. Furthermore we used cross-validation score to determine overfitting and underfitting validation curve to determine bias versus variance and learning curve to visualize the convergence status of training score with the cross-validation score. Bias is an error due to erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm and variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High bias leads to underfitting and the high variance results in overfitting. Accuracy and F1 scores can be misleading because they do not fully account for the sizes of the four categories of the confusion matrix in the final score calculation. MCC is more informative than the F1 score and accuracy because it considers the balanced ratios of the four confusion matrix categories (for example true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives). The F1 score depends on which class is defined as a positive class. However MCC does not depend on which class is the positive class which has an advantage over the F1 score and avoids incorrectly defining the positive class57.

We have also tested if the standardization technique on the entire dataset before learning and the “Feature Union” tool during feature extraction can improve the performance of the models or not by reducing data leakage (if any!). In standardization scaling technique values spread with mean (µ) = 0 and standard deviation (SD or σ) = 1. Furthermore our ontology model has been evaluated against reasoning time and SPARQL query execution time in Protégé and Jena Fuseki server. We have used reasoner such as HermiT Pellet Fact++ RacerPro and KAON2 available in Protégé for the verification of structural and logical consistencies in the ontology model.

Rules for recommendation generation

A knowledge base is a database for knowledge management and provides means for information to be collected organized shared searched and inferred. It comprises two types of statements: asserted and inferred. The inferred statements are logical consequences of asserted statements and logical rules. A knowledge base is used to store and manipulate knowledge in computer science interpreting invaluable information. It is often used in artificial intelligence applications and research for better understanding of a subject in computer-understandable form using appropriate symbols. In general a ruleset is applied to the systems that involve human-designed or managed sets of rules. A knowledge base may contain semantic rules with human-understandable symbols and words. Semantic misunderstanding occurs when people assign different meanings to the same word or phrase. In this study we have stored semantic rules (see “Appendix A.3”) in a knowledge base that combines ML classification results with preference variables to generate personalized recommendations based on the query execution in the SPARQL query engine (see Fig. 5).

Conceptualization of automatic activity coaching

The eCoach prototype system aims to collect individual activity data from wearable activity sensors at a daily level (day-n) and classify the activity data into the identified five classes using ML algorithms. In the procedure participants can set personal preferences in the eCoach mobile app for personalized recommendation generation and its meaningful delivery. In this study we have focused on the conceptualization of weekly short-term activity recommendation generation in eCoaching.

Different classification models are available; however we can’t determine “a priori” which classifier will perform the best. It requires enormous data for training validation and testing. We have collected real-activity data for sixteen adults using the MOX2-5 activity sensor over minimum of thirty days. According to the device manufacturer (Maastricht Instruments B.V.) the device's wear locations are thighs hips arms and sacrum. We have placed the device in the trouser pocket for this study to collect activity data from the hip or thigh location. We use the MOX downloadable android mobile application to capture personal activity parameters into the download folder of the android smartphone or tablet. Then we use our developed android supported eCoach mobile application to periodically transmit activity data to the eCoach back-end server. The eCoach server is protected by “eduVPN” and a firewall to filter redundant traffics. The back-end data collection module at the eCoach server has been developed with the Spring-boot framework (V. 2.5.x). The front-end (user interface) and the back end of the eCoach system is connected using REST (representational state transfer) microservice APIs (application programming interfaces). We have set up PostgreSQL (V. 12.9) for data storage at eCoach server following an authentication and authorization mechanism. The machine learning module for real-time model training classification model saving as pickle files and model re-training has been developed with Python V 3.8.5. At the end of ML model execution results for individual participants are stored in the database to display with android eCoach app. In the eCoach app we have developed a push-notification generation mechanism with Google Material Design guidelines to notify participants about their daily or weekly or monthly progress in activities and thereby generate personalized recommendations to motivate them to reach short-term and long-term activity goals.

Sixteen participants used the MOX2-5 devices regularly to record their daily activity data during the study in progress. We have applied a mean imputation method to imputing missing activity data during real data collection. The format of the collected data from the MOX2-5 is comma-separated values (CSV). All the activity data have been captured “per minute” basis. The developed eCoach app reads those files periodically using a schedular service to send them in the data collection module for storage following a consistency check. The ML module has further processed individual data from “per minute” to “per hour” and stored it in a separate table. As a result it has produced a set of 539 records which is not sufficient to determine the factual accuracy of the best classifier model. Therefore we have adopted the concept of transfer learning and incremental learning. Initially we have trained all the potential classifiers (see Table 4) with public Fitbit datasets using Kfold = 5 cross-validator and radom_state = 7. Afterward we have selected the best performing classifier and saved them as pickle files. Then we have re-used those pre-trained models for individual activity level classification. In this study we have classified the MOX2-5 sensor data with collection duration of more than 30-days with the following method—

We have selected the activity classification result from the individual classifiers with the highest mean accuracy. The adopted transfer learning and incremental learning approaches have been expressed with the following pseudo code.

The usefulness of the eCoaching concept to achieve personalized short-term goals (e.g. weekly) and long-term goal (e.g. 4 weeks) with transfer learning and incremental learning approaches have been conceptualized for an individual in Fig. 9 where “n” signifies the total number of individuals “N” signifies total number of day’s data used for transfer learning and “r” signifies the total number of daily activity record during model training and classification.

Validation study

Verification of the classifiers

To verify the performance of the classifiers in public Fitbit and MOX2-5 datasets we have the following three visualization approaches: (a) validation curve: it is an essential diagnostic tool that shows the sensitivity between changes in the accuracy of an ML model and changes in specific model parameters. A validation curve is usually drawn between some model parameters and the model's score. There are two curves in the validation curve—one for the training set score and one for the cross-validation score. Validation curves evaluate existing models based on hyperparameters (b) learning curve: it shows the estimator's validation and training scores for different numbers of training samples. It is a tool to see how much we benefit from adding more training data and whether the estimator suffers more from variance or bias errors and (c) scalability: it defines the ability of a classifier to adjust the classification results with an increasing number of training samples.

Verification of personalized recommendation generation and visualization

For personalized recommendation generation in the eCoach prototype system we have maintained individual personal preferences to understand personal interests (e.g. see Table 4). Preferences data are stored in the knowledge base. Participants can view and update their preference data in the eCoach mobile app. The design and specification of the eCoach mobile app using a user-centered design approach are beyond the scope of this study. To determine the weekly score of personal goal achievement we have summed up daily activity score and the measure of daily activity score is mentioned in Table 2.

Ethical approval and consent to participate

For our project we received ethical approval from Norwegian Centre for Research Data (NSD) (#797208) and Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK) (#53224). For this study informed or signed consents have been obtained from all the participants. Here we have not disclosed any identifiable data of the participants using text numbers or figures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vcmlza2FuZGluc3VyYW5jZS5jb20vd2hlbi1pdC1jb21lcy10by1lcy11bmRlcndyaXRpbmctZGF0YS1tYXktYmUtYS1raW5nLWJ1dC10aGUtaHVtYW4tdG91Y2gtaXMtdGhlLXF1ZWVuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When It Comes to E&S Underwriting Data May Be a King But the Human Touch Is the Queen,"The implementation of an annual wellness-fitness program can improve firefighter fitness and ultimately help save lives.

It’s impossible to ignore the great risks taken by firefighters. They experience injuries in large numbers and there is significant loss of life. Almost half of this loss of life is due to cardiovascular events. Additionally studies suggest that there is an increased risk of the development of certain cancers.

These brave men and women put their lives on the line to rescue and protect others. They won’t hesitate to run into a burning building while wearing heavy gear and carrying heavy equipment in order to save lives.

“​​Their job requires a combination of performance mobility strength and endurance and it often exposes them to environmental hazards and psychosocial hazards as well” said Dr. Latha Brubaker senior vice president of medical operations at Concentra.

“Being a firefighter can be physically difficult it can be dangerous and the impact of fighting fires and rescue can have a behavioral health impact as well.”

Given the physical and emotional challenges associated with their jobs firefighters need to be in top physical condition. Regular holistic health screenings and preventive conditioning programs can help protect these heroes ensuring they have long careers serving their communities.

A Dangerous Job

To understand the physical and mental health threats firefighters face it’s important to examine how firefighting exposes them to a number of different risks. Their job is physically taxing. They must wear heavy gear to protect them from high-temperature exposure while rescuing people and pets. They have to climb ladders and stairs during rescue operations. Although wearing masks to limit these exposures firefighters can inhale smoke and be exposed to harmful chemicals and environmental toxins increasing their risk of certain cancers.

“Firefighters have to climb ladders and stairs all the while hauling very heavy and unruly fire hoses and wearing very heavy equipment and PPE” Brubaker said.

While completing these physically demanding tasks firefighters can inhale smoke and other environmental toxins increasing their risks of certain cancers. A study of 30000 firefighters spanning from 1950 to 2009 found that firefighters were 9% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer and 14% more likely to die from the disease than the general population.

Outside of the physically taxing elements firefighters often work in distressing circumstances. There may be thoughts of the personal risks taken to save others. They witness significant injuries and loss of life.

All of these situations have the potential to be emotionally distressing for firefighters. That’s why a number of states — including California Tennessee Florida and Georgia — have passed or are considering passing laws that include PTSD benefits under workers’ comp coverage for firefighters.

“We’ve really doubled down on our commitment to behavioral health and we’ve gone so far as to partner with some third-party resources that have expanded our ability to provide behavioral health support” said Chris Studebaker senior director of onsite preventive services at Concentra.

Protecting Firefighter Health

Unlike in other professions it’s hard to reduce the number of physical and environmental hazards a firefighter faces on the job. Yes PPE can go a long way in protecting firefighters from burns and other injuries but the physical demands are also extreme. Firefighters are wrangling heavy fire hoses to stop the damage. In addition they are often lifting people and maneuvering in confined or challenging spaces.

In order to make sure firefighters are up to the task many departments conduct annual physical health assessments so that they can be certain their firefighters are physically and mentally prepared for the job. Medical personnel follow the guidelines provided by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1582 on Comprehensive Occupational Medicine Programs for Fire Departments which helps them determine if there is a condition present that may prevent a firefighter from performing their essential job functions.

The Joint Labor Management Wellness-Fitness Initiative comprised of two major fire service organizations worked to develop a comprehensive wellness-fitness program. Based on this initiative NFPA developed standards regulating these programs. This resulted in the suggestion of adding cancer screening fitness assessments and behavioral health screening to the periodic health assessments of firefighters.

“Some fire departments are now asking us to perform cancer screening” Brubaker said. “Cancer screening recommendations are made by the US Preventive Services Task Force for example and are based on a systematic review of scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed journals. When determining the appropriate screening tests it is important to review the USPSTF recommendations with the understanding of the potential additional risks amongst firefighters for certain cancers.

Sleep health is another area of issue in the fire service due to the 24 or 48-hour shift schedule and the mental strain and stress of the job.

Beyond screenings firehouses can opt to partner with providers of on-site health services including physical therapists who can work collaboratively with employers to develop and implement injury-prevention programs. Known as “tactical athlete programs” because their rigor is like that of the training a pro athlete would undergo these solutions can help catch injuries before they become severe and help keep firefighters’ bodies functioning optimally to enable them to perform their job.

Wearable technologies too are likely to play a role in keeping firefighters safe in the future: “We’re seeing the use of wearable tech sensors that look at environmental exposures and heat. And now the technologies can even track their sleep health” Studebaker said. “I think the future of wearable tech is going to shift away from discrete individual devices and more towards garment-based sensors.”

A Trusted Partner for Firefighter Physicals

The physical rigor required to fight fires combined with the emotional stressors present in the job mean that employers need to put extra care into guarding firefighters’ health and safety. Firefighters should undergo regular physical exams and Concentra is just the partner they need to conduct these physicals.

Concentra clinicians perform examinations imaging and lab tests that meet the National Fire Protection Association standards.

Firefighters who undergo these examinations will complete a physical fitness test that assesses their lifting pushing pulling carrying climbing and other abilities. These kinds of assessments can guard against musculoskeletal injuries common in the industry.

Should an injury occur the clinician utilizes a conservative treatment approach with an emphasis on active rehabilitation. Since firefighters are in safety sensitive positions opioids are usually avoided.

“​​Musculoskeletal injuries can be managed without the use of opioids” Brubaker said. “Our approach is a conservative one with the use of physical therapy when appropriate and anti-inflammatory medication if needed. We try to avoid prescribing opioids. Opioids are typically unnecessary.”

A Concentra clinician will perform lab tests including a complete blood count comprehensive metabolic panel lipid panel and urinalysis as well as TB tests. They will do alcohol and drug tests. They will perform audiograms pulmonary function tests chest X-rays and EKGs. They will complete a cardiovascular risk assessment and depending on age and the level of risks a stress test will be performed either at the onsite clinic or a cardiology office.

“It’s important for us to make sure in the first place that they’re healthy from a cardiovascular perspective that they’re healthy from a respiratory perspective” Studebaker said.

Behavioral health screening and cancer screening can be performed at Concentra Onsite Health clinics. Clinicians can conduct screenings for six cancers firefighters are at elevated risk for: colorectal prostate skin blood thyroid and bladder.

Concentra Onsite Health clinicians assess firefighters’ health holistically — something that is essential for a job that is both physically and emotionally taxing. By providing whole-person care Concentra Onsite Health aims to guard firefighters’ health so that they can come home to their families after a day of protecting others.

“Most firefighters are very passionate about the work they do. They are vital members of their community and take risks every day to keep these communities safe. The work of a firefighter can have an adverse impact on their long-term health and well-being. It is equally vital that we take care of our firefighters and do what we can to improve their overall health.”

Deployments will gradually phase in over the course of the next year.

Tosca operates a pooling model and delivers clean empty pallets from its service centres located across Europe to Avery Dennison sites. The service is fully managed with pallets inspected and washed after every rotation by Tosca.

At the end of every year Avery Dennison and its customers that take part in the pooling program will receive a CO2 emissions reduction certificate.

Tosca predicts that Avery Dennison alone could save 819 tons of CO2 emissions annually by switching all its Euro-sized wooden pallets (1200x800mm) to Tosca.

Violeta Gómez central packaging leader at Avery Dennison said: “The pooling program has been a massive success in Ireland and is helping us to reduce our carbon footprint and eliminate waste within the supply chain. Customers appreciate the fact that plastic pallets offer standard quality: they are cleaner (dust-free) and with less risk of damaging their products.

“Avery Dennison’s and Tosca’s plastic pallet pooling vision doesn’t stop after the pallets arrive to the customer. We encourage customers to take the chance to extend the pooling program further down the supply chain to end-users and help grow the eco system further.”

Felix Van Ouytsel business development manager added: “As the largest pooler of plastic pallets in Europe we deliver a combination of reusable products a flexible global service network and a committed partnership which will benefit Avery Dennison and its customers.”

Chemical company LyondellBasell announced the expansion plans of its propylene production capacity at its Channelview Complex near Houston Texas.

According to the firm the plans include the construction of a new propylene facility using LyondellBasell’s current technology to convert ethylene into propylene to produce polypropylene and propylene oxide.

LyondellBasell anticipates a final investment decision on the 400-kiloton propylene expansion project towards the end of next year.

The project would be able to produce 950 million pounds of goods annually. It would add more than 35% to the company’s propylene capacity at the Channelview Complex and will generate about 10-15 new jobs the firm added.

LyondellBasell Global Olefins & Polyolefins executive vice president Ken Lane said: “In addition to the lower carbon emissions than competing technologies we believe the project has more favourable economics compared to other production methods.

“The products offered through this investment will be an important element to helping our value chain partners achieve their long-term sustainability ambitions.

“Additionally this upstream investment would allow us to be less dependent on propylene market supply and demand providing us with the opportunity to serve growing customer needs better.”

Last month the company and plastic scrap recycler Shakti Plastic Industries signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to form a joint venture to construct a mechanical recycling plant in India.

TACO,"12 years and countless cases of human rights abuse in the making the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 starts on Sunday November 20.

It’s incredible that in just two days the world will stop and celebrate (despite the moral quandaries involved) and very little will get done workwise on a global level for one month.

In the United States however the time difference with host nation Qatar will mean that at least half of the group stage games will be during the twilight hours and early morning. So if you’re not a morning person and you love soccer; well you’re going to suffer a bit during this tournament. Which doesn’t mean Angelenos can’t get in on the party and watch the games in a proper footballing atmosphere.

So if you can wake up in time or manage to slip away from work these are the best places in Los Angeles to take in the matches while enjoying the “world’s game.”

The oil & gas value chain is broadly categorized into upstream midstream and downstream sectors. End users also form a prominent vertical that consumes the products produced by the industry. The key energy transition technologies being adopted by the oil & gas industry are CCS hydrogen renewable power energy storage biofuels and electric vehicle charging.

Hydrogen: Hydrogen is a buzzword in the energy sector. Conventionally hydrogen was produced and consumed locally in energy and other heavy industry verticals largely as a chemical. But the use of hydrogen as a fuel is now being explored in the transportation sector as well as in residential heating applications.

William Bridges

Some experiences in life you simply can’t prepare for. You can imagine how you might feel and what you might do but you can never actually know how you will respond in a situation until it happens. Falling in love becoming a parent and facing one’s mortality all fit into this category. In the workplace your first interview first day on the job and first time given the responsibility of managing others are of this ilk. For a select few who successfully climb the corporate ladder becoming CEO can be added to this list. As Bill George former CEO of Medtronic and current Harvard Business School professor puts it “No one is prepared to become CEO no matter how much they think they are. You have to grow into the job. You think you know how to run a business but that’s really more the COO role.”

What makes the top job so different from the leadership roles that come before it? To start with new CEOs discover quickly that they are accountable for everything that their reporting relationships have changed dramatically and that the job is extremely lonely.

Dick Boer former CEO of the Dutch food giant Ahold Delhaize explains how accountability changes: “As the company CEO it’s solitary. You can’t say ‘Look I can’t do it because . . .’ No. It’s you. You can’t blame anyone anymore for anything. It’s you to blame.” Ecolab’s former CEO Doug Baker illuminates the uniqueness of reporting relationships: “Our synapses are designed for one boss. Our whole career we have had one boss and now all of a sudden you’ve got 13 versions of a boss. Oh and by the way they don’t come to work every day like all your other bosses did.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reveals where the loneliness comes from: “Nobody who works for you sees what you see. And nobody you work for sees what you see. That’s the fundamental problem of a CEO which is you see it all and nobody else around you sees it so you can get very frustrated.”

For these reasons and many others no one should assume that they have it all figured out when transitioning into the role of CEO. In fact one-third to one-half of new CEOs are considered to be failing within 18 months of taking the role and more than 90 percent of those CEOs confess that they wish that they had managed their transition differently. Those who get it right realize early on that they will need to lead differently than they did on the way to the top. They know that their success will depend on whether they can reinvent themselves by rewiring the many work habits they built up over decades (on average new CEOs have worked for 24 years before taking the role).

Savvy CEOs recognize that the renewal opportunity isn’t just for them but for the entire organization. A transition of leadership creates what German American psychologist Kurt Lewin refers to as an “unfreezing” moment for the institution. According to Lewin’s theory organizations exist in an equilibrium state largely constrained (“frozen”) by resistance to change and group conformity. Movement becomes possible only when there is a jolt to the system (an “unfreezing”). Such jolts often come in the form of a crisis—such as when GM’s Mary Barra used the company’s ignition switch crisis as a catalyst for needed culture change. A CEO transition creates a similar opportunity—albeit without the crisis—to reset an organization’s aspirations and ways of working.

The best CEOs don’t miss the opportunity to make their first six to 12 months (not just the vaunted 100 days) both a personal transition of great import and a profound moment of institutional renewal. While each leader will act in ways befitting their unique situation there are at least four common ingredients for success:

not making it about you

listening then acting

nailing your firsts

playing “big ball”

Don’t make it about you

In his 1979 book Transitions: Making Sense of Life’s Changes the late author and consultant William Bridges wrote about the difference between transition and change. According to Bridges change is something that happens to people. Transition on the other hand is internal: it’s what happens in people’s minds as they go through change. Change can happen very quickly while transition usually occurs more slowly. The distinction is subtle but vital to understand for a new CEO who is pursuing both personal and institutional renewal.

The day you become CEO you undergo an enormous amount of change. For one all the attention becomes laser-focused on you often in ways that distort reality. Says Brad Smith former CEO of the accounting software giant Intuit “It’s no secret that we all get ten inches taller and our jokes get funnier the day we assume the role.” At the same time your power gets magnified. “Every time you say or do something” says DBS Bank CEO Piyush Gupta “it’s got a massive consequential effect. The whole company pivots.”

All this attention and power can quickly create a celebrity CEO phenomenon where the transition becomes all about you. Successful CEOs don’t let this happen—they keep their minds focused on the institution. As former Itaú Unibanco CEO Roberto Setúbal explains: “All CEOs need to ask themselves ‘What do you want to be remembered for—as a great person or a person who made the company great?’ If you want to make the company great then you must think about the company first yourself second. It’s human nature to want to be recognized so it’s not easy to put the institution ahead of yourself.”

Former Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga reinforces the point with a memorable analogy: “You want them to not remember you. You want the company to be successful where it’s headed. You do not own the business unless you created the company and were Steve Jobs or Bill Gates and then they should remember you. Guys like us we’re just stewards of the system in a ship sailing through the sea. You have to make sure that the boat doesn’t sink while you’re there and that during the voyage it picks up a couple of extra sails and some new engine technology. You make the boat work better. But you don’t brand the boat with your name and call it the Ajay Banga boat.”

Such advice sounds laudable in theory but what does it mean in practice? Taking this approach starts with asking different questions which then lead to different answers. For example:

Topic ‘It’s about me’ ‘It’s not about me’ Vision What legacy will I leave? What organizational purpose do I serve? Leadership What are my “nonnegotiable” expectations of others? Who does the company need me to be? Team Who on my team will complement my weaknesses? What conditions will I need to put in place to maximize my team’s success? Change What is broken that needs fixing? How will we respect our past while accelerating or disrupting our future? Engagement How will I get the organization on board with my vision? How will I engage the organization in creating our shared vision? Measurement How will I know if I’m successful? How will we know if we’re winning?

Microsoft’s Nadella embodies the “it’s not about me” mindset by ascribing a meaningful portion of his success to his predecessor. “My dad a civil servant in India always used to talk about institution builders as those people whose successors do better than they did themselves” he says. “I love that definition. I feel that if the next CEO of Microsoft can be even more successful than I am then maybe I’ve done my job right. If the next CEO of Microsoft crashes and burns that may result in a different verdict. That’s why I think too much credit is given to me and not enough to Steve [Ballmer Nadella’s predecessor] for what he set in motion. I don’t think I would have been able to achieve what I’ve achieved if not for his work.”

Israel Discount Bank’s former CEO Lilach Asher-Topilsky used a daily ritual to remind herself that the job was not all about her: “Every morning when I went to my office I entered the room looked at my chair and reminded myself that people were going to walk in and talk to the chair. I sit in this chair now but I have to remember that I have to be humble. I have to remember that everyone is the same. I sit in this chair and it makes me powerful but tomorrow I’m not going to be in this chair.”

Listen then act

When a new CEO takes over anxiety levels can run high within the organization. Everyone wants to hear what the new person thinks what will change and what the change will mean for them. With people overanalyzing every word and move the new CEO says and makes the urge to decide declare promise and explain is strong. The best leaders in transition know that it is better to listen and find out what is really going on before making broad declarations or premature moves. Of course context matters—in a turnaround situation there will be a premium on action—but in most contexts successful leaders subscribe to Albert Einstein’s edict of “If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution I would spend the first 55 minutes understanding the problem.” Practically speaking this ethos translates to the following practices:

Start with a broad-based listening tour.

Create a fact-based “one version of the truth.”

Lock in a short list of bold moves.

Communicate those moves in an elegantly simple engaging manner.

On his listening tour after being announced as the next CEO Intuit’s Smith asked the same three questions of board members investors fellow CEOs and employees: “What are the greatest opportunities we haven’t yet capitalized on? What are the greatest threats that could end this storied franchise if not addressed? What is the one thing I could do to screw it up?” Examples of other powerful questions you might consider asking are: What do you hope will change? What should not change? What aren’t people telling me that I need to know? What am I not hearing that I should be hearing? Lockheed Martin’s former CEO Marillyn Hewson explains why such questions are uniquely powerful during the transition period: “People tell you things because you’re the newbie that they’re not going to tell you two or three years from now.”

The perceptions you pick up during your listening tour should be validated with facts where possible and augmented by analytics that can help answer tough questions about the state of the business. The goal is to create one version of the truth that you can use as a baseline for the organization’s aspirations and against which to judge its future performance. Ed Breen the CEO of DuPont and former head of Tyco and General Instruments discusses his methodology: “As a CEO when you go into a company even if you’ve been in the company and you get promoted to CEO you need to take a good clean look at everything: return metrics cash conversion—all the key metrics. Then you can see where you sit vis-à-vis a really good company that has a business model like yours and you can ask ‘Well why aren’t we there? If they can be there why can’t we be there?’ There’s always a way to get there.” Financial and operational metrics are key but so are metrics on talent teamwork culture and stakeholder perceptions.

CEO Excellence The six mindsets that distinguish the best leaders from the rest.

Once you have a strong fact-based understanding about what is needed to propel the business forward it’s time to identify the biggest needle-moving actions that you will lead. What will you buy and sell? Where will you invest differentially? How will you improve productivity? Where will you create more differentiation? How will you reallocate capital? McKinsey research shows that making even two big moves across these arenas more than doubles the likelihood of rising from mid- to top-tier performance while executing three or more makes such a rise six times more likely. Furthermore CEOs who make these moves earlier in their tenure outperform those who move later so there is a premium on mobilizing the organization quickly.

You may be wondering “If moving fast is important why do great CEOs invest so much time in listening first?” Alain Bejjani the CEO of Dubai-based conglomerate Majid Al Futtaim explains this paradox of going slow to go fast: “We aimed to have the most inclusive process possible. Doing so built a broad sense of ownership and we also found that some of the most insightful answers came from people we wouldn’t normally have approached for input which in hindsight would have been a significant loss.” Best Buy’s former CEO Hubert Joly reinforces the point: “Of course you have to create a plan but you have to cocreate it. It doesn’t need to be perfect—the key is to create energy and manage energy.” Bejjani’s and Joly’s experiences are supported by social science that suggests that people are up to five times more motivated to execute initiatives that they have had a hand in creating versus ones that have been handed down from on high.

A powerful tool to mobilize the organization in the desired direction is to distill the company’s transformational vision and strategy down to an elegantly simple “one-pager.” Says DBS’s Gupta “We put together a one-page visual we call the DBS House. On it is everything: our vision strategy values targets etcetera. It allows us to all talk the same language about what we want to do and more importantly what we do not want to do.” Similarly Ivan Menezes the CEO of beverage maker Diageo carries around a one-pager called the “Diageo Performance Ambition” that has the company’s purpose and vision at the top and then lays out the company’s six strategic pillars—written in simple English with no jargon. Menezes describes why it’s so useful: “Whether you’re on a bottling line in Kenya or doing sales in Vietnam you can find yourself on the page and know where you could make a difference. It’s very helpful in depicting the clarity of the strategy and the change that is needed.”

Nail your firsts

In a famous social-science experiment conducted in 1946 by psychologist Solomon Asch participants were given one of two sentences. The first began “Steve is smart diligent critical impulsive and jealous.” The second read “Steve is jealous impulsive critical diligent and smart.” Although both sentences contained the same information the first one led with positive traits while the second one started with negatives. When asked to evaluate what they thought of Steve subjects who were given the first sentence evaluated him more positively than those given the second. This is an example of what social scientists refer to as the “primacy effect” and it’s why the adage “You never get a second chance to make a first impression” matters—first impressions tend to last.

Early in your tenure everyone even those you have worked with for years is forming their first impression of you as the CEO. Getting your first impressions right will send strong messages about how you intend to lead differently (from the previous CEO as well as versus how you have led in previous roles) and the renewal opportunity you see for the organization. Applying the following four principles will go a long way to ensuring that your first impressions are positive:

Understand people’s “why?”

Keep to a single narrative.

Err toward complete candor.

Prepare intensely for moments of truth.

If you know what motivates a person and can connect at that level the chances are greater that you will make a positive and lasting impression. “It goes beyond just listening to what they say” Lockheed’s Hewson shares. “If you take time to understand why they’re saying what they’re saying you can [then] help shape their longer-term thinking.” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings gives an example of how understanding the “why?” of the press shapes his actions: “They want to be truth tellers but they are forced to be entertainers.” Hastings makes it a point to give reporters a bit of both and can convey his message more effectively as a result.

Jacques Aschenbroich former CEO and current board chairman of the global automotive supplier Valeo hews to the second principle: “What I present to the board of directors is exactly the same that I present to our shareholders exactly the same that I present to leaders exactly the same that I present to the unions.” Israel Discount Bank’s Asher-Topilsky expands on the point: “When something happens internally or externally you continue to communicate in the same way.” On the one hand adopting a single narrative is liberating—one CEO confided in us “I’m not smart enough to have two versions of the truth!” On the other hand you’ll need to brace yourself for having to endure in the words of Procter & Gamble’s former CEO A. G. Lafley “Excruciating repetition.”

Asher-Topilsky speaks about the third principle—candor: “Don’t overpromise. Be frank about the problems not just the opportunities.” Even if you are uncomfortable in the moment such sincerity lays the foundation for real trust and credibility. To facilitate this level of candor with his board Diageo’s Menezes starts meetings in an executive session (just him and the board) with a list of seven or so things that are going well matched by an equal number that aren’t going well. Doing so offers his directors a better perspective on what he’s dealing with which allows them a chance to give better guidance. US Bancorp’s former CEO Richard Davis shares how this translates to communicating with investors: “I often said ‘Look you deserve the truth and we deserve for you to believe us. So when we tell you that things are going amazingly well you will remember us telling you when they weren’t.’”

Successful CEOs prepare intensely for important moments of truth such as the first time they have their team together their first board meeting their first investor presentation and their first quarterly earnings report. In these situations the wisdom of American football coach Vince Lombardi rings true: “The will to win is not nearly as important as the will to prepare to win.”

Aon CEO Greg Case learned this the hard way. When he took the top job at the professional-services giant he was told he had to present at an investor day that was scheduled to take place a month after he arrived. Having come in from the outside he knew there wasn’t time to prepare a thoughtful compelling and meaningful view of the future strategy of the firm. Case recalls “Had I been more seasoned I would have said: ‘We’re going to cancel that.’ But I didn’t know any better. So I said ‘OK we’ll get ready.’ It was a massive fire drill from hell.”

Case also shares the hard-gained learning that new CEOs should treat early interactions with individual board members as moments of truth. “Spend more time substantial amounts of time [with them] early on as a new CEO” he advises. “It’s absolutely essential that your board understands you and you understand them individually. It builds trust and transparency. I wish I’d spent more time early on.” Former Caterpillar CEO Jim Owens describes the practical application of this advice: “For the first six to nine months I personally met with each board member at their place of business took time to have dinner got to know them a little better and talked about the business in depth.”

Getting your first impressions right doesn’t guarantee success but it does increase the odds. As in golf putting the first shot on the fairway is the way you want to play.

Play ‘big ball’

“Play big ball not small ball” advises Sandy Cutler the former CEO of the power management company Eaton. “By that I mean spending time on things that no one else can in ways that magnify your effectiveness without getting mired in things that don’t make a difference.”

This advice may sound like common sense but it’s too often not common practice for new CEOs who suddenly find themselves accountable for everything and to everyone. Mastercard’s Banga confesses “The first two years were really hard. I started badly because I was trying to do everything—communicating getting to know people leading change finding the people I could build new relationships with and getting them to carry my message.” His life quickly spun out of control. “I was traveling as well. It was hard to sleep. I’d come back to my hotel room in Asia at 11 o’clock at night and I’d have 100 emails from the US waiting to be answered. And I’d promised my team that I’d respond to every email and every phone call within 24 hours.”

Like Banga many new CEOs enter the role thinking that they will go hard for the first 90 days and then back off a bit. That’s easier said than done. “I didn’t know whether I’d be successful and so I went 100 percent totally all in” divulges former LEGO CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp. “My health suffered quite badly. I went to a checkup and the doctor said ‘You have the fitness of a 65-year-old.’ I was at the time approaching 40. I then started becoming a bit more sensible.” Knudstorp’s experience is a cautionary tale—as a new CEO you should be disciplined about playing “big ball” from day one.

To play big ball throughout their tenure new CEOs can put three foundational elements in place early:

Time management: Set clear boundaries and stay extremely disciplined.

Talent: Put “A” players in critical roles move on “C” players and help “B” players succeed.

Operating rhythm: Combine accountability with urgency and targeted coaching.

At Mastercard Banga learned to become extremely careful about how he used his time: “If you as CEO can’t figure out what matters to you and if you are not willing to make the time for it then it’s your problem. No one can help you.” He set boundaries and adopted a color-coding system in his calendar. The time he spent for travel with clients regulators in internal meetings and so on were each assigned a different target time allocation and color. “If I wasn’t spending time in the right places in any of these areas a quick look at the calendar would make that abundantly clear” he shares. “One of my chief of staff’s primary jobs was to make sure that the balance of meetings was correct.”

Flemming Ørnskov CEO of the skin care company Galderma shares the hardest part of getting balance: “The thing I had to learn was to say no. When someone calls me and says ‘I want you to be the keynote speaker’ or ‘Don’t you want to do this off-site?’ or ‘Let’s do a dinner’ saying no feels uncomfortable initially because people mean it in a friendly way. But to say no politely is important.” Ørnskov is highly disciplined about making what he says yes to as productive as possible. “I really prepare for meetings and make sure the agenda is tight and focused” he explains. “I read the pre-reads I think about it I start and finish meetings on time. All meetings start and end with a recap of action items and follow-ups.”

The second area to get right early is talent management. GE CEO H. Lawrence Culp shares why: “Your people decisions are really where all your leverage is. As a CEO you absolutely have to get those right.” The best CEOs create a short list of roles (30 to 50) that will have the most impact on driving their company’s strategy. Then they make sure those roles are filled with A players. They also make tough calls on C players even those who have been loyal to the organization for decades. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon clarifies the rationale for this: “If we were ‘loyal’ to them by leaving them in the job we’d be hugely disloyal to everyone else and to the company’s clients.”

Further and often neglected is creating the conditions for B players to up their game: role modeling setting expectations and providing incentives and capability-building opportunities. Having done so if no improvement happens in a discrete time frame (months not years) it’s time for a colleague to move on. Gail Kelly the former CEO of Westpac Banking explains why: “It very rarely gets better if you’ve put the conditions in place for their success and they aren’t succeeding. That’s why you want to make those decisions early. It’s the most elegant way of dealing with it because you can discuss that it’s not the right fit. If you let it go on too long you can’t have that discussion.”

The third foundational element that will enable you as CEO to play big ball is establishing a robust operating rhythm for the company. This is harder than it may seem because it also involves deciding the altitude at which you will fly. As the corporate CEO you have business unit CEOs reporting to you who have the operating responsibility you no longer have. Although you will need to empower those people there is a trap to avoid as GE’s Culp explains: “I’ve seen a lot of my peers giving their business unit CEOs a lot of room because that’s what they always wanted when they were in the role. Then someone surprises them in not a good way and they start to think differently.”

For Culp as for the best company CEOs the key is to have a regular rhythm of reviews covering organizational operational and strategic issues. The altitude at which to fly is determined by the substance of those sessions. Mastercard’s Banga explains: “My operating rhythm is that if you’re not performing it will be a longer operating review we’ll dig into what’s going on. If you’re growing market share and growing on the priorities we agreed to in the KPIs it’ll be a very short review.”

Your operating rhythm doesn’t just reinforce your priorities; it also sets the metabolism of the organization. As Microsoft’s Nadella states “That’s a fascinating thing—what is tempo? Only the CEO can decide that.” It’s important to set a pace that allows you to get early runs on the board. Best Buy’s Joly explains why: “The key with any stakeholder is to get the ‘say–do’ ratio right: the ratio between what we said we were going to do and what we actually did. That’s how you get credibility. If you do what you say you’ll do they’ll want to see less of you. They’ll want you to spend your time working on the business and delivering on your commitments.”

We began by discussing how like falling in love transitioning into the CEO role is something you can’t fully prepare for. As such it’s a profoundly uncomfortable but also wonderous time for those fortunate enough to have been chosen to lead at the highest levels. We also noted that the impact of the transition extends far beyond the leader. The ascension of a new CEO is an unfreezing moment that can catalyze significant institutional renewal.

GE’s Culp describes how it feels when it all comes together: “I liken it to the flow I remember when I was on my high-school basketball team. We ran fast took care of each other and we were successful. Running fast with incredible people working at this level—I just find it to be great fun and rewarding in a whole host of ways.”

By not making it about you listening then acting nailing your firsts and playing big ball you’ll soon hit your stride.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL25vdi8xOC9tdXJkb2NoLXYtdHJ1bXAtcnVwZXJ0cy1wYXBlcnMta2ljay1kb25hbGQtYnV0LWZveC13b250LXBsYXktYmFsbNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL25vdi8xOC9tdXJkb2NoLXYtdHJ1bXAtcnVwZXJ0cy1wYXBlcnMta2ljay1kb25hbGQtYnV0LWZveC13b250LXBsYXktYmFsbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Murdoch v Trump: Rupert’s papers kick Donald but Fox won’t play ball,"Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers don’t do subtlety when it comes to political attacks.

Over the last week readers of his US titles have been informed that Donald Trump is “Trumpty Dumpty” the “biggest loser” in Republican politics and the man who meant the “red wave” never crested in the US midterm elections.

The New York Post marked Trump’s latest bid for election with something more damning: outright mockery.

Under the headline: “Florida Man makes announcement” the formerly pro-Trump newspaper directed readers to a story deep inside the newspaper on page 28.

“With just 720 days to go before the next election a Florida retiree made the surprise announcement Tuesday night that he was running for president” said the deadpan news report.

The tabloid’s print edition has a dwindling readership but the former US president is still said to be a regular reader – which means it probably hurt when they mocked his Mar-a-Lago home – raided by the FBI in August – as a “classified documents library”.

Yet while the newspaper editorials have led to suggestions that Murdoch has completed a clean break with the former US president this misses the more positive reaction on Murdoch’s Fox News television channel.

“Murdoch has very little control over his most important outlet which is Fox” said Michael Wolff the media commentator who has written three books on Trump.

“Let’s assume Murdoch was giving a message to the Post … he can’t do that at Fox. And Fox is the all-important thing.”

Although there has been criticism of Trump on Fox News in recent weeks several presenters such as Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson have their own loyal audiences who have been fed pro-Trump material for years. A rapid U-turn may be too much for them to take especially if the network is accused of betrayal.

As Wolff puts it: “Each of the voices at Fox is going to be motivated by their own ratings – and if their own ratings are dependent on Trump then they’re not going to deviate. Hannity does not seem to have deviated one increment off his absolute fealty to Trump. Tucker likewise.”

In the background is Murdoch’s attempt to reunite two parts of his business empire and ultimately hand over control to his 51-year-old son Lachlan. The family’s main media interests are separated into two businesses as a result of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal which saw the legally troubled outlets separated.

The core business is the US-focused television business Fox while the newspaper assets – including its UK titles – are controlled by News Corp.

Combining the two makes little business sense but would tidy up family succession planning according to the media analyst Alice Enders: “It’s not about Rupert being back in charge it’s about Lachlan taking over and pursuing the same traditional classic conservative agenda.”

She said that it would be hard for Fox News to find a way to let go of Trump without risking some of the hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising that flows to the network.

“Fox is the jewel in the crown. The influence that the Murdochs want to exercise is through Fox News. What’s super interesting is they want to maintain their currency as the go-to news channel for conservative voters – and they have to do that in a way that balances the Trumpistas against everyone.”

The focus on US politics also reflects a physical change in Rupert Murdoch’s location.

He has spent a substantial time in the UK in recent years alongside his now ex-wife Jerry Hall and his daughter Elisabeth.

During the Covid pandemic they were based at an Oxfordshire mansion where he took the decision to sign up Piers Morgan for the launch of TalkTV and went to get his Covid vaccine – at the same time that his US media outlets were casting doubts on its effectiveness.

Now the recently divorced nonagenarian is increasingly based at a newly acquired ranch in rural Montana a remote state favoured by billionaires. Official documents show that last month he paid £13000 to fly the former prime minister Boris Johnson there for a meeting while corporate filings suggest he is running his business empire from the ranch and has permission to hold board meetings there.

This raises the question of which Murdoch is now calling the shots: 91-year-old Rupert or Lachlan who is managing part of the business from his family home in Australia – working late into the night on video calls due to the time difference.

The Trump years weighed heavily on Murdoch with Fox News facing a $1.6bn lawsuit over claims it amplified Trump’s false allegations about fraud at a voting machine company after his election defeat. Murdoch’s son James has left the family business and had made barely coded criticisms of Fox News which hit hard according to Wolff.

“In terms of Rupert himself he has always detested Trump. Trump has been the cross to bear in his life and the Trump effect at Fox has essentially broken up his family.”

Trump banned from Twitter and struggling to get airtime has not taken his ostracism lightly whining that they were favouring Florida governor Ron DeSantis.

“NewsCorp – which is Fox the Wall Street Journal and the no longer great New York Post – is all in for Governor Ron DeSanctimonious” Trump said.

But as Enders puts it: “Murdoch doesn’t back losers. Trump is a loser.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzUxMTkzNS9kYW5nZXJvdXMtcmVjYWxsZWQtdG95cy1hcmUtc3RpbGwtb24tc2FsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dangerous recalled toys are still on sale,"(CNN) — Parents shopping for their kids this holiday season need to be alert and carefully examine toys before they buy them because recalled and counterfeit toys are being sold online a consumer report said Thursday.

The 37th annual “Trouble in Toyland” toy safety report by Denver-based US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) warned parents to be especially mindful of this hidden danger.

PIRG said that in October it was able to buy more than 30 recalled toys from several US-based online sellers noting that it is illegal for retailers and online marketplaces to sell toys that have been recalled.

The report also said counterfeit toys that don’t necessarily meet mandatory US safety standards continue to be sold in stores and online.

The group was able to buy close to a dozen different types of toys that had been recalled — for reasons that ranged from choking hazards to laceration risk to potential poisoning — from sellers on Facebook Marketplace and eBay as well as several online toy shops.

The toys included stuffed animals action figures activity balls for infants musical toys bath toys and a toddler’s riding toy and a majority of them were bought new in the original packaging or new with tags.

“None of the other sellers flagged stopped or sent a warning about any of our other purchases of recalled toys” the report said.

The recalled toys that PIRG said it was able to purchase online included:

— DigitDots 3mm and 5mm Magnetic Balls from HD Premier: These were recalled in March 2022 for injury to the digestive system if two or more magnets are swallowed.

#Recall: About 119K HD Premier DigitDots magnetic ball sets.

— Forky 11″ Plush Toys from Pixar’s Toy Story: The toy was recalled in July 2019 because the googly plastic eyes on the toy can detach posing a choking hazard to young children.

— Early Learning Centre Little Senses Lights & Sounds Shape Sorter Toys from Addo Play: The toy set was recalled in October 2022 because the red cube can come apart and release a small white ball posing a choking hazard.

— 6-inch Aflac plush promotional ducks from Communicorp: The plush ducks were recalled in June 2022 because components contain excessive levels of toxic phthalates which are dangerous because they can negatively impact brain and physical development in young children. The recall covered a variety of the plush duck characters including Accident Duck Business Duck Fishing Duck Police Duck PGA Duck One Day Pay Duck Heisman Duck and Lifeguard Duck.

— Blue’s Clues Foot to Floor Ride-on Toys from Huffy Corp: The toy was recalled in August 2022 because the ride-on toy can tip forward when a young child is riding it posing fall and injury hazards.

#Recall: @HuffyBicycles recalls about 28550 Blue's Clues Foot to Floor Ride-on Toys as they tip forward when a young child is riding it posing fall and injury hazards to children. Get free repair. Full recall notice: https://t.co/Fyvht8OzHW pic.twitter.com/xNnebRqZUm — US Consumer Product Safety Commission (@USCPSC) August 25 2022

When the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and a toy manufacturer announce a recall that means the toy must immediately be removed from store shelves and online marketplaces. Federal law prohibits the sale of products subject to a recall ordered by the CPSC or a voluntary recall by the company in consultation by the CPSC the report said.

PIRG offered this advice regarding the best way to avoid counterfeit toys: If the only place to buy a popular hard-to-find toy is a website you’ve never heard of or that looks sketchy there may be a reason for that.

The toys may not be genuine the report said and may not meet safety standards for parts that can break or levels of toxins which are common in plastic toys.

And while much of the focus of recent weeks has been on what governments are doing these thorny issues are just as relevant for corporates the world over.

This is where global banks such as Bank of America (BofA) believe they have a key role to play which goes beyond supporting sustainable capital raising and into advising companies on how to navigate the increasingly complex environmental social and governance (ESG) landscape they must operate within.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYnkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9zdHJpbmctb2YtY2FyZC1za2ltbWluZy10aGVmdHMtd2lwZXMtb3V0LWFjY291bnRzLW9mLWxvY2FsLWJhbmstY3VzdG9tZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,String of card skimming thefts wipes out accounts of local bank customers,"Local mom Unique Martinez says she used the ATMs at Santa Maria's Bank of America branch on South Broadway two weeks ago and within hours the money in her Electronic Benefits Card was wiped out.

""When I looked on my mobile app it showed the transactions from where the perpetrators went and took out my money from a bank I didn't even go to"" Martinez told KSBY. ""There were three different transactions — one for $800 one for $700 and one for $60.""

But Martinez was not the only victim. Ang Canseco of Lompoc said that on the same day Martinez had her money stolen while using a Bank of America ATM Canseco used her debit card at a Bank of America ATM in Lompoc.

She says by November 7 her account was wiped out by an unauthorized transaction from Santa Maria's Bank of America location on South Broadway. Canseco adds that on November 13 she also received notice about another transaction in Utah for $380. She says the funds were restored to her account by Thursday evening.

Meanwhile Friday afternoon another Santa Maria Bank of America customer reached out to KSBY saying $800 disappeared from her bank account when she too withdrew money from the ATM on South Broadway on November 7.

Katie Texiera tells KSBY she reached out to the Santa Maria Police Department on November 9. That day according to her police report representatives at the bank informed officers they had recovered a card skimmer inside one of their ATMs and that it was placed in their vault for safekeeping.

On Friday KSBY News reporter Jacob Dizon stopped by the Bank of America on South Broadway to speak with their employees about the incident but they refused to comment on the situation. They directed us to their corporate media spokesperson and we have not yet heard back.

Martinez meanwhile shared about the consequences she has faced as a result of the fraudulent transactions.

""It put me behind on all my bills on all my rent. I had late fees. I wasn't able to get my daughter the shoes she needed for basketball. I had no gas money. It burdened us a lot"" Martinez said.

She says she too filed a police report and that the funds were restored to her account the following week.

Though they are unrelated to this string of incidents at Bank of America on Friday we heard from the Community Bank of Santa Maria for tips on how you can identify and avoid having your card skimmed and duplicated when using ATMs.

They say you should be on the lookout for tape residue or anything sticking out of the ATMs and that it is a good idea to wiggle the card slot or keypad for loose-fitting attachments.

We also reached out to both Santa Maria and Lompoc police departments but they were unavailable for comment.

The Leonard Bearstein orchestra named for its four foot furry conductor has grown into a holiday tradition. The bears have charmed and confused people in uptown Charlotte delighting and perhaps frightening thousands of children since debuting in Founders Hall in December 1999. They performed a medley of Christmas tunes every hour on the hour.

Husband and wife team Todd and Jessica Alexander of Spintastic Sounds created the bears. They also set up the decorations for Bank of America Corporate Center every year after Thanksgiving.

The musical bears didn't appear in 2020 or in 2021 because of the pandemic. In separate statements Todd Alexander and Bank of America both confirmed the bears also will not appear this year. The news was first reported by The Charlotte Ledger newsletter.

Bank of America did not say why the bears were canceled. Alexander told the Ledger he sensed the Founders Hall property manager JLL was more focused on holding private events than attracting members of the public.

""I think somebody upstairs said this is the perfect time to just let them go away"" Alexander said.

The news struck a chord with many on Twitter.

""Distraught"" wrote user @john_shubert_

""More corporate layoffs? and at Christmastime?"" asked @LOLCLT.

Other users shared memories of watching the bears on their lunch break or with friends and families through the decades.

""One of my favorite memories from working in Uptown was meeting friends with kids for lunch and watching the Leonard Bearstein orchestra. The reactions to the bears were all over the place but it was a really cute holiday tradition"" wrote @ErinBreeden.

Another user @matt_kinner expressed hope that the bears could find a new venue perhaps at a brewery Camp North End or at the U.S. National Whitewater Center.

Alexander told the Ledger that a smaller group of bears the Chuckles Quartet also will not return to Birkdale Village this year after the shopping center said it wasn't interested in a return engagement.

Chuckles and company are scheduled to appear at the Kannapolis Town Park this year and Alexander said he hoped to get a set in Mint Hill as well.

Leonard Bearstein and his crew may still entertain audiences in other cities this winter.

Alexander told WFAE in 2019 that Bearstein and his crew have doppelgangers that have performed in Durham Goldsboro Milwaukee and two shopping centers in Virginia.

International versions of the orchestra have also been created and shipped to buyers in Singapore and Thailand though the Alexanders said they didn't know what had become of those animatronics since.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90ZWNoL2JhbmstYW1lcmljYS1kb3duZ3JhZGVzLWNvaW5iYXNlLWFtaWQtMjEwMDAwNzEyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America Downgrades Coinbase Amid FTX Train Wreck Citing 'Contagion Risk',"Coinbase went public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2021. In the subsequent year and a half the company’s shares have fallen nearly 90%.

Things continue to look bad for the blockchain. Bank of America (BofA) analysts have downgraded Coinbase’s stock citing the “fallout from the FTX collapse.” The bank moved Coinbase shares to “neutral” from “buy” in a Friday note to the bank’s investment clients according to multiple financial outlets. BofA also shifted the stock’s projected target value to $50 down from the $77 the analysts placed it at previously. The platform’s stock sits at just around $45 as of writing and has fallen more than 7.5% today alone.



Coinbase is the second largest crypto exchange by volume after Binance. In the past 24-hours more than $1.2 billion has been traded on the platform. But even with such prominent standing Coinbase isn’t immune from the destabilization brought on by the swift implosion of FTX.

“We do not think COIN is another FTX” wrote BofA senior analyst Jason Kupferberg in the note. But “diminished confidence in the crypto ecosystem” means that the the stock isn’t a sure bet in BofA’s assessment. Kupferberg wrote that “contagion risk” from FTX could lead investors to abandon crypto exchanges and blockchain companies altogether.

Coinbase already wasn’t doing particularly well. And honestly for their own sakes we can only hope BofA’s investment clients cut and run. Crypto has never been a good long-term bet and it sure isn’t now. An estimated three-quarters of all bitcoin buyers lose money “stablecoins” are decidedly not the industry is rife with Ponzi schemes and criminals (and is itself basically just one big pyramid grift) and one of the biggest purveyors of digital coins can go from super bowl ads and celebrity endorsements to disappeared investor dollars in a flash.

What is going on with FTX?

Not too long ago FTX was the third largest cryptocurrency exchange. Its founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was heralded as a new posterchild for the industry—shotgunning to billionaire status basically overnight. But then as you’ve probably heard by now SBF and his hastily assembled crypto empire collapsed over the course of a week after mismanaging investor funds and doing a whole ton of likely illegal things.

FTX’s breakdown has already caused at least one other crypto company to implode: the lender BlockFi—while other blockchain platforms also struggle but deny FTX exposure. Bankman-Fried is facing a class action lawsuit and federal investigations from the DOJ and SEC. There continue to be no signs that investors will recover their funds amid ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and the U.S. is considering extraditing SBF from the Bahamas.

Though there may be a wrench in those plans. On Thursday night the Bahamian government announced that it had seized control of FTX’s remaining assets—adding in another layer of chaos. The mysterious disappearance of the hundreds of millions in FTX funds was previously chalked up as a “hack” but the island country has claimed credit for it stating that “it is not the understanding of the [Bahamian] Commission that FDM is a party to the US Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings.”

The Bahamian and U.S. regulators seem to be sparring over where proceedings surrounding FTX and its liquidation should take place. Though the Bahamas wrote that it would “engage with other regulators and authorities in multiple jurisdictions” to determine the best course of action.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

BATH Maine — To address a growing need for diverse housing options a new affordable apartment complex was built in Bath and on Wednesday locals got to take a look during a grand opening.



Made possible through several tax credits and the guidance of MaineHousing the new 60-unit complex was developed by The Szanton Company and sits on the corner of Front and Summer streets.



Forty-two units will be reserved for those 55 and older and cost between $800 and $1500 a month to rent according to the developers.

""The mission of The Szanton Company is to create rental apartments that are moderate- to low-income which our tenants are proud to call home"" company President Nathan Szanton said at the grand opening.



The building also features several community spaces a rooftop deck and some mixed-use retail spaces some of which have already been renting before renovations and changes. Bookstore owner Jim Rice said as a retail and housing tenant seeing more affordable housing come to the downtown area is much-needed.

""Bath is in demand. It's really popular now and it's gotten more expensive"" Rice said. ""For me being right by the bookstore is ideal.""



With employers drawing folks to the midcoast area in recent years Bath Housing Authority Executive Director Deborah Keller said she is hopeful the development will address a need for diverse housing options in the greater Bath area."

It was required before a security guard would hand over their passports immigration records and identification according to court records.

What they didn’t know according to their declarations is that they signed clauses agreeing to bring any future dispute before the church’s internal arbitration panel of loyal Scientologists not the U.S. court system.

The Baxters and fellow Scientology worker Valeska Paris sued the church in April for trafficking and now a Tampa federal judge is considering whether to grant the church’s request to punt the lawsuit into internal arbitration.

At a hearing on the motion Thursday U.S. District Judge Thomas Barber asked both sides to explain whether the former Scientologists signed the contracts under duress. All three were members of the church’s military-style workforce called the Sea Org.

The Baxters and Paris signed their contracts out of “religious obedience” not duress argued William H. Forman an attorney for Church of Scientology International one of five church entities named as defendants.

He said that falls under a legal doctrine known as the ministerial exception that helps protect churches from claims by religious workers. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled secular courts cannot interfere with it he said.

Forman said no church official made objective threats to the Baxters or Paris about leaving the church. Signing the documents was required only if they wanted to leave while remaining in good standing with Scientology. He said the former Scientologists had “subjective beliefs” related to their religion about what would happen if they failed to sign the contracts such as being excommunicated from their families.

“The duress issues here are not black and white” Forman said. “They are hopelessly intermingled with the religious issues.”

What created duress was fear of punishment conditioned into the Baxters and Paris since childhood said Shelby Leighton an attorney with Public Justice a nonprofit that is part of the team representing the former Scientologists. In the Baxters’ case because children were not allowed in the Sea Org Laura Baxter got pregnant with her husband on purpose as a way to begin the process of leaving.

While being subjected to “long interrogations and psychological punishment” during the “routing out” process the Baxters were held in isolation and surveilled 24 hours a day by security according to their declarations. During her time in the Sea Org Laura Baxter said she was also confined to the ship’s engine room forced to do manual labor and had pay withheld.

Leighton said that physical force is not required to prove duress and that confinement and threat of force is sufficient. “That’s not a subjective fear” Leighton said. “They’re basically being trapped on the ship until they sign the documents.”

While discussing the issue of duress Barber asked about a hypothetical scenario in which someone had a gun to a person’s head while they signed an arbitration contract on video and whether that would have to go to arbitration. Forman responded “Yes because the agreement says you must arbitrate.”

Paris also served on the ship called the Freewinds but was in Australia when she left the Sea Org in 2009. Leighton said Paris experienced the same duress because she had to sign departure contracts with the arbitration clause in order to get her passport back from Scientology.

Barber the judge noted that Paris was in a foreign country and needed her passport to be in Australia.

“That is not being told you can’t walk out this door” Forman said. “It’s a matter of religious obedience.”

Last year a U.S. appeals court upheld a Tampa federal judge’s ruling that sent a fraud lawsuit brought by former Scientologists Luis and Rocio Garcia into the church’s internal arbitration. The Garcias’ attorney argued the arbitration agreements the couple signed while in the church were “substantively unconscionable” because they were seen as enemies of the church after suing Scientology and could not get a fair hearing.

The appeals court ruled that delving into the fairness of Scientology’s arbitration process would be interpreting religious doctrine in violation of the First Amendment.

In the trafficking case attorneys for Scientology argued that the Baxters and Paris signed the same arbitration agreements that the U.S. appeals court upheld in the Garcia case.

But in their response attorneys for Baxter and Paris argued the Garcias never raised the issue of duress. They were lay parishioners who signed contracts while receiving services and were not full-time religious workers.

Barber did not indicate when or how he would rule on Scientology’s motion to compel arbitration.

Raven-Symoné said that she told Disney producers that she didn't want her character to come out as gay in the ""That's So Raven"" reboot ""Raven's Home.""

In 2017 Raven-Symoné and Anneliese van der Pol reprised their roles as Raven Baxter and Chelsea Daniels in a new Disney Channel show. The spinoff which premiered roughly 10 years after the first series ended followed the best friends after they'd grown up and had their own children.

During a video interview for Them published on YouTube last week Raven-Symoné said that she didn't think it was a good enough reason for Raven to be gay in the reboot just because the actor had come out as gay.

Raven-Symoné continued: ""No Raven Baxter never exhibited any type of sexual identity situation in the priors. I'm not being myself on this show I'm being a character. Raven Baxter's not gay. No matter what the first four seasons looked like with me and Chelsea sleeping in the same room and us raising a family together. Okay that's not the case. We are friends. Who sleep in the same room.""

Raven-Symoné also said that she didn't think Raven should date anyone in the spinoff.

""It's so funny because we're working on the sixth season now and I'm talking to the EPs and they're like 'And you're gonna start dating?'"" she said. ""I'm like 'She don't need to date either. She's just gonna be nothing.'""

Raven was thrilled to have her mother back on the right side of the pond for the first time in more than a decade but Victor had a slightly more complicated reaction to his estranged wife’s unexpected return. Considering he never even told her about his heart attack it’s fair to wonder how much the long-distance spouses speak to one another. His awkward inability to ask his own wife out to lunch was also troubling.

To make matters worse Raven had a vision of Victor telling Tanya “I can’t live like this anymore.” Traditional shenanigans ensued as Raven’s paranoia led her to crash her parents’ romantic sail boat ride. (“No one dumps my mama not even my daddy!”)

Meanwhile Booker and his associates tracked down the exact tree in which Victor and Tanya once carved their names — the perfect gift for Victor’s 60th birthday — but they fumbled the delivery. More specifically they dropped the stump off the Golden Gate Bridge… and wouldn’t you know it fell directly onto Victor and Tanya’s sailboat.

Raven's Home Tanya Returns

After being rescued by the coast guard and returning home Victor finally told Tanya what Raven had been fearing. But here’s a shocker if you can believe it — Raven misinterpreted her vision! “I just can’t live like this anymore” Victor said. “We’ve been living apart for years. I thought I was fine with that but I saw you today and I realized I’m not.” Instead of ending things with Tanya however Victor announced that he wants to move to London so they can finally be together.

Tanya was elated by this turn of events even more so than Lazlo who claimed Victor’s now-vacant bedroom as soon as he heard about the big move.

But fear not Victor won’t be staying in London for long. Rondell Sheridan is expected back for the sixth season of Raven’s Home which was announced at Disney’s D23 Expo in September.

Plasmodium infection in humans initiates with sporozoite invasion within hepatocytes followed by a dramatic parasite multiplication in the liver. Each liver stage forms up to 90000 exoerythrocytic merozoites31. Regardless infection and parasite replication within hepatocytes is silent and at this stage infection is asymptomatic. It is the exponential growth of merozoites in the red blood cells that associates with liver damage and signs of disease. The liver alterations seem to be a consequence of hemozoin accumulation and local inflammation. However the mechanistic details of this process and how such disturbances on hepatic immune response could explain enhanced susceptibility to superinfections during malaria is largely unknown. To address these questions we first collected blood samples from symptomatic malaria patients infected with either P. vivax or P. falciparum and also after the end of pharmacological treatment and disease remission. As compared to healthy donors infected patients with either Plasmodium species showed signs of liver damage as indicated by serum levels of both ALT and AST (Fig. 1A). Patients diagnosed with either P. vivax or P. falciparum infection that received pharmacological intervention displayed remission of serum elevations of ALT and AST as previously described suggesting regression of liver injury57. Despite no statistically significance we also observed an increase of liver enzymes in serum of the P. falciparum infected patients and both AST and ALT had a 50–90% reduction after treatment (Fig. 1A). Together these data suggest that malaria patients had higher chances to evolve with liver injury which is recovered following parasite elimination.

(B) Parasitemia (n = 6) (C) Liver histopathology (HE staining Bar = 64 µm) and (D) Serum ALT and AST of control (n = 4) and infected mice at days 7 (n = 4) 14 (n = 8) and 28 (n = 8) post-infection.

To model human Plasmodium-induced hepatic injury in mice and further understand the putative impacts on immune function we infected mice with P. chabaudi a rodent variant whose pathology resembles human features of malaria including anemia hypoglycemia weight loss and hypothermia. Following 7 days of infection mice presented a significant increase in parasitemia (presence of parasites inside red blood cells; Fig. 1B) which persisted for approximately 28 days when parasitemia was completely cleared. In line with our data from malaria patients infected mice also had histopathological alterations in liver samples at the peak of parasitemia (7 days after infection; Fig. 1C) with a massive area of hydropic degeneration displaying widespread leukocytic infiltration within sinusoids (Fig. 1C; black arrows) and leucocyte islets (yellow arrows). Accordingly we also detected significant elevation on serum ALT and AST levels connecting Plasmodium replication with hepatocyte damage (Fig. 1D). To dissect if such grade of liver damage could impact on liver metabolic function we developed an experimental strategy where mice were given intravenously a known amount of indocyanine green (ICG) and its hepatic clearance capacity was measured real time using spectrophotometry. As shown in Fig. 1E non-infected mice are fully able to remove ICG out of circulation since a very small amount was detected in their blood following 20 min of administration. In sharp contrast mice in the peak of parasitemia and liver damage presented sustained higher levels of ICG in the blood confirming a precarious clearance function by the liver at this timepoint. After parasite clearance (14th to 28th days after infection) hepatic depurative function returned to baseline values and full function was restored. Taken together these data connect Plasmodium infection with higher chances of liver injury and failure allowing further investigation using this mouse model.

There is a growing body of evidence showing that hepatic immune system can rapidly react to necrosis product and parenchymal damage24. In fact liver harbors one of the most complex immune environment in the body and virtually all leukocyte subpopulations can be found within the hepatic environment under physiological conditions353638. Based on this premise we hypothesized that such abundance of not only of parasite components—but also necrosis-derived molecules—would impact directly on liver expression of different inflammatory genes636465. In fact as depicted in Fig. 1F several immune-system related pathways were upregulated during P. chabaudi infection as compared to controls. Using a polled analysis strategy where general pathways were grouped together we detected enhanced expression key pro-inflammatory gene groups including Toll-like receptors inflammasomes scavenger receptors and others. Also genes involved in phagocytosis (scavenger receptors and complement) were also upregulated which was accompanied by a sustained elevation of hematopoiesis and cell cycle genes including pro-inflammatory cell death modalities such as pyroptosis. Corroborating our clinical data on liver metabolism genes belonging to liver metabolic function including cytochrome P450 pathways were downregulated. In contrast—probably due to red blood cell parasitism by P. chabaudi—several genes related to iron metabolism were higher expressed in liver samples which exception of Bdh2 (cytosolic ketone bodies metabolism) and Hamp2 (regulation of systemic iron metabolism). These data together demonstrated that not only liver metabolism but especially hepatic immune system are dramatically altered due to Plasmodium infection. An expanded view of all genes and pathways analyzed can be appreciated in Fig. 1G.

Alterations in different hepatic immune cell populations along with massive Kupffer cell depletion are a hallmark of Plasmodium infection

Based on higher expression of a plethora of genes related to immune system in the progression of Plasmodium infection we next used a high dimensional immunophenotyping strategy based on Time-of-flight flow cytometry (CyTOF) to map the frequency of different immune cell populations (CD45+ events) within the liver. Data analysis of CyTOF results should take into account both dot plots and frequency results. For this liver non-parenchymal cells were isolated and incubated with a mix of 42 isotope-conjugated antibodies allowing a precise identification and quantification under single cell mass spectrometry (Fig. 2A). As shown in viSNE analysis (Fig. 2BC) control mice have a minor population of granulocytes inflammatory monocytes and NK cells under baseline conditions along with an expressive population of B cells T cells Kupffer cells (KCs) and DCs. Following infection by P. chabaudi a different scenario was observed since at the peak of parasitemia we found a significant increase of hepatic granulocytes T cells and NK cells which was accompanied by reduction in B cells frequency (Fig. 2CD). Interestingly KCs (F4/80hi CD11b+ Ly6Clow DC-SIGN-) were the most affected population during infection since we detected an almost full depletion 7 to14 days day post-infection which returned to normal values only at 28 days of disease (Fig. 2CD). In complete coincidence with these data inflammatory monocytes infiltrated within the liver when KCs were absent disappearing after 28 days post infection—a timepoint that KC numbers returned to normal. This suggest that Plasmodium infection causes an acute immune response in the liver which is not only related to the expression of inflammatory genes but also with major changes in liver leukocyte populations—including an abrupt impact on hepatic reticuloendothelial system. A summarized view of hepatic leukocyte dynamics can be seen at the heatmap (Fig. 2D).

To confirm the dynamics of KC depletion and hepatic inflammatory monocyte traffic during Plasmodium infection we also mapped their frequency using conventional flow cytometry. Focusing on KC/monocyte clusters identified in CyTOF (Fig. 3A) we corroborated that KCs (F4/80hi CD11b+ Ly6Clow DC-SIGN-) are in fact strongly depleted at the peak of parasitemia (7th-14th days) while inflammatory monocytes (F4/80+ CD11b+ Ly6Chi CD11c- MHCIIlow DC-SIGN-) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (F4/80+ CD11b+ Ly6Chi DC-SIGN+ CD11c+ MHCIIhigh) emigrated to the liver at the same time frame (gating strategy in Fig. 3B KC/iMO gating in Fig. 3C and supplementary Fig. 1C). Both populations also returned to baseline numbers (Fig. 3D) and frequency (Fig. 3E) at the end of disease. Therefore we identified KCs as a target of Plasmodium infection and their absence could induce a rapid inflammatory monocyte traffic to the liver.

Plasmodium infection leads to long-lasting alterations on Kupffer cell morphology

Based on our findings using gene expression CyTOF and flow cytometry we next imaged KCs/monocytes (F4/80+ cells) in their native environment using high resolution confocal intravital microscopy. For this mice were anesthetized and F4/80+ cells and sinusoids were stained in vivo and both 2D and 3D images were acquired (Fig. 4A). As seen in Fig. 4B KCs (F4/80+ cells with protrusions) are widespread distributed within the liver inhabiting exclusively the intravascular space where they can survey blood in real time. For this KCs have cytoplasmatic arm-like protrusions that can increase their area allowing a better sampling of molecules and antigens in the circulation as seen in three-dimensional reconstruction for an intravital microscopy Z-stack (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Video 1). However upon hepatic invasion of P. chabaudi the frequency of KCs also decreased at the peak of infection (7–14th day) returning to normal values 30 days after (Fig. 4D; chart left). However regardless the frequency F4/80+ cells morphology was kept altered during malaria (Fig. 4C). In non-infected mice 100% of F4/80high cells (presumably KCs) exhibit protrusions and are defined as normal when they are imaged as “star-like” cells. In contrast F4/80+ cells from P. chabaudi infected mice lost their bona fide morphology since they were mostly round cells lacking the classic protrusions (presumably inflammatory monocytes; Fig. 4C and Supplementary Video 2). Interestingly despite disease remission (undetected parasites in blood after 30 days post-infection) a residual population of round cells were found within the liver even after 70 days post infection (Fig. 4CD). This suggest that even if normal cell numbers were reached in the healing phase using CyTOF and flow cytometry approaches imaging the native environment of immune cells can disclose alterations due to Plasmodium infection that are sustained for longer periods which could also impact on liver ability to clear infections.

Hemozoin deposition within Kupffer cells triggers cell death by necrosis and ferroptosis

During the intra-erythrocytic stages of malaria infection up to 80% of the red blood cell cytoplasm can be consumed and throughout hemoglobin metabolism by Plasmodium significant amounts of hemozoin crystals are formed phagocytosed and accumulated in KCs as described earlier39. It has becoming increasingly clear that stimulation of macrophages with hemozoin can trigger cell activation including via TLRs inflammasome 404142 MyD88-independent activation of NF-kappaB and ERK as well as the release of several subtypes of chemokine42. Based on this we next combined bright field in vivo imaging with fluorescence confocal microscopy to map hemozoin distribution within the liver and merged it with KC location (Fig. 5A). We found that almost 100% of KCs (F4/80+ cells) at the peak of infection (7th day) harbor hemozoin inside cytoplasm (assessed by colocalization; Fig. 5AB) which was sustained up to 14 days after infection. Probably due to the massive KC death during malaria the percentage of hemozoin-positive cells declined over time (after 30–100 days); however when we normalized hemozoin positivity to the number of star-shaped cells (presumably mature and phagocytosis-capable cells) it is also reasonable to suggest that the vast majority of F4/80+ cells were harboring hemozoin crystals at this timepoint (Fig. 5B). Liver histopathology also confirmed hemozoin uptake by KCs on days 7 and 30 post-infection (Fig. 5C). To further investigate the putative direct cytotoxic effect of hemozoin in KCs we sorted F4/80hiCD11b+ cells (KCs; Fig. 5D) and incubated with different concentrations of purified hemozoin (Fig. 5E) and read LDH release in culture medium as an indicative of cell death (Fig. 5F). Interestingly KCs which were not exposed to hemozoin survived for all experimental protocol; however exposure to hemozoin induced a dose–response dependent cell death as assessed by reduced cell counts (Fig. 5E supplementary Fig. 1A) and a significant increase in LDH release (Fig. 5F) and cytokines (Fig. 5G and supplementary Fig. 1B) confirming that hemozoin in vitro (and probably also in vivo) may be a direct cell death agent.

In fact when we assessed which cell death modality was the most prevalent due to Plasmodium infection (Fig. 6A) we found that most KCs were undergoing necrosis (assessed by propidium iodide uptake) but not apoptosis (absence of annexin V staining). To confirm in vivo if KCs were in fact dying due to Plasmodium infection and hemozoin deposition we developed a strategy to map necrosis using confocal intravital microscopy (Fig. 6B). For this mice received a cell-impermeant DNA-intercalant dye (Sytox green) which strongly stains for dead cells. As seen in Fig. 6B non-infected mice had almost no DNA staining even when we image a larger field of view. However several KCs internalized Sytox green at the peak of infection. The morphology exhibited like amoeboid shape with a largest surface area is specific of KCs confirming that they are a relevant target for Plasmodium infection in vivo. Also using flow cytometry we detected that infected KCs had also enhanced production of mitochondrial ROS as compared to controls (Fig. 6C).

Taking into account the presence of iron within hemozoin crystals we next investigated if KCs could also being depleted due to ferroptosis. Interestingly gene expression analysis showed a significant downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) with concomitant increase of cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT (Slc7a11) in infected liver non-parenchymal cells as compared to controls (Fig. 6D). In addition using a calcein-AM/chelator system (Fig. 6E) we confirmed by flow cytometry that infected KCs harbors significant higher amounts of iron within cytoplasm. In fact such iron accumulation within KCs was also coincident with enhanced lipid peroxidation as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 6F). Together these findings suggest that ferroptosis might be one of the cell death mechanisms which could explain such overt KC depletion during Plasmodium infection.

Kupffer cell death due to Plasmodium infection is a hallmark in enhanced susceptibility to secondary infections

KCs location within the hepatic sinusoids enables an intimate survey of circulating blood and this facilitates their major role in clearance of pathogens and microbial products avoiding the spreading of infections to other organs24. Based on our data that KCs are abruptly depleted due to hemozoin internalization we hypothesized that such deficiency on a key player on liver immunity would impact on host ability to fight secondary infections. Then we next selected two different models of murine infections that resemble contemporary relevant diseases in public health: coronavirus and E. coli infections. For this mice were first infected with P. chabaudi and then challenged with a murine strain of coronavirus (MHV-3 Fig. 7A) and since this mouse hepatitis virus share a common genus with Sars-Cov-2 lessons learnt from MHV-3 could offer mechanistic insights into COVID-19 pathology43. When challenged mice only with Plasmodium 100% of mice survived for the whole experimental period (Fig. 7B); however single intraperitoneally infection with MHV-3 led to full mortality in 5 days post challenge. Interestingly mice that were challenged with MHV-3 at the peak of Plasmodium parasitemia had a more severe variant of liver damage and inflammation displaying perivascular inflammatory foci (Fig. 7C panel 4; yellow arrow) with accumulation of leukocytes bordering the vessels (Fig. 7C panel 4; black arrow) and hemozoin deposition (Fig. 7C panel 4; blue arrow) succumbing to co-infection significantly earlier (100% lethality at 2 days post infection) (Fig. 7BC). To understand for how long murine malaria could impair KC function we also challenged mice when infection was already cleared (28 days post inoculation) knowing that despite undetectable parasitemia KCs were still harboring intracellular hemozoin at this timepoint (Fig. 7D). In complete agreement mice that were challenged with MHV-3 at 28 days after Plasmodium infection were still more susceptible to disease presenting significant earlier mortality (Fig. 7E) showing steatosis (Fig. 7F panel 4; yellow arrow) hemozoin crystal (Fig. 7F panel 4; black arrow) and hydropic degeneration (Fig. 7F panel 3; white square Fig. 7F panel 4; blue arrow) (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Together these data suggest that failure on KC function induced by Plasmodium infection might consist in an aggravating factor in prognosis of relevant respiratory tract diseases including the current world-wide concerning of Sars-Cov-2 pandemic.

We have previously demonstrated that KCs are one of the most significant cells to arrest and clear bacteria in the circulation and when E. coli scape from gut microcirculation and flows within systemic circulation KCs immediately capture and kill these bacteria in the liver24. To further investigate if hemozoin deposition and KC dysfunction could also impair mice ability to face bacterial challenges we injected mice with E. coli at the peak of plasmodium parasitemia (Fig. 8A). While mice single infected with Plasmodium or E. coli completely survived for the whole experimental period co-infection with bacteria in mice with malaria led to 100% of mortality at 24–48 h after bacterial infection (Fig. 8B). Such enhanced mortality could be—at least in part—explained by a reduced arresting of bacteria within the liver as demonstrated by off-line digital tracking of E. coli behavior in infected mice as compared to controls (Fig. 8C). As seen in Fig. 8C and Supplementary Video 3 E. coli displays a free-flowing behavior within sinusoids in co-infected group while they were almost instantaneously arrested in mice which are not challenged with Plasmodium. Also the rate of KCs—regardless their reminiscent number—that were able to engulf bacteria was significantly lower in co-infection group as compared to Plasmodium only challenged group (Fig. 8D). These data led us to hypothesize that such inefficient KC clearance behavior could predispose systemic bacteria to spread to other organs fueling widespread infection. In fact Plasmodium infected mice evolved to a massive E. coli spread to several organs including liver spleen lung brain and blood as compared to controls (Fig. 8E). Therefore KC depletion during Plasmodium infection is sufficiently severe to impact in host ability to fight secondary infections. Taken together our data provided solid mechanistic evidence that hemozoin deposition within liver macrophages with concomitant inflammation and necrotic cell death could be a relevant virulence factor during malaria infection which ultimately predisposes individuals to super infections.",,,,,,
BRK-B,Berkshire Hathaway,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzExLzE4L2hvdy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1iZXQtYXBwbGUtd2l0aG91dC1hcHBsZS1zdG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Warren Buffett Made a Bet on Apple Without Buying More Apple Stock,"Buffett added Apple exposure while diversifying Berkshire's portfolio.

Apple (AAPL 1.00%) is by far the largest investment in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. His 895 million shares mean that 39% of the portfolio's value is in Apple stock.

Although Apple is one of Buffett's biggest winners such a significant position may appear to counter the investment strategy of Buffett and his team which leaned toward more diversification. So it's ironic that this investment has further increased. The question for investors is whether the strategy will work for Buffett and for Apple shareholders looking to follow his lead.

How Berkshire's Apple investment increased

Berkshire's 13F filing following third-quarter 2022 earnings revealed a surprising purchase -- 60 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -0.56%). TSMC manufactures chips for the most prominent semiconductor companies including Apple.

According to estimates from Bloomberg and DigiTimes TSMC relied on Apple for more than 25% of its revenue in 2021. This makes Apple TSMC's largest client. That is also a large enough share that TSMC stock could easily rise and fall with the fortunes of Apple.

It also shows how critical TSMC is to Apple. The chips it makes go into critical Apple products such as the iPhone iPad and Mac computers making the chipmaker an indispensable part of Apple's business.

Why this is a wise strategy

The TSMC purchase amounts to ""concentrated diversification."" It benefits Berkshire because it diversifies Buffett's portfolio while exposing itself more deeply to Apple. Since over 25% of TSMC's business involves Apple that means just under 75% does not. Many of TSMC's other clients -- which include Advanced Micro Devices Broadcom Nvidia and Qualcomm -- lead niches within the semiconductor industry.

Moreover Buffett likes market leaders and TSMC fits that description. According to TrendForce TSMC produces slightly more than half of the world's semiconductors. That dominance comes largely from maintaining technical leads over companies like Intel and Samsung. That fact means that its segment-leading clients including Apple will likely continue to turn to TSMC.

Investors will also like that TSMC holds the potential as a profitable stand-alone investment. Its revenue in the first nine months of 2022 of $56 billion grew 43% compared with the same period in 2021. Also its nearly $25 billion in net income left it plenty of cash to invest in the business and pay investors like Buffett more than $7 billion in dividends.

Buffett and his team also bought this stock at a lower valuation than Apple. During Q3 when Berkshire purchased five lots of shares TSMC traded at a P/E ratio ranging from 12 to 18. In comparison Apple sold for between 22 times and 28 times earnings an added factor that may have led to the purchase of TSMC shares.

Should Apple investors follow such a lead?

Investors with significant Apple holdings could further concentrate by adding TSMC shares. At a 14 P/E ratio it remains a cheaper chip stock than Apple and trades near levels where Buffett's company bought TSMC shares.

However investors should not expect this strategy to work most of the time. Even if one can understand a company's suppliers well it is not typical for a related company to offer a low valuation and considerable growth potential.

Nonetheless the TSMC purchase looks like a wise strategy in Buffett's case and shareholders in Apple TSMC and Berkshire Hathaway should profit as a result.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1zdG9jay1wb3J0Zm9saW8tMTAtMTgzNjIwNDA0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Stock Portfolio and 10 Newest Investments in 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1zdG9jay1wb3J0Zm9saW8tMTAtMTgzNjIwNDA0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E6104E7790>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1zdG9jay1wb3J0Zm9saW8tMTAtMTgzNjIwNDA0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vZXRmcy1hbmQtZnVuZHMvc2VjdG9ycy9zcDUwMC13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1tYWtlcy1hbGwtaGlzLW1vbmV5LWZyb20tc3RvY2tzLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Makes All His Money From Just 11 Stocks,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-warren-buffett-makes-all-his-money-from-stocks-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vZXRmcy1hbmQtZnVuZHMvc2VjdG9ycy9zcDUwMC13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1tYWtlcy1hbGwtaGlzLW1vbmV5LWZyb20tc3RvY2tzLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHRzLWJlcmtzaGlyZS13YXJucy1hYm91dC1jcnlwdG8td2Vic2l0ZS11c2luZy1pdHMtbmFtZS0yMDIyLTExLTE4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Berkshire warns about crypto website using its name,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/technology/warren-buffetts-berkshire-warns-about-crypto-website-using-its-name-2022-11-18/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHRzLWJlcmtzaGlyZS13YXJucy1hYm91dC1jcnlwdG8td2Vic2l0ZS11c2luZy1pdHMtbmFtZS0yMDIyLTExLTE4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL25vcm1hbmR5cGFya2Jsb2cuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvcGxlYXNlLXdlbGNvbWUtbmV3LWFnZW50LWthaWx5LWZpdHpnZXJhbGQtdG8tYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LWhvbWVzZXJ2aWNlcy1ub3J0aHdlc3QtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Please welcome new agent Kaily Fitzgerald to Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Northwest Real Estate - The ...,"SPONSORED :

The two major money managers led a pack of 76 institutional investors — defined as firms managing $100 million or more — that have bought additional shares in Compass according to an analysis by The Real Deal of Securities and Exchange Commission filings and Nasdaq data.

Firms that increased their positions in the brokerage collectively acquired 30.9 million shares.

Vanguard last quarter bought 6.3 million shares in Compass building its stake in the brokerage to nearly 9 percent from 7.4 percent. Even with the increase the value of its shares in Compass dropped from $115.6 million to $88.9 million during the quarter.

BlackRock the world’s largest money manager likewise increased its exposure to Compass stock as the value of its holdings plunged. During the third quarter BlackRock bought another 3.8 million shares increasing its stake to nearly 4 percent from 3 percent. The shares’ value however dropped to $39.7 million from $115.6 million.

Not all institutional investors kept the faith.

A total of 71 reduced their exposure to the stock in the third quarter collectively offloading 27.4 million shares. The biggest transactions involved Discovery Capital Management and the New York State Common Retirement Fund whose sole trustee is the state comptroller Tom DiNapoli.

Discovery which sold 844411 shares now has an $11.4 million stake in Compass. Meanwhile the retirement fund a pension plan for state government workers shed 622241 shares dropping the value of its holdings in Compass to just $425000.

Institutional investors collectively own 292 million shares or around two-thirds of Compass. During the third quarter 40 firms left their positions in the brokerage unchanged including its largest shareholder SoftBank which stood pat with 132.4 million shares.

In August SoftBank disclosed that the value of its Compass investment which totaled $1.08 billion over three funding rounds had dropped to $543 million.

Its latest SEC filings show that it has taken more losses. In the third quarter SoftBank estimated the value of its stake in Compass at $307 million down from $477.8 million during the previous quarter.

Twenty-eight firms took new positions in Compass led by J. Goldman & Co. which reported an acquisition of just under 1 million shares. Another 28 firms divested their stakes. The largest selloff involved Wasatch Advisors which sold its more than 4 million shares in the brokerage.

Construction can start on first phase of Las Vegas Spaceport

New York financial giant Blackstone is a major landlord in Las Vegas with megaresorts on the Strip and other buildings in its portfolio.

Now an industrial real estate firm it owns is developing its first Southern Nevada warehouse projects.

Link Logistics which owns around 9 million square feet of industrial space in the region recently announced plans to build two new complexes in North Las Vegas that will span more than 1 million square feet combined.

One project Desert Palm will feature a 350000-square-foot facility on Cheyenne Avenue just west of Interstate 15. The other Desert Willow will consist of three buildings totaling 720000 square feet at Commerce Street and Gowan Road according to a news release.

Both are expected to be finished in the fourth quarter next year the release said. It noted that Link focuses across the U.S. on infill sites or plots surrounded by existing development.

Southern Nevada’s warehouse market grew considerably over the last several years and accelerated even more after the pandemic hit as increased online shopping fueled demand for distribution space. Industrial vacancies are at all-time lows and developers keep launching new projects especially in North Las Vegas.

Joe Williams director of development in the west region for Link told the Review-Journal that infill sites are near population centers and can serve local businesses.

Matthew Duplantis Link’s market officer for Nevada and Arizona also pointed to the business generated by the convention industry and said if a building is a certain distance away from say the Las Vegas Convention Center tenants are unlikely to get hired by attendees to truck in goods or materials.

Blackstone led by billionaire Stephen Schwarzman kicked off a real estate buying spree in Southern Nevada after the economy crashed a decade or so ago acquiring rental houses apartment complexes and office buildings.

It bought The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for $1.73 billion in 2014 then sold the flashy hotel-casino for $5.65 billion in a deal that closed this spring. It still has a heavy presence on the Strip having acquired as a landlord several MGM Resorts International-operated properties in recent years.

It purchased Bellagio’s real estate for $4.2 billion in 2019; teamed up to acquire MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay in 2020 in a deal that valued those properties at $4.6 billion; and purchased Aria and Vdara’s real estate last year for nearly $3.9 billion.

Blackstone acquired a huge portfolio of U.S. industrial buildings from Singapore real estate giant GLP for $18.7 billion in 2019 giving the buyer 179 million square feet of infill logistics properties.

Blackstone which formed Link Logistics in 2019 acquired more than 4.7 million square feet of industrial space in Southern Nevada through the GLP deal according to Duplantis.

Boeing has consolidated its defense space and security business from eight divisions into four according to a company statement. Those reorganized divisions now focus on vertical lift; mobility surveillance and bombers; air dominance; and space intelligence and weapons systems.

The changes mark the first major moves to revamp the defense unit since Ted Colbert took over as its president and chief executive in March.

“I am confident this reorganization will drive greater and more simplified integration and collaboration across Boeing Defense Space and Security” Colbert said. “These changes will help accelerate operational discipline and program quality and performance while stabilizing our development and production programs. These are necessary steps to put BDS on the path to stronger profitable growth.”

In the third quarter of 2022 Boeing’s defense business reported $2.8 billion in losses which led to the company as a whole reporting a nearly $3.3 billion loss.

The company blamed the losses on problems with the KC-46A Pegasus program — which saw a nearly $1.2 billion charge in that quarter alone — as well as the VC-25B Air Force One MC-25 Stingray T-7 Red Hawk and NASA’s Commercial Crew programs. Boeing pointed to higher manufacturing and supply chain costs as well as technical challenges. Air Force One also had a $766 million charge in the last quarter.

The Pegasus in particular has had persistent troubles particularly with the faulty vision system that boom operators use to refuel aircraft. A redesigned version of the vision system has been repeatedly delayed and was most recently pushed back 19 months to October 2025.

Reorganizing Boeing’s defense divisions also brought a reshuffling of its executive ranks — and two major retirements.

Steve Parker who was vice president and general manager for bombers and fighters has been appointed chief operating officer for Boeing Defense the company said.

Mark Cherry will remain vice president and general manager of the vertical lift division the company said.

Dan Gillian previously vice president and general manager of U.S. government services for Boeing Global Services will now head Boeing defense’s mobility surveillance and bombers division. Programs handled by this division include the KC-46 Pegasus E-7 Wedgetail VC-25B Air Force One presidential plane Survivable Airborne Operations Center P-8 Poseidon and the E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System or AWACS aircraft.

Steve Nordlund who headed Boeing’s Phantom Works advanced research development and prototyping division is now vice president and general manager for the air dominance division.

Phantom Works’ non-space portfolio including its Virtual Warfare Center has been folded into this new division which will also include the F-15 Eagle T-7 Red Hawk trainer MQ-25 Stingray MQ-28 Ghost Bat — used by Australia in its Loyal Wingman program — and classified programs. And Nordlund will be the senior site executive for Boeing’s St. Louis region where aircraft such as the T-7 are built.

Kay Sears now vice president and general manager for autonomous systems will be in charge of Boeing Defense’s new space intelligence and weapon systems division. This division will include space exploration and launch programs satellites munitions missiles weapon system deterrents space-related components of Phantom Works and subsidiaries such as Liquid Robotics and Spectrolab.

Boeing said Jim Chilton now senior vice president for space and launch will continue to manage space exploration and launch programs satellites and Phantom Works Space until Feb. 4 2023. The following day Chilton will become Colbert’s senior adviser focusing on future space ventures.

Tim Peters and Cindy Gruensfelder who now serve as vice presidents and general managers of mobility and surveillance and missile and weapon systems respectively will retire after the transitions are complete Boeing said.

The defense unit is also consolidating its manufacturing and safety total quality supply chain and program management efforts.

The sector’s losses were blamed on poor-performing Pentagon programs and the long-delayed Starliner capsule a reusable spacecraft designed to transport NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.

Boeing Defense Space & Security (BDS) a $26.5 billion a year business will continue to be led by Ted Colbert who was named BDS president and CEO in March.

BDS includes a broad portfolio of fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft commercial and government satellites human spaceflight programs and weapons.

Boeing announced it will consolidate BDS’s eight divisions into four: Vertical Lift; Mobility Surveillance & Bombers; Air Dominance; Space Intelligence & Weapon Systems.

The Space Intelligence & Weapon Systems sector will be led by space industry veteran Kay Sears who joined Boeing in February as vice president and general manager of autonomous systems and was previously vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin’s military space portfolio.

Sears will oversee space exploration and launch programs including NASA’s Space Launch System moon rocket as well as satellites munitions missiles weapon system deterrents maritime undersea Phantom Works Space and subsidiaries.

James Chilton who was senior vice president of space and launch will transition to a new role as senior advisor to Ted Colbert focusing on future space ventures. Between now and Feb. 4 2023 Chilton will continue to manage space exploration and launch programs satellites and Phantom Works Space.

by J. Kasper Oestergaard European Correspondent Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 35 and 62 commercial jets in October 2022 compared to 27 and 36 deliveries respectively in the same month last year. Year to date Boeing and Airbus have delivered 363 and 497 aircraft compared to 268 and 460 respectively in the first 10 months of 2021. So far this year Boeing and Airbus are 95 and 37 deliveries ahead of last year’s totals respectively.

Following a more-than-challenging 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2021 was a year of recovery for the two largest commercial plane makers. With the end of the year approaching 2022 is set to be another year of recovery for the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry despite supply chain challenges macro-economic weakness and the conflict in Ukraine. Boeing and Airbus still have a long way to go before deliveries are back to pre-pandemic levels though.

For the full year 2021 Boeing delivered 340 aircraft compared to 157 in 2020 and 380 in 2019. Boeing’s last “normal” year was 2018 – before COVID-19 and the 737 MAX grounding – when it delivered 806 jets a level that will likely not be recaptured before 2025. The past three years have been extremely challenging for Boeing but despite Dreamliner quality issues and 777X delays the outlook is mostly bright. Dreamliner deliveries have resumed and the 737 MAX is approved to fly in nearly every country. The aircraft however has not yet returned to commercial service with Chinese airlines despite the fact that the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) ungrounded the 737 MAX in December of last year. On October 30 China Southern Airlines canceled two 737 MAX flights that would have marked the aircraft’s return to commercial service with Chinese airlines. On October 10 a Boeing 737 MAX flight by MIAT Mongolian Airlines landed in Guangzhou – the first commercial flight by the model to China since the aircraft’s grounding in March 2019. Earlier this year it was announced that Boeing will begin to remarket some 737 MAX jets earmarked for Chinese customers. Ongoing political tensions between the United States and China are impeding deliveries and Boeing is facing perhaps its most difficult situation since entering the Chinese market half a century ago. Chinese airlines are no longer ordering its jets and hundreds of new aircraft cannot be delivered to Chinese customers. On top of that Boeing is stuck with a completions and delivery center in Zhoushan that it has no need for until the political situation improves. The Zhoushan plant was scaled to accommodate 100 aircraft annually.

In 2021 Airbus delivered 611 aircraft and won the deliveries crown for the third year in a row. Deliveries were up from 566 in 2020 but remain well below the company’s all-time record high of 863 shipments in 2019. Airbus is expected to retain the deliveries lead for the foreseeable future due to the company’s comfortable backlog lead over its American rival. Prior to 2019 Boeing had out-delivered Airbus every year since 2012.

As indicated above in October 2022 Boeing delivered 35 jets including 23 737s (22 MAX / 1 NG) one 747 four 767s one 777 and six 787s. Since June of this year the 737 program has been producing aircraft at an official monthly rate of 31 per month up from 27. The rate of 27 per month was maintained between November 2021 and May 2022 and prior to that the monthly rate was just 19. Despite the recent 737 rate increase ongoing supply chain issues are likely to persist for the time being. Boeing had been considering a boost in 737 production to 38 jets per month in the first half of 2023 followed by another increase to 47 jets per month by the end of 2023 but these plans have now been postponed. In connection with the release of Boeing’s second quarter 2022 earnings President and CEO David Calhoun commented “But I do believe we’re at a state now where at 31 we are comfortable the industry can get there and maybe has already gotten there and then we are going to watch as they qualify more capacity going forward before we pull those rates up.” At present Boeing’s main supply chain headache is its engine supply.

On August 10 deliveries of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were resumed following a suspension of shipments that lasted nearly 16 months. Boeing suspended Dreamliner deliveries in May 2021 for the second time in less than a year. The current 787 production rate is two aircraft per month and Boeing expects to continue at this rate for now but will likely return to five per month over time. In March of this year it was reported that the company was testing the ability of suppliers to meet output scenarios as high as seven per month by the end of 2023.

The 777 program was expected to get a new addition in late 2023 with the first delivery of the 777X but in April Boeing announced this will now not happen before 2025. This reflects an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements. According to Boeing the 777-9 production rate ramp-up is being adjusted to minimize inventory and the number of planes requiring “change incorporation” including a temporary pause through 2023. However Boeing is taking advantage of the adjustment to the 777-9 production schedule by adding 777 freighter capacity starting in late 2023. In January of this year Boeing launched a new 777X-based freighter thereby expanding its 777X and cargo portfolio. Qatar Airways will be the 777-8F launch customer.

In October 2022 Airbus delivered 62 jets including five A220s 47 A320s (all NEO) three A330s and seven A350s. During 2021 Airbus steadily increased A320 production from 40 per month to 43 in Q3 2021 before finishing the year at a rate of 45 per month. Production will continue to be increased until reaching a monthly rate of 65 by early 2024 (recently pushed back from mid-2023 due to supply chain challenges). Also Airbus is working with its supply chain to increase the A320 production rate to 75 aircraft per month in 2025. The newest A320 NEO family addition the A321XLR successfully accomplished its first flight on June 15 2022. Entry into service initially planned for the end of 2023 is now expected to take place in early 2024.

The A220 meanwhile is being produced at a rate of six aircraft per month up from five at the beginning of the year – with a monthly production rate of 14 envisioned by the middle of the decade. The A350 production rate currently averages five per month and was expected to be increased to six by early 2023. However the rate increase will likely be delayed until the end of 2023 due to sanctions on Russia and a legal fight between Airbus and Qatar Airways over A350 paint/surface issues. Airbus is currently producing two A330s per month a rate that is expected to be increased to nearly three aircraft by the end of 2022.

In 2021 Airbus launched the A350 freighter or A350F which is a major and much-needed boost to the company’s competitiveness in the cargo segment. Boeing has long dominated the cargo space with its 737-800BCF 767-300BCF 767-300F 777F 777-8F and 747-8F offerings. Until now Airbus has only offered the A330-200F which has not performed well in competition against Boeing’s popular 767-300F. With the launch of the A350F it appears Airbus is getting serious about capturing more of the cargo aircraft market. The A350F which carries up to 120 tons (109 metric tons) of cargo received its first order in November of last year and will predominantly compete with the 777F and later the 777X freighter. In comparison the 777F has a cargo capacity of up to 112 tons (102 metric tons). To date the A350F has accumulated 31 net new orders.

Turning to the October orders review Boeing had a strong month and booked orders from seven customers for a total of 122 jets. The company reported no cancellations in October. The largest order for 42 737-10s and 10 737-9s was placed by Alaska Airlines followed by the order placed by International Airlines Group (IAG) – one of the world’s largest airline groups – which booked a total of 50 737-8-200s and 737-10s. Also in October an undisclosed customer placed an order for 10 787-9 Dreamliners. Finally Emirates booked five 777 freighters. Other customers ordered a total of four 737 MAXs and one 767-300F. Year to date Boeing has accumulated 550 net new orders (664 gross orders). In 2021 Boeing booked 909 gross orders and received 430 cancellations for a total of 479 net new orders (before ASC 606 changes). Please note that for comparison reasons we do not include Boeing’s so-called ASC 606 accounting adjustments in the numbers reported in this article and regard net new orders as gross orders minus cancellations.

In October Airbus booked 177 orders from five different customers and reported 14 cancellations (11 A320neos and three A321neos). IAG ordered 31 A320neos and 28 A321neos followed by Xiamen Airlines which booked 25 A320neos and 15 A321neos. Also in October Jet2 plc ordered 35 A320neos while an undisclosed customer booked 28 A321neos. Finally Air Canada ordered 15 A220-300s. Year to date Airbus has accumulated 810 net new orders (1033 gross orders) surpassing both 2021 gross orders and net new orders. In 2021 Airbus booked a total of 771 gross orders and received 264 cancellations for a total of 507 net new orders – enough to win the orders crown for the third year in a row. It should be noted however that if Boeing’s 2021 ASC 606 adjustments were included Boeing would have come out ahead with 535 net new orders.

At the end of October 2022 Airbus reported a backlog of 7397 jets of which 6772 or 92 percent were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 328 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of October Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5323 aircraft of which 4277 or 80 percent were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.6 years of shipments at the 2019 production level (the pre-pandemic level) or 12.1 years based on the 2021 total. In comparison Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.6 years at the 2018 level (the most recent “normal” year for Boeing) or 15.7 years based on 2021 deliveries. In 2022 to date Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries is 1.52. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 1.63. In 2021 Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was 1.41 while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.81.

For 2022 Forecast International’s analysts currently expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 407 and 668 commercial jets respectively. Compared to the 2021 level this is a 19.7 percent increase for Boeing and a 9.3 percent increase for Airbus. Please note these figures exclude militarized variants of commercial platforms such as Boeing’s P-8 Poseidon and KC-46 Pegasus and Airbus’ A330 MRTT tanker.

Boeing released third quarter 2022 results on October 26 and now expects to deliver 375 737 MAX jets down from its previous guidance in the low 400s. Airbus released Q3 2022 earnings on October 28 and maintained its target of 700 commercial aircraft deliveries this year. This means that Airbus expects to deliver as many as 203 aircraft in total in November and December which is quite ambitious. However from 2017-19 Airbus managed to do just that – delivering 201 aircraft in November-December 2017 and 216 in the last two months of both 2018 and 2019.

Boeing Defense Space & Security (BDS) reorganized its divisions streamlining to help turn around the firm’s financial performance the aerospace giant announced Nov. 17. Instead of eight divisions the company will now have four divisions: Air Dominance; Mobility Surveillance and Bombers; Vertical Lift; and Space Intelligence and Weapons systems.

“These changes will help accelerate operational discipline and program quality and performance while stabilizing our development and production programs” BDS chief executive officer Ted Colbert said in a statement. “These are necessary steps to put BDS on the path to stronger profitable growth.” The consolidation is effective immediately.

Boeing has faced companywide losses including in its commercial sector. Its defense business has been a significant drag on the company’s recent financial performance following losses incurred on fixed-price government contracts. In October Boeing reported a loss of $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 with its defense business $2.8 billion in the red.

“Turnarounds take time—and we have more work to do—but I am confident in our team and the actions we’re taking for the future” Boeing chief executive officer David L. Calhoun wrote in a letter to employees at the time.

Now Boeing has pivoted in its operations in the hopes of turning around its finances. Only the Vertical Lift division remains untouched with Mark Cherry remaining vice president and general manager of the division.

Dan Gillian previously in charge of U.S. government operations for Boeing Global Services will take over the Mobility Surveillance and Bombers division. That portfolio will include the KC-46 Survivable Airborne Operations Center E-7 E-3 VC-25B P-8 bombers 777X components and executive transport aircraft.

The KC-46 and VC-25B which will become the new Air Force One have been a significant financial drag for Boeing. The KC-46 program lost $1.2 billion and the VC-25B program lost $766 million in the third quarter. The KC-46 has been troubled from the start problems in its refueling system requiring a revamp and leading to delays. The VC-25B program was priced too cheaply according to Boeing making it a loss generator for the company. Supply chain issues and labor shortages have increased problems.

Steve Nordlund formerly the head of the Phantom Works advanced research and development division will lead Air Dominance. That division will include the non-space elements of Phantom Works classified programs and the F-18 F-15 T-7 MQ-25 and MQ-28 currently used by Australia.

Kay Sears until now the head of autonomous systems will take over the new Space Intelligence and Weapons Systems unit. That will include space exploration launch programs satellites munitions missiles weapon system deterrents maritime undersea Phantom Works space and Boeing subsidiaries BI&A Millennium Insitu Liquid Robotics Spectrolab Argon and DRT.

Several executives will retire after assisting with the transitions: Tim Peters the head of mobility and surveillance and Cindy Gruensfelder who has led missile and weapon systems. Jim Chilton the senior vice president for space and launch will continue to manage space exploration launch programs satellites and Phantom Works space operations until February before moving to a senior adviser role with Colbert.

The reshuffle comes as part of a broader shakeup in BDS. Colbert appointed former bomber and fighters division head Steve Parker to take on a new position as chief operating officer at BDS to help turn its fortunes around Reuters reported in October which Boeing confirmed in its latest announcement.

“I am confident this reorganization will drive greater and more simplified integration and collaboration” Colbert said."

The company’s Suzhou facility started producing inverters since September 2017.

As a result the Suzhou Plant Phase II has been launched to expand its inverter production capacity by adding Viper manufacturing capability making the facility its second largest Viper production site around the globe after the Singapore site.

As per a press release from the company these milestones underscore BorgWarner’s strong innovation and production capabilities and its Charging Forward strategy to drive the trend of electrification in the global automotive industry.

Notably the Singapore facility began producing small batches of the first-generation of Viper power switches in 2014.

Working On Electronics

In another announcement BorgWarner has stated to enter into a strategic partnership with Wolfspeed wherein the product company will invest $500 million in Wolfspeed’s financing transaction. Accordingly the company has also filed a Form 8-K disclosing its commitment to invest.

Under the multi-year agreement the company will be entitled to purchase up to $650 million of devices annually.

Frédéric Lissalde President and CEO BorgWarner noted that silicon carbide-based power electronics play an increasingly important role for the customers as the electric vehicle business continues to accelerate.

Notably BorgWarner’s Charging Forward strategy targets $4.5 billion of electric vehicle revenue for 2025 compared to less than $350 million in 2021.

Gregg Lowe President and CEO Wolfspeed said “The announcement demonstrates the creative solutions two collaborative and strategic partners are pursuing to better support the growing demand for silicon carbide devices. BorgWarner has been a strong partner with Wolfspeed for many years.”

A Newton family is offering the city the chance to buy about 15 acres of largely undeveloped land for $24 million — and local officials are soliciting developers’ proposals on partnering with the city to make a deal.

The property located close to Newton South High School stretches between Dudley and Brandeis roads and a majority of the site already is zoned for single-family housing according to Mayor Ruthanne Fuller. But the city is considering whether the property could be used for public open space affordable housing or for the schools.

Fuller said the city is exploring the potential of joining with a developer to purchase the property.

“This approach which has been used successfully here in Newton and elsewhere may provide us with an opportunity to achieve both some of the City’s desired outcomes for the property and at the same time partner with a developer to submit a competitive acquisition offer” Fuller said in a statement.

The property is currently owned by longtime Dudley Road residents Dr. Lois Slovik and Dr. David Slovik who have owned the bulk of the land since 1979.

In addition to an undeveloped 13-acre parcel the Sloviks own a 1912 Colonial-style home at 85 Dudley Road and a 1965 raised ranch at 132 Brandeis Road they purchased in 2011. All three properties are included as part of the proposed sale to the city.

The couple declined to be interviewed and asked LandVest Real Estate to serve as their representatives according to David A. Rosen the company’s chairman.

Both have deep ties to Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Lois Slovik is a psychiatrist and the director emeritus of the Couples and Family Therapy Program at the hospital and is an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the medical school.

David Slovik is a hospital endocrinologist and an associate professor of medicine at the medical school.

In a statement to the Globe Rosen said the Sloviks know that the property has “significant development potential.”

“They wish to give the City of Newton and Newton Conservators the opportunity to purchase the property before putting it on the market in order to see whether the property could be used for” purposes like the expansion of open space the school district recreation or other municipal uses according to Rosen.

“They would particularly like to see the property used for public purposes as open space” Rosen said.

Large blocks of undeveloped land do not come to market often in Newton and when they do the city has to contend with the astronomical value of local real estate which is far higher than in most of the region.

In the Garden City the median single-family home price was about $1.6 million in September up nearly 25 percent from a year earlier according to Redfin. By contrast the median single-family home price in Eastern Massachusetts climbed to $900000 earlier this year.

Under the city’s current zoning rules the 15-acre property could be used to create about 20 single-family homes Fuller has said.

In Newton the closest example of what this sort of arrangement might look like was the purchase of 40 acres of Kesseler Woods land off Vine Street in 2003.

At the time the city worked with a developer to put up the roughly $15 million purchase price — the city’s share was about one-third of the cost — in order to preserve about half of the land as open space. In 2015 the city approved 88 rental apartments for the remainder of the property including about a dozen affordable units.

The last time the city acquired a large swath of land was in 2019 when it used eminent domain to take about 15 acres of Webster Woods from Boston College. The city announced it would pay the university $15.2 million for the Hammond Pond Parkway property which Fuller said would be preserved as open space.

But the university has opposed the taking and the sides have been wrangling in Middlesex Superior Court over the land’s value.

Meanwhile Fuller is making the case for a $15 million tax increase to help fund city services and schools plus school building projects.

Fuller said the city has not yet determined how it would fund any purchase from the Sloviks.

“We look forward to seeing the responses to the request for Expressions of Interest [from developers] and what a potential partnership might be before determining how or whether the City might choose to fund this potential project” Fuller said in a statement to the Globe.

Developers have until Dec. 1 to make their proposals to the city and those concepts will be reviewed by a team of city housing school and environmental officials.

The group also includes Rick Lipof the City Council’s vice president and a city councilor from Ward 8 where the property is located.

If the city and a developer partner were to ultimately acquire the site any potential development would still fall under the review of city boards and departments according to Lipof.

“The interest will guide where we go. We can tell people what we want to see and the components that we welcome. But we’ll have to see what comes forward” Lipof said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2Jlc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvcmVwb3J0LTgwLW9mLWJvc3Rvbi1saWZlLXNjaWVuY2UtcHJvamVjdHMtbWF5LWJlLXNoZWx2ZWQv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2xvYmVzdC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9yZXBvcnQtODAtb2YtYm9zdG9uLWxpZmUtc2NpZW5jZS1wcm9qZWN0cy1tYXktYmUtc2hlbHZlZC8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: 80% of Boston Life Science Projects May be Shelved,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.globest.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/11/17/report-80-of-boston-life-science-projects-may-be-shelved/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E611093490>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2Jlc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvcmVwb3J0LTgwLW9mLWJvc3Rvbi1saWZlLXNjaWVuY2UtcHJvamVjdHMtbWF5LWJlLXNoZWx2ZWQv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2xvYmVzdC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9yZXBvcnQtODAtb2YtYm9zdG9uLWxpZmUtc2NpZW5jZS1wcm9qZWN0cy1tYXktYmUtc2hlbHZlZC8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ib3N0b24vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzExLzE3L2Jvc3Rvbi1iZXJkby1kZWFkbGluZS1uZWFycy1vd25lcnMtcnVuLWJlaGluZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boston's BERDO emissions reporting deadline may be extended as building owners fall behind in process,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bizjournals.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /boston/news/2022/11/17/boston-berdo-deadline-nears-owners-run-behind.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E611092D70>, 'Connection to www.bizjournals.com timed out.

What if it were possible to swap out the fuel flowing through pipes from natural gas to something carbon-free? Like magic you could keep heating homes as they are currently heated but put an end to a major source of emissions that is contributing to the onslaught of wildfires and catastrophic weather of recent years.

That’s part of what researchers from the University of Massachusetts Lowell were aiming to find out when they embarked on a study to examine the viability of hydrogen in Massachusetts. In a paper published earlier this year in the peer reviewed journal Frontiers in Energy Research the team offered an endorsement recommending among other things that the state should consider adopting green hydrogen and blending it with natural gas to heat homes and fuel appliances like gas stoves. A similar recommendation wound up in a bill before the Legislature.

The trouble is like magic not everything is as it seems.

Several prominent scientists say the UMass Lowell study’s conclusions largely dismiss a body of research that has found risks associated with running hydrogen through ordinary gas pipes and that the process of producing it requires so much energy that making it on a mass scale wouldn’t be viable for heating homes. Some researchers have even concluded that hydrogen though it has no carbon could actually accelerate global warming.

What’s more while the study lists the Associated Industry of Massachusetts Foundation as the funder hundreds of pages of documents obtained by a public records request reveal that the authors knew that the funds had been solicited directly from some of the foundation’s members in the natural gas and pipeline industry which has staked its future in part on the large-scale adoption of hydrogen. But in the published study the authors did not disclose what some experts say is a conflict of interest.

E-mails sent among the study’s principals and their funders reveal that specialists at natural gas giant National Grid and a business lobbyist with ties to the industry were allowed to review and suggest changes before the study was released. Some of the study’s recommendations were substantially written by the lobbyist.

“My personal take is this should not have been published in a peer reviewed journal as it is because I think the presentation is biased slanted and misleading in a way that’s hard to defend academically” said Robert Howarth a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University who has published research on hydrogen and is helping to advise New York state’s climate transition.

The UMass study appears to be part of a trend in which researchers who receive funding from the gas industry have concluded that hydrogen can be used in home heating while independent studies have not.

“There are at least as many industry-funded studies as there are independent ones” said Jan Rosenow the European program director of the Regulatory Assistance Project an independent energy policy organization and the author of a recent study that examined how studies on hydrogen and heating differed depending on the funding source. ”To my own astonishment I found that of the studies I identified as independent not one suggests that hydrogen for heating at least at scale is a sensible economic choice” he said.

UMass Lowell officials and the study’s lead author Christopher Niezrecki a distinguished professor and at the time of the study chair of the university’s mechanical engineering department said that they stand behind the work and that it complied with the university’s research integrity policies.

The UMass Lowell records were shared with the Globe after being obtained by the utility watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute which requested the documents after an early press release led it to suspect a cozy relationship between the researchers and the gas industry.

The idea for the study was hatched at a time when gas companies were seeing ominous signs for their industry in Massachusetts. In 2020 the Baker administration had prepared a plan for net zero greenhouse gas emissions that prioritized replacing gas and oil for home and commercial heating with electric heat pumps. And Attorney General Maura Healey had petitioned the state’s Department of Public Utilities to chart an orderly downsizing of natural gas which some viewed as tantamount to calling for the death of the industry.

Mary Usovicz then a senior staff member of UMass Lowell’s business development office brought a proposal for a study on hydrogen to the Associated Industries of Massachusetts a business trade organization. It was Usovicz’s job to find industry partnerships for university research and AIM was a logical place to turn.

The group includes members from various industries — construction retail hospitality and more — but has been found to have a particularly close relationship with the energy industry. An analysis by researchers at Brown University last year concluded that AIM consistently worked in line with the gas industry and named it one of the primary forces working to stall climate action in Massachusetts.

Usovicz had spent decades working in the gas industry and had been friendly with AIM lobbyist Robert Rio for years. Rio agreed to have AIM’s charitable arm the AIM Foundation fund the study. He then worked closely with Usovicz an author on the study while the research was being conducted meeting as often as once a week and ultimately helping to write the study’s policy recommendations he acknowledged in interviews. He said he had no particular agenda or influence over the study’s outcome.

“I parachuted in when necessary and made sure that it was on track” Rio said. “I read the report edited it a little bit did some you-should-look-at-this you-should-look-at-that.”

Asked about Rio’s involvement in the study UMass Lowell spokesman Jonathan Strunk said the university was “transparent about the report’s sponsor and the stakeholders the university authors engaged.”

A disclosure on the report states that “Any opinions findings conclusions or recommendations expressed in this report are those of the authors and do not reflect the views of the AIM Foundation or the stakeholders interviewed.” A list of stakeholders included energy companies such as National Grid Enbridge and Avangrid along with advocacy organizations like the Acadia Center Gas Leaks Allies and Salem Alliance for the Environment.

But the documents provided under the public records request shed a different light on the role that industry played. One e-mail attachment a Microsoft Word file with editing track changes shows that Rio drafted or edited entire passages of the final version of the executive summary as well as portions of the policy recommendations.

Rio said in an interview that his changes largely amounted to rewriting and smoothing out what others were proposing already but much of his language remains nearly verbatim in the final version.

“It is our conclusion that the use of hydrogen in some applications which currently use fossil fuels will reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions and help contribute to meeting the Commonwealths 2050 net-zero carbon goals and if widely adopted help reduce CO2 emissions globally” reads one paragraph that was substantially written by Rio and which appears nearly identical in the final.

Rio also drafted the language for a recommendation that the state create an overall hydrogen policy to emphasize using hydrogen to replace greenhouse-gas-emitting fuels for heating buildings and for a recommendation that the pilot program be established to start allowing gas utilities to begin blending hydrogen into the natural gas they deliver.

The e-mails also reveal that specialists from National Grid who were among the many stakeholders that the report authors talked to as they compiled the report were given a unique opportunity. Unlike the environmental advocates listed as stakeholders by the report authors the specialists from National Grid were invited to provide feedback and comments on an early draft of the study.

A spokesman for National Grid acknowledged that green hydrogen is a part of the company’s strategy and said that as a longtime AIM member “we were eager to support a study that would allow us to learn more about hydrogen’s potential as a decarbonization solution.”

The comments that National Grid provided on the draft “were rooted in experience in both our UK and US businesses science and research” the spokesman said.

Niezrecki said his team accepted some of the suggested changes “because it made sense but it’s not like any company said ‘You must have this wording in the paper.’ ” He added that he reviewed and approved all changes before publication and that all of the authors agreed on any language in the study.

Even so some other scholars familiar with the study said they were appalled.

“That’s all a really bad look for academic integrity” said Nathan Phillips a professor in the Earth and Environment department at Boston University and a climate activist. “This to me is a subtle but clear reflection of how fossil fuel industry funding influences academic research to neutralize and water it down.”

Moreover e-mail correspondence shows that the AIM Foundation funds were solicited from energy companies. In an e-mail dated Jan. 13 2021 Usovicz wrote to Niezrecki the study’s lead author detailing “the funds that we have collected to date” listing as contributors National Grid Eversource Enbridge Public Policy Group a lobbyist for Vistra and Energy New England all gas pipeline and electric companies.

At the time those companies had donated $56500 she wrote. The sum ultimately raised was $71500. It’s not clear where the additional funds came from.

Usovicz and Rio confirmed their fund-raising efforts in interviews but declined to provide additional details saying AIM policies forbade it.

“It looks like the gas companies used AIM as a kind of front group really to hide behind” said Itai Vardi a research and communications manager with the Energy and Policy Institute. “The casual reader that opens the report reads that it was funded by the AIM Foundation. But these e-mails show that the pipeline industry Enbridge and the gas companies were the main drivers here in terms of providing money.”

From the start the intent of the study went beyond a purely academic pursuit Usovicz said in an interview. The goal was to create guidance that policymakers could translate into legislation. In accordance with that goal Usovicz met with state Representative Tom Golden Jr. just as the research was beginning and soon wrote in an e-mail dated Feb. 23 2021 to Niezrecki and others that Golden had filed “placeholder” legislation on “hydrogen and other possible fuels.”

Legislative records show Golden who has since left the Legislature for another job filed two bills days apart one that simply called for more study of hydrogen and another that called for a variety of actions that could open the door for large scale use of hydrogen in the state. AIM lobbied for the first bill according to required disclosure statements and National Grid lobbied for the second bill. Rio said in interviews that he knew nothing of the second bill known as House Bill 4081.

As the study was being completed e-mails indicate that Usovicz successfully proposed a provision in the study’s recommendations calling for a state requirement that renewable fuels including hydrogen be blended into the gas system.

In November 2021 UMass Lowell announced an event to showcase the findings that was sponsored by Eversource National Grid and other gas companies. State lawmakers and others with influence on state policy participated.

In the environmental community the announcement caused a stir and caught the attention of Regina LaRocque an infectious disease physician and researcher at Harvard Medical School who is also a climate activist.

“It seemed strange to me that our state representatives would appear on a platform that seems to be hosted by these industry partners” she said.

LaRocque began an e-mail exchange with UMass Lowell chancellor Julie Chen at one point sending her a 2008 report that examined how fossil fuel companies influenced academic work by simply funding it.

“I urge you to take a look at today’s event with a critical eye to the role and purpose of the industry funding including the potential threat that such funding poses to the core academic and public interest functions of a university” she wrote.

Chen wrote back but did not respond directly to the criticism. Instead she referred LaRocque to Niezrecki the report’s lead author and noted that the authors viewed the study as “just the first in a potential series.”

Golden who participated in a panel discussion at the event the next day received $5600 in campaign donations from 14 donors who listed Eversource as their employer including several vice presidents and senior vice presidents. Another $1300 came the same day from Hickey & Associates a lobbying firm that lists Eversource as a client on its website.

Regarding the donations a spokeswoman for Eversource said “We encourage all of our employees to be active members of their communities.” Golden did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Ron Fein legal director for Free Speech For People a campaign finance reform advocacy organization said there’s nothing illegal about the donations “but it looks sordid. It shows how corrupt our system has become.”

Golden’s bills did not emerge from committee and didn’t pass before the most recent legislative session ended. But in the eyes of the industry they represented a meaningful if brief victory.

And at an industry conference in May Sheri Givens National Grid’s vice president of US Policy & Regulatory Strategy told an audience “We are proposing or what other utilities are proposing is to have some kind of incentive framework for renewable natural gas for heating purposes.”

What’s more she said there was already a vehicle: “We actually have legislation currently in Massachusetts House Bill 4081.”

Nov. 16 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE: BKD) (""Brookdale"" or the ""Company"") announced today that it has priced its previously announced public offering of 2.5 million of its 7.00% tangible equity units at $50.00 per unit (equal to the stated amount per unit). The transaction is a public offering made by means of a prospectus supplement under Brookdale's effective shelf registration statement. Brookdale's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""BKD"" and Brookdale intends to apply to list the tangible equity units on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""BKDT."" Brookdale anticipates that the offering will close on November 21 2022 subject to customary closing conditions.

Brookdale has granted the underwriters of the offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 375000 tangible equity units.

Each tangible equity unit is comprised of a prepaid stock purchase contract and a senior amortizing note due November 15 2025 each issued by Brookdale. Unless settled earlier each purchase contract will automatically settle on November 15 2025 (subject to postponement in certain limited circumstances) and Brookdale will deliver at least 12.9341 but no more than 15.1976 shares of its common stock per purchase contract subject to adjustment based upon the applicable market value of the common stock as described in the final prospectus supplement relating to the tangible equity units offering. Each amortizing note will have an initial principal amount of $8.8996 will bear interest at a rate of 10.25% per annum and will have a final installment payment date of November 15 2025. On each of February 15 May 15 August 15 and November 15 commencing on February 15 2023 Brookdale will pay quarterly cash installments of $0.8750 per amortizing note (except for the February 15 2023 installment payment which will be $0.8166 per amortizing note) which will constitute a payment of interest and a partial repayment of principal and which cash payment in the aggregate per year will be equivalent to 7.00% per year with respect to each $50.00 stated amount of tangible equity units. The amortizing notes will be the direct unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Brookdale.

Brookdale expects the net proceeds from the offering to be approximately $120.3 million (or up to $138.5 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option) after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. Brookdale expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.

BofA Securities Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc. are acting as joint book-running managers for the tangible equity unit offering. The offering of tangible equity units (including the component stock purchase contracts and senior amortizing notes) is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). The offering may only be made by means of the prospectus supplement relating to such offering and the accompanying prospectus. Copies of the prospectus supplement for the offering and the accompanying prospectus can be obtained by contacting BofA Securities Inc.; Attn: Prospectus Department 200 North College Street 3rd floor Charlotte NC 28255-0001 or by telephone at (800) 294-1322 or by emailing [email protected] or Barclays Capital Inc.; c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions 1155 Long Island Avenue Edgewood NY 11717 or by telephone at (888) 603-5847 or by emailing [email protected].

This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of Brookdale common stock into which the purchase contracts settle) and shall not constitute an offer solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer solicitation or sale is unlawful.

After she became the NCAA's all-time scorer Brown was among those to send congratulations to the Hawkeyes sharpshooter but it came in a strange way.

""Congrats to Caitlin Clark on becoming all-time leading scorer"" he wrote in a message on X accompanied by a GIF of actor Mel Gibson with long flowing hair.

Brown later called the former Iowa Hawkeyes star the ""Cracker of the Day"" after he revealed to his followers on X that she blocked him on the social media platform. It appeared that one lewd attack after another finally crossed the line for Clark.

Well the former NFL receiver went on Jason Whitlock's podcast to discuss their social media beef.

""Caitlin Clark we love you. There's no drama here. I'm excited about what you're going to do for women's basketball. You're an amazing player. I love to watch your game. You bring a lot of excitement and energy"" Brown said.

Brown later said his made-up network CTESPN ""would love to have you talk express what you deal with your traumas your adversities how you continue to be great"" saying his comments about Clark were ""all in fun and games.""

""Continue to be great continue to keep focus on being the best athlete you want to be. Continue to lead women's sports and pioneering it the way you want to pioneer it. I have a daughter they look up to you and look up to everything you guys are doing. So shout out to you Caitlin Clark.""

It was a nice message from Brown at first. But then he couldn't help but throw in one more crude comment.

""If it's hairy don't worry about it"" Brown concluded.

It's tough to imagine that Clark will be unblocking Brown any time soon after that.

The comment resulted in a sigh and little chuckle from Whitlock.

Bizarre interactions with Clark from IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel resulted in him no longer covering the WNBA for the outlet.

Clark scored 21 points in her first preseason game with the Indiana Fever last week after they selected her with the first overall pick in April. Her official WNBA debut will be next Tuesday against the Connecticut Sun.

Nov. 18 2022,"Jean Serra

V2 Communications CEO Jean Serra’s lesson learned from the early days of COVID was the importance of regular and frank communication with clients and her staff.

This took the form of honest assessment of the impact of the pandemic on clients’ bottom lines and how business goals needed to be adjusted to also keeping team members in the loop on departing accounts.

“Don’t PR your feedback” Serra stressed to the attendees of “Leading Through Challenging Times” webinar Nov. 15 sponsored by O’Dwyer’s & moderated by Researchscape's Tony Cheevers.

Inflation and fear of a recession are top of mind with many of V2’s clients but Serra faces these issues head-on. “It’s important to be upfront about the reality of the world” she stressed.

Tony Cheevers

Serra described a very busy fall so far of in-person contact with clients who while not denying impact of current events still see opportunities.

While many would characterize today’s dicey economic climate as challenging Serra prefers to look at is as evolving.

“Leadership is a lot more than managing a crisis it also involves keeping your finger on the pulse of change in your department on your team in your organization in your marketplace in the world. All of that helps leaders to identify a shifting tone and a shifting conversation in the market” Serra said.

V2 works with clients to prioritize scenarios most likely to occur and what actions will have the biggest impact on stakeholders Serra explained. Key to this effort is getting a handle on a client’s mission and vision.

ESG starts small

As ESG and sustainability efforts become increasingly common in organizations and require strong leadership to rally both internal and external stakeholders Serra noted many clients turn to her firm to help communicate both corporate positions on issues and the programs already in place.

“Even in the absence of having that formal program in place communications can help clients look at what is happening in pockets of their organization that they may not be thinking about and create connective tissue around projects that work as part of a larger ESG and sustainability narrative” she said.

Ultimately coverage of and awareness for ESG and sustainability initiatives are opportunities to contribute to larger societal conversations Serra explained.

COVID broadened talent pool

A positive side effect of the pandemic was the opening up of V2 to a talent pool not just based around their offices in Boston and New York according to Serra.

While the hybrid work model used by V2 and many others puts a damper on organic connections in the office Serra believes her team enjoys the flexibility and shows no signs of turning back. “You have to work on figuring out ways to make sure there’s an opportunity for meaningful personal interactions when people come in” Serra said.

Setting up more personalized forms of outreach to staffers is critical Serra explained. V2 uses one on one check-ins. “Good communications during tough times focuses both on what’s happening with the business but also on how people are doing personally” Serra said.

Ten months after the British songbird's abrupt residency cancellation the Grammy-nominated singer will begin her string of Weekends with Adele shows in Las Vegas on Friday.

The 32 concerts at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace – Fridays and Saturdays through March 25 – are sold out according to Ticketmaster the official ticketing site for the shows. The least expensive tickets on secondary sale sites hover around $700 before fees; some of the best seats for opening night are $10000 and higher.

On the night before her residency debut Adele posted a photo on Instagram from final rehearsals and shared her jumble of feelings.

""I’m highly emotional incredibly nervous but can’t sit still because I’m so excited"" she wrote. ""Maybe it’s because I didn’t start when I was supposed to. Maybe it’s because it’s opening night maybe it’s because Hyde Park went so great maybe its because I love the show I don’t know. But it’s safe to say I’ve never been more nervous before a show in my career...""

Adele left fans – many of whom traveled from other countries and didn't learn of the cancelation until arriving in Las Vegas – angry and disappointed after the last-minute cancelation of her residency in January. She apologized with a tearful video on social media.

""I'm so sorry but my show ain't ready. We’ve tried absolutely everything that we can to put it together in time and for it to be good enough for you but we’ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and COVID – half my crew are down with COVID they still are – and it’s been impossible to finish the show…I can’t give you what I have right now.""

Adele isn't a pop star because she's hip. It's because she's sincere

Last July Adele told BBC Radio 4 in England that she understood why fans were upset with the delay but she doesn’t regret her decision to retool the show.

The “Easy on Me” singer acknowledged as much in her latest statement saying “For some of you it was a horrible decision on my part and I will always be sorry for that but I promise you it was the right one. To be with you in such an intimate space every week has been what I’ve most been looking forward to and I’m going to give you the absolute best of me.”

Interest in seeing the singer perform hits such as ""Rolling in the Deep"" ""Easy on Me"" and ""Someone Like You"" live increased in urgency given Adele's recent comments that she intends to take a break from music after her residency wraps.

At an event last month Adele said: “after Vegas I really want to get a degree in English literature.”

“It’s something that if I hadn’t made it in my singing I think I would definitely be a teacher. I think I would be an English lit teacher” she said telling fans that she wishes she had attended college and it’s her plan for “2025 vibes.”

But don’t expect to see the “Someone Like You” singer taking notes inside a classroom. She clarified that she could receive her degree online and with a tutor.

When it comes to celebrity restaurants especially ones that are on the main drag in popular cities they're often deemed tourist ""traps"" for a reason — they're all about making big money. Many hungry people have overpaid for an unimpressive meal fancily arranged on a plate in places like South Beach Miami; Times Square in New York City; or almost anywhere in Los Angeles. When eating in Las Vegas it can also be a gamble.

However Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen restaurant which is located in Caesars Palace in Sin City is actually somewhat reasonable in terms of the quality of food. As of the time of this writing its nearly 9000 Yelp reviews have left it with a 4.4-star rating which isn't too shabby either. So if you're planning a trip to Las Vegas and want to know if dining at Hell's Kitchen will break your bank and your soul here's how much it costs to eat there.

How much does it cost to eat at Hell's Kitchen?

We're going to focus on the dinner menu as that's a classic dining time for Hell's Kitchen. A popular way to go if you're someone who has trouble making decisions is a prix fixe menu. Let them choose for you! We don't have to live a life of confusion. The three-course fixed menu costs $89.95 per person and is bumped up to $148.95 per person if you pair it with wine. We always say yes to wine. With dishes like pan seared scallops golden beet salad beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding you will not leave hungry.

Thinking you might go rogue with their regular dinner menu? Great we love food confidence. The cheapest option that isn't a side is the pumpkin soup which will cost you $16.95. Over on the higher end you're looking at $79.95 for the mishima reserve wagyu ribeye. In between those two things lives a wide range of meals in the 20- and 30-dollar ranges with the non-prix fixe beef Wellington coming in hot at $69.95 (nice). We also love an entire meal of sides which all cost $14.95 each.

What's to drink at Hell's Kitchen in Las Vegas?

Obviously we know people will be drinking in Vegas and Hell's Kitchen is certainly accommodating when it comes to their alcohol menu. If you're feeling celebratory or just plain sassy then a bottle of wine is the way to go. For the ""money is no object"" crowd we're placing our bets on the 2014 Hundred Acre Ark Vineyard cabernet sauvignon which is a jaw-dropping $1050.95. Not into spending your rent on a bottle of wine? How about 2017's Marsanne Tahbilk for which you will spend $65.95.

For the less committed there is the old fashioned way of drinking by the glass. In fact feel free to order an old-fashioned even though it's not listed on the menu. You can however grab an array of cocktails featuring bourbon mezcal gin and vodka for under $22 each. A glass of wine won't cost you more than $40 and if that's too much just order a beer. Hell's Kitchen even serves Coors Lite for $10.95. Gosh how much is a Coors heavy?

Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen also offers a vegan/vegetarian menu.

Despite the British chef's proclivity for beefing with vegans on social media his restaurant does offer dining options for those who adhere to vegetarian and vegan diets including dessert. Vegan/artichoke risotto pan seared tofu scallops quinoa salad and a host of other options are ready to be consumed. It's not as fully formed as the other menus the restaurant offers but there are a bunch of different dishes to choose from that all cost significantly less than the other options."

To identify new food trends…

… the company uses a process called “Insights Engine” which uses AI to review 300B menus studies and other data points per year.

Campbell’s employees use the data to understand where a trend is going whether it will last and if one of its brands is in position to capitalize on it. Recent innovations include:

The Deal

Quick Thoughts

According to Capital One PRIOR is “a luxury travel company made up of a team of tastemakers and experts that specializes in imaginative and unique travel itineraries one-off experiences and original editorial content”. I get the sense that PRIOR offers high-end guided tours. For context the first 3 trips being offered are 3 nights each in places like Savannah (starting at $1695 per person based on double occupancy) and Napa Valley (starting at $2495 per person based on double occupancy). Those prices including lodging and activities but not airfare. If that’s your thing the subscription here gets you access to global travel guides and early booking to their trips as well as a newsletter.

Capital One also notes that ” Venture X customers will have the opportunity to book once-in-a-lifetime trips across the globe by purchasing or redeeming points on Capital One Entertainment.” I find that potentially intriguing because we’ve seen Capital One occasionally offer experiences through Capital One Entertainment at very good value.

I haven’t yet checked out PRIOR’s travel guides and I’m not personally into luxury guided trips so I don’t find this addition particularly appealing.

Optum Rx to Cover Adalimumab Biosimilars

UnitedHealth’s pharmacy benefit manager Optum Rx announced that it will add 3 adalimumab biosimilars to it formulary list when they launch on the US market in 2023 according to a report from Forbes.

Currently there are 7 FDA-approved adalimumab biosimilars referencing Humira and 3 more are under review. One is planned to launch in January 2023 and the rest are scheduled to launch in July 2023.

Within the report Forbes said that Humira costs $50000 per year per patient and that Optum Rx’s announcement could mean that thousands of patients could “be shifted” in 2023 to a cheaper biosimilar alternative saving “Optum Rx clients and the US healthcare system potentially billion of dollars a year.”

The PBM will still have the reference product on its formulary but will be covered at parity to the biosimilars. Optum Rx disclosed their announcement during the HLTH 2022 conference in Las Vegas Nevada.

China Approves World’s First Denosumab Biosimilar

According to a report from Big Molecule Watch China’s National Medical Products Administration approved a Boyobei making China the first country to approve a denosumab biosimilar referencing Prolia/Xgeva. The product was developed by Luye Pharma Group and it will be used in the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at a high risk of fractures.

Luye Pharma Group developed Boyobei in conjunction with Boan Biotech its subsidiary. Denosumab products are fully-human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibodies that binds to RANKL reducing resportive bone long increasing bone strength and reducing fractures as a result.

Luye Pharma Group plans to seek approval for Boyobei in the European Union and the United States along with other global markets.

Organon Launches 2 Biosimilars in Canada

Organon’s Canadian division Organon Canada announced the launches of 2 oncology biosimilars on the Canadian market: a bevacizumab (Aybintio) and a trastuzumab (Ontruzant).

Aybintio references Avastin and will be used to treat patients with a variety of cancers including colorectal cancer; non-small cell lung cancer; ovarian fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer; and malignant glioma glioblastoma. Ontruzant references Herceptin and will be used in the treatment of early breast cancer metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer.

“Particularly during Global Biosimilars Week we recognize that many patients across Canada require more affordable treatment options” said Michael Casia president and managing director of Organon Canada in a statement on the launch of Ontruzant.

The news comes shortly after Saskatchewan announced that it will become the sixth Canadian province to implement a biosimilars switching policy. Additionally Viatris and Biocon Biologics launched their bevacizumab biosimilar Abevmy in Canada in May 2022. Aybintio was also approved in the European Union in August 2020.

“The impact of COVID-19 continues to put pressure and strain on our healthcare system across Canada. The adoption of biosimilars that are available at a reduced cost such as Aybintio® can help alleviate these burdens” Casia commented in a statement on the launch of Aybintio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvY291cnRuZXktbGlwdG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4MTU2OTM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Courtney Lipton Obituary (1978 - 2022),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/courtney-lipton-obituary?id=38156938 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvY291cnRuZXktbGlwdG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4MTU2OTM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

And it’s all thanks to pop megastar Drake. The strange saga of Luna Luna was told in a new story by the New York Times Thursday.

Luna Luna was created by the Viennese artist André Heller in the late 1980s. Through strokes of good luck Heller was able to convince the major working artists of his day to make functional amusement park rides: Haring made a merry-go-round Basquiat a ferris wheel and Roy Lichtenstein made a labyrinth complete with music by Philip Glass. Logistical and financial issues led Luna Luna down a dark path that ended with Heller selling off the works which eventually languished in storage for decades.

In 2019 creative director Michael Goldberg stumbled upon a blog post about the old carnival. He then brought in DreamCrew Drake’s business and management team who brought in Live Nation which organizes music festivals and partners in the art world like the Tate Modern MOCA the Kitchen and the Shed. The idea was to not only take the works out of storage and restore them but to make Luna Luna a traveling attraction complete with new amusement rides commissioned by today’s working artists. Drake has thus far invested nearly $100 million into the project.

It will fall to curator Kathy Noble to commission these pieces as the newly appointed curatorial director of Luna Luna. Noble was brought on as the performance non-profit Performa’s curator and manager of curatorial affairs in 2018. It is unclear if she will continue on in that role.

In a somewhat tragic turn André Heller will no longer be involved with Luna Luna after it was revealed earlier this month that he had taken some sketches that Basquiat had made for Luna Luna and then created a new art work out of it that he framed in a Basquiat style. Heller attributed the piece and the frame to Basquiat and attempted to sell it at TEFAF for $3 million. While it didn’t sell at the fair it was eventually bought by a collector for $800000. Heller claimed that the whole thing was a “childish prank” but he could face serious consequences on the grounds of art forgery. As a result the Luna Luna team felt it would no longer be appropriate for Heller to be involved in the project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlcmFkaW8ubmV0L2Nhcm5pdmFscy1mYXN0ZXItdG8tdGhlLWZ1bi1wcmlvcml0eS1lbWJhcmthdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Faster to the Fun is Returning to Carnival Cruise Line,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='cruiseradio.net', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /carnivals-faster-to-the-fun-priority-embarkation/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E611543F70>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlcmFkaW8ubmV0L2Nhcm5pdmFscy1mYXN0ZXItdG8tdGhlLWZ1bi1wcmlvcml0eS1lbWJhcmthdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vZHJha2UtbHVuYS1sdW5hLWFydC1hbXVzZW1lbnQtcGFyay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Drake Rescued the Long-Lost Art Carnival Luna Luna,"LOS ANGELES — Earlier this year in a 50000-square-foot warehouse lined with weathered shipping containers and crates the Viennese artist André Heller was reunited with one of the great loves of his life and career.

The psychedelic works inside unseen by Heller or the world for 35 years had long been lost to history despite their flashy provenance. Together they made up Luna Luna — a functional amusement park where the rides and attractions also happened to be contemporary art from the likes of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Salvador Dalí which Heller had conceptualized and opened briefly in Hamburg Germany in 1987.

For decades he had obsessed over its loss. “Forget about it” he told himself repeatedly. “This is like a love affair where you can’t stop having erotic dreams.”

Eventually Heller managed to move on. “And then” he said via video chat from Austria “when everything was out of my mind I met some people that started reminding me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFub3RoZXJtYWcuY29tL2FydC1waG90b2dyYXBoeS8xNDUyNi9sZWFoLWdvcmRvbi1rYW5hdmFsLWhhaXRpLWV4aGliaXRpb24taW50ZXJ2aWV3LW1vY2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leah Gordon's Kaleidoscopic Portrait of Carnival in Haiti,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.anothermag.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /art-photography/14526/leah-gordon-kanaval-haiti-exhibition-interview-moca (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E611543E20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFub3RoZXJtYWcuY29tL2FydC1waG90b2dyYXBoeS8xNDUyNi9sZWFoLWdvcmRvbi1rYW5hdmFsLWhhaXRpLWV4aGliaXRpb24taW50ZXJ2aWV3LW1vY2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Since United resumed plated meal service in domestic first class in June 2021 the catering program has been marked by a lack of selection and in some cases poor taste.

In fact for lunch and dinner service United has only had three major menu rotations since then — most recently a choice between za'atar chicken and a vegetarian selection Impossible meatballs.

Now a top United executive is acknowledging the catering issues and promising improvements.

""I know you probably love the za'atar chicken and the Impossible meatballs"" chief customer officer Linda Jojo said sarcastically. ""Sorry to say they're probably not gonna be around much longer.""

Jojo speaking at the Skift Aviation Forum in Dallas on Wednesday said that the lack of variety comes down to a slew of pandemic-related challenges.

""What I would say is that we definitely got slowed down first by the pandemic itself and now by the supply chain challenges that have been there"" she said. Adding to the complexity is the fact that United contracts with 130 different catering kitchens across its global network.

The Chicago-based carrier now offers customers the option to pre-order their meals on certain flights — with five choices — and uses data to drive its catering decisions said Jojo who was previously United's chief digital officer.

""We will be feeding that data through our analytics engines and we now know what customers want and will have a better chance of putting that on the plane"" she said.

Jojo also teased some new enhancements to United's domestic meal service and following Jojo's comments a United spokesperson shared more.

Starting this week domestic first class will have six new scheduled entrees including two for breakfast and four for lunch and dinner. To create more variety the lunch and dinner entrees will be catered directionally: two for eastbound flights and two for westbound flights.

Also starting Dec. 1 the airline promises ""six new signature entrees"" in its pre-order system. Additionally that day the airline will bring back its signature ice cream sundae cart in Polaris business class on four routes from San Francisco International Airport (SFO): Frankfurt Airport (FRA) Brisbane Airport (BNE) Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) and Sydney Airport (SYD). That news was first reported by Live and Let's Fly and confirmed by a carrier spokesperson.

Details about the entrees aren't yet available.

Don't expect free Wi-Fi on United

This year United began offering flat $8 Wi-Fi pricing on board all of its domestic flights for MileagePlus members.

But don't expect it to become free Jojo said.

The airline is focused on the reliability of its network — and wants to ensure that the wireless access points aboard its aircraft are not overused not to mention the satellite bandwidth.

""A small price creates a little bit of friction that we think is a way to help people that really need it — are gonna be able to have it and use it"" she said.

In fact there wasn't a huge increase in Wi-Fi use when United introduced the cheaper pricing Jojo said ""which I thought was interesting.""

United continues to dynamically price Wi-Fi on its long-haul international flights. United credit cardholders receive a 25% statement credit when purchasing Wi-Fi aboard a United flight.

More: Delta debuts free Wi-Fi for all SkyMiles members in latest internet trial

Jojo's comments come as Delta Air Lines inches closer to free Wi-Fi on its flights. The carrier is testing free Wi-Fi for all SkyMiles members on select aircraft. Meanwhile JetBlue has long provided free Wi-Fi on all of its flights.

Farewell to United's alcohol wipes?

One of the last vestiges of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic can be found when boarding a United or United Express flight.

At the boarding door a flight attendant still hands out individually wrapped alcohol wipes — a throwback to when every airline was heavily pushing the cleanliness of its aircraft.

Sanitizing wipes will remain available on board aircraft for those who want them Jojo said. However the airline might transition to handing out something else.

""Our flight attendants greet every single customer now and sometimes it's the hand wipes sometimes it's just to say hello and we may not have a wipe forever"" she said. ""There may be something a little more fun coming at some point but I don't think we'll ever take away that touchpoint at the end of the jet bridge.""

Regardless of what new form that touchpoint takes it would be yet another sign of United moving past the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMTExNzAwNTYxMC9lbi9DT1JSRUNUSU5HLWFuZC1SRVBMQUNJTkctRGlnaXRhbC1WaXJnby1hLUxlYWRpbmctR2xvYmFsLU1vYmlsZS1FbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWFuZC1Db21tZXJjZS1OZXR3b3JrLVBhcnRuZXJlZC1XaXRoLXRoZS1Xb3JsZCVFMiU4MCU5OXMtTGFyZ2VzdC1UZWxjby1Db21wYW5pZXMtV2lsbC1Hby1QdWJsaWMtdmlhLUJ1c2luZXNzLUNvbWJpbmF0aW9uLVdpdGgtR29hbC1BY3F1aXNpdGlvbnMtQ29ycC7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CORRECTING and REPLACING Digital Virgo a Leading Global Mobile Entertainment and Commerce Network ...,"LYON France & AUSTIN Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Please replace the release with the following corrected version due to revisions in the first bullet of the subhead in the fourth paragraph of the release and in the ""Advisors"" section.

Guillaume Briche Digital Virgo Chief Executive Officer said of the transaction “After years of steady growth and profitability now is the time for us to go public and pursue more rapid growth by satisfying customer demand for a one destination platform that fulfills their content commerce and financial needs. It’s also the right moment to bring our offerings to the U.S. market. We’ve resisted previous pushes to go public but in Goal Acquisitions Corp. we found exactly the right partner. Their team not only has the experience in building businesses and advising companies but also has the global relationships in sports media games and other areas that will allow us to develop new partnerships leading to more rapid customer acquisition and premier content creation to enhance the platform and grow revenue and profitability.”

Goal Acquisitions Founder and Advisor Alex Greystoke remarked “When we launched our SPAC we set out to find a high-quality company led by a first-rate management team operating in the convergence of sports media games and technology. Guillaume and the Digital Virgo team certainly meet those criteria and more. They’ve built an amazing company which is already a global leader. This deal provides important capital for them to grow and execute but it also brings our team’s experience and network of global relationships in sports media entertainment and other sectors that will be essential in reaching more customers and expanding the business. We have aligned our interests with them by our sponsor agreeing to forfeit a portion of its shares and receiving a grant of earnout shares which are subject to the post-combination company meeting certain share price targets. We’re excited to work with them in creating the one destination platform and building something really remarkable.”

[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]

Silk Way West Airlines shows no sign of slowing down its impressive record of growth having secured a deal to offer even more cargo capacity in the future. The Azerbaijani cargo carrier signed an order with Boeing for two state-of-the-art 777-8 Freighters with options for two additional aircraft the two companies announced today at the agreement signing ceremony in Everett Washington. Per the agreement aircraft deliveries are planned for 2029 and 2030.

Silk Way West Airlines is the first customer in the whole Central Asia region to order the industry’s newest most capable and fuel-efficient twin-engine freighter. The aircraft can carry over 118 tons of structural payload with a range of over 9200 km. With its advanced technology new GE9X engines and composite wing design the 777-8 offers 30 per cent greater fuel efficiency and emission levels as well as 25 per cent lower operating costs per ton. As a result the new aircraft will also make an important contribution to the airline’s sustainability goals.

This investment will not only enable Silk Way West Airlines which serves 40 destinations around the world to further expand its international network and meet growing demand for cargo transport but will also strengthen Baku as a key international cargo hub. The Azerbaijani capital has become increasingly important for the Middle Corridor linking Europe and the Western Hemisphere to Asia through the Caspian region.

Back in April 2021 the cargo airline signed a purchase agreement for five Boeing 777s setting the course for further fleet growth. Now the new 777-8 aircraft complement SWWA’s fleet development plans by enabling the necessary operational commonality enhancing a long-term strategy of sustainable growth as well as allowing the Azerbaijani carrier to continuously improve service to its customers.

Trying to time when to invest in these heavy cyclical companies is almost more of an art than a science.

The global leader in this field is Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) with operations in over 50 countries around the world. The name was derived in 1904 when Benjamin Holt replaced the rear wheels from a Holt steam tractor with a pair of tracks to help farmers deal with soft soil. During a field test in 1905 the company photographer exclaimed that the machine crawled like a big caterpillar.





Caterpillar is expected to generate over $58 billion in revenues in 2022 and currently has a market capitalization of approximately $119 billion. It's still going strong for now but as a recession begins to unfold and construction begins to fall off Caterpillar shareholders could be in for trouble as their shares are trading near all-time highs at the moment.

Caterpillar Is Likely Near Peak Earnings

About the company

Caterpillar operates through four segments: Construction Resource Energy and Transportation and Financial Products. The Construction segment makes a wide variety of construction equipment such as asphalt pavers excavators cold planers etc. The Resource segment provides electric rope and hydraulic shovels draglines rotary drills hard rock vehicles wheel dozers and other machines used primarily for mining and heavy construction. The Energy and Transportation segment manufacturers engines and integrated systems for power generation purposes in a wide variety of industries and applications. Lastly the companys Financial Products segment provides financial support for customers to buy its products through operating and finance leases installment sale contracts working capital loans and wholesale financing as well as insurance and risk management products.

Recent earnings

The company recently reported third quarter results for 2022 and it appears the company is firing on all cylinders. The Construction segment saw sales increase 19% and operating profits rise 40% the Resource segment boosted revenues by 30% with segment profits increasing 81% and the Energy and Transporation segment increased revenue by 22% and segment operating profits by 32%. The familiar theme in these strong increases was favorable price realization meaning the company is raising prices on all their customers which is also a familiar theme in most industries today.

The operating margin was 16.2% for the quarter compared with 13.4% for the prior-year period. Adjusted profit per share was $3.95 compared with third-quarter 2021 adjusted profit per share of $2.66.

Story continues

Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby stated Our team remains focused on serving our customers as we continued to see healthy demand across most of our end markets during the third quarter.

The company has a complicated balance sheet because it finances a large portion of its equipment sales. The company has $22.7 billion in financing liabilities which makes it a fairly decent-sized bank. That line item is offset by financing receivables of $20.7 billion. Traditional debt stands at $13.7 billion against cash of $6.3 billion.

During good times the company generates strong free cash flowsand for the first nine months of 2022 operating cash flow was $5.0 billion and capital expenditures were $868 million. The company repurchased shares during this period totaling $3.3 billion. Yet investors should question this buyback strategy as the stock has been trading near all-time highs throughout much of the year.

Valuation

The 30-year earnings history of Caterpillar is choppy as it often struggles through recessions. In 2009 revenues dropped 37% and earnings per share dropped 75% from the prior year.

Nonetheless consensus earnings per share estimates are $13.89 for this year and $15.00 for next year which seems odd in my view with high chances of a recession occurring in 2023. That puts the company trading at 16 times this year's forward earnings and 15 times 2023 earnings.

The GuruFocus discounted cash flow (DCF) calculator gives us a value estimate of $175 or 31% below today's prices using next year's earnings per share estimate of $15.00 and a long-term global GDP growth rate of 4.0% to sub in for long-term company growth as Caterpillar is too cyclical to value it accurately in the near-term. During major recessions companies in this industry can suffer major earnings and share price declines.

The company pays an annualized dividend of $4.80 which equates to a 2.08% dividend yield. The payout ratio is below 50% based on current earnings per share estimates for this year and next.

Guru trades

Gurus who have purchased Caterpillar stock recently include Murray Stahl (Trades Portfolio) and Mairs and Power (Trades Portfolio). Gurus who have reduced or sold out of their positions include Mario Gabelli (Trades Portfolio) and Diamond Hill Capital (Trades Portfolio).

Summary

Caterpillar is highly levered to both macroeconomic issues and commodity prices such as steel and oil. With an inverted yield curve and mass layoffs occurring at major corporations the odds of a recession next year are fairly high. With its stock trading near all-time highs it is likely not a good time invest in Caterpillar stock in my view. Typically the best time to invest in cyclical stocks like this has been in the middle of an recession after revenues and profits have materially declined leading to a plummetting share price and were not at that point yet.

These products known as ""Oxclaw' and ""Bullox"" are a textured screen plate and a modular screen plate system respectively.

Provided by CAT



With this agreement in place both of the innovative products will now only be available to CAT asphalt paving customers.

As a radical departure from the industry norms Oxclaw's revolutionary three-dimensionally textured screed ensures lateral compaction and confinement to the asphalt material being laid. The result is an improved mat density and smoothness as well as density at the joint. This means a reduction in compaction expense and possible overall cost savings.

The screed's cast plates are forged with high strength chromium carbide which provides it with a much higher level of wear resistance and a longer working life in the field.

The Bullox system refers to an all-new way to secure the plates themselves to the screed. It can reduce the screed plate change time up to 80% from days long to less than four hours potentially. Again a major cost savings when it comes to machine down-time.

This gas pipeline contract for Union Gas Ltd involved a 400-foot crossing of the Thames River using concrete-encased pipe.

The Allis Chalmers HD 19 side-boom and the Caterpillar D7 (Model 572 pipe layer) seen in the background were only part of the equipment required to wrestle this heavy pipeline section into place.

Based in Chatham Ontario Union Gas Ltd had begun operations in 1911 about 20 years after the first natural gas well came into production in Essex County.

Interestingly one of the first known gas pipelines to be built in North America moved natural gas from Petrolia to Sarnia Ontario as early as 1862.

The Allis Chalmers HD 19 crawler was powered by a 6-71 GM 2-stroke diesel rated at 118 kW (160 hp) while the Caterpillar D7 was powered by a four-stoke diesel rated similarly.

Side-boom attachment manufacturers included Trackson Co (later Caterpillar) Superior Manufacturing Ltd. and Midwestern Manufacturing among others in the era.

HCEA Canada is very fortunate to have in our collection a 1960s Caterpillar 572 Pipe Layer on static display at the Simcoe County Museum.

With a counterweight of 6 tonnes it could lift 40 tonnes handily.

McNally Construction based in Hamilton Ontario has donated several units to our antique equipment collection including this machine. Thanks go to Patrick McNally for his foresight and commitment.

Watch for details of HCEA Canada’s Wheels & Tracks Event coming in June 2023. Please see updates on our web site: www.hceacanada.org

To see more than 60 restored pieces of vintage construction equipment in action be sure to attend the Historical Construction Equipment Association (HCEA Canada) events: ‘Wheels & Tracks in Motion’ County Museum near Barrie held in June and the ‘Last Blast’ in October.

These creatures are so rare that we often wonder how much more beauty nature holds. One such video of a caterpillar with a head similar to that of a dragon has gone viral on Twitter.

Oruga cabeza de dragón 🐛 pic.twitter.com/qZ0W74Jius— Insectos y Bichos (@bichostw) March 30 2022

The video is captioned “Dragon head caterpillar” and the 8-second footage shows the beautiful insect wiggling on a rock. The head of this caterpillar is indeed like that of a dragon with alluring horn-like protrusions on its head. The caterpillar can be seen moving on a rock and has two white strips on an otherwise green body.

According to Fact Animal there are about 400 variations of the dragon-headed caterpillars and they are mostly found in North and South America Asia and Australia. They can grow up to 3 centimetres and other than the way they look there is no difference between them and other caterpillars. They grow and hatch into a butterfly with bright coloured wings. Some of the variations of the caterpillars have venomous stings to keep their predators away.

Dragon-headed caterpillars also like to eat their eggs after the larva has hatched. The nutrients they need to grow are present in the eggs they hatch from. They then move on to have leaves like any other caterpillar.

The video has gathered over 44 lakh views on the microblogging platform. It even has 840 likes and continues to grow in numbers on the social media platform. People in the comments were in awe of the beauty of this caterpillar.

Contracted service expansions from Centene combined with identified cost synergies are expected to increase run-rate Adjusted EBITDA to $85 million and be fully realized by the fourth quarter of 2024. Consideration for the acquisition includes $650 million at close plus additional contingent consideration of up to $150 million based on 2023 performance. The upfront consideration will be funded in part by $250 million in Evolent equity issued to the sellers at a price of $29.50 a 24% premium to the prior day's closing price subject to lock-up provisions. Upon close the NIA team and platform will be fully integrated into Evolent's value-based specialty care business which includes New Century Health Vital Decisions and IPG.

In addition to the NIA acquisition Evolent and Centene are expanding Centene's relationship with NIA and extending NIA's contracts with Centene through 2027. We believe these expansions will generate at least $20 million of Adjusted EBITDA by the fourth quarter of 2024.

Seth Blackley Chief Executive Officer of Evolent stated ""Today's announcement represents another step forward in Evolent's journey to become a national leader in value-based specialty care and we believe it will also improve our financial profile customer diversification and scale. I am also excited to significantly expand our strategic partnership with Centene and I look forward to the opportunity to further grow our relationship in the time ahead.""

Mr. Blackley continued ""These transactions should elevate our visibility with payers and create a more comprehensive specialty solution that should position us as the go-to value-based specialty partner for any health plan in the country. After the closing of the transaction we believe we will have a $50 billion cross-sell opportunity inside our existing customer footprint up from $16 billion today. Finally this acquisition brings complementary assets to a core Evolent business that is performing well including strong revenue and margin growth heading into 2023. We believe this announcement aligns with our core operating priorities of revenue growth margin expansion and disciplined capital allocation all for the benefit of our shareholders.""

John Johnson Chief Financial Officer of Evolent stated ""We believe the NIA acquisition is financially attractive and is expected to immediately enhance our Adjusted EBITDA margin and cash flow profile. Further with highly visible free cash flow generation in 2023 and beyond the transaction maintains our strong balance sheet from day one while enabling us to quickly de-lever in the next 18 months.""

Dan McCarthy President of Evolent added ""With the successful integration of past specialty acquisitions and the accelerating growth in our existing business we believe we can integrate the NIA asset into our platform and add new revenue and Adjusted EBITDA with the benefit of the NIA solutions team and customer base. Our experience in the value-based specialty market informs us that many current and prospective payer partners are looking for more breadth and integration across specialties and I believe this acquisition sets us up to meet that need.""

Sarah London Chief Executive Officer of Centene commented ""Magellan Specialty Health has been a trusted partner of Centene and its health plans for more than a decade. By combining Magellan Specialty Health with Evolent which is also a trusted strategic partner Centene will have access to a broad and integrated portfolio of value-based specialty solutions across more of Centene's geographies and lines of business.""

The government insurer said in an announcement that it expects to bank $750 million in the aggregate from the deal. Centene added Magellan Specialty Health a leading specialty benefit management company as part of its acquisition of Magellen Health which closed in January.

Magellan Specialty Health provides utilization management tools to insurers including for radiology musculoskeletal physical medicine and genetic testing. When the transaction closes Centene and Evolent will enter a multiyear partnership that enables the insurer to extend and build on its work with Magellan Specialty.

""This transaction is another significant milestone in our ongoing portfolio review and value creation plan"" said Sarah London CEO of Centene in the release.

""Magellan Specialty Health has been a trusted partner of Centene and its health plans for more than a decade"" London added. ""By combining Magellan Specialty Health with Evolent who is also a trusted partner Centene will have access to a broad and integrated portfolio of value-based specialty solutions across Centene's geographies and lines of business.""

Centene said it expects to receive $600 million in proceeds from the sale at closing including at least $400 million in cash and the remainder in Evolent stock. The insurer said it will bring in an additional $150 million in 2024 should specific performance metrics be reached.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and the company expects it will close in the first half of 2023. Centene said it plans to use the majority of the proceeds to repurchase stock and the balance will be put toward debt.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGNhcmVmaW5hbmNlbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jZW50ZW5lLXNlbGwtbWFnZWxsYW4tc3BlY2lhbHR5LWhlYWx0aC1ldm9sZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Centene to sell Magellan Specialty Health to Evolent,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.healthcarefinancenews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/centene-sell-magellan-specialty-health-evolent (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60EC707F0>, 'Connection to www.healthcarefinancenews.com timed out.

Katie Hobbs won a razor-thin victory last Tuesday over Lake a full-throated endorser of the Big Lie — although the former television anchor is refusing to concede.

The Republican Governors Association a political committee that combines corporate cash with dark money from politically oriented nonprofits that do not disclose their contributors spent at least $11 million on Lake’s campaign. The RGA is chaired by current Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey who backed her opponent in the primary. He told CNN in July “Kari Lake is misleading voters [about the 2020 election] with no evidence.”

After the Jan. 6 2021 insurrection many corporations paused their political giving to congressmembers who objected to the certification of the presidential election for Joe Biden. Most resumed their donations to those who voted to overturn the election. Microsoft is one of the companies that kept its finger on the pause button. The software giant also invested in a pro-democracy initiative called Democracy Forward which supports election security and local journalism in the U.S. and abroad.



Tech giant Google General Motors Aflac Wells Fargo Blue Cross Blue Shield FedEx and Walgreens all gave $100000 or more to the Republican Governors Association.



However on Aug. 18 a little more than two weeks after Lake became the nominee for governor Microsoft donated $150000 to the RGA. The software giant was not alone in donating to a committee that would go on to support election denying gubernatorial nominees across the country including Lake. Nor was Microsoft the RGA’s biggest corporate contributor.

In 2022 Missouri-based Centene Management Company donated $1.5 million to the RGA. Koch Industries the Kansas-based conglomerate donated $1.25 million. Philadelphia-based Comcast Financial Agency Corporation AT&T Pfizer and Nike co-founder Phil Knight all donated $250000 or more to the RGA. Tech giant Google General Motors Aflac Wells Fargo Blue Cross Blue Shield FedEx and Walgreens all gave $100000 or more to the RGA.

Capital & Main reached out to the companies for comment. Only Blue Cross Blue Shield responded by email before publication. “Our commitment is to improve the quality access and affordability of health care for every American and we support organizations to help meet that goal” the statement read. “While we do not agree on every issue or policy position nor do we direct where our support goes within those organizations we will continue to support policymakers in both political parties who will work with us to build a more affordable and equitable health care system for the nearly 115 million Blue Cross and Blue Shield members.”

The RGA has also received millions of dollars from Republican megadonors like Robert Bigelow Miriam Adelson Richard Uihlein as well as from the Concord Fund a dark money group connected to Leonard Leo who is credited with reshaping the U.S. Supreme Court.

The RGA funneled much of its spending on Lake’s campaign through the Yuma County Republican Central Committee Axios reported. The political organization’s coordinated campaign with Lake reserved airtime between Sept. 28 and Nov. 8. One of those ads featured a homophobic far right pastor named Justin Erickson. In the spot Erickson portrays himself as a small businessman dealing with inflation which he blames on liberal Democrats. Erickson’s views may rub some of RGA’s donors (and some Arizonans) the wrong way.



“Despite that spend Kari Lake still underperformed and underperformed most profoundly with Independents who are just done with crazy rhetoric.”

~ Stacy Pearson political strategist



In a 2014 sermon on homosexuality Erickson falsely said that “50 percent of the homosexual LGBT-Now-Q community 50 percent have AIDS. One in twenty are child molesters on the sex offender registry” Mother Jones reported. In a 2016 sermon he called Islam “satanic” and Erickson has argued that women should play a subservient role to men.

Evan Vorpahl is senior researcher for True North Research a nonprofit research firm that tracks the role of money in politics and assisted Capital & Main with the analysis of the campaign filings. In his view the corporations and right-wing donors are attacking “our democracy and freedoms.” He wrote in an email that “they should be held accountable for the extremism their dollars helped RGA buy.”

It’s not clear that the spending made the difference in an election where voters rejected extremism in close races according to Arizona-based political strategist Stacy Pearson.

“Despite that spend Kari Lake still underperformed and underperformed most profoundly with Independents who are just done with crazy rhetoric. They took their tinfoil hats off” Pearson said. Hobbs’ margin in Arizona though narrow was more than 60% larger than Biden’s in 2020.

If corporate cash and dark money could not “outspend Kari Lake’s crazy” as Pearson argues it could make more of a difference in low profile down ballot races like that of the state attorney general. Abe Hamadeh a former Army Reserve intelligence officer is a less flamboyant election denier than Lake or Mark Finchem the failed cowboy hat-wearing candidate for Arizona secretary of state who embraces QAnon conspiracy theories. Hamadeh is in a dead heat with is Democratic rival Kris Mayes who currently leads by a handful of votes. The attorney general’s office oversees the enforcement of the state’s election laws and is in charge of prosecuting election fraud in the state.

If Hamadeh wins he will have General Motors Comcast Pfizer Blue Cross Blue Shield and a long list of other corporate donors to thank — as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They all donated to the Republican Attorneys General Association another campaign committee that accepts unlimited corporate cash. RAGA contributed about $2.8 million to support Hamadeh’s candidacy according to OpenSecrets a nonprofit that tracks money in politics. “Those down ballot races — the more money you put in them the more attention that you’re going to get especially with attorney general secretary of state.” said Doug Wilson a Democratic campaign strategist based in North Carolina.

We explore the complexity created by new and expanding foreign investment regimes and the EUs foreign subsidy review tool. We also look ahead to what dealmakers should watch out for in 2024.

Summary Regulators have focused their attention on mergers in the digital/tech and private equity M&A pharmaceuticals industries while also scrutinizing below-threshold private equity acquisitions sciences transport energy and consumer deals. In technology which accounted for 20% of deals blocked in 2023 authorities are looking at the impact on ecosystems innovation and potential competition. Transactions resulting in data concentration as well as those involving AI are also in the spotlight while the EU’s Digital Markets Act and forthcoming U.K. equivalent will require designated digital firms to submit information about all deals involving digital services or that enable the collection of data deals falling below standard filing thresholds.

As countries work to meet their green transition targets we expect sustainability and environmental arguments to feature more heavily in merger control reviews potentially overriding competition outweighing antitrust concerns. But some antitrust authorities (e.g. in the U.S.) remain sceptical of ESG considerations. A patchwork of approaches is emerging.

HOPE of Evansville on Friday became the official owner of an empty building at 900 N. Main St. and will move its office there in 2023.

The sale was for $125000. Burger King occupied the property most recently; it had been available for 5.5 years.

""Two thousand and thirty-three days"" said listing agent Mark Miller of ERA First Advantage Realty Commercial. ""It was time for it to come off (the market).""

HOPE of Evansville's current office is a former dentist office space on Southeast Fourth Street. Most of the agency's housing work thus far has focused on neighborhoods south of Lloyd Expressway -- Goosetown Tepe Park and Culver. HOPE has 100 rental units in those areas.

The agency has dabbled in Jacobsville remodeling and selling a home on East Tennessee Street and pursuing two other projects on Missouri and Delaware streets. HOPE wants to do more in the neighborhood Executive Director Josh Calhoun said.

Local news:A little family diner on North Main Street is so busy that it's outgrowing its space

The agency hosts financial literacy classes and the new office is situated on a METS bus line. HOPE had five employees when COVID hit in spring 2000 but it has since grown to nine.

""We are running our of space and it was time to purchase a new office"" Calhoun said. ""We make other people homeowners but HOPE of Evansville didn’t have a home. It only made sense to have an office and we wanted to be in Jacobsville.”

HOPE plans to remodel the old Burger King's interior landscape the property and upgrade its façade. Calhoun said HOPE will donate kitchen equipment in the property that Burger King left behind.

Evansville officials have prioritized redeveloping the North Main Street corridor for years starting with a street reconstruction project and bicycle path followed by the Forge on Main affordable housing complex and Deaconess Aquatic Center project.

Mayor Lloyd Winnecke announced recently that a grocery store DG Market will move into the ground level of Forge on Main. Newer restaurants such as Waylon's Diner have joined traditional ones such as Turoni's on the corridor.

HOPE of Evansville will be another new addition. Calhoun who worked for the Evansville Department of Metropolitan Development and CenterPoint Energy before joining HOPE of Evansville said he wants to have the move completed in the first half of 2023.

""My aggressive timeline is a four-month turnaround"" he said."

To skip our analysis of the recent market trends you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World.

The Fertilizer Industry: An Analysis

The growing global population climate change and water scarcity problems have joined forces to put a strain on the production of agricultural products globally. With a growing demand the need to generate higher crop yields from the existing arable land is rising. This is where fertilizer companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (NYSE:ADM) CF Industries Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CF) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) enter the picture. For healthy growth plants require three main nutrients: Nitrogen Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK). Farmers use fertilizers to fill the soil deficiencies in these nutrients for healthy growth of their crops.

Before we delve into the recent market trends for the fertilizer industry we need to understand the basics of how fertilizers are made. Basic Nitrogen-based fertilizers such as urea urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) and ammonium nitrate require ammonia as a feedstock produced most commonly from natural gas and coal in some cases. On the other hand Phosphorus and Potassium based fertilizers require mineral deposits of these elements.

Fertilizer prices have risen significantly in the recent past and may remain elevated at least in the near-term. Urea prices surpassed their 2008 peaks while phosphates and potash prices are close to 2008 levels according to the World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook. The Russia-Ukraine conflict led to sanctions on Russia and Belarus the two leading producers of fertilizers. The crisis was further exacerbated with the reduction in ammonia production due to higher natural gas prices. In addition China the largest producer of Nitrogen and Phosphorus imposed export restrictions to cater to domestic demand.

We have picked the top 15 fertilizer companies based on their market capitalization that are involved in the production and delivery of fertilizers. These companies are some of the largest producers of fertilizers worldwide with products including nitrogen potash and phosphate-based commodity fertilizers as well as complex and specialty fertilizers.

Apart from the public companies included in this list there are several privately-owned or state-owned companies that hold a significant market share in the fertilizer industry. Belarus-based Belaruskali OAO is the world’s second largest producer of potash. Prior to the sanctions imposed on the country the company through state-owned Belarusian Potash Company exported more than 10 million tons of its products per annum to 140 countries globally. China Brazil and India were its major customers.

Story continues

Moscow-based UralChem is a privately-owned producer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. It is the second largest ammonium nitrate producer in the world with production capabilities of 2.7 million tons of ammonium nitrate 2.2 million tons of ammonia 0.8 million tons of MAP and DAP 0.8 million tons of complex fertilizers and 0.5 million tons of urea.

EuroChem is a privately-held vertically integrated fertilizer producer with mining assets in Russia Kazakhstan and Brazil production assets across four continents and a global sales and distribution network. The company ranks among the top five mineral fertilizers producers globally with 27 million tons of fertilizer produced in 2021.

It is a narrative that senior government officials including those from the United States and the European Union leaned into over the weekend at various agriculture-focused events at or on the sidelines of COP27 the annual United Nations climate negotiations held this year in Sharm el-Sheikh Egypt.

“We believe in the promise of improved production precision agriculture nutrient management and enhanced efficiency fertilizers” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said on Saturday at the COP27 session titled “Global Fertilizer Challenge: Announcing New Funding for Fertilizer Efficiency and Soil Health.”

Vilsack said the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be contributing $25 million to new fertilizer efficiency initiatives part of $109 million in new public funding from countries like the United States Norway and Germany to expand fertilizer access and improve fertilizer efficiency during a time of crisis in global fertilizer markets.

“We can increase productivity for small-scale farmers by using fertilizers in a smarter way” Norway’s Minister of International Development Anne Beathe Tvinnereim said on a panel during that session hosted by the U.S. Center at COP27.

This climate summit has seen significant attention paid to issues around food and agriculture. A whole day was dedicated to the topic it is included on the official agenda and the summit features several food-and-ag-focused pavilions. As U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry noted during an event on “Adaptation and Agriculture Day” on November 12 “The future of our food systems is deeply entwined in the climate challenge.” Not only is climate change threatening food security worldwide; more than one-third of global emissions come from food and farming.

Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers which are widely used in industrial agriculture are a notable source of such emissions. These fertilizers are produced from fossil fuel feedstocks and have a significant climate impact emitting greenhouse gasses at each stage of their life cycle. According to recent research synthetic nitrogen fertilizers account for about 2 percent of global GHG emissions; reducing their use “offers large mitigation potential” a peer-reviewed study published in August states.

“Are governments going to be promoting a vision that tinkers around the edges or one that is transformative?” – Shefali Sharma

But curtailing chemical fertilizer production and use was not on the agenda at COP27. Instead panels populated by industry reps and U.S. and EU government officials focused on promoting more efficient fertilizers.

“Improving the efficiency of fertilizer is an industry talking point” Ben Lilliston director of rural strategies and climate change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) told DeSmog. He said the push for more efficient fertilizers is partly based in fact given the glaring problem with fertilizer overuse and nitrogen leaching that pollutes the environment. But initiatives that focus on fertilizer efficiency without addressing the larger problems inherent in industrialized food production miss the bigger picture he explained. “From our perspective it’s not really addressing the core issue” Lilliston said. “They’re still operating within the same farming system.”

Lilliston and others say that what’s needed instead is agroecology — the practice of applying ecological concepts and principles to the sustainable management of agricultural systems — and a transition to sustainable food systems and that public and philanthropic support to prop up the fertilizer sector is misguided.

“Farmers are struggling yet the big fertiliser companies are making record profits. Governments need to stop using public funds to subsidise chemical fertilisers and support a shift towards agroecological farming practices that are better for farmers consumers and the planet” David Calleb Otieno of the Kenya Peasants League said in a statement.

“The real test is whether we’re creating a system change in agriculture’s climate footprint” said Shefali Sharma director of IATP’s European office. “Are governments going to be promoting a vision that tinkers around the edges or one that is transformative creating food systems that are resilient and restoring ecosystems?”

Michael Fakhri an independent UN expert or “Special Rapporteur” on the right to food noted in a report to the UN General Assembly in July that the environmental degradation wrought by chemical fertilizers violates the right to a healthy and sustainable environment. He said the fundamental issue is not disruption in the accessibility of fertilizers but rather “that so many farmers rely heavily on chemical fertilizers in the first place.” Lessening farmer dependency on these fertilizers must be the ultimate objective he says.

Yet instead of scaling back subsidies for industrial agriculture and chemical fertilizers or introducing measures to discourage corporate profiteering or to promote alternative farming systems the United States and other wealthy countries are doubling down on industry-driven narratives input-intensive industrial agriculture and promoting techno-fixes under the umbrella term “climate smart agriculture.”

Climate smart agriculture is among a series of buzzwords that GRAIN flags in an “agribusiness greenwashing glossary” explaining that the term emerged to counter support for agroecology. According to GRAIN “The world’s largest fertiliser companies propelled it into the mainstream with a massive lobby campaign and the creation of a global alliance of corporations governments and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and FAO.”

That influence continues to grow in the broader agriculture sector as evidenced by the slew of new partnerships and programs promoting the “climate-smart” concept. These include the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM4C) launched at COP26 last year and expanded this year and a Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities that USDA announced in February. These initiatives were on display during “Agriculture Day” at COP27 on Saturday with dedicated sessions highlighting milestones and new investments. One of those new investments announced by Vilsack is the establishment of a public-private research partnership called the Efficient Fertilizer Consortium. USDA is putting $5 million towards it while the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (which is coordinating the consortium) is seeking to raise matching funds.

The Efficient Fertilizer Consortium is part of the Global Fertilizer Challenge which was launched by U.S. President Joe Biden in June as an effort to address food insecurity and agricultural emissions through investments in fertilizer efficiency and alternative fertilizers and cropping systems. In addition to the $5 million to establish the consortium the United States is spending $20 million on an initiative called “Fertilize Right” to advance fertilizer efficiency worldwide starting in Pakistan Brazil Colombia and Vietnam. As of November 12 the Global Fertilizer Challenge which will be implemented in partnership with AIM4C has reached a total of $135 million in funding.

“I couldn’t be more thrilled by the Fertilizer Challenge that has been issued today” US AID Administrator Samantha Power said during the Global Fertilizer Challenge COP27 session. She referenced working with the International Fertilizer Association (IFA) and with fertilizer firms like Yara. These agribusiness interests have had a notable presence at previous UN COP summits and COP27 is no exception.

“The majority of the solutions put forth and funded by governments and donors to address these problems are in the long run making things worse” – Bridget Mugambe

One of the panels during the U.S.-hosted session on the Global Fertilizer Challenge included the head representative for the global fertilizer industry IFA Director-General Alzbeta Klein who spoke about addressing the availability and affordability of fertilizers as well as their sustainability. She excluded any mention of the industry’s substantial profiteering.

A new report from the nongovernmental organizations IATP and GRAIN found that nine of the largest fertilizer companies are expected to rake in $57 billion in profit this year more than quadrupling their earnings from 2020. The report examined corporate filings for nine fertilizer producers: Nutrien Yara Mosaic CF Industries ICL Group PhosAgro OCI K+S and OCP. It also looked at fertilizer import costs this year for 18 G20 countries and nine low- and middle-income countries finding that these governments were paying double or triple what they paid in 2020 for fertilizer this year.

Several factors contributed to surging fertilizer prices including supply chain disruptions and soaring fossil gas prices worsened by Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. Another factor however is the market power enjoyed by a handful of large fertilizer producers: The top 10 companies account for almost 40 percent of fertilizer sales and in the United States just four firms control 75 percent of domestic nitrogen fertilizer production.

This level of concentration facilitates market manipulation and price gouging. “We’ve seen [fertilizer producers] raise their prices beyond the cost of inputs like gas” Lilliston told DeSmog.

At a time when climate experts are calling for urgent transformations of all systems in society including the food system some environmental advocates are questioning the approach of enhancing fertilizer efficiency while maintaining the chemical-dependent model of industrialized agriculture. For instance Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa (AFSA) a large grassroots civil society movement advocating for food sovereignty and ecologically-based farming in Africa is pushing back against the input-intensive “green revolution” agricultural model that outside interests are exporting to Africa.

“Today the majority of the solutions put forth and funded by governments and donors to address these problems are in the long run making things worse” Bridget Mugambe AFSA’s program coordinator said in a statement on the group’s website. “Industrial agricultural methods dubbed ‘Climate Smart Agriculture’ promote the use of excessive chemical inputs on plants and in the soil. Carbon credit programs are being developed to legitimize pollution and to uproot communities from their land. These are just a few examples of the false solutions brought by the rich and the powerful.”",,,,,,

The new Microsoft Supply Chain Platform aims to enable organizations to orchestrate data from their disparate supply chain systems and make decisions on it.

The new platform uses Microsoft Cloud infrastructure and applications including Azure Dynamics 365 Microsoft Teams and Power Platform as the building blocks for customers to orchestrate the data create workflows and improve supply chain operations.

A core component of the new platform is the Microsoft Supply Chain Center which serves as a control tower for supply chain data and analyses according to Mike Bassani general manager for supply chain at Microsoft. The Supply Chain Center can take data from a company's existing supply chain systems including ERP systems Microsoft Dynamics 365 SAP and Oracle as well as standalone supply chain applications and discover where they may have issues.

The Supply Chain Center includes connectors to logistics and supply chain applications providers C.H. Robinson FedEx FourKites and Overhaul.

Microsoft Supply Chain Platform is available now as an open platform with capabilities from Dynamics 365 Azure and Microsoft 365 which are individually purchased and priced according to Microsoft.

Supply Chain Center is in public preview with licensing and pricing information to be determined at general availability. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management customers will automatically have access to Supply Chain Center with their existing licenses.

The Microsoft Supply Chain Platform enables companies to use data from various systems to get better visibility on supply chain issues.

Supply chain challenges are ongoing Supply chain disruptions have become a constant problem for organizations in the last few years which requires new applications to identify and mitigate issues before they affect business Bassani said. Companies are vulnerable to supply chain disruptions because they lack visibility to see what's coming as data is not current and can be trapped in various disconnected systems he said. The new supply chain platform originated from Microsoft's own supply chain disruptions and the lack of applications to deal with them said Panos Panay executive vice president and chief product officer at Microsoft during Supply Chain Reimagined a virtual conference that introduced the platform on Wednesday. Five years ago Microsoft's supply chain was run on Excel spreadsheets. ""It worked but once you start getting into the nuances of all the challenges that's not an effective way to do it"" Panay said. In the last five years Microsoft moved from Excel to a homegrown cloud-based system including 15 Azure products which served as the basis for its new supply chain offering he said.

Kraft Heinz gets better supply chain insights Consumer goods giant Kraft Heinz Co. has been using the new platform for the last two years said Mitch Arends senior vice president and head of operations for Kraft Heinz North America at the Supply Chain Reimagined event. Several issues including a drought in California that affected the supply of tomatoes Kraft Heinz sources for the Heinz ketchup brand put pressure on the supply chain Arends said. The pandemic changed consumer behavior to more in-home consumption leading to changes in how Kraft Heinz delivers products to market. All of this led to Kraft Heinz needing a more agile and resilient supply chain so that the company could for example forecast disruptions before they happen he said. ""[Microsoft Supply Chain Platform has] helped to increase our scalability and reliability and it's enabled us to see insights and trends faster"" Arends said. ""We can assess risks faster which enables us to have a greater level of collaboration not only internally but across the supply chain.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemicals from a large 3M factory north of Cordova found a way into the river and their wells.

The facility employs about 500 people and makes the adhesives used in Post-It Notes Scotch tape and other popular products. It also produces a family of chemicals called PFAS otherwise known as ""forever chemicals"" whose threat to human health has prompted increasing concern among federal and state environmental agencies.

Water and wastewater sampling by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2019 detected the chemicals. Now the agency says the drinking water of nearly 300000 people including the Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa will need additional testing to ensure it is safe.

Earlier this month the EPA announced that PFAS contamination from the 3M factory has created ""an imminent and substantial endangerment"" of public and private drinking water supplies. In a Nov. 2 EPA order Maplewood-based 3M agreed to investigate PFAS contamination in private wells and public water systems up to 10 miles away from the plant.

The situation has left local officials with a dilemma: they want to reassure people about their drinking water even as they face questions about health risks and who will pay to clean up the contamination.

City officials in Camanche Iowa announced in September that the municipal water which serves almost 4600 people tested above the EPA limit for two of the chemicals.

The city advised residents to contact their health care providers or consider installing home filters. Now officials are informing water customers that the city is seeking ""expert guidance"" from state and federal authorities.

""As of right now we are in a 'test and wait' phase on PFAS issues"" Camanche Public Works Director Gaylon Pewe wrote on the city's website. City officials did not respond to a request for an interview.

Their announcements have not eased the fears of several Camanche residents who on social media reacted to the city's latest news release with dismay. Is the water safe to drink? several asked.

""If it's that serious you know do some surveys and find out what's going on"" Camanche resident Gary Hopkins 78 said in an interview. ""Then get it to the doctors and the scientists and figure out what they can do to stop it.""

3M’s facility in Cordova Ill. opened in 1970. It employs 500 and manufactures adhesives for such products as Post-it Notes and Scotch tape.

The 3M plant has been a fixture in Cordova since the facility opened in 1970. The EPA permits the company to discharge its wastewater into the Mississippi River but 3M must monitor it for PFAS.

In 2019 3M informed the agency it was releasing more of the chemicals from the factory than previously reported. Testing has revealed the presence of at least 60 PFAS analytes in the vicinity.

PFAS or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a class of human-made compounds that do not break down easily in the environment and accumulate in organisms. Some are linked to a range of health problems like altered hormone levels decreased birth weight digestive inflammation and ulcers high cholesterol hypertension in pregnancy kidney and testicular cancers and reduced vaccine effectiveness in children.

They are ubiquitous in consumer and industrial products but for people living near contaminated sites drinking water is typically the main source of exposure of the odorless and tasteless chemicals.

In June the EPA updated draft health advisories for PFOA and PFOS two types of PFAS to levels so low as to suggest that no amount of PFAS is safe for consumption — a lifetime limit of 0.004 parts per trillion and 0.02 ppt of the two compounds respectively equivalent to a few drops in the combined volume of water in thousands of swimming pools.

This summer 3M began testing some of the drinking water near Cordova for PFAS and offered to sample about 190 private wells within a 3-mile radius of the plant. The company later started to contact private well owners with an offer to install in-home water treatment systems regardless of their sampling results.

Under the EPA order 3M now must offer well sampling to properties within a 4-mile radius of the plant that were not previously included in its outreach. Testing can begin after the agency approves a work plan the company will submit by early December.

Meanwhile 3M is required to test area public water suppliers within 10 miles of the plant. An agency spokesperson declined to say what action the EPA might take if testing reveals contamination in those facilities.

The agency also ordered 3M to develop a special work plan for the city of Camanche which is north of the Cordova plant in Iowa. The plan must include the provision of an alternative drinking water supply or water treatment.

Grant Thompson a 3M spokesperson directed people who are concerned about the safety of their drinking water to government websites that address ""PFAS-related questions.""

The city of Camanche has issued similar advice.

Numerous river communities downstream of the plant have detectable levels of PFAS in their water treatment systems and continue to test for the chemicals.

Charles Brown utilities lab manager for the city of Moline Ill. said PFAS removal is expensive and there are downsides to taking action too soon.

Treatment standards are likely to change next year when the EPA announces its final recommendations for four PFAS chemicals he said. Research on PFAS removal also is apt to provide water plant operators with additional treatment options in coming years.

Brown said Moline residents contacted him several months ago to inquire whether they can drink their water.

""Of course the water is safe"" Brown said. ""We wouldn't put it out if it wasn't and we would let people know.""

Moline tests city water quarterly. Results from December 2021 indicated two PFAS compounds exceeded the EPA's guidelines but just one tested above the state of Illinois' health advisory limit which is less stringent.

""We'll have to wait to see where more funding comes for the actual treatment"" Brown said. ""But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in treatment until we know what the [final EPA PFAS] limits are going to be and then what the science will be for treatment.""

3M has faced several legal cases for PFAS production. Other than in Cordova it has two major U.S. plants that produce the chemicals: in the Twin Cities and in Decatur Ala. The state of Minnesota sued the company over mismanaged PFAS waste from its Cottage Grove plant and in 2018 settled for $850 million to treat drinking water there. 3M also settled lawsuits in Alabama last year for $99 million.

But perhaps the most significant disruption centered on the company's chemical plant near Antwerp Belgium where Flemish authorities briefly shut down production of the chemicals. 3M ultimately struck a $600 million remediation deal.

David Cwiertny a University of Iowa engineering professor and director of the Center for Health Effects of Environmental Contamination said if his drinking water tested positive for PFAS he would install a home water treatment system such as carbon filters or reverse osmosis.

""It's jarring to have your water supply be something that you immediately don't trust"" he said. ""And even with treatment a lot of people won't trust what's coming out of their taps and that trust is hard to regain and rebuild.""

As communities surrounding Cordova grapple with the difficult cleanup ahead Cwiertny said it is all but certain they will not be the last.

Linda Vaughn is among thousands of residents living north of the Quad Cities of Iowa and Illinois who are confronting the question of whether they can safely drink water from their taps. She lives 4 miles from the 3M plant.

Linda Vaughn a retired school bus driver lives about 4 miles from the 3M plant on the Illinois side of the river. She already avoids what comes out of her well but wonders whether she will have to do more. Vaughn drinks bottled water while her husband drinks filtered water from their refrigerator.

""I don't know if that covers it"" she said. ""I don't think we've had any problems so far. And my husband's in his 70s. I'm in my 70s.""

Increase your investment portfolio’s after-tax return. Build your own index fund to invest in what matters to you. It’s tempting to dismiss these marketing claims as hyperbole except they are coming from some of the best-known and most-respected names in the investing world including Fidelity Schwab and even Burton Malkiel author of the investing classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street.

The fanfare is about a controversial trend: A growing number of investment firms now offer Main Street investors a strategy called “personalized” or “direct” indexing that typically requires buying and trading stocks directly mimicking an index . Investment firms and advisers have long offered this strategy to the wealthy for an annual management fee that’s often more than 1% of the portfolio’s value. But now enabled by no-commission trading  smart supercomputer programs and the ability to buy fractions of shares at least three firms—Fidelity Schwab and Wealthfront—are repackaging the service for cost-conscious index investors. The new offerings enable you to dabble in personalized indexing with portfolios as small as $1 for fees ranging from $4.99 a month to 0.4% a year (see the table below).

There are two main types of these new programs. One focuses on personalizing your portfolio by allowing you to invest in thematic baskets of individual stocks— green energy firms for example—or to tailor a broader index by eliminating companies you may object to or that you have large positions in elsewhere. The other type which typically allows less personalization is all about tax efficiency focused on harvesting investment losses to offset gains or income and reduce your bill on April 15.

Why not just pick the stocks on your own? Few average investors have the time and expertise either to buy and manage potentially hundreds of stocks in a way that replicates an index or to constantly swap money-losing stocks for similar issues to lock in tax losses.

Healthy Skepticism For Direct Indexing

Any new Wall Street offering should be scrutinized. And this one has plenty of critics: Rick Ferri a financial adviser and president of the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy questions the fees and wonders whether the customized portfolios might make it harder to move assets from the provider who built the personalized index.

As for tax efficiency investors will have to weigh any advantage against the increased complexity of their tax returns: Schwab (which requires potential new clients to have a no-cost consultation with one of its advisers) warns its Personalized Indexing investors to expect 1099 tax forms that can exceed 50 pages for example. And some individual investors might consider the minimum investment at Schwab and Wealthfront—$100000—on the high side.

Reasons to Invest

Even boosters—including fund-research giant Morningstar which plans to roll out a direct indexing program to be sold through advisers late in 2022—concede that these new indexes aren’t for everyone. Daniel Needham president of Morningstar’s Wealth Management Solutions urges investors to first protect their core savings by building up an emergency fund and using tax-advantaged retirement-savings accounts to invest in the tried-and-true mix of low-cost stock and bond index funds. Once that’s done he says there are three main reasons an investor might consider a personalized index:

Preferences. Although there are already more than 10000 mutual and exchange-traded funds with almost every imaginable mix of stocks some investors may prefer to create a portfolio of individual stocks to address ethical or other concerns. Customization might be limited though. Customers of Fidelity’s managed FidFolios can jettison up to five stocks or two industries from Fidelity’s preset portfolios; for now Schwab’s clients can bar only three stocks after selecting a portfolio. An exception is Wealthfront which gives clients the ability to eliminate an unlimited number of stocks from their personalized index.

Balance. Employees of companies that offer significant stock compensation (tech firms for example) may want to limit tech exposure elsewhere. They could create a personalized index that avoids the tech stocks that make up more than one-fourth of the S&P 500 diversification that could reduce overall portfolio risk.

Taxes. Investors in high tax brackets who expect to reap significant capital gains can use personalized indexing to turbocharge tax loss harvesting in taxable brokerage accounts. The technique involves selling an investment that has declined in value and using the losses to offset taxes on capital gains from other investments (or up to $3000 in income if losses exceed gains). To stay fully invested investors use the proceeds to buy something similar.

This requires expertise because the IRS’s “ wash sale ” rule penalizes you for switching into investments that look “substantially identical” to whatever you sold in the past 30 days. You can’t sell and then buy back GM shares within the next month for example. But you can sell GM and buy Ford

Losses are abundant these days in mutual funds and ETFs of course but direct-indexing promoters claim that holding individual stocks allows you to cash in on losses that might be obscured by the overall return of a broad index fund. “Even in a good year 20% to 30% of stocks will be down” explains D.J. Tierney a senior portfolio strategist for Schwab Asset Management Solutions.

The boosters say tax-loss harvesting can be worth the work. A Wealthfront study says that over the five-year period ending April 30 the after-tax returns of the firm’s US Direct Indexing clients were typically 0.4 to 0.8 percentage point a year ahead of where they would have been had they stuck with ETFs and used standard tax-loss harvesting strategies.

Malkiel Wealthfront’s chief investment officer says that tax loss harvesting is one of the only exceptions he makes to his passive-index-investing advice: “I absolutely believe in direct indexing. It is really very helpful in times like this when the market has declined so sharply.”

But other cost-conscious investment advisers say most investors don’t pay enough taxes to make the strategy worthwhile unless they expect large capital gains. It shouldn’t be surprising that a complicated tax strategy pays off most for those with high tax bills. For everybody else personalized indexing it seems is like hiring a tailor to craft a bespoke shirt. Creating a customized stock portfolio for a fee might be a luxury to invest in only after taking care of the necessities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdS5lZHUvbmV3cy9hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnRzLzIwMjIvbm92ZW1iZXIvY2FyZWVyLXNlcnZpY2VzLWV0aXF1ZXR0ZS1kaW5uZXIucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Students Take Part in Career Services Etiquette Dinner,"Students Take Part in Career Services Etiquette Dinner

11/18/2022

Tuesday night the St. Louis Room in the Busch Student Center became a place for Saint Louis University students to experience dinner in a professional atmosphere.

Career Services hosted its fall etiquette dinner for students. The event offered tips and advice for students for handling business dinners.

“Our goal is to prepare students for interaction in a professional dining setting such as a meal or reception” said Floyd K. Welsh Career Services Director. “We hope they came away with more confidence navigating those types of events and made connections with employers as well as each other.”

Around 125 students signed up to take part in the event. The students dressed in their professional best participated in a four-course dinner. In between the courses 17 employer representatives from various industries in the St. Louis area offered advice and mingled with students.

During the appetizer portion of the evening students were encouraged to move around the room and talk to each other and the employer representatives. After learning the right way to initiate a conversation students were able to make introductions and collect business cards.

“I came here tonight for the networking opportunity — to get contacts and get to know the businesses around the area better” said Caitlin Conrad a freshman majoring in marketing and data analytics. “I met a lot of great people — it’s just a great opportunity to get an introduction into what to do during the first meeting with someone.”

Following the mingling portion there were more lessons and more intimate conversations. The students returned to their seats at the tables for the rest of the evening. Each table had one of the 17 employer representatives.

Robel E. Esayas a junior majoring in public health with a minor in marketing said he came to the event hoping to improve his knowledge of etiquette but also to meet new people — the dinner was just a bonus.

“The food really isn’t the first thing here it’s the conversation” he said.

Esayas said he enjoyed the event and found it beneficial.

“I’ve connected with different people and gained insight into what they do and how they work in life” he said.

Community Leaders from Alcona and Iosco Counties recently participated in a Broadband Provider Panel presentation.



Coordinated by the office of Sen. Gary Peters and Connected Michigan the event brought together communities seeking to increase internet access to residents and the providers who are interested in expanding services.



“Access to affordable high-speed internet is critical to ensuring that our communities can be successful in a 21st century economy and world” said Senator Peters a member of the Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee. “My office was pleased to help put on this event to connect local leaders and residents with providers to both expand and improve the quality of internet services available to families in Northeast Michigan.”



Internet Service Providers (ISP) panel presenters included Marilyn Passmore from Charter Communications; Tom Sobeck and Ruthanne Largent of PIE&G Connect; Rich Castle of Consumers Energy; and Matthew Sams of Mercury Broadband. The panel was facilitated by Tom Stephenson Northern Michigan coordinator for Connected Michigan.



Nearly two dozen community leaders business owners and residents attended the meeting at the Warrior Pavilion in Oscoda. Questions for panelists included the timeframe of implementation for previously awarded Rural Development Opportunity Funds (RDOF) to expand internet and wireless access.



Sams shared that Mercury Broadband has been providing services in Michigan since 2019. Their tentative timeline is to build out the internet infrastructure by the end of 2023 and begin offering services by the end of 2024. Sams also said that Mercury is leveraging its extensive capital investments to build out the network for the areas it was awarded in the RDOF grant.



Passmore from Charter Communications stated that their service offers a 300 MPS starting point. Charter is also involved with the FCC program to offer free literacy programs to consumers as well as internet subsidies for income-based families. Castle from Consumers Energy stated that while Consumers has no plans to enter the internet service provider business they are collaborating with other ISPs such as Presque Isle Connect to share access to poles.



Chris Scharrer CEO of DCS Technology Design LLC and project consultant for Iosco County’s Broadband Advisory Committee reminded attendees that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for communities to access state and federal funding to expand internet access. He also stated that wireless technologies are subject to 3-to-5-year generational changes similar to cellular technology.



Sobeck from PIE&G Connect stated that their cost to build out internet services is approximately $25000 per mile as compared to other companies who may spend up to $70000 per mile. Sobeck reminded the group that PIE&G is a nonprofit organization and is invested in bringing internet access to rural communities including farms.



The outcome of the panel presentation was to build relationships between counties and potential vendors. Gloria Brooks president of Develop Iosco said “Our Broadband Advisory Committee was well represented at the event. We believe that the information and connections from this meeting will allow us to submit a competitive proposal for funding and ultimately bring improved quality internet services to our residents.""

The letter is a forecful response to a controversial CTIA report earlier this week (November 15) from telecoms lobby group CTIA which attacked the efficacy of spectrum sharing via a direct takedown of CBRS as a basis for future spectrum releases in the US. The CTIA report authored by Recon Analytics claimed CBRS has “low utilization low market demand and a dearth of innovative use cases”.

In response the new pro-CBRS letter – addressed to FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel and NTIA administrator Alan Davidson and seen by Enterprise IoT Insights – states that over 285000 CBRS base station devices are now live on CBRS airwaves at 3.55-3.7 GHz in the US. The total has been reached in just three years they declare since the FCC opened the band for shared and private cellular usage – and compares with 69543 new radio deployments by public mobile operators in the same period and 418887 in the “entire 40-year history” of public cellular in the US.

In other words new CBRS cell sites are going-in three times (300 percent) faster than the rate of public network expansion. The numbers also undermine any kind of shaky counter-argument that public cellular is an upgrade exercise originally on the grounds the three-year CBRS count is two thirds (69 percent) of the 40-year total for commercial cellular – even if it is so far an apple-and-orange measures of (mostly) 4G micro and 5G macro cells.

The signatories are mostly CBRS familiars from the telecoms space such as Airspan Networks Amazon Celona Charter Communications Comcast Cox Communications Federated Wireless Hewlett Packard Enterprise Mavenir Systems Motorola Solutions and Pollen Mobile. A handful of parties with more traditional ‘vertical’ interests have also signed notably agricultural giant Deere & Company and real estate firm JBG SMITH Properties.

The education sector (blurring with the healthcare and the municipal realm) is also represented by the American Library Association the Purdue Research Foundation and the Schools Health & Libraries Broadband Coalition (SHLB). The letter states that the whole of US industry “support[s] an inclusive approach to spectrum policy”; it recites use cases for CBRS networks variously in manufacturing farming logistics education and healthcare.

This gang of CBRS champs also urge the FCC and NTIA to follow the CBRS model for future spectrum releases on the grounds that it is efficient. In total 228 organizations have won priority-access (PAL) licenses at auction which is “almost 10 times the number of winning bidders in the exclusive-use 3.45 GHz band” the letter states. The general-access (GAA) portion of the CBRS band hosts nearly 900 different users across many sectors it says.

The CBRS model has made the US appear progressive and worth following the letter declares. It suggests Brazil Germany France Japan Sweden and the UK have all followed the US lead with mid-band ‘vertical’ spectrum. “The US has shown the world” they write. “In light of other countries’ moves toward greater spectrum sharing the US should extend its leadership by nurturing and growing CBRS.”

The letter concludes: “The CBRS allocation has fulfilled its promise as the ‘innovation band’ in an incredibly short period of time. The framework should be advanced for future spectrum allocations including in the lower 3 GHz band to enable greater competition innovation efficiency and American leadership. Thank you for continuing to support a spectrum policy that demonstrates America’s inventive spirit at its finest.”

The letter is copied in full below.

Last month Kelly Hill executive editor at RCR Wireless summed up: “Conversations on spectrum policy are shifting focus to renewing the pipeline of airwaves under consideration for future use both for 5G and as-yet-unstandardized 6G systems.” Federal agencies are also reconsidering how to shape the spectrum pipeline wrote Hill and where spectrum sharing may help to “bolster commercial spectrum access”.

Hill quoted the NTIA at a panel discussion at the Spectrum Policy Symposium in Washington D.C. “There are not a lot of easy bands left if any and we need better tools to be able to innovate our way through it” said the NTIA. A report from Coleago Consulting from July last year said average urban needs for mid-band spectrum (around 1.5-7.125 GHz) would be over 2000 megahertz by 2025-2030 and as high as 3690 megahertz in rich cities.

The same article also cited a study by Analysys Mason commissioned by CTIA which ranked the U.S. ahead of 15 global markets for licensed low-band and unlicensed mid-band provisions but eleventh of 15 for licensed mid-band spectrum availability.

Meanwhile the FCC has launched an inquiry into the use of up to 550 megahertz of spectrum at 12.7-13.25 GHz. The 12-13 GHz range falls into the “high midband”. The FCC has said it is “ideally suited for mobile broadband use as it is already allocated for terrestrial mobile services on a primary basis domestically.” It has extended an existing freeze on new operations in the band.

Dear Chairwoman Rosenworcel and Administrator Davidson

Wireless spectrum is essential to America’s future technology leadership industrial might and global competitiveness. That’s why a remarkably broad swath of companies and organizations – representing manufacturing automotive agriculture energy retail commercial real estate communications media and supply chain industries as well as schools libraries and civil society groups – support an inclusive approach to spectrum policy. America needs a balanced policy that considers the needs of an extraordinarily diverse range of spectrum stakeholders who are investing in advanced networks to power the “5G economy”.

As we consider new spectrum options that can be made available to serve the American people we urge you to build on the demonstrated success of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum sharing model. The innovative CBRS licensing framework has driven innovation in the next generation of wireless networks. These networks advance investment protect critical U.S. leadership and security by enabling ongoing Department of Defense (DoD) and Federal missions in shared bands drive innovation and competition and maximize efficient use of the limited yet essential spectrum resource. Every day more devices services and organizations require access to a wider array of spectrum resources. Implementing approaches that promote a wide variety of advanced communications applications will powerfully advance the public good.

Spectrum Sharing Advances Investment

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) first authorized commercial equipment in the CBRS band just three years ago and completed its auction of shared licenses just two years ago. In that short timeframe CBRS is now being used throughout the country with over 285000 CBRS base station devices (CBSDs) already deployed in under three years. For comparison the commercial wireless industry has built 418887 cell sites over its entire 40-year history. (During the same three-year period that CBRS has been active cellular providers built 69543 cell sites – of which more than 10000 use CBRS.) As further evidence of a dynamic equipment ecosystem the FCC has certified 187 different CBRS base station models and 496 different end user client devices ranging from traditional smartphones and IoT modules and gateways to security cameras barcode scanners and building management sensors. Use of the CBRS band is vibrant and growing at an impressive pace.

Spectrum Sharing Drives Innovation

The CBRS framework provides users with flexibility to choose from the broadest range of technologies and service models driving innovation and competition in the private wireless market. Because CBRS spectrum is accessible to a wide variety of operators it provides options for operators in suburban rural and remote areas that are not adequately served by traditional carriers while also enabling private network users to customize networks to meet their needs.

CBRS is emerging as the home spectrum band for a myriad of advanced wireless use cases. For example:

– CBRS-powered networks are improving the efficiency of supply chains warehouses and critical seaports.

– CBRS is enabling advanced manufacturing techniques that enhance worker productivity and safety helping – American firms maintain their competitive edge.

– Farms are using CBRS to increase efficiency yields and cost savings.

– Transportation and shipping hubs are using private networks to support automated-guided vehicles moving cargo and to improve real-time logistics through faster wireless communications.

– Schools and libraries are using CBRS to close the digital divide and homework gap for underserved communities.

– Hospitals are using CBRS to triage and monitor patients including by connecting outdoor hotspots to indoor networks so nurses can test and triage patients outside the hospital setting.

– Airports entertainment venues and stadiums are using private CBRS networks to improve the guest experience by providing additional and dedicated bandwidth for venue operations.

These and many other use cases demonstrate that CBRS networks – along with complementary technologies like industrial automation artificial intelligence precision agriculture and edge computing providers – are essential to enabling an enterprise technology stack that propels American innovation and advanced industrial practices.



Spectrum Sharing Spurs Competition



CBRS enables “converged” delivery models that both compete with and bolster traditional wireless network services provided over exclusively licensed spectrum. It is also proving complementary to Wi-Fi. No single private entity or industry should hold the key to an enterprise university or other entity’s ability to access the public airwaves needed to deploy an innovative purpose-built network. The CBRS framework helps ensure that does not happen. This competition drives still more innovation creating a virtuous cycle.



Spectrum Sharing Maximizes Efficiency of a Limited Resource



CBRS uniquely combines auctioned and non-auctioned authorizations into a single frequency band maximizing the scale of the equipment ecosystem to the benefit of many different types of users. The FCC conceived of the CBRS shared-license model to allow the DoD to avoid band clearing (and its associated costs) and continue its critical operations while also allowing a wide variety of commercial operators to use spectrum in the same band. This tiered spectrum sharing model ensures the protection of America’s national security interests while allowing other users to make the most of a critical resource.



Both the auctioned (Priority Access License or PAL) and non-auctioned or licensed-by-rule (General Authorized Access or GAA) portions of the CBRS bands have demonstrated substantial success. The PAL auction resulted in 228 diverse winning bidders – almost 10 times the number of winning bidders in the exclusive-use 3.45 GHz band. PAL winners included wireless internet service providers and electric utilities cable operators and nationwide and regional mobile network operators. The GAA portion of the band hosts nearly 900 different users including factories cities school districts hospitals research centers schools public libraries utilities and other critical infrastructure. Most importantly unused PAL spectrum does not lie fallow and can be efficiently put to use by GAA spectrum users.

That all of these different user types can “cohabitate” in a single spectrum band is an achievement to be celebrated and replicated. At the same time as new technologies and techniques become available to make the CBRS automated dynamic sharing regime even more efficient it provides a framework for iterative improvement over time.

Spectrum Sharing Is Internationally Recognized

CBRS has become a model for spectrum sharing around the world. Recognizing the value of midband private 5G networks other countries are also working to make spectrum available in new ways for new users and uses. For example Germany France the United Kingdom Japan Brazil Sweden and other countries have all designated substantial amounts of shared midband spectrum for private and local networks.

– In Germany the Frankfurt Airport is working toward deploying a private 5G network to “control data and voice communication autonomously.”

– In Japan Sony is working to deploy internet service that will minimize “service disruptions caused by heavy traffic” in certain residential complexes.

– In the U.K. Verizon is using shared midband spectrum to develop a private 5G wireless network for the Associated British Ports.

– In Europe CEPT is studying CBRS-like dynamic sharing of low/medium power networks with satellite systems in the 3.8-4.2 GHz band.



With CBRS the United States has shown the world that spectrum can be made available without requiring inefficient allocations for a wide variety of different uses. In light of other countries’ moves toward greater spectrum sharing the United States should extend its leadership by nurturing and growing CBRS.



Conclusion



The undersigned parties believe that the CBRS allocation has fulfilled its promise as the “innovation band” in an incredibly short period of time. The framework should be advanced for future spectrum allocations including in the lower 3 GHz band to enable greater competition innovation efficiency and American leadership. Thank you for continuing to support a spectrum policy that demonstrates America’s inventive spirit at its finest.

It’s more like players are taking the gloves off and lining up their punches.

Just as CTIA released another study supporting licensed spectrum another group of companies sent a letter to federal spectrum agencies calling for a CBRS-type framework to be applied to the lower 3 GHz band.

The November 17 letter addressed to FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA) Administrator Alan Davidson spells out how successful the CBRS 3.5 GHz band has been in the U.S. and how it’s driving innovative uses of spectrum. For example farms are using CBRS to increase yields and schools and libraries are using it to close the digital divide.

Public Knowledge OTI and SHLB also were signatories to that correspondence as well as groups like California State Library LinkOregon and New York Public Library.

Spectrum melee

CTIA sparked a litany of opinions and comments from the CBRS industry after publishing a Recon Analytics report earlier this week that essentially called CBRS a failure. It’s all part of a full court press that CTIA is making to bolster its argument for making more mid-band spectrum available for licensed use by its mobile carrier members.

Related CTIA study stirs up frenzy over CBRS

On Thursday CTIA released a white paper by Rysavy Research saying it’s essential to allocate hundreds of megahertz of additional mid-band spectrum on an exclusive license basis with full power levels and wide bands.

That came after an Accenture report released in September that identified 350 MHz in the 3.1-4.5 GHz band as one of the most promising for 5G; the other two being 400 MHz in the 4.4-4.94 GHz band and 400 MHz in the 7.125-8.4 GHz band.

The Accenture study said the U.S. wireless industry currently has access to 5% of lower mid-band spectrum while unlicensed spectrum users have access to 7x and government users have access to 12x that amount.

An earlier updated study also released by CTIA in September by Analysys Mason showed the U.S. continues to lag other countries in the amount of mid-band spectrum available for licensed 5G.

CBRS pioneer weighs in

The question is how the 3.1-3.45 GHz band which sits right in the prime mid-band space will be used commercially. Will it be auctioned for commercial uses like the C-band or will it be modeled after the CBRS band which is in part shared and in part licensed?

Celona is one of those pushing for a CBRS-like model. The company was founded about two years ago; it sells hardware and software for enterprises to set up a private network using CBRS. Without CBRS the enterprise has to go to an operator to supply a network for them and that can be a time-consuming and limiting process said Mehmet Yavuz co-founder and CTO at Celona.

“This will take some time” before all is said and done Yavuz said. “I believe CTIA came out with this report because they’re afraid” that the next most promising mid-band spectrum for 5G may be used on a shared basis like CBRS. If CBRS were deemed a success it could more easily be extended to other bands like the 3.1-3.45 GHz.

Instead it’s bashing the CBRS model. “That’s what we believe is going on right now” he said.

Incumbent Department of Defense (DoD) Navy users are protected in the 3.5 GHz CBRS band. The same could apply to the 3.1-3.45 GHz band which also is home to the DoD.

“We believe this is not practical for all those systems to be moved” out of the 3.1-3.45 GHz Yavuz said “The best way is to keep them as the Tier 1 users the incumbents” he added. “Then open it up” for use by secondary users.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbWlkY2l0eW1lc3Nlbmdlci5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9pbnNwaXJlbm9sYS1zY2hvb2xzLWFubm91bmNlcy1rZXZpbi1iYXJuZXMtanItYXMtY2hpZWYtb2Ytc3RhZmYtc3BvbnNvcmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,InspireNOLA Schools announces Kevin Barnes Jr. as Chief of Staff (sponsored) – Mid-City Messenger,"InspireNOLA Charter Schools is proud to announce that Kevin Barnes Jr. has joined the organization as Chief of Staff.

Credit: Ratfink1973 from Pixabay.

Chevron has agreed to fully acquire energy solutions firm Beyond6 (B6) and its network of 55 compressed natural gas (CNG) stations across the US for an undisclosed sum.

Under the deal Chevron subsidiary Chevron USA will acquire a 100% stake in B6 from Chevron’s current B6 co-owners a subsidiary of Mercuria Energy Trading (Mercuria) and B6 CEO Andrew West.

Chevron Americas Products president Andy Walz said: “Chevron has seen strong demand for our RNG-to-CNG fuel offering from new and existing customers.

“Because of its carbon negative attribute and the ability of fleet operators to efficiently adapt vehicles to run on CNG renewable natural gas can be a lower carbon solution for fleets seeking to reduce their lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.”

Mercuria will also sign a long-term supply agreement with Chevron whereby the latter will receive renewable natural gas as part of the transaction.

Mercuria chief investment officer Brian Falik said: “B6 represents a best-in-class operator in the build-out of a renewable natural gas network and Mercuria has been excited to help the company grow from a stand-alone business to one that can help drive growth under Chevron.

LLC (CPChem)—a joint venture of Chevron Corp. and Phillips 66—and QatarEnergy have reached positive final investment decision (FID) to move forward with construction of the partners’ previously delayed grassroots petrochemical complex along the Texas Gulf Coast in Orange Tex. about 113 miles east of Houston (OGJ Online July 15 2019).

To be named Golden Triangle Polymers Co. LLC—a newly formed joint-venture partnership of CPChem (51%) and QatarEnergy (49%)—the proposed $8.5-billion integrated polymers complex will include a 2.08-million tonne/year (tpy) ethylene cracker and two 1-million tpy high-density polyethylene (HDPE) units for production of proprietary Marlex polyethylene pellets for sale primarily to manufacturers in the Asia Pacific Europe and Latin America the partners said upon announcing FID on Nov. 16.

Targeting 25% lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than similar US and European plants in support of CPChem and QatarEnergies’ commitments to enabling a reduced-carbon future the complex comes as part of the companies’ aim of meeting increased global demand for polymers as well as the next phase of QatarEnergies’ downstream growth strategy which includes major investments in ethylene ethylene derivatives and general polymers said Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi QatarEnergy’s president and chief executive officer.

Scheduled for immediate start of construction the Golden Triangle Polymers complex is slated for commissioning in 2026 the companies said.

Earlier this year CPChem and QatarEnergy confirmed they also are moving forward with a previously announced plan to jointly build and operate the proposed Ras Laffan petrochemical project (RLPP) in Ras Laffan Industrial City Qatar (OGJ Online June 9 2022). The RLPP too will feature a 2.08-million tpy ethane cracker and two HDPE units.

CPChem and QatarEnergy already serve as JV partners in Ras Laffan Olefins Co. and Qatar Chemical Co. Ltd. which respectively operate petrochemical production complexes in Ras Laffan and Mesaieed Qatar.

The partners previously deferred taking FID on the Golden Triangle Polymers project in 2020 amid a then-uncontrolled global pandemic (OGJ Online Aug. 2 2021; Aug. 3 2020).

We have a great relationship and a proven track record of operating these facilities safely and reliably” said Chevron Phillips Chemical President and CEO Bruce Chinn. “Our products help make life better for billions of people every day and they are part of a lower carbon future. This facility will help meet the growing demand for our products and improve the quality of life for the world’s growing global population.”

His Excellency Mr. Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi the Minister of State for Energy Affairs the President and CEO of QatarEnergy said: “We are excited to announce taking the FID on our largest petrochemical investment ever highlighting QatarEnergy’s integrated position as a major player in the LNG and international exploration sectors as well as being a global petrochemicals producer. This important project will complement QatarEnergy’s growing portfolio both internationally as well as in the United States and will help meet growing global demand for polymers. It builds on our long-term and successful partnership with Chevron Phillips Chemical and we look forward to further collaborations in the future.”

Once operational the plant will produce Marlex® polyethylene. Polyethylene is used in the production of durable goods like pipe for natural gas and water delivery and recreational products such as kayaks and coolers. It is also used in essential packaging applications to protect and preserve food helping prevent it from going to landfills and keep medical supplies sterile.

The plant expected to begin operations in 2026 will include a 2080 KTA ethane cracker and two 1000 KTA high-density polyethylene units. The project is targeting to have approximately 25% lower greenhouse gas emissions than similar facilities in the United States and Europe supporting the company’s efforts to help enable a lower carbon future. Chevron Phillips Chemical will manage engineering procurement and construction for the project and operate the facility after start-up.

Construction of the Golden Triangle Polymers plant will begin immediately near Chevron Phillips Chemical’s existing facility in Orange located 113 miles east of Houston. Chevron Phillips Chemical and its predecessors have had a presence in the Orange community since 1955.

The engineering procurement and construction of the polyethylene units will be executed through ZDJV a joint venture between Zachry Industrial Inc. (Zachry Group) and DL USA Inc. The furnace portion of the ethane cracker engineering and procurement will be executed by T.EN Stone & Weber Process Technology Inc. while PCL Industrial Construction Co. will provide construction services. Engineering procurement and construction for the additional portions of the ethane cracker will be executed by JKJV a joint venture between JGC America Inc. and Kiewit Energy Group Inc. and BMZ Third Coast Partners a joint venture between Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company Inc. and Zachry Industrial Inc. (Zachry Group) will execute the utilities and infrastructure scope of work. The main automation contractor for the project is Emerson Process Management LLLP and W.T. Byler Co. Inc. is managing heavy civil work for the entire site. The project also includes a rail and storage-in-transit yard with engineering procurement and construction services provided by W.T. Byler Co. Inc.

“We work hard to be a good neighbor in the communities where we operate and we are extremely grateful to the community members and public officials in Orange for their support as we developed this project” Chinn said. “This facility will contribute to the social and economic fabric of the entire Golden Triangle region of Texas bringing in thousands of high-paying American jobs and billions of dollars in economic impact. We care deeply about the community of Orange and we’re thrilled to be bringing jobs and resources to the region with safety and environmental performance at the forefront as always.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vdmVuZXp1ZWxhbmFseXNpcy5jb20vbmV3cy8xNTY0OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Venezuela Slightly Ups Oil Output Expands Iran Cooperation,"Caracas and Tehran held their ninth high-level economic summit to open new cooperation avenues as well as investment in Venezuelan oil projects.

Caracas November 17 2022 (venezuelanalysis.com) – Venezuela’s oil production rose marginally with new Iranian condensate imports as the two countries prepare to extend cooperation in several key economic sectors.

According to secondary sources from the latest Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) report October’s production stood at 679000 barrels per day (bpd) an uptick from the 669000 bpd pumped in September. For its part Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA reported 717000 bpd an improvement from the previous month’s 666000 bpd.

PDVSA is reportedly drawing production from new wells located south of Maracaibo Lake in western Zulia state reaching some 98180 bpd in October although recent flooding in the area has hampered efforts. Venezuela has also continued ramping up Iranian condensate imports which is used to dilute heavy Venezuelan crudes adding to the slight increase in production.

The most recent shipments of Iranian condensate as well as crude to Venezuela included two cargoes of 2 and 1.95 million barrels in August and a 2.1 million dispatch in October according to Vortexa. Another Iranian cargo is expected in mid-November sources told Argus Media. In exchange a 1.9 million barrel load of Venezuela’s Merey 16°API was shipped last month to Tehran as partial payment for the imports.

Since 2020 Venezuela and Iran have strengthened their partnership to overcome US sanctions with Tehran sending fuel crude diluents equipment materials and even technicians to help restart oil extraction and refining operations. In September 2021 the countries began an oil-for-condensate swap deal followed by a 20-year cooperation map signed in June.

Recently high-level delegations from both countries held the ninth meeting of the Iran-Venezuela Joint Economic Committee in Tehran in order to expand bilateral dealings reported the Iranian agency IRNA. Between November 11-15 the two sides inked a new document focusing on energy science technology healthcare education agriculture and tourism explained Venezuelan Agriculture and Land Minister Wilmar Castro Soteldo.

“[This is] a great document for presidents [Nicolás Maduro and Ebrahim Raisi] to make the corresponding decisions” stated Castro. He added that more than 40 Iranian companies expressed readiness to invest in Venezuela including in the Caribbean country’s electric system.

As part of the expanded partnership Iranian car manufacturer Saipa will soon export 1000 vehicles to Venezuela out of an 80000 car order reported Iranian media.

For his part Venezuelan Transportation Minister Ramón Velázquez met with Iran National Development Fund (NDF) chairman Mehdi Ghazanfari and welcomed his proposal to invest in Venezuela’s oil and petrochemical projects. The NDF is Iran’s sovereign wealth fund created in 2011 to turn oil and gas revenues into durable wealth.

Venezuela’s modest oil production recovery reaching one million barrels last December is mainly attributed to the ongoing wide-reaching alliance with Iran. Nonetheless crude output has stumbled this year as the industry remains hindered by US sanctions.

Since 2017 Venezuela’s oil sector has been under siege following the imposition of financial sanctions against PDVSA followed by a full-fledged oil embargo in 2019 as well as secondary sanctions and other threats throughout 2020. The measures were largely responsible for the country’s 1.9 million bpd crude output diving to less than 350000 bpd in the second half of 2020.

Lower oil production has also resulted in lower exports throughout the years with some small hikes since 2021 after Caracas teamed up with Asian intermediaries to find alternate routes for oil shipments.

In October Venezuela registered 533968 bpd in exports of crude oil and byproducts the fourth-lowest monthly average this year as reported by PDVSA and Refinitiv Eikon vessel-tracking data. Most cargoes went to Malaysia and China.

However the exports decline will soon be slightly overturned with new oil shipments about to set sail to Europe. Following a four-month hiatus Italian oil company Eni and PDVSA agreed to resume an oil-for-debt swap deal that had seen Eni receive 3.6 million barrels of Venezuelan diluted crude oil (DCO) between June and July.

According to Reuters an Eni unit has been assigned two cargoes of one million DCO barrels each for November loading. In May Eni and Spain’s Repsol obtained sanctions exceptions from the US Treasury Department amidst Europe’s energy crunch.

While the swap deal pays off PDVSA’s billions of dollars in debt to the two firms Caracas had suspended shipments demanding more substantial benefits mainly fuel imports as the country’s refineries continue hampered by frequent operational disruptions. Neither Eni nor PDVSA have informed if the resumed deal includes expanded terms.

US oil corporation Chevron has likewise been lobbying for a sanctions waiver in order to pump and sell Venezuelan oil from its four-joint ventures in the country using an oil-for-debt swap deal. The US Treasury Department has not offered any updates on Chevron’s request.

Earlier  BOC Aviation Ltd. — the Singapore-based aircraft operating leasing company  had started the legal action against 16 insurers over its aircraft stuck in Russia.

Now  the China Development Bank (CDB)  China's largest policy bank still has nine aircraft in Russia after Moscow blocked some 400 jets from leaving following Western sanctions over its February invasion of Ukraine.

The listed 18 insurers named in the proceedings as per the filing on Nov. 15  included Swiss Re AG  Lloyd's of London Ltd Chubb Ltd and Great Lakes Insurance a subsidiary of Munich Re.

However  similar to the BOC Aviation filing  the latest filing did not include further details on the size of the claim by CDB  which had a total portfolio of 384 aircraft at the end of June.

Keeping track of the recent developments  the latest legal action are the third to be initiated in the Irish courts following filings by two other major leasing companies — Avolon and BOC Aviation Ltd.

In the month of June  AerCap Holdings NV  the world's biggest aircraft lessor had filed a $3.5 billion lawsuit at London's High Court over its insurance claim for more than 100 seized aircraft  the largest claim by any lessor related to the conflict.

CDB Aviation has reported a value of 747 million yuan ($105.4 million) asset write-down in the month of August but unlike most other lessors  it did not write down the full value of its Russian seized jets  as it saw a ""high probability"" of repossessing them in the foreseeable future.

The leasing company is still actively communicating with Russian airlines to find effective ways to repossess the aircraft but that in a worse case scenario it may need to fully write down their value if it cannot get them back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzYW5kc3Rhci5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC8yMDIyLzExLzE4L3dvbHZlcmhhbXB0b25zLWxpZ2h0LWhvdXNlLWNpbmVtYS1tYXktcmUtb3Blbi13aXRoaW4tbW9udGhzLz9mYmNsaWQ9SXdBUjJvQUxaZWw4eEFiaW1oOFFJbG45M1BsSlBCRWVPcWNvaGEwQkhKVlp5ejRuNmJKb1NtemZ6bjJDd9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New offers to run Wolverhampton's Light House Cinema submitted weeks after venue closes,"The venue closed earlier this month after more than 30 years of trading with Wolverhampton Council saying it had provided £330000 of funding support over the last decade but debt levels were 'unsustainable'.

On Friday council leader Ian Brookfield said three expressions of interest had been made for the independent facility in the Chubb Buildings since the charity operators ceased trading.

But he said the offers were limited to re-opening the cinema only and not the bar and cafe which had ""significant debts"".

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is sending humanitarian aid to those affected by the recent rains in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. Some 200000 people have been forced out of their homes with at least 90 people dead and more than 130 missing.

The Brazil Area Presidency has assembled staff and resources to assist those affected by the floods. A letter sent to bishops and stake presidents from Elder Joni L. Koch Brazil Area President and his counselors Elder Arnulfo Valenzuela and Elder Mark D. Eddy all General Authority Seventies states that 21 meetinghouses are now being used as shelters for evacuated people and thousands of basic food packages provided by the Church to the state Civil Defense have already begun to be distributed to the population.

Missionaries from the Church helped unload emergency supplies from an Azul airplane at a military airport in the city of Canoas on Wednesday May 8. Working with Azul Airlines the Church is planning to send an aircraft from Saõ Paulo to Porto Alegre with supplies donated by the Church on Thursday May 9.

Other humanitarian aid initiatives are underway in close coordination with the government to help the community. The Church’s Welfare and Self-Reliance and Family Services departments are coordinating support and efforts to meet the needs of members as well.

Authorities consider the flooding the state’s worst-ever crisis caused by natural disasters.

News reports say some 80% of the population is without running water right now a week into the flooding. Many also do not have telephone or internet services.

The airport bus station and main roads are all blocked or closed going into the capital of Porto Alegre — and more than two-thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state are affected by the flood waters. Field hospitals have been set up to help those affected.

Social media posts on the Church’s Autossuficiência Brasil and Brazil Area accounts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also explain that the Church is responding to the disaster.

Thousands of essential items are being donated including basic baskets mattresses bedding and blankets hygiene kits cleaning kits drinking water personal protective equipment and tools.



These donations are being coordinated in collaboration with the State Civil Defense. Also local church leaders are coordinating efforts to help the community.

“[T]he Brazil Area office is mobilized to do everything possible to help and help the population of Rio Grande do Sul our dear brothers and sisters and friends at this time of great sorrow” the post said in Portuguese.

The post goes on to say that Church members who want to make donations to those affected by the calamity can do so through official government organizations that are coordinating donations through civil defense and social funds.

Some of the cities in Rio Grande do Sul — roughly the size Ecuador — were already suffering from at least three previous major floods in less than eight months.

The rains are expected to continue in the area along with high winds.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 100 tires left on church property as vandals strike again,"We’re Sorry!

Loneliness has reached epidemic levels in the United States. What can we do about it?

Note: For more information on loneliness view MSU Extension's Understanding America’s Loneliness Crisis video.



Imagine a condition that research has shown to be as bad for your health as physical inactivity obesity air pollution or smoking 15 cigarettes per day. This condition is connected to a 20% overall increase in the chance of experiencing an early death.

This health condition is not a disease virus or caused by a hazardous chemical. It is loneliness.

Who is most likely to be lonely?

A recent study conducted by Cigna found that over half of Americans are experiencing loneliness. This study found that underrepresented racial groups and people with lower incomes tended to be lonelier than their counterparts. Additionally roughly 80% of young adults (ages 18-24) reported feeling lonely which is twice as many as older adults above the age of 66. And nearly three times as many younger adults (ages 18-34) reported always feeling left out than adults over the age of 55.

What does it mean to be lonely?

There are many different definitions of loneliness. Generally speaking loneliness is a feeling that you lack meaningful and fulfilling relationships. Loneliness is a different experience than solitude or isolation. Someone can be surrounded by people but still feel lonely.

Most studies including the Cigna study use the evidence-based UCLA Loneliness Scale to measure loneliness. This scale asks 20 questions and respondents that finish with a final score of 43 or above are considered lonely. If you are curious about how you would score you can take a free online version of the test.

What can we do to combat loneliness?

Dr. John Cacioppo an expert in loneliness created the acronym “EASE” to help people combat feelings of loneliness:

E xtend yourself (safely). Dr. Cacioppo recommends finding opportunities to volunteer doing things you enjoy in your community.

eek collectives. Find others that enjoy similar things as you. Expect the best. It is important to maintain a positive outlook to counteract the negative mental effects of loneliness.

This framework provides a simple starting point for someone looking to address feelings of loneliness.

MSU Extension programs can also help reduce feelings of loneliness.

Michigan State University Extension offers many programs that can help you learn how to make effective action plans and develop new skills to combat loneliness such as mindfulness and tai chi.

An affidavit filed in Tarrant County Tuesday outlines a saga that began on Twitter where investigators said Rew struck up a relationship with David Tieman who “empathized with Rew’s story that her daughter needed help paying medical expenses.”

In the span of a year-and-a-half Tieman told investigators that he sent Rew approximately $1200000 mostly from his personal IRA along with a mutual fund checking and savings accounts cash advances and personal loans.

""Unfortunately online dating creates great opportunities for scammers” said Federal Trade Commission Regional Director Matthew Wernz.

Wernz said romance scams are on the rise costing Americans $1300000000 over the last five years. That's more than any other kind of fraud.

While the increase in cases is most striking for people ages 18 to 29 Wernz said the reported median loss is highest for those 70 and older.

""The numbers are so great that it really is a testament to how easy it is for someone to get lured into a romance scam even if they're not actively looking for dating opportunities online. Scammers often use really pressing needs that they have for money to convince someone of their needs” he said.

In this case the affidavit shows a text thread in which Rew asked for a total of $20000 for heart medication telling Tieman “Unless I don't get my meds I won't be around then.""

Tieman responded ""Ugh honey. I'm trying honey.”

He eventually sent her the money via Cash App.

It was just some of the hundreds of thousands he told investigators Rew said would be reimbursed by her insurance provider Cigna.

But according to court documents “A Cigna representative informed law enforcement officers that neither Rew nor her daughter had accounts from November 1 2019 through April 1 2022.”

Investigators also found that during that time Rew moved money for gambling visiting casinos in Oklahoma 324 times between December of 2019 and April of 2022 racking up millions in earnings.

Friday Tieman told NBC 5 he's been advised not to comment.

For others the FTC recommends people to never send money to those they haven't met to be leery of requests for credit card numbers wire transfers or cryptocurrency and to always talk with trusted friends.

“Oftentimes just the act of describing to someone else what it is that you're dealing with can help you realize that you're involved in scam” said Wernz.

Friday Rew’s attorney declined to comment.

The Tarrant County District Attorney’s office said it does not comment on ongoing cases.

On Thursday the Hamilton County Commission voted to accept $12 million in federal emergency rent and utility relief in order to relaunch the program. Beginning Monday Nov. 21 at 9 a.m. applications from those in the county can be submitted through 513Relief.org.

The county will pay for up to 15 months of rent — 12 past due payments and three future payments — and utilities for eligible renters who have experienced a financial impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a press release from the county the program is expected to help between 3000 and 3500 households with the new round of funding in place. Previously the program distributed $44.9 million in emergency rental and utility aid in the region.

“With winter weather upon us we know some Hamilton County residents are struggling to heat their homes and pay the rent” said Denise Driehaus Hamilton County commissioner. “Thanks to our partners at the federal level help is available.”

Who is eligible for this aid?

To apply for the program on 513Relief.org applicants need four things:

Current and/or past-due household bills for rent and utilities Income verifications like pay stubs for the past 30 days Details of the pandemic's financial impact Landlord vendor registration — checks are made directly to the landlords

Those who already received the full 15 months of rent assistance before the program was paused in July will not be eligible the county said.

Applications will be processed in the order in which the county receives them. Applicants will be contacted by the staff to submit their financial records and documents.

Payments will likely not be distributed until the start of 2023 though the county said applications should be processed within 30 days of filing.

For those who lack access to the internet or a laptop tablet or smart phone or individuals over the age of 60 help signing up for the program will be provided by the United Way of Greater Cincinnati Care Coordination team. To take advantage of that applicants can call 211 and request to speak to a care coordinator or text 211CARES to 51555.

I own my home and still need help — what should I do?

While this program is only available to renters living within Hamilton County there is still a mortgage and utility assistance program funded by the State of Ohio that can help those who own their own homes and still need assistance.

That program called Save the Dream helps to pay delinquent mortgage payments and/or future mortgage payments for up to six months.

The amount of assistance a household receives varies from household to household but up to roughly $25000 is available in mortgage assistance.

To qualify the household must primarily live in Ohio experienced financial hardship or loss of income related to the COVID-19 pandemic and have an income that matches the eligibility threshold.

Number of people in household 1 2 3 4 5 6 Max income 150% of area median income $103350 $118200 $132900 $147600 $159450 $171300

For those who do not qualify for this program the Hamilton County Commission has set aside funding in an American Rescue Plan to help keep homeowners from foreclosure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3RlbXBsZS9hcnRpY2xlL25qLXFiLW1hdXJpY2Utd2lsbGlhbXMtc2V0LWZvci10ZW1wbGUtZ2FtZWRheS12aXNpdC0xOTc4OTkyNjMv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly8yNDdzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UvdGVtcGxlL2FydGljbGUvbmotcWItbWF1cmljZS13aWxsaWFtcy1zZXQtZm9yLXRlbXBsZS1nYW1lZGF5LXZpc2l0LTE5Nzg5OTI2My9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NJ QB Maurice Williams set for Temple gameday visit,"Class of 2024 recruit Maurice Williams Jr. is regarded as one of the top dual-threat quarterback prospects in New Jersey.

Pendiri Negara Islam Indonesia (NII) Crisis Center Ken Setiawan menyinggung soal kelompok 'Polisi Cinta Sunah' terkait kasus terorisme yang diduga melibatkan anggota Polri di Lampung.

Diketahui Densus 88 Antiteror Polri menangkap dua anggota Polda Lampung karena diduga memasok amunisi senjata api ke kelompok teroris.

Ken mengatakan penangkapan ini membuktikan bahwa ada upaya infiltrasi kelompok teroris ke tubuh aparat. Tujuannya agar mereka memiliki akses persenjataan.

Ken menduga dua anggota Polda Lampung itu sudah bergabung di kelompok 'Polisi Cinta Sunah' jaringan Salafi Wahabi yang melakukan infiltrasi ke dalam tubuh aparat.

""Saat ini muncul fenomena unik di internal kepolisian dengan istilah Polisi Cinta sunah yang juga merupakan salah satu cara infiltrasi paham Salafi Wahabi ke tubuh kepolisian"" kata Ken Setiawan melalui sambungan telepon kepada CNNIndonesia.com Rabu (16/11).

Ken menyebut banyak polisi yang terpapar radikalisme karena belajar dengan guru yang salah. Menurutnya mereka juga keliru mengundang penceramah dan mengikuti tokoh-tokoh Salafi Wahabi.

Ken berpendapat bahwa fenomena 'Polisi Cinta Sunah' adalah benalu atau parasit di tubuh kepolisian. Mereka kelihatan rajin ibadah dan jargon memurnikan tauhid serta kembali kepada Alquran dan sunah.

Buntutnya banyak polisi yang tiba-tiba menyalahkan dan membid'ahkan masyarakat karena berbeda paham. Bahkan sampai mengkafirkan orang lain yang tidak sepaham dan akhirnya pada mengundurkan diri karena menjadi polisi dianggap bertentangan dengan hati nurani.

""Jumlah pengikut media sosial Polisi Cinta sunah yang sekarang berganti nama menjadi Pembelajar Cinta sunah mencapai sekitar 170 ribu orang (follower)"" ujar Ken.

Disampaikan Ken foto-foto anggota polisi bercelana cingkrang dan berjenggot yang awalnya menghiasi laman medsos (Instagram) kini sudah banyak dihapus diganti dengan konten hadist dan ayat-ayat kitab suci.

Ia pun khawatir jika fenomena Polisi Cinta Sunah tak dianggap sebagai ancaman maka bukan tak mungkin kasus yang ada di Polda Lampung juga bakal terjadi di wilayah lain.

Karenanya Ken menilai mesti ada antisipasi yang dilakukan oleh Polri terkait penyusupan gerakan radikalisme ini. Selain itu perlu ada ketegasan dari pimpinan Polri untuk melakukan pembinaan personel di lapangan agar tak terpapar paham terorisme.

Ken turut menyebut bahwa Polri harus melakukan skrining ke personel lainnya untuk mendeteksi secara dini apakah masih ada oknum polisi terlibat jaringan terorisme sehingga tidak mencederai dan merusak kepolisian.

""Pimpinan di tingkat Polri harus segera mengevaluasi paling tidak ada pembinaan bagaimana seorang aparat bermasyarakat. Paling utama yakni pembinaan tentang mental dan ideologi"" ujarnya.

Ken juga mengungkapkan ada berbagai latar belakang yang menyebabkan anggota kepolisian terpapar terorisme misalnya faktor pertemanan sampai belajar dengan guru yang salah.

Lebih lanjut Ken pun menduga bahwa dua oknum anggota polisi Polda Lampung dikabarkan ditangkap Densus 88 diduga merupakan jaringan lama.

""Tidaklah mungkin dia (oknum polisi) ini menyerahkan amunisi ataupun senjata api begitu saja dengan orang yang tidak jelas. Paling tidak dia sudah berafiliasi secara pemikiran lewat pertemanan dan adanya unsur kepercayaan"" tutur Ken.

Sampai saat ini CNNIndonesia.com belum mendapatkan pernyataan dari Densus 88 maupun BNPT terkait dugaan infiltrasi di tubuh aparat lewat grup cinta sunah itu.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQua29tcGFzLmNvbS9yZWFkLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvMTQzMzIxNTY2L2RhZnRhci1wZW1haW4tc2luZXRyb24tY2ludGEtYWxlc2hhLXdhamFoLWxhbWEtZGFuLWJhcnUtYmVyYWR1LWFrdGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daftar Pemain Sinetron Cinta Alesha Wajah Lama dan Baru Beradu Akting,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvbGEuY29tL3JhZ2FtL3JlYWQvNTEyNzM1OC80MC1rYXRhLWthdGEtY2ludGEtcm9tYW50aXMtYmlzYS1kaWphZGlrYW4tYmFoYW4tcmF5dWFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,40 Kata-Kata Cinta Romantis Bisa Dijadikan Bahan Rayuan - Ragam Bola.com,"Bola.com Jakarta - Kata-kata cinta romantis penuh makna bisa menjadi pengungkapan perasan yang mendalam.

Berikut koleksi kata-kata cinta romantis yang bisa jadi bahan rayuan dinukil dari Pinkvilla Kamis (17/11/2022).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpcHV0YW42LmNvbS9jaXRpemVuNi9yZWFkLzUxMjgwOTUvY2ludGEtYXRhdS1uYWZzdS1rZW5hbGktYmVkYW55YS1zZWJlbHVtLWphbGluLWh1YnVuZ2FuLWFzbWFyYdIBYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpcHV0YW42LmNvbS9hbXAvNTEyODA5NS9jaW50YS1hdGF1LW5hZnN1LWtlbmFsaS1iZWRhbnlhLXNlYmVsdW0tamFsaW4taHVidW5nYW4tYXNtYXJh?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cinta atau Nafsu Kenali Bedanya Sebelum Jalin Hubungan Asmara,"Liputan6.com Jakarta - Kita semua tahu bagaimana rasanya saat jantung berdetak saat bersama dengan seseorang yang dikagumi atau merasa disayang oleh lawan jenis. Itulah yang menjadi titik fokus kalian dalam sebuah hubungan.

Namun apakah perasaan itu sekadar nafsu atau cinta yang menggairahkan kalian? Bagaimana kalian bisa membedakannya? Sebagai permulaan ada banyak cara di mana cinta dan nafsu bisa tumpang tindih.

Nafsu bisa terasa sangat mirip dengan cinta terutama di awal hubungan ketika energi hubungan asmara baru selalu menggebu-gebu. Namun perasaan nafsu dan cinta juga memiliki banyak kualitas yang membedakan keduanya.

Menurut beberapa ahli sebagaimana dilansir Cosmopolitan pada Kamis (17/11/2022) nafsu didorong oleh keinginan untuk kepuasan seksual dan biasanya muncul sebagai dorongan yang kuat untuk mencapainya.

Karena intensitas itulah yang membuat orang bingung untuk membedakan nafsu dari cinta. Nafsu mendorong tubuh kita untuk menghasilkan lebih banyak hormon testosteron jadi ketika kita berada di sekitar orang ini kita merasa berenergi dan sangat terangsang secara fisik.

Berbeda dengan nafsu sederhananya cinta mencerminkan keterikatan emosional dalam hubungan romantis meskipun mencakup ketertarikan seksual namun tidak didefinisikan seperti nafsu.

Biasanya orang yang benar-benar jatuh cinta akan menghabiskan waktu untuk mengenal satu sama lain dengan melakukan hal-hal bersama.

Sementara itu ketika setiap pertemuan berubah menjadi aktivitas seksual kemungkinan besar itu adalah nafsu dan bukan cinta."

Cisco reported the restructuring this week saying it would affect about 5% of its nearly 80000-person workforce or about 4000 employees. However the company expects only a temporary reduction in the size of its workforce while trying to redistribute employees to other positions and hiring for unfilled ones a Cisco spokesperson said in an email.

""This really is a rebalancing"" said Cisco CFO Scott Herren during the company's earnings call with analysts on Wednesday.

Cisco will redirect its resources toward security and enterprise networking and accelerate its platform strategy Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said.

Cisco's broad security portfolio will position it to help enterprises reduce operational costs by switching from multiple vendors' products to Cisco's platform said Will Townsend vice president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.

""Security represents tremendous upside for the company given their footprint in large enterprises"" Townsend said.

Cisco's security products include Cisco+ Secure Connect Cisco Umbrella Duo Cisco SecureX and Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics according to Gartner analyst Frank Marsala. The Secure Cloud Analytics portfolio includes Secure Access Service Edge extended detection response zero trust and cloud security.

Cisco's enterprise networking products comprise its portfolio for data centers private and public clouds and the campus.

""It is not a surprise that Cisco wants to double down and improve its portfolio and the agility of the portfolio"" IDC analyst Rohit Mehra said.

Cisco will likely increase its focus on the Catalyst and Meraki products said Shamus McGillicuddy an analyst at Enterprise Management Associates. ""They are working hard to make all their networking products manageable via the Meraki cloud"" he said.

Cisco and its customers can benefit from more cloud-delivered products McGillicuddy said. For Cisco these products ensure recurring revenue through their subscription-based model rather than perpetual licenses. For customers they eliminate the installation and maintenance costs of on-premises products.

Cisco declined to specify which office spaces it would drop during the restructuring but confirmed that the company plans to move more toward a hybrid work model.

""Cisco is well positioned to lead the hybrid work transition and we continually evaluate our long-term workplace strategy to ensure alignment with key priorities and Cisco values"" the Cisco spokesperson said. ""This includes investing in collaborative hubs upgrading offices and in some cases reducing leased or owned office space to reinvest in other priority areas.""

Cisco expects revenue this quarter to increase by 4.5% to 6.5%. Last quarter revenue rose by 6% beating analyst estimates.

Helping Cisco's revenue increases was an easing of supply chain restraints that allowed the company to whittle down its order backlog Gartner's Marsala said. The company was also able to raise prices because of inflation.

""Backlog built during the tough supply issues prices raised now supply chain is easing so revenue is being recognized"" Marsala said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbW9vcmluc2lnaHRzLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvY2lzY28tZmxleGVzLWl0cy1pb3QtbXVzY2xlLWF0LXRoZS1pbmR5LWF1dG9ub21vdXMtY2hhbGxlbmdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco Flexes Its IoT Muscle At The Indy Autonomous Challenge,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbW9vcmluc2lnaHRzLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvY2lzY28tZmxleGVzLWl0cy1pb3QtbXVzY2xlLWF0LXRoZS1pbmR5LWF1dG9ub21vdXMtY2hhbGxlbmdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E61019E560>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbW9vcmluc2lnaHRzLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvY2lzY28tZmxleGVzLWl0cy1pb3QtbXVzY2xlLWF0LXRoZS1pbmR5LWF1dG9ub21vdXMtY2hhbGxlbmdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1zc3BhbGVydC5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXNjby1zZWN1cml0eS1idXNpbmVzcy11dG0temVyby10cnVzdC1hbmQtZHVvLWRyaXZlLWdyb3d0aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco Security Business: UTM Zero Trust and Duo Drive Growth -,"Cisco Systems' end-to-end security business grew 9% in the company's latest quarter driven by unified threat management and Zero Trust offerings -- including the Duo platform according to Cisco CFO Scott Herren.

Scott Herren CFO Cisco Systems

The comments -- which surfaced during Cisco's earnings call on November 16 2022 -- come at a key time for the networking company and its channel partners.

The backgrounds: Amid fierce competition from Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet (among others) Cisco shook up its security business in May 2022.

Fast forward to November 2022 and Cisco's top four priorities in the security market include:

Address product scalability and quality Focus on the experience Deliver a unified platform for the cloud Improve core security features.

Cisco Executive VP Jeetu Patel described progress on those four fronts during Cisco Partner Summit in early November 2022.

Cisco Security: Partner Opportunities

To win business today Cisco is calling on channel partners and MSPs to:

Secure and/or refresh the base with the new firewall capabilities. Sell the end-to-end story while positioning the resulting experience becomes a force multiplier. In addition to selling to CISOs sell to the security operations center team.

To stir customer demand and awareness Cisco is planning a $20 million “Secure the Enterprise” branding campaign.

Meanwhile Cisco's overall business appears to be holding up well despite Wall Street's concerns about a potential recession. For its Q1 of 2023 Cisco said:

Revenue was $13.6 billion up 6% compared to the corresponding quarter last year.

Net income was $2.7 billion down 10% from the corresponding quarter last year.

The figures generally beat Wall Street's expectations.

Cisco Layoffs 2022: Some Job Cuts Real Estate Reductions

Nevertheless Cisco is maintaining a sharp focus on cost controls. The company plans to cut about 5% of its staff -- or roughly 4165 employees -- while also cutting back on real estate holdings Silicon Valley Business Journal reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzExLzE4L2Npc2NvLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRlZC10aGUtcG93ZXItb2Ytc3RvY2stYnV5YmFja3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco Just Demonstrated the Power of Stock Buybacks,"The networking-technology titan is retiring millions of shares in 2022.

Networking-equipment giant Cisco Systems (CSCO -0.44%) reported results this Wednesday covering the first quarter of fiscal-year 2023. The company generated adjusted earnings of $0.86 per diluted share surpassing Wall Street's consensus earnings estimate of $0.84 per share.

Investors and analysts applauded Cisco's strong results and the stock price closed 5% higher on Thursday. However I don't see a ton of headlines mentioning one of Cisco's most shareholder-friendly qualities: The company is shoveling billions of dollars straight into the pockets of shareholders. I'm particularly impressed by Cisco's effective use of stock buybacks.

Cisco's buybacks make a difference

Fun fact: If not for the anti-dilutive effects of the buyback program Cisco would barely have satisfied the consensus-earnings target.

Cisco's adjusted net income increased by 2% year over year landing at $3.5 billion. At the same time the stock-repurchasing program reduced the share count by 12 million stubs in the first quarter. The canceled stock adds up to 127 million shares on a trailing basis which works out to a 3% reduction.

In a world where Cisco doesn't worry about share-count reductions this-quarter's earnings would have landed at $0.84 per share but only by the skin of its proverbial teeth. With three significant digits you'd be looking at earnings of $0.856 per share a rounding error away from missing the analyst target.

OK that's no surprise

The lower share count shouldn't surprise anyone especially since the bulk of this-year's buybacks fell in the second quarter of 2022. That period was covered in last-February's earnings update giving everybody nine months to update their earnings estimates accordingly. The exercise above is just a bit of calculator-based entertainment illustrating how generous Cisco's buyback program really is.

Cisco has invested an average of $1.1 billion per quarter in stock buybacks over the last three years. Dividend payments averaged $1.6 billion per quarter over the same period. That adds up to $1.69 billion of cash per quarter sent right back to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Free cash flows in this time span averaged $3.53 billion per quarter so the shareholder-bound cash returns consumed 48% of Cisco's average cash profits.

Cisco loves to share its cash profits with you the shareholder

This generous cash return is no accident. Cisco has a history of generating massive cash flow and sharing them freely with stock owners.

On the earnings call Cisco CFO Scott Herren said that the dividend-payout and buyback activity were ""in line with our long-term objective of returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders."" That's been an official Cisco policy since the fourth quarter of 2019 three years ago.

I love seeing this shareholder-friendly policy in a veritable cash machine such as Cisco Systems. Even in an off-year like 2022 the company amassed $12.8 billion of trailing free cash flows -- and sent half of it right back to shareholders.

Today Cisco's stock comes with a shrinking share count and a beefy dividend yield of 3.3%. You should expect the dividend payments to continue rising modestly over the years while buybacks are adjusted to meet that 50% cash-sharing ambition year by year. These qualities make Cisco a great buy for income investors who value a free-flowing stream of cash profits and a tight commitment to cash-based profit sharing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZS1uZXR3b3JrLmNvbS90ZWxlY29tL2Npc2NvLXBsYW5zLWN1dC01LXdvcmtmb3JjZS11bmRlci02MDBtLXJlc3RydWN0dXJpbmctcGxhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco lay off will impact 5% of workforce under $600M restructuring plan | Fierce Telecom,"Cisco unveiled plans to realign its workforce over the coming months to capitalize on key growth opportunities looking to strengthen its enterprise networking security and platform offerings. But the pivot won’t come cheap. The company noted in financial filings it expects to spend a total of $600 million on the move with half of that outlay coming in the current quarter.

The restructuring will include the shuffling layoff and hire of new talent and the slimdown of its real estate portfolio to reflect an increase in hybrid work. A company representative told Fierce the plan will impact about 5% of its workforce. As of July 30 2022 the company had approximately 83300 full-time employees meaning approximately 4100 people will lose their jobs.

But the representative noted Cisco will be hiring for other roles and expects to end its current fiscal year with “roughly the same” number of employees as it had at the start.

“This decision was not taken lightly and we will do all we can to offer support to those impacted including generous severance packages job placement services and other benefits wherever possible” the representative said. The job placement assistance will include doing “everything we can do” to help affected employees step into other open positions at the company the representative added.

Cisco similarly implemented a restructuring plan in mid-2020 which included a substantial number of layoffs.

While the representative declined to disclose what departments would feel the most impact this go around Cisco CFO Herren and CEO Chuck Robbins stated on an earnings call on Wednesday the company is looking to put more resources behind its enterprise networking platform security and cloud-based products.

During the call Herren urged analysts not to “think of this as a headcount action that is motivated by cost savings. This is really a rebalancing.” He added that in an ideal world the company would simply be able to move employees from one area to another but the reality is that there will be some degree of skills mismatch.

Between severance real estate-related and other costs Cisco said in a financial filing it expects the restructuring to cost a total of $600 million. Around $300 million of that will be spent in its fiscal Q2 2023 which roughly aligns with calendar Q4 2022. Another $200 million will be spent in the 2H of its fiscal 2023 (roughly the first half of calendar 2023) with the remaining $100 million coming in the first quarter of its fiscal 2024 which should cover August through October of 2023.

Earnings

The restructuring announcement came as Cisco reported results for FQ1 2023 covering the three months ended October 29 2022. Consolidated revenue of $13.6 billion was up 6% year on year but net income fell 10% to $2.7 billion.

By product Secure Agile Networks revenue was up 12% to $6.6 billion End-to-End Security grew 9% to $971 million and Optimized Application Experiences increased 7% to $193 million. Sales in Internet for the Future fell 5% to $1.3 billion Collaboration was down 2% to $1.08 billion and Other Products revenue plummeted 47% to $2 million. Services revenue was flat at $3.39 billion."

Merrill Wealth Management

Mega financial institution Citigroup has big goals under CEO Jane Fraser to transform itself into a leading wealth management shop along with a big problem: Rival Merrill is poaching some of its top advisors in the Tri-State area.

A team of four advisors managing a collective $1 billion of client assets has left Citi Private Bank to join Merrill Wealth Management a move staggered over the past two months a Merrill spokesperson said in an email. The change was first reported by AdvisorHub on Nov. 14 citing an unnamed source.

The advisors did not immediately respond to a request for comment; Citi declined to comment.

Frank Falco who leads the former Citi group as managing director will be based out of Merrill's office in Great Neck New York. The other advisors — senior vice presidents Kevin Condon John Huber and Alexandra Maksimow — will work from a location in Stamford Connecticut.

Falco's team will focus on serving ultra-high net worth and high net worth clients including executives and business owners according to a press release shared in an email by a Merrill spokesperson.

The Great Neck branch of Merrill specializes in multi-generational wealth and business owners and the Stamford office has expertise in retirement planning concentrated stock positions traditional investments and estate planning according to descriptions on the branches' respective websites.

The departures follow Citi Private Bank's loss over the summer of another high-profile team managing $8 billion of client assets in nearby Greenwich Connecticut. The team included Stephen Lillis David Rabideau and Lauren Spirelli and wealth management specialist Steven Calderon Barron's reported at the time.

Citi private banking veteran Nisha Jhaveri also made the leap to Merrill in October. According to a LinkedIn post from last week she will be based out of the Greenwich branch as well.

The moves come as CEO Fraser moves to hire 500 advisors in the next three years as part of the bank's wealth management push with a focus on cultivating ties with a niche segment of early-career consultants accountants and private equity workers in its new Wealth at Work program . While this program has been successful so far logging a 6% year-over-year growth in revenue during the third quarter of 2022 the Private Bank unit which suffered the loss of advisors to Merrill reported a 13% decline in revenue from the second quarter and a 10% revenue drop year-over-year according to a press release last month.

In September Fraser acknowledged that bankers commuting in the Tri-State area which comprises New York New Jersey and Connecticut were uncomfortable with coming back to the offices in New York as pandemic-area restrictions eased and employers attempted to lure employees back. In statements to the House Financial Services Committee Fraser said she understood that workers were unhappy with the rising cost of commuting into the city. She added that Citi was considering opening offices in New Jersey and Connecticut to make it easier for them or expanding work-from-home privileges. It's unclear if this was a factor in the recent moves.

Andy Sieg the president of Merrill Wealth Management said in comments to reporters last month that despite the ongoing attrition of veteran brokers amid a highly competitive labor market this year the wirehouse is going on the offense with hiring mostly for young talent but also for experienced brokers.

""We have a highly differentiated offering and platform"" Sieg said. ""There is no organization that we compete with that can make a similar claim to be able to fully serve the needs of high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients across investing of course but [also] broad financial planning banking lending and more.""

According to a media release American Banker has partnered with Best Companies Group to identify banks that excel at creating positive and supportive workplaces for employees. Citizens Bank is the only Arkansas bank to be named on the list. As challenges for employee retention and hiring continue to impact businesses across the country the Arkansas-based company is continuing its legacy in the industry of having a people-centric philosophy.

This year Citizens Bank earned a spot in the ranking of Best Banks to Work For based on an anonymous employee survey and a thorough review of the benefits and perks offered. The full 2022 Best Banks to Work For list will be featured at www.americanbanker.com.

“We are honored to be recognized nationally for our ‘People First’ mission and culture” said Adam Mitchell president and CEO of Citizens Bank. “This year marks the first time Citizens has been recognized as one of the Best Banks to Work for by American Banker. We are the only bank in Arkansas to make the list. We are proud of this accomplishment but even more proud that we continue to foster a culture that supports and advances our employees.”

On the 2022 list Citizens Bank was ranked in the category for banks with less than $3 billion in assets. The annual Best Banks to Work For survey and awards program is designed to identify and honor banks with the best cultures for helping employees thrive.

“The banks recognized on this list are trying hard to create workplaces that employees want to join” said Chana R. Schoenberger Editor-in-Chief of American Banker. “Especially during this moment when companies are experiencing a shift in how where and how much employees work banks are paying attention to how they can best retain their people.”

Determining the Best Banks to Work For involved a two-step process. The first consisted of evaluating each participating bank’s workplace policies practices and demographics. This part of the process was worth approximately 25% of the total evaluation. The second consisted of employee surveys aimed at assessing the experiences and attitudes of individual employees with respect to their workplace. This part of the process was worth approximately 75% of the total evaluation. The combined scores determined the final ranking.

To be considered for participation banks had to have at least 50 employees working in the U.S. and been in business for a minimum of one year. Best Companies Group managed the registration and survey process and also analyzed the data to determine the final ranking.

But in true Lydia Ko fashion she found some magic at Tiburon Golf Club birdieing 8 of her next 14 holes to post a 7-under 65 and take the early lead in the year’s final event. The 65 is Ko’s lowest first-round score in the CME Group Tour Championship and ties her second-lowest opening round of the season. It’s just the third time this year that she’s recorded a first-round score of 65 or better – she last opened with a 65 at the Trust Golf Women’s Scottish Open where she ultimately finished in a tie for fifth – and Ko was proud of her ability to bounce back after that bogey on the first something that other players may have considered a bad omen.

“Not the start that I had envisioned going to sleep yesterday but I knew that there was plenty of golf to be played” Ko said. “No matter what circumstances I think with the wind being up today it was going to be a tough stretch of holes to start. So I wanted to not get too caught up with how I started and stay patient out there. I think that's going to be a big key this week. It's 72 holes. The LPGA's top 60 players are here this week so you know there's going to be so much good golf. You're just trying to play as good golf as the others.”

Ko won the CME Group Tour Championship back in 2014 when she defeated Carlota Ciganda and Julieta Granada in a playoff with a par on the fourth extra hole. It’s been a long nine years since that victory and Ko has evolved both on and off the golf course. But the same competitiveness remains and with Rolex Player of the Year honors Vare Trophy and a $2 million winner’s check on the line you can bet Ko will continue to attack Tiburon Golf Club and give it her all over the next 54 holes.

“I think when you come to a golf course where you've played for quite a bit you are able to gauge that you're going to have some of those good days and bad days but I'm hoping to kind of bring it all together” said Ko. “The last time I won here was in 2014 nine years ago and a lot of things have happened since then. I think the level of play has kept getting better and better in my time on Tour. So I know that if I did exactly the same thing I may not be the one holding the trophy in the present. So I'm just trying to play the best golf I can. I think that's all I can do. I just want to focus on me and just play without any regrets.”

Thailand’s Pajaree Anannarukarn and major champion Danielle Kang are in a tie for second after carding a matching 6-under 66s. Kang was bogey-free on day one at Tiburon hitting 14 of 14 fairways and 13 of 18 greens and the 66 is now her lowest first-round score in the CME Group Tour Championship. As she looks ahead to the next three rounds Kang will continue to focus on the swing changes she’s been working on with longtime coach Butch Harmon tweaks that have made a world of difference for the six-time LPGA Tour winner since her return to competitive golf in August after undergoing treatment for a tumor on her spine.

“I've been working on a lot of different mechanics with Butch and I know he's simplified a lot of things.

I have a bunch of notes written on my glove because I can't remember the basics of it but when I do it correctly I miss it in the right places” said Kang. “I'm having more opportunities. I know it's just Thursday but I'm really happy that I put a really good round together today. So taking it day by day.”

Anannarukarn became a Rolex First-Time Winner at last year’s ISPS Handa World Invitational in Northern Ireland when she defeated Emma Talley in a playoff. Though she said that Thursday’s blustery conditions were certainly challenging playing in the wind helps her to focus harder. “Not going to lie but I find it a little challenging whenever you play in the wind windy conditions” said Anannarukarn. “I feel like what I try to do just to try to stay focused on every single shot that I can. Especially when it's strong wind or gust wind. Just really try to stay concentrated.”

Two players sit in a tie for fourth at -5; Rolex First-Time Winner Gemma Dryburgh and 2022 LOTTE Championship presented by Hoakalei winner Hyo Joo Kim who is playing for the first time in the United States since the Kroger Queen City Championship presented by P&G in September. Seven players are tied at -4 most notably Rolex Women’s World Golf Rankings No. 1 Nelly Korda 2021 AIG Women’s Open winner Anna Nordqvist and 2022 Amundi Evian champion Brooke Henderson.

The country music superstar performed Nov. 16 for about 2000 people at Tiburón Golf Club as part of the CME Group Tour Championship. Several hundred Southwest Florida first responders were among those who attended the private two-hour concert thanking them for helping after Hurricane Ian devastated communities Sept. 28.

""The man has a true passion to help others"" Terry Duffy said of Urban. “When I called him about coming this year I didn’t even give him the date and he was in.”

Duffy who has a home in Naples is chairman and CEO of the Chicago-based CME Group the largest futures exchange in the world.

CME Group and its top clients representatives and patients from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis Tennessee also attended the concert. CME Group donated a total $200000 to local charities the Collier County Foundation and Collier County 100 Club to assist with local rebuilding efforts following Ian.

CME Group along with hosting the golf event for more than a decade hosted the Global Financial Leadership Conference. The GFLC held at The Ritz-Carlton Beach Resort has been canceled in recent years because of the pandemic and the hurricane this year. The last one was in 2019 and CME Group plans to return the GFLC to Naples in 2023.

Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have been among the speakers who addressed CME Group investors who flew in from throughout the globe to attend the annual gathering along the Gulf of Mexico shore.

And this wasn't Urban's first visit to Naples. The musician along with his fellow Australian-born wife Nicole Kidman were in town for the last GFLC in 2019 to attend a private nearly $3000-a-plate dinner for CME Group members titled ""From Hollywood to Honkytonk: An Evening with Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban.""

The celebrity power couple also visited Naples in 2012 when they were spotted walking along Fifth Avenue South and took in a ""Spider-Man"" movie at Hollywood 20 in North Naples (now called Regal Naples).

Duffy pointed out how Urban performed a concert in 2020 at a drive-in theater near Nashville for frontline workers after the pandemic hit.

“He’s a dear friend and great human being and his wife is the same"" Duffy said.

Naples Fla. — Lydia Ko is in total control at the halfway mark of the CME Group Tour Championship.

Total control of the season-long scoring and money races too.

Ko shot a 6-under 66 in Friday’s second round of the LPGA Tour’s season finale pushing her to 13 under for the tournament and five shots clear of Hyo Joo Kim through 36 holes.

Ko made four birdies in a six-hole stretch midway through her round rolled in a testy 4-footer to save par on the par-4 13th to maintain what was then a four-shot lead and hasn’t dropped a shot since her opening hole on Thursday.

Her flawless round capped a big day for the LPGA which unveiled its 2023 schedule with a record-setting $101.4 million in purses earlier Friday.

Ko's 66 was the best score of the day; four other players shot 67's. Through two rounds at Tiburon there have been four scores of 66 or lower; Ko has two of them after an opening 65 on Thursday.

Kim (69) made back-to-back birdies on 16 and 17 to get to 8 under alone in second. World No. 1 Nelly Korda (69) is in a pack tied for third at 7 under along with Japan’s Nasa Hataoka (67) Sweden’s Anna Nordqvist (69) and Scotland’s Gemma Dryburgh (70).

Korda was making a move on the front closing her first nine with three birdies in a four-hole stretch. But she made nothing but pars on the back nine.

Ko entered the week with a one-point lead in the race for LPGA Tour player of the year. She needs to avoid just all-out disaster on the weekend to win her second consecutive Vare Trophy for having the year’s lowest scoring average. Those titles would move her closer to the LPGA Hall of Fame.

And with $2 million the biggest single prize in women’s golf awaiting the winner that means the money title is within her reach as well.

Ko is now averaging 68.964 this year. Atthaya Thitikul's average for the season is now 69.447. It would take about a 40-shot swing between them on the weekend for Thitikul to catch Ko in that race.

And if Ko wins the tournament she’d push her earnings for 2022 to $4364403 and virtually lock up the money title as well.

PGA Tour

Dubai United Arab Emirates — Rory McIlroy hopes his strong finish Friday at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship is a good sign for the weekend.

The top-ranked McIlroy who leads the Race to Dubai standings went birdie-birdie-eagle on this final three holes for a 4-under 68 that left him seven shots back of co-leaders Matt Fitzpatrick and Tyrrell Hatton at Jumeirah Golf Estates.

“It was nice to finish with a flourish there and put myself a little closer to the guys going into the weekend” said McIlroy who is bidding to be the European tour’s leading player for the fourth time in his career.

Fitzpatrick's 67 puts him at 12-under 132 overall to not only share a three-shot lead with Hatton after two rounds but also keep him out in front in the Race to Dubai.

“I’ve played two good rounds to start with to put myself in position” the U.S. Open champion said. “Just keep doing more of the same and see where it gets me come Sunday.”

Fitzpatrick would clinch a first Race to Dubai title with a third win at the World Tour Championship provided McIlroy or Ryan Fox don’t finish the event in second. A second-place finish would also be good enough for Fitzpatrick if McIlroy finishes lower than seventh.

Fitzpatrick had six birdies and a bogey at the 12th hole on the Earth Course where he is a two-time winner. Hatton's 67 included eight birdies and three bogeys.

Adri Arnaus and Alex Noren are three strokes off the lead. Jon Rahm and Jorge Campillo are a further shot back.

Fox who is second in the points table to McIlroy shot a 72 and was in 37th place after two rounds.

McIlroy's brilliant approach shot set up his eagle on the par-5 18th. He described his first 33 holes as “very mediocre golf” but said “something sort of clicked.”

He's not sure what.

“I'm not sure but whatever it is I need to bottle it for the weekend” the Northern Irishman said. “You never know that finish here on Friday could be key to something that happens over the next 36 holes.”

McIlroy is trying to win the FedExCup and Race to Dubai in the same year for the first time having won each event on three occasions. His last Race to Dubai title came in 2015 having also won it in 2012 and 2014.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJpc2submV0L2Rlcml2YXRpdmVzLzc5NTUyMTYvc3RpY2stb3ItdHdpc3QtY21lLXJldGFpbnMtZmNtLWFwcGxpY2F0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stick or twist?

This is an important milestone in preparation for the physics runs with lead-lead collisions that are planned for 2023 and the following years of Run 3 and Run 4. In lead-lead collisions each of the 208 nucleons of one of the lead nuclei can interact with one or several nucleons of the other lead nucleus.



The CERN ion injector complex has undergone a series of upgrades in preparation for a doubling of the total intensity of the lead-ion beams for the High-Luminosity LHC. Achieving this goal requires a technique called ""momentum slip-stacking"" to be used in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) where two batches of four lead-ion bunches separated by 100 nanoseconds ""slip"" to produce a single batch of 8 lead bunches separated by 50 nanoseconds.

Representatives of Labcorp talk with Purdue veterinary student Kyle Barron of the DVM Class of 2026 at the PVM Career Fair.

A cavernous room filled with representatives of a variety of veterinary companies greeted Purdue DVM and veterinary nursing students when they arrived at the 2022 Purdue Veterinary Career Fair. The event was held Friday November 11 in the Purina Pavilion at Creighton Hall which is just about a block west of the College of Veterinary Medicine.

A total of 53 veterinary enterprises were represented at the fair including small and mixed animal veterinary clinics and a research company. Nearly 165 students turned out to interact with the businesses. “We were hopeful to provide a meaningful opportunity for students to engage with employers” said Director of Student Services Jamie Richards. “For those students early in their veterinary education this was a chance to develop relationships that can lead to summer opportunities and potentially the first step in their careers.”

Richards said the veterinary practices that participated praised the good attendance which they said was better than what they saw at other career fairs they had attended. They also noted that the students seemed excited and they appreciated that they were able to talk to a lot of students with a good mix of veterinary nursing and DVM students.

The 2022 PVM Career Fair proved to be a great success attracting nearly 165 students and more than 50 employers.

Richards said students mentioned that they appreciated the more spacious venue compared to the Veterinary Medical Library in Lynn Hall where the event had been held in past years. “They felt it was not as crowded and they could carry on conversations with employers” Richards said. Looking ahead he said they hope to see more large animal practices participate in the future.

Even though the event was moved out of Lynn Hall Richards said the student participation exceeded expectations indicating the walk down Harrison Street to the new venue was not a deterrent. “And I think we have opportunities for improvement and growth next year.” Richards also thanked Paige Allen RVT assistant director of academic advising and recruitment and Marisela Mercado Shippam senior administrative assistant for Student Services for their creativity organization and leadership in setting the event up and veterinary student Caitlyn Gunther of the DVM Class of 2025 and her SAVMA Purdue Practice Connect team for serving as hosts and assisting with check-in.

The IT services heavyweights filed complaints with the GAO on Oct. 31 over NSA’s FocusedFox contract which covers the agency’s need for network and exploitation analyst services that will support its next generation analyst framework.

As a result of the bid protests NSA will reevaluate all proposals and make a new source selection decision federal agency sources told FedScoop. GAO dismissed the protests on Nov. 14 because of the corrective action being taken.

The FocusedFox contract is intended to provide the agency with analysts who have a deep understanding of adversary networks network defenses and cyber network operational capabilities.

Booz Allen and Leidos argued the agency did not properly evaluate proposals and also challenged the agency’s cost evaluation while Leidos also said the NSA conducted an improper best-value determination.

This is the second major multi-billion dollar contract won by CACI that has been challenged in the past year.

Example video title will go here for this video

Our team traveled to Laredo Texas where questions arise about whether enough is being done as we see a record number of overdoses.

There are just not enough resources to go around.

Some illicit substances have even been found in machinery parts according to border control.

“Our overdoses are up 100% from last year. Fentanyl is very real” Saenz said. ""It’s got to be stopped and the key is the border.”

But what isn’t unique is that this town of 300000 people is battling the same problem as many other cities across the country.

“Laredo does 60% of Mexico's trade...40% trade with the U.S. and Mexico” Saenz said.

“The river doesn’t divide us. It really connects us” Saenz said. The Rio Grande is just 200 feet wide between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo Mexico. It’s what makes this town unique.

They welcome the on-flow of trains trucks cars and even walkers heading over the bridge from Mexico.

“What makes Laredo so important too is we’re the number one land port. We are number one land port in the nation in terms of trade” Saenz said.

Saenz was born and raised here. Many locals have never left.

“Nuestra is power. Our story is power” said Mayor Pete Saenz as he walked the streets of downtown Laredo highlighting the culture that can be seen around every corner.

Ninety-five percent of the people who live there are Hispanic. A bulk of them are Catholic. The only thing that separates the town of 300000 people from Mexico is the Rio Grande River.

In just the past few months the Laredo Field Office area which is comprised of eight ports of entry from Brownsville to Del Rio seized enough fentanyl that could kill everyone in the state of Florida. The latest data obtained by 10 Investigates shows five times as much fentanyl has been seized by border patrol in 2022 than in 2019.

“We’ve seen all types of drugs here in Laredo. We’ve seen it in tires in equipment itself floors ceilings the commodity. Recently we had one with broccoli and cabbage. We have meth hidden within the boxes. We’ve found drugs in machinery parts and automotive cabs” Vasquez said.

They are also working to keep narcotics like fentanyl out.

“On a typical day you’ll see the bridge half full. We are making sure U.S. consumers get their goods on time” Vasquez said.

The agency is in charge of overseeing and inspecting the shipments coming into the country.

“There are 10000 trucks daily crossing from Laredo Texas. The only thing separating us from Mexico is that bridge right there” said Assistant Port Director Javier Vasquez with U.S. Customs and Border Protection .

That’s why 10 Investigates headed 8 miles north from downtown Laredo to the World Trade Bridge where we met exclusively with border patrol officers.

Fentanyl is making its way from China to Mexico and then moves across the border into the U.S.

Some illicit substances have even been found in machinery parts according to border control.

“The more people the more technology we have will help us with the smuggling come across from the border” Vasquez said.

He says they will never say no to more resources.

“We have to have that balance. The time it takes to install them we have other officers out there dogs the old technology. The other tools we have go hand in hand” Vasquez said.

But that takes time. The next phase of the four machines could take more than a year to construct.

“Laredo is one of the test beds. The next phase is for us to have four additional machines at pre-primary area. We will eventually have 15 machines so every single truck and everything is 100% scanned” Vasquez said.

At the World Trade Bridge port where there’s one machine there are 15 lanes truckers can drive through.

But the problem is there’s only one of these machines in Laredo. One other is in Brownsville Texas. There are 50 crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border. That’s where officers are checking automotive parts groceries and other items that are part of the trade economy.

“They sit here and can take a look at what’s inside so we don’t have to unload the trailers which is time-consuming and we have to find a balance where we don’t slow down the drivers and the trade coming in” Vasquez said.

“When the driver passes through the MEP the low dosage of energy is on the driver. The high energy is on the trailer itself. We have shipments of machinery so for steel items we need something that can penetrate steel and look inside. This high-energy we can see what’s inside"" Vasquez said.

After trucks drive through the first point of entry the ones that are flagged are then sent to the second point which is the MEP machine. It uses multi-energy technology X-rays to check cargo similar to what’s used to screen baggage at airports.

The Assistant Port Director says the brand-new technology at the World Trade Bridge Port of Entry is a Multi-Energy Portal (MEP) system. The FORTUNE 500 company Leidos has a $480 million contract to integrate the systems at sites across the U.S.

“I know CBP is investing a lot of money in technology especially here at the World Trade Bridge” Vasquez said.

While there have been a record number of seizures we are still seeing a record number of overdoses so we asked if enough is being done to stop this drug from coming into our communities.

There are just not enough resources to go around.

Stopping the fentanyl epidemic : ""...It takes a full community effort.""

Because once it makes it across the border it can make its way to Tampa Bay in just 19 hours. Once fentanyl hits the streets it takes the equivalent of less than five to seven grains of table salt to make someone overdose. A salt shaker’s worth of fentanyl could wipe out entire populations like Venice Haines City or Tarpon Springs.

The number of drug overdoses in Florida involving synthetic opioids increased from 2837 in 2019 to 4734 in 2020 according to CDC data.

Here’s why experts say we are seeing more fentanyl coming into the U.S. from Mexico. Let’s start with a report from the Brookings Institution a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington D.C. with more than 300 policy experts from all across the world.

Their researchers found prior to 2018 China was a direct supplier of fentanyl shipping the finished product to the U.S.; however China changed how it classified the drugs in 2019. That’s when the chemicals started going to Mexican cartels and as a result the drug is smuggled into the U.S.

According to the CDC the U.S. is in a third wave of overdoses. The first wave of drugs included prescriptions in the 1990s. Then it was heroin in the early 2000s and starting in 2013 the next wave was synthetic opioids like fentanyl.

Former DEA Acting Administrator Uttam Dhillon says Mexican drug cartels have what they need to produce the drug. He says these groups are the biggest threat to the U.S. and believes they should be considered terrorist organizations. He also says fentanyl should be considered a weapon of mass destruction and shared the same sentiments with Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody. Back in October Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd blamed cartels for the agency’s largest fentanyl bust.

According to the DEA the two main cartels responsible for fentanyl are the CJNG and the Sinaloa. Both are based in Mexico. Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman was once Sinaloa’s cartel leader. He made headlines in the U.S. when he was sentenced to life in prison for dozens of drug-related charges.

According to the public policy research organization Cato Institute more than 86 percent of convicted drug traffickers in 2021 were U.S. citizens. The group looked at data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission on federal convictions. Cato researchers say they are subject to less scrutiny so Americans are able to more easily smuggle drugs. Cato also found more than 90 percent of seizures occur at legal crossing points or checkpoints.

10 Investigates Reporter Jennifer Titus sat down with Mike Furgason the DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge at the Tampa District Office to talk about how fentanyl comes from the border and into our community. He says there needs to be a multi-layered approach to stop the fentanyl epidemic:

“I think it takes a full community effort. DEA believes that our education programs our enforcement and our communication with our state local counterparts and combining with state and local counterparts will be successful. But the most important thing we have to do is attack those organizations"" Furgason said. ""There are two organizations responsible for fentanyl coming into the United States. It’s CJNG and Sinaloa both based in Mexico and they've been stalwarts of drug trafficking organizations for a very long time. And it's gonna take a full attack on those organizations both domestically and internationally to dismantle them.”

In a 2020 intelligence report the DEA said Mexican Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) are diversifying their sources of supply. It shows the flow of fentanyl from China or India to Mexico or Canada where it’s being smuggled into the U.S.

Parents should be aware that a study published earlier this year in the JAMA shows three-quarters of teen overdose deaths last year involved fentanyl. That’s why Furgason recommends checking out the emoji decoder on the DEA’s website. It's part of the agency’s One Pill Can Kill campaign. In addition to how fentanyl gets to the streets in the Tampa Bay area Furgason talked to 10 Investigates about rainbow fentanyl and what parents need to look out for with their kids.

“There’s some very specific terms very specific measures that we can look at to see whether we’re moving the needle” Brig. Gen. Jeffery Valenzia the U.S. Air Force Advanced Battle Management System Cross-Functional Team lead said Nov. 16 at a C4ISRNET event.

The benchmarks include data on how technologies speed or slow decision making how many errors are introduced the variance among available options and potential weak spots or pitfalls.

“We can look at variance. What happens with a very low-skill battle manager as opposed to a high-skill battle manager within the same operational scenario? Can I develop tools that help us to level that out?” Valenzia said. “We can look at vulnerabilities. If I’m creating a kill chain that’s dependent upon a single node that’s highly vulnerable to either kinetic or non-kinetic suppression well then I’ve created a fragility in the system.”

Put simply he said it’s all about “performance delivery.”

RELATED

Valenzia’s remarks come as some analysts express concerns about JADC2 alignment among the services and lawmakers seek clarity on overall progress and price. The brigadier general dismissed the idea that the Army Air Force and Navy aren’t closely collaborating on the effort calling it a “convenient argument that’s not reflective of what’s really happening.”

An early version of the annual defense bill included a review of JADC2 implementation with staff saying the provision is not meant to be punitive but rather guide the application of future resources. The legislation has yet to clear the House and Senate.

The military services each have their own contributions to JADC2 which aims to seamlessly link forces and databases across land air sea space and cyber. The Army has Project Convergence. The Navy has Project Overmatch. And the Air Force has the Advanced Battle Management System which Valenzia is intimately involved with.

“JADC2 is about war fighting. It’s really about combined arms. It is an age old problem really approaching it in a unique manner” Valenzia said at the C4ISRNET event. “The methodology that we’re going after is taking advantage of the fact that we have information systems that can connect us in ways of which are really unique to this time. And because of that we have the ability to share insights knowledge across the battlefield.”

The Air Force in September selected five companies to aid its development of ABMS as the service’s secretary Frank Kendall acknowledged efforts to modernize command and control systems are more challenging than expected.

L3Harris Technologies Leidos Northrop Grumman Raytheon Technologies and Science Applications International Corporation together known as the the ABMS Digital Infrastructure Consortium will work on secure processing resilient communications open-ended designs and other digital challenges to JADC2.

The five are all among the 40 largest global defense firms ranked by revenue totaling some $100 billion earned in 2021 according to a Defense News analysis.

“The rationale behind it is a consortium-based approach which is not to go to a single vendor who develops a solution set that sometimes comes with some restrictions on how you can scale it in the future” Valenzia said. “Instead it’s to take these high-performing companies — who have the resident expertise in the complexity of what we’re trying to do — to drive a collaborative transparent infrastructure approach so that we not only can deliver the warfighting capability today but we can scale it into the future.”

The New York Times citing unnamed sources reported Friday that the investigation’s focus is whether Live Nation Entertainment constitutes a monopoly and has taken unfair advantage of its market position with its practices. The probe has involved DOJ Antitrust Division staff reaching out to parts of the music industry including venues and ticket sellers according to the outlet.

FOX Business reached out to the DOJ and a Live Nation Entertainment representative for comment on the report but neither responded by publication.

TAYLOR SWIFT TICKETMASTER DEBACLE SPARKS CALL FOR HEARINGS BY SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR

Live Nation Entertainment was formed in 2010 when ticket seller Ticketmaster and concert promoter Live Nation combined. At the time the DOJ hinged its approval of the combination on Ticketmaster licensing its software to two firms and divesting certain segments as well as the new company agreeing to not retaliate against venues that choose not to use its services according to a press release.

The DOJ and Live Nation Entertainment agreed to extend by over five years and amend the agreement in 2019 after the entertainment company faced accusations of repeatedly breaching the original terms. The new agreement included ""additional safeguards to ensure Live Nation does not punish venues that want to work with competing ticketers"" according to the DOJ at the time.

Live Nation Entertainment and Ticketmaster have been facing heightened scrutiny this week over handling of ticket presales for Taylor Swift’s upcoming ""The Eras"" tour. However the antitrust probe apparently started well before Swift's ticketing issues according to The New York Times.

TAYLOR SWIFT TICKETS SEE HUGE DEMAND AMID REPORTS OF TICKETMASTER SITE CRASHING DURING PRESALE EVENT

Presales for Swift’s tour opened Tuesday with many fans waiting hours in the online Ticketmaster queue to purchase tickets or wind up empty-handed. Some customers reported experiencing issues while attempting to score seats and others complained about prices and fees Forbes reported.

Ticketmaster issued a statement about the Swift presale event Thursday saying that a ""staggering number of bot attacks as well as fans who didn’t have invite codes drove unprecedented traffic"" to its website according to NPR.

It took steps such as pausing or delaying queues for certain time zones to accommodate the high demand as well as scheduling the Capital One-specific event. The company said that customers bought over two million tickets in one day the outlet reported.

Ticketmaster on Thursday canceled the general public sales of Swift's concert tickets slated to start Friday morning over ""extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory to meet demand.""

Swift writing on her Instagram Story on Friday said she was ""trying to figure out how this situation can be improved moving forward"" and ""not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them multiple times if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could.""

TAYLOR SWIFT'S NOSEBLEED SEATS COST OVER $1K TICKET PRICES SKYROCKET FOLLOWING TICKETMASTER SALE CANCELATION

""And to those who didn't get tickets all I can say is that my hope is to provide more opportunities for us to all get together and sing these songs"" she also said.

Amid customers reporting presale issues for Swift tickets politicians such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. David Cicilline criticized the company. Some targeted Live Nation Entertainment’s 2010 merger and made monopoly accusations.

Klobuchar said Thursday and Friday that she planned to hold a hearing about Ticketmaster before the end of the year.

Live Nation Entertainment said in its most recent annual report that it sold a total of over 282 million tickets through its systems in 2021. In 2019 before the pandemic it sold over 485 million according to the filing.

Hours-long wait times platinum ticket pricing and site glitches resulting from completely unprepared and overloaded website servers made for a hellish ticket-purchasing experience for fans. But Maffei claims that the fault isn’t on Live Nation or Ticketmaster but on the incomprehensible demand. The singer he suggests is simply too famous – in fact she’s apparently famous enough to fill 900 stadiums on presale alone.

“The Live Nation team is sympathetic to the long wait times and fans who couldn’t get what they wanted” Maffei told CNBC. “Reality is it’s a function of the massive demand that Taylor Swift has. The site was supposed to be opened up for 1.5 million verified Taylor Swift Fans. We had 14 million people hit the site – including bots another story which are not supposed to be there. And despite all the challenges and the breakdowns we did sell over 2 million tickets that day. We could have filled 900 stadiums.”

Liberty Media CEO and Live Nation chairman Greg Maffei responds to the Taylor Swift ticket fiasco: “I apologize to all our fans. We are working hard on this.” https://t.co/C8ATt6B2Kn pic.twitter.com/4bePfAtdxz — CNBC (@CNBC) November 17 2022

Maffei went on to explain that Swift’s Eras tour isn’t even a Live Nation-promoted event. “Interestingly AEG – our competitor who is the promoter for Taylor Swift – chose to use us because we are in reality the largest and most effective ticket seller in the world. Even our competitors want to come on our platform.”

A spokesperson for AEG Presents Live Nation’s biggest competitors in the concert promotion space and the owner of numerous venues across the country said “Ticketmaster’s exclusive deals with the vast majority of venues on the Eras tour required us to ticket through their system. We didn’t have a choice.”

This paired with the chairman’s insistence that the presale was derailed by demand (“This exceeded every expectation”) for Swift’s first tour in four years (“That’s caused a huge issue”) feels like a major deflection in the face of the scrutiny Ticketmaster and Live Nation have faced not only from ticketless fans or those who feel robbed by platinum markups but from politicians who may be in a position to interfere with their dominating monopoly on concert ticketing and promotion. Editor’s picks

“Daily reminder that Ticketmaster is a monopoly its merger with LiveNation should never have been approved and they need to be reigned in” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted earlier this week. Shortly after Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) penned a letter addressed to the Live Nation Entertainment CEO highlighting a lack of competition in the live music industry.

“Ticketmaster’s power in the primary ticket market insulates it from the competitive pressures that typically push companies to innovate and improve their services” she wrote. “That can result in dramatic service failures where consumers are the ones that pay the price.” Trending 'Word Salad': Andrew Huberman's Cannabis Claims Slammed by Experts Brian Wilson Placed in Conservatorship as Daughters Win Consultation Rights Megan Thee Stallion Strikes Again With New Single 'BOA' See Taylor Swift Perform 'Fortnight' 'But Daddy I Love Him' at The Eras Tour in Paris

The nightmarish and at times anxiety-inducing experience of purchasing tickets is not unique to Swift’s Eras tour. On-sale for Harry Styles’ Love on Tour prompted similar responses from fans who were unable to purchase tickets after long wait times or were instead met with Ticketmaster’s dynamic-based official platinum prices marked up by hundreds of dollars by the time they were able to select tickets. The same occurred when Billie Eilish announced the Happier Than Ever world tour and is likely to happen again when Beyoncé eventually (hopefully) unveils dates for the Renaissance tour.

In early November President Joe Biden tweeted saying he had called on his administration to crack down on hidden junk fees often found in concert ticket sales but as Live Nation and Ticketmaster’s market domination continues hidden fees are the least of live music fans’ concerns."

Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and NVIDIA today announced a collaboration to build an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Earth Observations Digital Twin that will provide the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with an efficient and centralized approach to monitor current global environmental conditions including extreme weather events.

The two companies expect to fully integrate and demonstrate one of the variable data pipelines — sea surface temperature — by September 2023 one year after initial contract award.

Presently NOAA receives terabytes of data about its five earth systems domains — the cryosphere land atmosphere space weather and ocean — from numerous space and Earth-based sensor sources. NOAA administrators and researchers have to collect combine and analyze that information to observe and understand environmental conditions and changes.

The new Earth Observations Digital Twin — developed under contract with Lockheed Martin Space working with NVIDIA — will provide NOAA with a high-resolution accurate and timely depiction of global conditions using current satellite and ground-based observations.

For the project Lockheed Martin’s OpenRosetta3D™ platform will utilize AI and machine learning (ML) to ingest format and fuse observations from multiple sources into a gridded data product and detect anomalies. NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus the collaboration and database engine of its Omniverse world simulation platform will convert data into the Universal Scene Description framework enabling data-sharing across multiple tools and between researchers. Agatha a Lockheed Martin-developed visualization platform will ingest this incoming data from Omniverse Nucleus and allow users to interact with it in an Earth-centric 3D environment.

“At Lockheed Martin we regularly use digital twins and AI to provide our government customers with the clearest current situational picture and actionable intelligence for their important missions” said Matt Ross senior program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. “We’re pleased that we can use our technology experience to collaborate with NVIDIA on this project to provide NOAA a timely global visualization for their own important missions.”

“Digital twins will help us solve the world’s hardest scientific and environmental challenges” said Dion Harris lead product manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. “The combination of Lockheed Martin’s AI technology with NVIDIA Omniverse will give NOAA researchers a powerful system to improve weather predictions at a global scale.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toZWVkbWFydGluLmNvbS9lbi11cy9uZXdzL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMjIvZi0zNS10cmFpbmluZy1zeXN0ZW1zLWtlZXAtcGlsb3RzLW1pc3Npb24tcmVhZHkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F-35 Training Systems Keep Pilots Mission Ready,"Before any pilot straps into the single seat 5th Gen fighter they achieve qualification through nearly a year of training within classroom and simulated environments.

That's about to change.,"Correction: A previous version of this story misinterpreted a BAE Systems statement.

FORT WORTH Texas — On a mile-long production line in Fort Worth Texas the next wave of the U.S. and allied militaries’ F-35 Joint Strike Fighter fleets takes shape.

Dozens of nascent fighters coated almost entirely in sea-green primer work their way north through Air Force Plant 4 a government-owned facility operated by manufacturer Lockheed Martin. They begin their journey here as a pair of wings hanging from blue platforms on the southern end. Along the way Lockheed employees — the entire site has about 17000 workers — add the engines cannons tails rudders lift fans canopies landing gear sensors and other components that make the Lightning II the most advanced fighter jet ever made.

Plant 4 is also where Lockheed Martin has faced significant challenges from labor and supply chain shortages spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic to the recent discovery that a key magnet in a subcontractor’s part had for years been made with an unauthorized China-sourced alloy.

In an interview with Defense News during a Nov. 2 visit to the plant Edward Smith Lockheed’s director of F-35 domestic engagement said the company is on track to start delivering the first Lot 15 fighters in late 2023 and it’s a few years away from making up the production losses caused by the pandemic.

Recent economic turmoil complicated and prolonged the contract negotiating process for lots 15 through 17 but Lockheed expects to sign a final agreement by the end of the year.

“Think about what was happening when we were finalizing the [2021] budget [proposal] — it was pre-COVID” Smith said. “Since then we’ve gone through a worldwide shutdown of the supply chain. … We’ve seen inflation that we haven’t seen since the ’70s. … We had suppliers that are so uncertain about their supply chain that some of them were unwilling to predict out further than six months on what their costs were going to be.”

Now several years of declining per-unit prices — the cost of an F-35A steadily decreased from $89 million in Lot 11 to nearly $78 million by Lot 14 — are about to come to an end. The lower quantity of purchased fighters the pandemic and the addition of more capabilities will cause the price of an F-35 to rise in the coming lots Smith said.

“You’re adding capabilities you’re buying more of a jet now” he explained. “Your prices are going to go up a bit. You can’t [get the price lower] by cutting 100 airplanes out of a lot buy.”

From Liberator to Lightning II

The walls of Air Force Plant 4 have seen decades of history. It began operating 80 years ago under Consolidated Aircraft a Lockheed predecessor turning out B-24 Liberator and B-32 Dominator bombers to fight in World War II. Over the years other aircraft produced here have included the sweep-wing F-111 Aardvark the F-16 Fighting Falcon and parts of the F-22A Raptor.

Scenes from the James Stewart movie “Strategic Air Command” were filmed on the flight line. And the Texas Historical Commission in 2008 designated the site a historical landmark for its role in World War II. This limits how much Lockheed Martin can modify the plant’s structure though the company has learned to adapt.

Today this is Lockheed’s primary site for producing the F-35 — the only facility that turns out all three variants of the fifth-generation fighter over three shifts operating around the clock usually five days a week. A handful of F-35s are also built in Italy and Japan. The fighters built at Forth Worth will eventually go to U.S. Air Force Navy and Marine Corps units as well as allies such as the U.K. Denmark Norway Belgium and Israel.

The entire site totals 1 mile and 25 feet and it covers 7.5 million square feet — about the size of 130 football fields. About 4000 employees work in the main construction facility with the remainder in other areas.

Dozens of wings hang in pairs — as many as 33 pairs — on the southern end of Plant 4 where they are joined to a center structure. They are then mated to other fuselage sections made by Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems before moving onto the final assembly area where components both large and small are added and fastened into place.

When an F-35 is finished its nose gear is hooked to a tow bot that wheels the aircraft through the front of the facility where it is taken to another building to test structural durability. Then the F-35 is moved to another humidity-controlled final finishing facility where twin robots dubbed Zeus and Thor apply stealth coating.

That’s how the process usually works. But when the coronavirus pandemic hit in early 2020 it forced Lockheed Martin to make several adjustments on the fly.

COVID and other curveballs

Lockheed began changing its F-35 production line operations during the first few months of the pandemic moving to shore up its supply chains and adjust work schedules.

COVID-19 quickly took a bite out of the F-35′s production schedule — an area where Lockheed is still playing catch-up. The company originally planned to deliver 141 fighters in 2020 but realized that spring it simply wasn’t going to happen. The contractor eventually produced 120 that year.

Because much of Lockheed’s F-35 supply chain is sourced in the U.S. Smith said it was largely able to avoid the worst of the crunches that affected other parts of the defense industry such as shipping bottlenecks at backed-up ports.

But Lockheed wasn’t entirely immune. For example BAE Systems builds the F-35′s aft fuselage in Lancashire England. The U.K. had stricter COVID-19 lockdowns than America which hindered production Smith said.

“One of the biggest supplier effects was labor” he explained. “People just weren’t allowed to go to work for some of our suppliers.”

In a statement to Defense News BAE Systems said its F-35 production work in the U.K. resumed in April 2020 after a temporary pause.

A slowdown in F-35 construction was inevitable according to Smith. But it wouldn’t last forever and the company didn’t want to lay off skilled experienced employees it would need when work picked back up.

“With that backlog [from the U.K.] we saw it coming” Smith said. The company realized “they’re going to start back but there’s going to be a gap because everybody shut down for a while. So how do we [manage the slowdown]? You don’t take a workforce of 17000 employees and tell them to go home.”

Lockheed decided to “stretch the work we have” Smith said. The company sat down with its employees’ union the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 776 and they hashed out an adjusted work schedule — one that would allow F-35 construction to continue while allowing for easier social distancing during the pre-vaccine months of the pandemic.

From May to early September 2020 Lockheed Martin divided each of its F-35 shifts at Fort Worth into three groups which then worked on a two-weeks-on one-week-off schedule.

By the end of the summer Smith said BAE had worked through its supply issues and normal work could resume at Fort Worth without any layoffs or loss of pay or benefits. A union spokesman told Defense News its members too saw the alternate schedule as a success.

Absenteeism during the pandemic was unavoidable Smith said. At its peak in February 2021 the absentee rate almost doubled compared to pre-pandemic levels. But a year later it had largely subsided. From January 2021 to April 2022 Lockheed added about 700 employees to the line to make up for absences and ensure it could meet demand the company told Defense News.

Lockheed also took steps to keep its suppliers — particularly smaller firms — operating during the tumultuous period Smith said. “There’s a lot of mom and pop shops out there that if contracts stop coming they’ve got about three months and then they’re out of business.”

Lockheed adopted a so-called forward-funding strategy of paying them three or four months early. In March 2020 the Pentagon upped progress payment rates to large businesses like Lockheed from 80% to 90%. Lockheed said it in turn forwarded those payments to its own supply chain. In 2021 the contractor said it averaged about $400 million in accelerated payments each week to its suppliers particularly small and vulnerable businesses.

Smith said this allowed Lockheed’s smaller subcontractors to buy long-lead parts — items that take a long time to produce or deliver — knowing there would be business waiting when the parts arrived.

In early 2021 Lockheed also began striking long-term agreements with suppliers which Smith said helped mitigate some of the effects of inflation.

Lockheed spokeswoman Laura Siebert said finding savings in the supply chain process will be key to keeping costs down for lots 15 through 17 which will produce about 375 F-35s. That’s about 100 fewer than the 2019 deal for the previous three lots.

“With the lower [production] numbers we were still able to beat inflation metrics [in the] cost” she said. “You’ll see that in 15 through 17. And a lot of it has to do with supply chain [savings].”

Lockheed was able to cut per-tail costs to about $78 million for Lot 14. From now on Smith said the cost of each F-35 is likely to increase because of inflation lower quantities and added capabilities. Lot 15 jets are to be the first to come with Technology Refresh 3 already installed — a series of upgrades to the F-35′s hardware and software meant to improve its displays processing capability and memory.

Smith said these improvements will allow the fighter to store and process more data as well as provide the “backbone” for the upgrades that will make up the F-35′s Block 4 modernization effort.

Block 4 will include the ability to carry more weapons better recognize targets and conduct advanced electronic warfare. Smith said the F-35 is on track for 75 major upgrades that will introduce about 518 capabilities without changing its outer skin.

After the worst of the pandemic’s crunch passed Lockheed ramped up its production. By 2025 the company expects to be back on schedule.

Last year the contractor delivered 142 fighters beating the upper end of its yearly goal by three. In 2022 the company is on track to produce 148 to 153 F-35s. In 2023 Smith said the production rate will probably be about the same as this year as the company works to overcome lingering supply chain issues. Some of those problems are related to the war in Ukraine which has affected European raw material suppliers.

“Supply chain problems are going to cascade for the next several years” according to Smith.

In subsequent years he added “our intent is to continue to ramp” up production. In a re-baseline agreement for the F-35 program struck in September 2021 Lockheed agreed to start delivering 156 F-35s a year from 2023 onward.

Right now Lockheed is wrapping up production of Lot 13 F-35s and the company expects to deliver much of the remaining Lot 14 fighters in the first half of 2023.

The firm is already starting production of Lot 15 at the Fort Worth factory and deliveries are expected to begin in the second half of 2023.

Lot 16 and 17 fighters will follow and Smith said some sub-suppliers are already starting preliminary work on some parts that will go into Lot 16.

‘A wrestling match’

Once construction ends completed F-35s prepare for their first flight by Lockheed Martin test pilots. For the F-35B the short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing variant flown by the U.S. Marine Corps test pilots also take the fighters up for a short hover.

Four or five fighters are flown each day on average sometimes more said test pilot Brian “Banski” Bann who flew Harriers for the Marine Corps. But clear skies are a must for these acceptance flights Bann noted so they don’t fly when it’s cloudy.

At first the test pilots take an F-35 up to about 15000 feet for a relatively shorter flight to check its engine Bann said. At that height he added if the engine malfunctions it’s still possible to glide back down.

And then the test pilots can really take the F-35 for a spin: a supersonic flight test at 35000-40000 feet that can last 1 hour and 45 minutes pushing pilots to their G-force limits and leaving them drenched in sweat.

“It’s like being in a wrestling match” Bann said.

At the north end of Plant 4 a newly assembled F-35A waited just inside the open hangar doors as about a half-dozen employees gathered around.

This fighter will soon be the Air Force’s 361st F-35A. It’s destined for RAF Lakenheath in England where the service is setting up its first permanent F-35 squadrons in Europe. In years and decades to come it will likely be flown on patrols in and around Europe perhaps engaging in combat.

But on this day some employees slowly walked around the aircraft scanning the ground for rocks or other debris that could damage the fighter.

A younger worker cautiously guided the tow bot wheeling the F-35A pulling the fighter into the sunlight for the first time. It was this employee’s first time controlling the robot and when he was done his colleagues gave him a smattering of applause.

“He did good” a manager said.

Inc. both reported year-over-year growth in online sales for Home Depot’s fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 30 2022 and Lowe’s ended Oct. 28 2022. Despite rising costs due to inflation consumers are investing in home projects — and both do-it-yourself and professional customers continue to shop.

Home Depot reported a profit of $4.34 billion Q3 2022 up from $4.13 billion in Q3 2021. Meanwhile Lowe’s reported a profit was $154.00 million down nearly 91.9% from $1.89 billion a year earlier. In 2021 Lowe’s sold its Canadian business to Sycamore Partners for $400 million resulting in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $2.1 billion on Lowe’s Q3 earnings results.

Net sales were up for the first time since January 2022 at $23.48 billion. That’s up from $22.92 billion for the comparable period a year earlier. net sales increased 2.4% in Q3 2022 to $23.48 billion compared with $22.92 billion year over year.

And while customers for both Home Depot and Lowe’s made fewer transactions in Q3 average order values grew. A sign that while prices are higher consumers are willing to make the investment said Jeff Kinnaird executive vice president merchandising at Home Depot according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.

Home Depot Q3 earnings 2022

For its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 30 Home Depot reported online sales grew 10.0%.

Net sales increased 5.6% at $38.87 billion. That’s up from $36.82 billion for the comparable period a year earlier. Net earnings increased 8.2% to $4.34 billion. That’s up from $4.13 billion for the year-ago period.

Additionally Home Depot fulfilled 50% of online orders through its stores.

For the nine months ending Oct. 30 Home Depot net sales grew 5.3% to $121.57 billion. That’s up from $115.44 billion a year earlier. Net earnings for the period were $13.74 billion up 5.1% from $13.08 billion for the year-ago period.

CEO Ted Decker said despite inflation and rising interest rates “our customer has remained resilient and engaged” according to the transcript. “Customers are still spending lots of time at home. We’re not all back at work five days a week. These homes continue to age and they’re worth 40% more than they were pre-pandemic.”

Decker highlighted the retailer’s Pro and do-it-yourself (DIY) customer growth. Home Depot’s B2B Pro business sells to professional home improvement and other contractors.

As more homeowners plan to invest in the homes they already own as mortgage rates climb Richard McPhail chief financial officer said it’s a shift to an “improve in place” mentality.

Home Depot and Lowe’s could benefit from an aging housing marketing says Brian Yarbrough an analyst at financial investment firm Edward Jones.

“We think the demand and the tailwind for the housing market remains positive over the next three to five years” Yarbrough says. While the outlook remains positive Yarbrough said he expects growth to slow in 2023 due in large part to inflation.

“As inflation continues to outpace wage growth at some point it has to cut into consumer spending” he says. Consumers will likely look where they can cut back on non-essential purchases which could trend toward cutting back in the home improvement category Yarbrough says.

Lowe’s earnings Q3 2022

Lowe’s reported its online sales increased 12.0% year over year for its fiscal third-quarter ended Oct. 28.

“Our Lowes.com sales grew 12% this quarter four times our U.S. growth rate representing a sales penetration of 10%” said CEO Marvin Ellison according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. Ellison said the retailer will continue to enhance the online user experience as well as its fulfillment capabilities.

Strong appliance sales drove the majority of Lowe’s 12% increase in online sales said Brandon Sink chief financial officer according to the Seeking Alpha transcript.

The retailer noted its focus on enhancing omnichannel fulfillment capabilities. Joe McFarland executive vice president of stores said the retailer is on track to decrease shipping times 50%. Lowe’s also began offering same-day delivery nationwide with Instacart now supporting more than 1700 stores.

Net sales were up for the first time since January 2022 at $23.48 billion. That’s up from $22.92 billion for the comparable period a year earlier.

For the nine months ended Oct. 28 Lowe’s net sales was $76.61 billion. That’s a slight decrease from $74.91 billion for the comparable period in 2021. Profit was $5.48 billion down from $7.23 billion a year earlier.

Fulfillment retail strategies at Home Depot and Lowe’s

Both Home Depot and Lowe’s cited omnichannel options for customers as parts of their fulfillment strategies. Lowe’s announced it will open a new coastal holding facility in the port city of Suffolk Virginia. And Home Depot noted during its earnings call that half of its online orders were fulfilled in stores.

The pandemic prompted many large retailers to offer alternative ways to receive merchandise. Offering in-store or curbside pickup paid off for Digital Commerce 360 Top 1000 retailers in 2020. Those that offered such options grew collectively online by 50.3% in 2020 versus 30.2% for those that did not.

60% of both Home Depot and Lowe’s ecommerce orders were picked up in stores in 2020.

Edward Jones’ Yarbrough expects ecommerce growth rates will continue to grow albeit at a slower rate compared to the pandemic boom of 2020.

“I expect growth rates to stay somewhere in the single high and low double digits” he says. “We’ll continue to watch that. I still expect a sizeable amount of the orders will be picked up in store — which is nice because that’s a better profit [for the retailer] than to have to ship it directly to people.”

Home Depot earnings

For the fiscal quarter ended Oct. 30 Home Depot reported:

Online sales grew 10% compared to a year ago.

Net sales increased to $38.87 billion. That’s up 5.6% from $36.82 billion for the comparable period a year earlier.

As the holiday season rapidly approaches many people are going to be breaking out their ladders and toolkits to decorate their eaves with sparkling Christmas lights. Christmas lights in general were created in the late 19th century to prevent the fires commonly caused by putting real candles on trees per Christmas Light Source. Outdoor-safe Christmas lights were invented a few decades later in 1927 which have long since solidified themselves as a holiday season décor staple.

Choosing Christmas lights is half of the battle though. Between trying to decide how many lights you'll need and what shape size and color to choose the whole process can very quickly become overwhelming. Then comes the price — it can cost anywhere from an extra $20 to as much as $500 a month per every 100 light bulbs according to PG&E.

The newest launch of the company’s updated paid membership program called Lululemon Studio combines the company’s popular interactive smart mirror streaming classes in-person workouts and discounts on your favorite apparel.

This software upgrade not only comes with live and pre-loaded classes from Lululemon’s 15 professional trainers on the pricey in-home Mirror hardware but also includes new workouts from eight studio partners representing everything from high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and boxing to yoga and meditation to barre and dance. And for those who want the choice of the IRL experience mixed in with their virtual exercise the membership offers 20% off classes at those studios’ locations as well as free classes in Lululemon stores.

I spent a few weeks trying out all Lululemon Studio has to offer and it’s an impressive package of interactive and live workouts as well as a nice discount on all that expensive gear. But is it worth the promotional starting price of $795 (normally $1495) plus a $39/month subscription? Well it depends what you’re looking for.

Here’s what you should consider before you go all-in on Lululemon Studio.

Lululemon Studio A great home gym mirror lululemon If you're looking for a mirror-based home gym solution with tons of great workouts (and a cheaper price than most competitors) the Lululemon Studio is well worth it. $1495 From $795 at Lululemon

What we liked about it

The Mirror is compact and decor-friendly

Tobey Grumet/CNN

The actual Lululemon Studio Mirror device which looks like a sleek everyday full-length mirror isn’t new — the company acquired the popular Mirror platform in 2020. But it was my first time using one in my home. Though I was worried I wouldn’t have the space to work out correctly once I propped the Lululemon Studio against the wall and plugged it in I was thrilled to find that my cramped area was roomy enough for all the classes I tried. And best of all since the Mirror sits right behind my desk I didn’t have to worry that folks on the other end of a video call might notice that my gym is also my office.

I decided to lean the Mirror against the wall with its carbon steel frame but you can opt to have it mounted during delivery. The whole thing weighs 70 pounds which means that while you can move it around the house you probably won’t want to. But I can also attest to migrating it from the original spot I chose to another room — though I did need a hand carrying it.

Easy setup

Setup was so simple I had to wonder if I missed something. First you’ll need to download and create an account on the Lululemon Studio app (available on both iOS and Android). Then just plug it in press the power button at the bottom and you’ll be greeted by a full HD 43-inch display. It will then walk you through pairing it to your Wi-Fi connecting to your phone and syncing your device to the app.

Because the Mirror is not a touchscreen you will have to use the app to control it. At first I thought this would be less efficient but quickly realized that since everything is in my home I wouldn’t have to worry about stuff like my phone dying. And because it connects to its own Wi-Fi you can put it in a room with a slower signal or even in a Wi-Fi dead zone.

For those who already have a Mirror and want to upgrade to Lululemon Studio you’ll just have to update the app and the software on the device.

New studio partners (and instructors) are fun and eclectic

Tobey Grumet/CNN

Now that I was ready to go I was psyched to check out the new workouts.

No doubt about it. I miss live fitness classes. Before the pandemic I took at least three classes at my gym per week. But then I got used to working out virtually and just heading down to the gym in my building and that’s a wrap. Lululemon Studio embraces the sensation of live classes even more than my experience with Peloton. Maybe that’s because the way it’s filmed and shown on the Mirror is like the instructors are in the room with you rather than just following them from a broadcast studio. Plus you’ll still be able to see yourself in the Mirror alongside the trainers just like a real studio class.

The eight studio partners are Dogpound for cardio Aarmy for bootcamp Y7 and YogaSix for yoga classes Forward_Space and AKT for dance Pure Barre for barre and Rumble for boxing. I started with the dance classes because that’s what I miss the most and I could sweat off over 500 calories during a 50-minute Forward_Space class without even thinking about it. In fact I had a blast and it was super easy to follow the moves even in my small space.

Next I tried the yoga class. I will admit I’ve never been a yoga fan. I’m that person in the back of the class with one eye open when we’re all supposed to be “looking inwards.” So it was with great pleasure that I tried YogaSix which offers Power Yoga and Sculpt + Flow classes set to upbeat music. I started with a Beginner Power class and enjoyed it so much I went to intermediate the next day. I liked that it kept me motivated to follow the moves with banging tunes and I didn’t have to pretend to be spiritual (not that there’s anything wrong with it).

I was also pleasantly surprised by the Rumble classes. There happens to be a Rumble studio around the corner from my apartment and I’ve always wanted to check it out but never got to it before the pandemic. I tried a 30 minute Boxing + HIIT class and I had SO MUCH FUN while nixing nearly 400 calories. The instructor kept me involved focused and inspired and you better believe I was dripping sweat when it was done. And with the 20% off live classes I may just get to the studio yet.

There are too many classes to specifically discuss (over 10000 on-demand streamable classes with 60+ types of fitness from beginner to expert) but I can honestly guess it would be impossible not to discover something you enjoy. I even found my old ballet slippers and took an intermediate classic ballet class (ouch). The fact is no matter what type of class you want to try it’s probably here in some form.

Easy app and tight-knit community

Tobey Grumet/CNN

If you’re going to hop on the virtual workout train you’ll need an app that won’t confuse the heck out of you. The Lululemon Studio app lays everything out clearly and the Home screen lets you choose a target for your weekly workouts and then plainly shows your progress. Here you’ll also see new classes browse the eight studio partners check out what the community is digging and save your fave classes under My Shortcuts. A Time Savers area shows 15-minute classes for a quick hit and below that you can even get information on booking a personal training session for $40 per 30 minutes. These use The Mirror’s built-in microphone for two-way audio and the front-facing camera (which comes with an optional physical cover if you’re worried about privacy) for interaction.

Elsewhere in the app you can more broadly peruse classes via Genre Channels Programs and Collections; see a calendar of all the live classes; and get a better breakdown of your Activity (including a color-coded heart rate chart calories burned and a Health Score that encompasses Heart Muscle and Recovery). You can scroll to the settings to invite up to five household members to share your membership as well.

One thing I did not expect to appreciate as much as I did was the Lululemon community. I could log in at any time to start a class and see hundreds of members’ icons (including username picture and age) scrolling on the bottom without the pressure of a super-competitive leaderboard. I don’t know why but it felt strangely comforting to know that I wasn’t the only one werking it and I could go at my own pace without feeling badly about myself.

What we didn’t like about it

No app-only option

Tobey Grumet/CNN

I get it Lululemon you want to sell hardware. But to be honest as much as I like working out with the Mirror I could just as easily take those classes on my phone or even stream them on a TV — especially since there’s no touchscreen. For those of us with smaller spaces or like me with a gym in my building it would be much easier to pay a monthly subscription fee for the app. I didn’t splurge for a pricey Peloton product during Covid-19 but I was still able to take unlimited classes with a monthly software subscription — which was life-saving during lockdown.

When I spoke to Mike Aragon CEO of lululemon Digital Fitness at the Lululemon Studio launch event he suggested that the company would consider allowing an app-only subscription sometime next year.

How it compares

Mirror workout products are a hot commodity and Lululemon has some competition — though at this time they are most definitely the lowest-cost option at the promotional price of $795 and offer the best variety of classes. The nearly $4000 Tonal comes packed with a 24-inch touchscreen as well as built-in weights and cables for a full body workout while the 24-inch interactive screen on the Tempo Studio uses AI paired with 3D technology to better mimic a personal trainer for $2495 (there’s also the $395 Tempo Move if you want a more affordable option that uses your TV as the screen). The newest addition to the mirror-based fitness products is the $2495 Forme Studio which includes access to streaming Barry’s Bootcamp classes and is focused on offering a “personal fitness concierge” to help you train one-on-one through the interactive touchscreen hardware.

In the end for the promotional price you’re missing out on more-advanced hardware including a touchscreen larger screen and AI and swapping it out for a plethora of fun well-produced classes. But since Lululemon has not announced when it will push The Mirror back to its original $1495 it feels well worth it at its promotional price.

Bottom line

For many of us daily fitness regimes have changed drastically since Covid-19. Getting back to the gym may not be on everyone’s list — especially if you’ve gotten used to working out at home. Mirror-based fitness products are fun easy to set up and certainly trendy but Lululemon has added an extra layer to its offering with Studio’s eight new partners and 15 trainers.

The mix of classes is well-curated and in addition to getting back to stuff I love like dance I was highly engaged with things I wouldn’t bother trying under other circumstances like yoga and boxing. Plus I can take these classes anywhere — though I do wish there were a lower-cost option for just the app-based subscription.

For the promotional price of $795 (the full price is $1495) you can try the Mirror for 30 days risk-free. Yes it’s pricey if you add on the monthly subscription but so is a gym membership so it depends on what you want to get out of it. And if you don’t love exploring these classes and trainers as much as I do Lululemon will pick it up for free for a full refund.

Not bad for a well-rounded home gym experience a good-looking full-length mirror and a nice discount on your premium Lululemon gear.

And obviously the third Fortress/VLSi trial resulting in another near-billion-dollar award splashed the headlines. The District of Delaware was busy uncovering the story behind IP Edge/Mavexar LLC and how they run and control their subsidiaries and it’s even more interesting than I thought it was; though of course it hasn’t stopped entities like those run by Jeffrey Gross from continuing to roll out filings. More below.

On Remand from AAPA Decision Qualcomm Claims Confirmed Unpatentable: In a decision following an appeal that drew a concurrence the Board panel again cancelled all challenged claims of Qualcomm’s U.S. 8063674 patent. The Federal Circuit vacated the Board’s underlying decision arguing that they “incorrectly interpreted § 311(b)’s ‘prior art consisting of patents or printed publications’ to encompass [applicant admitted prior art (AAPA)] contained in the challenged patent.” But the Federal Circuit found the use of the AAPA is permissible and remanded and left the door open to consider whether the AAPA formed the “basis” of the challenge. Another non-AAPA ground was affirmed.

In the decision the Board noted that the Director issued updated AAPA guidance on June 9 and considered it as superseding the earlier guidance. It relied on the statements therein to note that as long as the AAPA does not form the “basis” of the challenge it is permissible by the language of the statute. Apple argued it simply supplied additional limitations and details thought conventional and that the rejections were based and relied on another prior art reference not in dispute; Qualcomm argued the opposite. The Board sided with the petitioner and found the additional limitations taught by the AAPA consistent with the Federal Circuit’s and Office’s current interpretation of their rules. The concurring judge tersely noted they did not believe analysis was necessary at all given the clear Director’s Updated Guidance.

IP Edge/Mavexar Hearings Mandamus Request: If you’re not following the IP/DE blog here you should. It detailed a series of hearings last week on disclosure requirements that all seemed to reveal that IP Edge and its three principals have been running a business whereby they cold-call private citizens with little to no Internet presence offer them a passive 5% of any proceeds from a patent assertion campaign and then set them up as the sole owner and controlling party of an LLC—at least legally. Then per testimony from last week IP Edge (or their other alter ego Mavexar) control all litigation decisions. See here for more. Data shows that more than 500 lawsuits are filed annually—as much as a sixth of all U.S. patent suits per annum—by IP Edge entities set up this way. Mavexar has intervened and filed a writ of mandamus to the Federal Circuit to try and stop what it has called a “judicial inquisition.”

This is the first strategic investment made by WM in textile recycling. Leveraging Debrand's expertise and technology WM expects to offer new textile recycling capabilities and provide circular solutions across North America. The investment will help Debrand grow. The terms of the investment agreement were not disclosed.

Debrand specializes in reverse logistics for the fashion and retail industry. The company is headquartered in Vancouver Canada and its customers include Lululemon Athletica Canada Goose Aritzia Kit and Ace IKEA Canada and Everlane.

""We work with our customers to unlock the highest value for their products by extending the products' life through reuse or recycling"" says Amelia Eleiter co-founder of Debrand. ""Not only will WM's investment allow us to integrate our solutions at scale across North America but we will also be able to empower new and existing customers to run efficient and profitable circular systems.""

This year Debrand is projected to divert nearly 1000 tons of used textiles (125 percent year-over-year growth) from landfills through resale recycling and repurposing channels. The investment from WM will accelerate Debrand's plans to grow its operations capabilities customer network and team.

""Our customers are looking for ways to reduce waste from their operations enhance their sustainability reporting and accelerate the transition to a circular economy"" says Eric Dixon vice president of sustainability and environmental solutions at WM. ""WM in turn is continuing to adapt to meet these needs and become a true sustainability partner to our customers.

""After working with Debrand we recognized the immense value of their cutting-edge textile allocation technology that has enabled us to enhance sortation and divert our customers' textile waste from landfills into circular solutions. Over 17 million tons of used textile waste are generated annually in the U.S. and our investment in Debrand will help rapidly grow and scale textile solutions and innovation across North America.""

Significant demand and growth are expected for Debrand's reverse logistics textile solutions in response to climate change and the movement toward a circular economy. The fashion industry is one of the highest producers of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally and a growing number of brands have committed to adopting circular strategies to reduce GHG emissions that derive from producing fibres and raw materials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpdi5jb20vbmV3cy9lY29ub215LWxhdy1wb2xpdGljcy9leHBlcnRzLXdlaWdoLWJyaWFuLWhpbGxzLTcwLW1pbGxpb24tYXJpdHppYS1zdG9jay1zYWxlLTgyNjk1OTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts weigh in on Brian Hill's $70-million Aritzia stock sale,"Company’s founder sold shares to diversify assets get cash for philanthropy

Aritzia Inc. founder Brian Hill caused a ripple in his company’s share price on Tuesday after the company’s chairman and former CEO announced that he was selling $70 million in shares.

The bought deal that saw CIBC Capital Markets buy 1.36 million Aritzia shares left Hill with an 18.7-per-cent stake in the women’s fashion retailer down from a 20-per-cent stake.

Those who have experienced Hill’s phenomenal business success and those who advise ultra-high-net-worth individuals say the transaction should not have caused Aritzia’s shares to fall – even though Hill sold his shares below market value.

Hill’s shares sold for $51.60 each which was about 4.6 per cent below their $54.08 closing price on Monday.

Aritzia’s (TSX:ATZ) share price tanked more than five per cent Tuesday morning before rebounding to close down 0.8 per cent on a day when the Toronto Stock Exchange gained nearly 0.4 per cent

“The minute you indicate you're going to sell the value of your stock drops because people are going ‘Why is the owner selling?’” Lululemon Athletica Inc. founder Chip Wilson told BIV after Hill’s announcement.

“’Oh my God! Everyone else should sell because the owner is selling.’ That's one of the most bullshit lines ever.”

Indeed Aritzia made clear that Hill was not selling his interest because he had lost faith in the company. It said in a release that he planned to use his proceeds “for estate planning investment diversification and charitable giving purposes.”

One of Hill’s philanthropic donations has been along with wife Andrea Hill to provide $5 million to help fund building a new Vancouver Art Gallery.

Wilson said that he too was encouraged to sell Lululemon shares to diversify his assets when he owned more than one-quarter of the company.

He did he said but then had second thoughts.

“I pulled my money out – maybe too much” he said. “I went ‘What am I going to do with it?’ And then the only thing I wanted to do with it is put it right back into Lululemon. So I didn’t do a very good job of pulling my money out.”

Some of Wilson’s philanthropy has been to donate along with wife Summer (Shannon) Wilson $100 million to the B.C. Parks Foundation to help protect and enhance the province’s nature. He also donated $100 million to help fight the disease FSHD from which he suffers.

Wilson has often stirred controversy.

This may be why in 2014 when he announced that he was going to roughly halve his stake in Lululemon to 13.85 per cent the yogawear maker’s shares immediately jumped in price by nine per cent.

Wilson one year earlier had drawn blowback for saying that the yogawear maker’s products “don’t actually work” for some women’s bodies.

He then clashed with Lululemon’s board of directors.

Now with a nine-per-cent stake in Lululemon Wilson remains the company’s largest single shareholder.

Wilson’s bigger occupation is with his 20-per-cent stake in the global sportswear giant Amer Sports which is known for brands such as Arc’Teryx Armada and Peak Performance.

“It could be bad advice [for Hill] to diversify” Wilson said. “He’s got a hell of a business there. I’m really impressed by it.”

Thane Stenner who has made a career out of advising ultra-high-net-worth individuals said his best suggestion is for uber-successful corporate founders to diversify assets while they can.

The senior portfolio manager and senior wealth advisor at Stenner Wealth Partners which is part of CG Wealth management told BIV that one scenario he witnessed about 15 years ago crystalizes the importance of diversification.

Two Ontario brothers had built a business worth more than $1 billion and each had stakes in the company that were approximately 12 per cent.

“Let’s call it $125 million each” Stenner said.

“They were in their mid-50s and one brother wanted to diversify and sell out his position so we helped him do that on a tax-deferred basis. The other one said ‘No I think the company has way more upside.’ The sad story is that over the next five years that company went to zero. So one brother diversified his position and grew it a little bit. The other one didn’t and got a bit greedy. Basically it cost him and quite candidly it actually created some conflict between the brothers.”

Stenner said large shareholders wanting to diversify assets should telegraph that to the market in advance.

That is what Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates did he said. Gates years ago said that he was going to consistently sell a set amount of shares each quarter so the market would be prepared for regular announcements.

One thing many corporate founders do not know Stenner said is that Canadian tax law allows them to diversify publicly traded stock into a diversified portfolio on a tax-deferred basis.

“I've done this hundreds of times” he said.

Stenner’s company participated in the bought deal that saw Hill sell his shares to CIBC.

He said a smart way for founders to sell large blocks of shares is to do this via a bought deal or an institutional block sale.

This is in part because when a company hints that shares may be sold through a public stock exchange its share price can get hit.

On Sept. 22 Andrew Peller Ltd. (TSX:ADW-A) said that a holding company intended to sell up to 569851 of its shares that had been owned by former principal Jeff Peller until he died in 2021.

On an average day approximately 26600 Andrew Peller shares trade on the TSX.

The shares the wine producer said “may be sold privately through the facilities of the TSX or a combination thereof.”

The company’s share price then fell more than 11 per cent as of yesterday despite the TSX Composite Index rising more than five per cent during that same time frame.

BIV asked Andrew Peller in an email why some of Jeff Peller’s former shares might be sold on the public market instead of necessarily being bundled up and sold as one entity to a single buyer. The company did not respond.

Hill who founded Aritzia in 1984 with a store in Vancouver's Oakridge Centre rarely gives interviews. Aritzia did not respond to a request from BIV to interview Hill.

Using LyondellBasell’s proprietary MoReTec technology this commercial scale advanced recycling plant would convert pre-treated plastic waste into feedstock for new plastic production. The final investment decision is targeted for the end of 2023.

The previously announced German Joint Venture Source One Plastics will provide plastic waste feedstock to the plant. Source One Plastics is planning to build a facility designed to recycle the amount of plastic packaging waste generated by approximately 1.3 million German citizens per year. This plastic waste will consist of materials such as multi-layered food packaging items or mixed plastic containers that are typically not recycled today.

“We are actively working to move the circular economy forward. Progressing our MoReTec technology represents another step LyondellBasell is making to accelerate the development and implementation of scalable sustainable and circular technology” said Yvonne van der Laan LyondellBasell Executive Vice President Circular and Low Carbon Solutions. “This high yield differential technology will allow us to convert plastic waste into pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gas for use in our crackers as feedstock leading to the production of new plastic materials. Solid process residues can be re-used or consumed in other applications making this technology an energy efficient zero waste process for the recycling of plastic waste”.

The start-up of the MoReTec advanced recycling plant is planned for end of 2025 with a capacity of 50000 tonnes per year. The feedstock produced will be converted at the LyondellBasell Wesseling site into new CirculenRevive polymers for use in applications such as food packaging and healthcare products.

MoReTec - A story of innovation

In 2018 LyondellBasell began conducting base research in the chemical recycling of plastic waste together with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany which proved the efficiency of the MoReTec technology at laboratory scale. In October 2019 the company announced the construction of a chemical recycling pilot plant at its Ferrara Italy site which begun operation in August 2020. With the operation of the pilot plant research work improved the efficiency of the recycling process identified a commercial catalyst and made further progress in the characterization of the waste feedstock stream. The MoReTec plant capability was further expanded converting the pilot plant to a small scale industrial facility in 2021.

Today the MoReTec technology allows for the recycling of most types of plastic materials such as multi-layered food packaging items or mixed plastic containers. Polyolefin-based plastic waste is decomposed in a proprietary reactor unit resulting in high-quality feedstock usable for the production of new plastic materials at the LyondellBasell polymer plants.

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and received the fine.

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment.

The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgment in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote.

“I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh kindly refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife.

“Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

After the other woman posted the screenshots the newlywed deleted her Instagram account.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/florida-a-m-backs-away-from-dubious-237m-donation-00157234 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Solid Previews Around $6M – Thursday Night Box Office,"EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios‘ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange WTI crude futures settled at $85.59 a barrel yesterday — the lowest since Oct 25.



Before going into the overall macro environment for oil let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Nov 11.

Analyzing the Latest EIA Report

Crude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.4 million barrels compared to expectations of a 400000-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of a surge in exports lower imports and higher refinery demand accounted for the big stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer.



Total domestic stocks now stand at 435.4 million barrels — 0.6% more than the year-ago figure but 4% lower than the five-year average.



The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 1.6 million barrels to 25.6 million barrels.



Meanwhile the crude supply cover decreased from 28 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period the supply cover was 28.5 days.



Let’s turn to the products now.



Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the first time in five weeks. The 2.2 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to a pullback in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would fall 800000 barrels. At 207.9 million barrels the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 1.9% less than the year-earlier level and 5% below the five-year average range.



Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) increased after dropping last week. The 1.1 million-barrel gain reflected a fall in demand. Meanwhile the market looked for a supply draw of some 500000 barrels. Despite last week’s build current inventories — at 107.4 million barrels — are 13.2% below the year-ago level and 15% lower than the five-year average.



Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization at 92.9% rose 0.8% from the prior week.

Final Word

Even as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy it has remained the best S&P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 66% in 2022 against the S&P 500’s loss of around 17%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.



Oil has pulled back from those lofty levels with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.



Consequently three of the top four gainers of the S&P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum OXY Hess Corporation HES and Marathon Oil MRO.



Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&P 500 stock in 2022 with a gain of 148%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7% on average.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange WTI crude futures settled at $85.59 a barrel yesterday — the lowest since Oct 25.



Before going into the overall macro environment for oil let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Nov 11.

Analyzing the Latest EIA Report

Crude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.4 million barrels compared to expectations of a 400000-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of a surge in exports lower imports and higher refinery demand accounted for the big stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer.



Total domestic stocks now stand at 435.4 million barrels — 0.6% more than the year-ago figure but 4% lower than the five-year average.



The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 1.6 million barrels to 25.6 million barrels.



Meanwhile the crude supply cover decreased from 28 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period the supply cover was 28.5 days.



Let’s turn to the products now.



Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the first time in five weeks. The 2.2 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to a pullback in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would fall 800000 barrels. At 207.9 million barrels the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 1.9% less than the year-earlier level and 5% below the five-year average range.



Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) increased after dropping last week. The 1.1 million-barrel gain reflected a fall in demand. Meanwhile the market looked for a supply draw of some 500000 barrels. Despite last week’s build current inventories — at 107.4 million barrels — are 13.2% below the year-ago level and 15% lower than the five-year average.



Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization at 92.9% rose 0.8% from the prior week.

Transition and transformation. Freedom and fluidity. Rising artists Pilar Zeta and Miranda Makaroff will explore these themes and more in two new installations at Art Basel Miami Beach 2022. In collaboration with W Hotels and Mambo Creatives Zeta and Makaroff will stage their work at the recently renovated W South Beach from Tuesday November 29 2022 - Saturday December 3 2022.

For their Art Basel debut W has found kindred spirits in Zeta and Makaroff daring visionaries with vibrant fresh perspectives who share values core to the iconic hotel brand such as inclusivity curiosity and originality. Both installations will be unveiled Tuesday November 29 2022 at Hands on Sand the iconic party series hosted by music producer and DJ Pascal Moscheni. From Ibiza to Paris Hands on Sand invites guests to dance through an ocean of genres and experience an epiphany of what a real party should be.

“We could not think of two more dynamic or relevant artists to collaborate with than Pilar Zeta and Miranda Makaroff” said Carly Van Sickle Senior Director Global Brand Marketing W Hotels Worldwide. “Their bold yet playful aesthetic as well as the passion they infuse in their work is undeniable. We’re ready to kick off Art Basel Miami Beach with an unforgettable staging of their work at W South Beach and have the energy of our guests add to their visions.”

“Future Transmutation” A Large-Scale Installation by Pilar Zeta

When: Open to the Public: 9 a.m. ET -10 p.m. ET Wednesday November 30 2022 - Sunday December 4 2022 (excluding private events Tuesday November 29 2022 from 7 p.m. ET – 12 a.m. ET and Wednesday November 30 2022 from 12 – 3 p.m. ET)

Where: Lawn W South Beach 2201 Collins Avenue Miami Beach Fla. 33139

On the heels of “Hall of Visions” - one of the most talked about works of Art Basel Miami Beach 2021 - Argentinian-born artist Pilar Zeta returns with “Future Transmutation” a new site-specific large-scale interactive sculptural garden and pathway that engages mathematics astronomy and occult philosophies as creative devices. “Future Transmutation” is a reminder that as living entities we must come to terms with the fact that reality is a transforming one. In order to keep up with transmutation and metamorphosis we need imagination which Zeta triggers with the help of symbolic meaning. Completely glazed in a violet hue a color known to elevate our consciousness to a higher state the piece presents us with a series of elements loosely based on traditional Masonic altarpieces.

In the center 44 tiles (44 being the number of achievement) float above the lawn floor in a checkerboard arrangement an allegory of the dualities of the self. As visitors step up onto this platform they become immersed in glowing iridescent light as well as interacting shapes while the tiles become dynamic with movement and touch. Guarded by two candles with violet flames Zeta urges visitors to look once more at the representation of a portal. Portals are places that harbor a limit. A space where two things meet one starts and the other ends. Maybe it's a privileged place for mysterious magical things to happen. A space opening a new dimension. For imagining a transformation.

Several free-standing sculptures encircle the installation arranged in triangular shapes. Tension is present in two geometric bodies derived from Pithagoras’ mathematical theorem: a sphere representing the fluid flowing entities that adapt to the environment and a pyramid signifying fire the energetic forceful moving things in the world. Finally there is a sundial a device connected to the sun’s movement and position. While everything is inviting us to move towards a future transmutation looking at the sundial reminds us of the present moment we are living and that our future self is happening in the transmutation now. It invites us to imagine a future with all our senses and explore what it will look like.

“Life presents many portals - many opportunities to transform who you are where you are” said Zeta. “Travel can be a portal where one can disconnect and be in the moment. That’s what I want those to interact with ‘Future Transmutation’ to be: present while aligning with a future self.”

“An Amphibious Love Affair” A Creative Intervention by Miranda Makaroff

When: Open Exclusively to Guests of W South Beach

Where: WET Deck W South Beach 2201 Collins Avenue Miami Beach Fla. 33139

A vibrant psychedelic exploration of freedom and self-discovery Ibiza-based artist Miranda Makaroff will debut “An Amphibious Love Affair” during Art Basel 2022. Staged in and around the WET Deck pool of W South Beach Makaroff has created a colorful marine universe for guests to dare to explore. Like the siren at the center of the piece who goes into the depths of the water to fall in love with an amphibious fluid creature - instead of doing what’s expected and going to the outer world to find her Prince - the artist invites guests to venture to the depths of their soul on a journey of self-discovery. A journey that includes a touch of joy humor and respect for everyone.

Makaroff’s “intervention” of the space includes cabanas adorned with neon as well as abstract oceanic “creatures” buoyantly floating in the pool. Her underwater world will also come to life in exclusive pool towels literally enveloping hotel guests in her vision.

“When concepting the piece I wanted to inspire everyone to make their own path and set their own rules no matter what society tries to impose” said Makaroff. “W is a brand that stands for inclusivity acceptance and diversity so I wanted my piece to celebrate how welcome everyone will be when interacting with my art.”

Under the name “Hall of Visions” this site-specific monumental installation was open to the public and lived forever in the form of NFTs in partnership with Aorist. Zeta’s art is heavily influenced by her upbringing (her mother was an art history teacher in Argentina) and a nascent interest in Ancient Egypt cosmology and metaphysics. Having been introduced to esoteric philosophies from a young age Zeta’s understanding of Neo-Metaphysical concepts is ubiquitous throughout her various artistic creations. Zeta’s artistic style is defined by her minimalist surrealist landscapes her bold use of color and of deconstructed shapes. She has described her artistic style as ‘mystical futurism’ and her allusions to ancient traditions concerning practical magic and innovative digital skills allow her to create liminal spaces in which both the past and the future are acknowledged and engaged.

This widespread availability makes it popular with regular travelers who count on the company for reliably comfortable lodging complete with top-notch service. But just as the hospitality chain stays on top of updating and maintaining its properties it also can make changes to its policies and pricing. And now Marriott has announced that it will start to charge guests more for one thing soon. See what will cost you more in the new year.

Marriott Bonvoy allows regular guests to collect rewards and earn status with the chain.

Rewards programs come in all forms from your local coffee shop's ""buy 10 get one free"" punch cards to international airlines offering lounge access and upgrades. For Marriott and its related chains the Bonvoy program manages customer loyalty over time. With each stay and dollar spent guests can earn points that can be redeemed for free stays at the hotel—or even used to purchase items or book flights with partner airlines.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

Arguably the most enticing part of the program is that it also allows frequent guests to earn elite status after a certain number of stays with the company. Each member gets better perks as they rise through the ranks from the entry-level Silver Elite tier earning free WiFi and late checkout privileges to higher-tier Platinum and Titanium Elite members getting perks like lounge access room upgrades and welcome gifts.

All told the program makes it more likely for regular travelers to stick with Marriott when it comes to booking accommodations. But now the company says it's making a change that could wind up costing you more.

Marriott says it will cost guests more to do one thing starting next year.

After several other changes in recent weeks Marriott has announced that it's making some changes to the Bonvoy program's highest Ambassador Elite tier. The company says that it will increase the required spending for the tier from $20000 per year to $23000 per year representing a 15 percent markup The Points Guy reports. The new policy will take effect on Jan. 1.

Spending isn't just limited to the base rate paid for a hotel stay. Any incidental charges—including on-site dining and other room charges—will count towards the requirement.

""To ensure the program is delivering the highest level of service to its most loyal members when it is most important Marriott Bonvoy is announcing an enhancement for Ambassador Elite members to help make travel planning easier and trips more fulfilling within the Marriott Bonvoy portfolio"" the company said in a statement per The Points Guy.

Some requirements for the top tier are staying the same.

However even though Marriott will expect more money from guests to reach its highest tier some requirements will stay the same when the policy changes. The company announced that the number of elite nights needed to unlock eligibility will remain at 100 per year. Notably these nights aren't necessarily defined just as stays at a property: They can also be achieved with cobranded credit card spending according to travel rewards blog One Mile at a Time.

It's also important to note that anyone looking to achieve Ambassador Elite in 2022 will still be able to unlock the tier with $20000 in spending before Jan. 1. Anyone who hits the milestone will earn the top status through February 2024 according to One Mile at a Time.

The latest changes will also bring back a major perk for the top tier.

Even though it will be more difficult to achieve the hotel chain's top status in the future those who do manage to meet the requirements will be rewarded with a significant perk. Marriott also announced that it had revived its personal ambassador agent program for the top elite guests marking the first time it's been available since it was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic The Points Guy reports.

Each ambassador provides guests with one-on-one service to book reservations within Marriott properties. But they also use each member's personal preferences to help with everything from making local dining recommendations and reservations to suggesting and booking special tours and activities.

Guests of the top tier will also still be able to take advantage of the Your24 offering. This perk allows Ambassador Elite members to choose which 24 hours count towards the length of their stay such as a 9 p.m. check-in to a 9 p.m. checkout."

The area was in disarray and not very appealing to new businesses according to officials at the time and the cities decided to work together to spruce up the area.

Work has continued for five years and is about to start paying off.

At a recent Dearborn Heights Planning Commission meeting Arthur Mullen a planner from Wade Trim talked about some of the work that has been done up to this point.

He said they are working on beautification issues as well as new ordinances for the “Taylor Dearborn Heights Gateway Overlay District” as it is officially known.

“We had a very good working group” Mullen said. “We spent a lot of time working on ordinances for the overlay district to make them match in both cities.”

Mullen said they started by deciding exactly what the area should look like and then combed through both Taylor and Dearborn Heights ordinances to see what part of the new look was already codified in each city.

Then they made a proposed ordinance for that overlay district for both City Councils to approve.

The next step for both cities is to pass the proposed ordinances.

“This isn’t an overnight fix” Mullen said. “This will take place over years as businesses renovate and new businesses come in.”

Both cities will have to hold a public hearing on the new ordinances before they can be passed but ultimately it’s up to each council to decide whether to pass them or not.

The new district would have the same requirements for Dearborn Heights as it does for Taylor making both sides of the road look the same.

“We want it to be inviting to the public” Mullen said.

A study that was agreed to in 2017 addressed three major topical areas:

• The definition of issues and opportunities for multimodal transportation to address the combined needs of business commercial services and retail facilities as well as identifying existing and potential businesses/services that could come into the area that would serve the increased business/professional population of the area with the relocation of potentially several thousand Ford Motor Co. employees

• Development of a menu of streetscape recommendations that would unite and blend the two communities – making the improvements accessible to drivers cyclists and pedestrians alike

• Development of a conceptual vision of the improved street environment that would result in a safer more functional and more aesthetically appealing environment for drivers pedestrians cyclists and other transit users/vehicles.

Since the project started both cities have seen changes in leadership with then-Taylor Mayor Rick Sollars losing a reelection campaign and then-Dearborn Heights Mayor Daniel Paletko dying in office.

The new officials — Taylor Mayor Tim Woolley and Dearborn Heights Mayor Bill Bazzi — have committed to continuing the process to update that area of both cities.

“The first thing we have to do is incorporate an ordinance for the Van Born corridor” Bazzi said shortly after taking office last year. “There were a few communities that were looked at for their best practices so we are benchmarking for the best ordinance.”

Bazzi was not at the planning meeting as it was the same day and time as the council meeting due to election week causing scheduling conflicts.

Dearborn Heights City Engineer Ali Dibb also recently spoke about the project.

“Once the ordinances are adopted by the communities we are going to gradually move into the new standards” he said. “So the project is called ‘Van Born Overlay’ so we are going to specify things like landscaping setbacks things of that nature and they’re going to be gradual as businesses and buildings are renovated or new businesses come in you are going to see the new standards apply.”

Woolley said both he and Bazzi are fully on board with continuing the project.

“We have discussed it a number of times and bounce things off each other on what each city is doing to help the area” Woolley said. “We’re continuing to work together on this project and the more ideas in the room the better. Taylor is still continuing the grant program for businesses along the Van Born corridor which is focused on property enhancement. We are also talking with Wayne County to see what’s in the future for that stretch of Van Born.”

Overview

Van Born Road runs along the northern edge of Taylor just north of I-94 from approximately the Southfield Freeway on the east to Inkster Road on the west. North of Van Born is Dearborn Heights and the Ecorse Creek runs parallel to Van Born creating a large federal flood plain that ranges from northern Taylor through Dearborn Heights and into Dearborn.

Van Born for the most part is home to many small businesses and restaurants. Two of Van Born’s largest institutional tenants the vast headquarters of Masco Corp. and neighboring Kmart which was vacated in 2016. Masco left Taylor to drastically downsize in a new Livonia headquarters while the Kmart closure was one of hundreds announced by the Sears corporation.

Ford Motor Co. has been occupying both the former Masco building and the former Kmart building in recent years.",,,,,,,,,

Despite U.S. consumer confidence declining in October suggesting slowing economic growth and the Eurozone heading into a recession at the end of 2022 Mastercard (MA 0.16%) surpassed analysts' revenue and earnings expectations for the third quarter. In addition management highlighted several reasons why it should outperform moving forward.

Here are two reasons Mastercard is a buy.

1. Cross-border payments are improving

Payment networks like Mastercard charge a ""cross border fee"" on all business transactions in one country involving a credit card issued outside that country. The fee amounts to 0.6% of the purchase price and the payment network charges the cost to the merchant's bank accepting the foreign card. Revenue from these fees rises as more people travel outside their home country and use their credit cards.

By the end of 2019 cross-border fees comprised 33% of Mastercard's pre-pandemic net revenues. And when most nations instituted travel bans in early 2020 in response to the pandemic it gutted this significant Mastercard revenue source. As a result by the second quarter of 2020 the pandemic low cross-border fees declined 54% year over year and were responsible for 46% of its net revenue loss of 19% year over year in the middle of 2020.

Today international travel continues to recover as border restrictions are progressively relaxed. Mastercard Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach said during its third-quarter 2022 earnings call that ""Cross-border travel in the third quarter had reached 124% of 2019 levels."" He added ""Relative to 2019 levels most regions are up sequentially including a notable improvement in Asia.""

You can see the rebound in international travel in Mastercard's cross-border travel revenues. Cross-border fees that were only $637 million in the second quarter of 2020 have rebounded to $1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2022 which exceeds 2019 pre-pandemic third-quarter cross-border revenues of $1.5 billion. Additionally cross-border revenue is now a 57% driver of its net revenue 15% year-over-year gains in the third quarter.

The best part is that international air travel has yet to recover fully. The International Civil Aviation Organization currently projects that most international routes should fully recover to their pre-pandemic levels by either the fourth quarter of 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. As long as travel continues improving the company will continue to have a strong tailwind for revenue growth.

2. The Digital First program

Digital First is Mastercard's brand name for its virtual card financial management and benefits program launched in 2019. A virtual payment card is a secure temporary digital card number that operates similarly to a physical credit or debit card except it is more secure. People can use virtual cards to make contactless payments in stores with a mobile device or online purchases with any computing device.

Virtual cards have several use cases with rising popularity.

First many traditional businesses are replacing plastic corporate cards with virtual cards. Virtual cards provide companies with more control over employee spending.

Second banks and fintechs use virtual card technology to quickly create custom-made credit debit and gift cards for customers.

Last young innovative companies like DoorDash (DASH 2.79%) can use virtual card technology to create and issue one-use virtual cards. Dashers use these cards to pay out the exact amount for each food order at the specific restaurant where a customer made the food request.

All of the above use cases make the global virtual card market a rapidly growing segment but market researchers have differing views on the eventual size of the opportunity. Pessimistic analysts think the market will only be worth $65 billion by 2030 and optimistic analysts believe the market will be well over a trillion by the end of this decade. Whatever the eventual size of the market Mastercard wants a piece of this new opportunity.

Currently the Digital First program benefits Mastercard by increasing its payment volume expanding the places where its payments are accepted and capturing new fintech payment flows -- growing revenues and profits.

Should you buy the stock?

About the only thing that can stop Mastercard long-term is regulation. Since it is part of a duopoly with Visa (V 0.49%) governments often give it fines and it is the target of antitrust probes. So although the company is unlikely to be broken up the threat that governments could create rules to generate more competition is always present.

On the other hand it is a $330 billion market cap company within a $255 trillion market currently targeting $115 trillion of that opportunity. Moreover since it has many secular tailwinds a huge brand name and a powerful network effect it likely has many years of double-digit growth with huge attractive margins ahead.

Although it has a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.80 compared to the Financial Transaction Services industry's PEG ratio of 0.96 which many consider overvalued this is one company that deserves the premium. Therefore if you are looking for a stable growth company that should outperform the market you should strongly consider Mastercard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMizwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLmNvbS9uZXdzL3ByZXNzLzIwMjIvbm92ZW1iZXIvbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1zcGVuZGluZ3B1bHNlLWxhc3QtbWludXRlLXNob3BwaW5nLXByZXZhaWxzLW92ZXItb25lLWRheS1zYWxlcy1hbmQtcHJvbW90aW9ucy1hcy1jYW5hZGlhbi1yZXRhaWwtc2FsZXMtZXhwZWN0ZWQtdG8tZ3Jvdy01LTctdGhpcy1ob2xpZGF5LXNlYXNvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mastercard SpendingPulse: Last-minute shopping prevails over one-day sales and promotions as Canadian retail ...,"Mastercard SpendingPulse: Last-minute shopping prevails over one-day sales and promotions as Canadian retail sales expected to grow +5.7% this holiday season November 17 2022

This holiday season from November 25 to December 24 Canadian retail sales (excluding Automotive) are expected to increase +5.7%* year over year (YOY) and +21.2% since pre-pandemic (2019) according to the Mastercard SpendingPulseTM holiday forecast. E-commerce retail sales are expected to grow +3.8% YOY (+63.1% YO3Y). Mastercard SpendingPulse measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment and is not adjusted for inflation.

“While there are lots of pre-Black Friday sales and promotions happening to draw customers in early we’re expecting a return of last-minute gift buying this holiday season” said Steve Sadove senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “Easing supply chain issues coupled with a return to in-store shopping has reduced the need for consumers to do their online holiday shopping well in advance.”

This year moderate sales growth is expected on Black Friday (+2% YOY) and Boxing Day (+7.5% YOY) as these traditional single-day sales have become extended events. While Electronics were a popular purchase for consumers during these sales events in the past Electronic sales are projected to be down -12.5% YOY (-54.3% YO3Y) on Black Friday and -8.2% YOY (-54.8% YO3Y) on Boxing Day this year as consumer behaviour shifts.

The days leading up to Christmas are slated to be among the busiest days for retailers. A major boost for this season’s retail growth is expected from in-store shopping as customers have more flexibility to shop in-store again. Total retail sales are projected to be up +24% YOY on December 23 and +17.5% YOY on Christmas Eve.

Jewelry and Leather Goods are expected to be popular last-minute gifts on December 23 with +25.4% YOY growth. Apparel is likely to be a go-to gift for shoppers on both December 23 (+17.1% YOY) and Christmas Eve (+4.9% YOY) in addition to Electronics (+10.7% YOY on December 23 and +5.2% YOY on Christmas Eve).

“This holiday season consumers are looking to stretch their dollars as they deal with economic challenges including higher interest rates which makes it imperative for retailers to encourage spending through season-long sales” said Michelle Meyer North America Chief Economist Mastercard Economics Institute.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2NvaW5nZWVrLmNvbS9tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWhzYmMtd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tam9pbi1mb3JjZXMtZm9yLXJlZ3VsYXRlZC1kaWdpdGFsLWFzc2V0LXNldHRsZW1lbnQtcGxhdGZvcm0tcHJvb2Ytb2YtY29uY2VwdC10cmlhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MasterCard HSBC Wells Fargo join forces for regulated digital asset settlement platform proof-of-concept trial,"Along with some of its United States Banking peers MasterCard (NASDAQ: MA) is expanding its poison chalice tentacles further into the digital asset space with its participation in a new proof-of-concept (PoC) project aimed at creating a regulated digital asset settlement platform.

Announced on Tuesday the PoC is a joint venture by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s New York Innovation Centre (NYIC) alongside HSBC MasterCard and Wells Fargo to test a digital money platform called the Regulated Liability Network (RLN). It will use distributed ledger technology or blockchain to “improve financial settlements.”

The project also draws participation from several central banks commercial banks and “regulated non-banks” including BNY Mellon Citi PNC Bank Swift TD Bank Truist and U.S. Bank.

The 12-week PoC will test a version of the RLN design that operates in U.S. dollars where commercial banks issue simulated digital money or “tokens” representing the deposits of their own customers and settle through simulated central bank reserves on a shared ‘multi-entity’ distributed ledger.

The project will also test whether a programmable digital money design is extendable to other digital assets and the system’s viability within existing laws and regulations.

The group behind the PoC claims that “the concept could potentially be extended to multi-currency operations and regulated stablecoins.” This suggests one aim might be to further bridge the gap between traditional banking and ‘stablecoin’—to some the digital currency equivalent of a gateway drug and to others an untrustworthy misuse of the technology.

One key takeaway from the announcement is that it serves as more proof if it were needed of MasterCard’s increasing efforts to control the future narrative of digital currency or perhaps more accurately the lack-of-future of digital currency.

“MasterCard invested in Blockstream Lightning Labs and all the other infrastructure partners of Lightning Network in order to run a controlled opposition campaign against the big blockers so that bitcoin could never scale. Lightning’s purpose is for people to ‘just use fiat'” explained Bitcoin Historian Kurt Wuckers Jr. in an August 2021 tweet.

The water gets murky when looking into the various investments of MasterCard and the venture capital firms that it backs but by some estimates up to 90% of the public infrastructure for BTC is in the control of the interconnected network of MasterCard Blockstream and the Digital Currency Group.

These investments make the planned PoC a strange move particularly if Mastercard truly does subscribe to the everyday adoption of the likes of BTC as its investments in Blockstream and DCG seem designed to suggest.

The stated ‘scope’ of the PoC project is to simulate digital money issued by regulated institutions in U.S. dollars testing the RLN to “create opportunities to improve financial settlements.” By ‘improve financial settlements’ read ‘make faster and more secure’ which on the face of it is not necessarily a bad thing and yet we are left to wonder who will be in charge of this distributed ledger network and how it might shape future digital asset regulation in the United States.

With its extensive BTC-related portfolio MasterCard has positioned itself well to significantly cash in by facilitating and verifying such transactions and in the process further divert the original purpose of this technology.

Should this latest experiment in the possibilities of distributed ledger technology prove a success MasterCard could become one the key ground-floor players in a traditional banking ‘revolution’ that seems inevitable to see decentralized finance theory used—or perverted depending on your point of view—to build the U.S.’ own central bank digital currency (CBDC) though the press release was quick to shut down any such speculation:

“This project will be conducted in a test environment and only use simulated data. It is not intended to advance any specific policy outcome nor is it intended to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a retail or wholesale CBDC nor how one would necessarily be designed.”

For the first time Mastercard debit credit and prepaid cards are accepted in Ethiopia. The news follows partnerships between the financial services giant and two Ethiopian financial firms.

EthSwitch Ethiopia’s national payment switch and Ethiopia-based Oromia Bank have partnered with Mastercard. The move brings Mastercard services to the citizens of Ethiopia.

Both tourists and local citizens carrying Mastercard payment cards are now enabled to withdraw local currency from Oromia Bank ATMs. The ‘EthSwitch network’ is to process all of these withdrawals.

The next phase of the partnership aims to enable people to pay for goods and services with Mastercard payment cards. Oromia Bank EthSwitch and Mastercard are collaborating ensuring the cards can be used at Point of Sale.

Big players in Ethiopia’s financial industry

ATM usage has increased rapidly in Ethiopia having been first implemented in 2001. By the end of the 2020/2021 fiscal year Ethiopia had processed a combined total of over 225 million ATM transactions. Interbank transactions processed by EthSwitch made up around six per cent (38302370) of these.

Oromia Bank also has significant outreach in Ethiopia boasting over 400 branches nationwide. Moreover the bank has also introduced new banking practices into the nation including interest-free banking services.

Bettering financial freedom for Ethiopians

Shehryar Ali country manager for East Africa at Mastercard explained the company’s commitment to supporting Ethiopia’s digital transformation objectives.

He said: “Ethiopians are increasingly seeking safe seamless and consistent digital experiences. Backed by the speed and security of Mastercard’s global network we are pleased to partner with and EthSwitch and Oromia Bank to lead the transition to digital while supporting Digital Ethiopia 2025 vision to modernise the payment system.

“Importantly we are also contributing to the financial freedom of Ethiopia’s citizens and anyone visiting the country for work or leisure. Together we can connect more people to the global digital economy while laying the groundwork for future innovation.”

Teferi Mekonnen president of Oromia Bank explained the recent developments for payments in Ethiopia.

Mekonnen said: “Ethiopia has witnessed a significant shift in [the] growth of electronic payments over the last few years and the bank has played a significant role in pioneering new banking practices”

“We remain committed to developing appropriate payments channels to provide people with more convenient secure and reliable ways to access funds in the country. This partnership with EthSwitch and Mastercard is the latest example of how we continue to collaborate on this journey.”

Yilebes Addis chief executive officer at EthSwitch commented on the national payment switch’s aims for Ethiopian payments.

He said: “Oromia Bank is the first bank to accept Mastercard payment cards using EthSwitch as the payments processor – a milestone we are extremely proud of.”

Addis explained: “The mandate of EthSwitch is to contribute to the modernisation of the national payments system and enhance financial inclusion in the country. Through this partnership we are progressing [toward] this goal by enabling interoperability of ATMs and making it easier for people to transact.”"

Match Group which owns popular apps Tinder and Hinge reported strong third quarter earnings due in part to a 2% increase in paying subscribers across brands. Tinder alone saw a 7% jump in paid users. But while more paid subscribers is good news for the app's investors the question remains whether paying for a dating app is a smart investment for singles.

You can't buy love but you can invest in your relationship search

Paying for a dating app won't make your perfect match magically appear. Plenty of other factors like your personality and relationship goals or even your location could have an impact on your search for a partner. But putting money behind your dating strategy might help those other areas. ""A lot of the less-than-wonderful experiences on dating apps happen because people are not invested"" Cora Boyd a dating and relationships expert based in Seattle tells CNBC Make It. Boyd works with clients and creates educational content to help people find love and from what she's seen clients who pay for dating apps report better outcomes or at least have a more enjoyable experience.

Someone who is just dabbling or who's not serious or is not going to follow up is not going to be paying for the platform. Cora Boyd dating and relationship expert

""The motivation for clients or anyone who's paying [for apps] is they're serious and they are wanting to find a connection where there's mutual investment they're looking for more of a committed relationship"" Boyd says. ""Someone who is just dabbling or who's not serious or is not going to follow up is not going to be paying for the platform."" Those using dating apps agree. Laura whose name has been changed to protect her privacy says she's glad she signed up for a paid eHarmony subscription a couple of years ago. She paid a total of around $115 over six months. ""I thought that the idea of it was stupid at first but my parents talked me into it and told me that it was worth it and after the first week or so of being on the app I felt the same way"" Laura tells CNBC Make It. On eHarmony users essentially have to pay if they want to talk to potential matches Laura says so she found it more common to find other people looking for a long-term relationship compared with her experience using other apps like Tinder and Bumble. ""Overall I'm really thankful for the dating app because it changed my outlook on dating"" she says. Shelling out over $100 for a dating app was tough especially since Laura didn't have income at the time due to the pandemic. Still she says it paid off: ""I met my boyfriend on eHarmony and we've been together for two years so far. I definitely think it's worth it."" The only downside: Having to finish paying through the end of the subscription despite already finding her significant other. An annoying quirk but also a testament to how quickly someone can find a relationship when they're more invested in the search.

The 22nd FIFA World Cup kicks off this coming Sunday November 20 when host nation Qatar play against Ecuador at 4pm UK time.

There are a number of firsts for the tournament: It will be the first World Cup in the Middle East the first World Cup to be held in the northern hemisphere’s winter and it will be played in a slightly reduced time-frame of 29 days.

However the competition comes with more than its fair share of controversy. If you fancy having a pint at the game you will be out of luck with FIFA announcing that alcohol will not be sold inside stadiums or at the Brand Activation Areas within the stadium perimeters

Expectations surrounding England are reasonably low but one man who has arguably attracted the most attention is James Maddison. Gareth Southgate listened to the public outcry and included the Leicester star in his squad  but faces a race against time to be fit for England's group opener against Iran on Monday with a knee problem.

It’s going to be a football frenzy with four games per day during the group stages before some likely big clashes in the last 16 and the prospect of an upset or two as the tournament approaches the latter stages.

Hosts Qatar will get the tournament under way on November 20 against Ecuador  with the final taking place at the Lusail Iconic Stadium on December 18.

England World Cup kick-off times (UK time)

England go into the tournament low on confidence following a disappointing Nations League campaign which led to them being relegated from League A after they failed to win any of their matches against Italy Hungary and Germany.

Pressure has been building on manager Gareth Southgate as a nation waits to see if the Three Lions can go better than their run to the semi-finals at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

They have been drawn in Group B along with Iran the United States and Wales.

When does the World Cup start?

The 2022 FIFA World Cup will begin on Sunday November 20 as host nation Qatar gets the tournament kicked off.

The tournament was initially set to begin on Monday November 21 but FIFA changed the schedule to ensure the host nation had the spotlight as is customary.

World Cup 2022 first match

The tournament will kick off with hosts Qatar entertaining Ecuador in Group A action with the match scheduled to kick off at 7 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET / 4 p.m. GMT) on November 20 in Al Bayt Stadium.

It is tournament tradition that the host nation plays in the tournament's first match. And when the 2022 FIFA World Cup schedule was set back in April it raised eyebrows when it did not include a traditional inaugural match involving host nation Qatar. Instead the schedule at the time listed Qatar playing the second of four matches on opening day on Monday November 21 behind Senegal vs. Netherlands.

It was only three months before the tournament kicked off that FIFA announced the change in the schedule that ensured Qatar kicked off the tournament a day earlier.

World Cup opening ceremony 2022

With the shift of the tournament's opening match to Sunday November 20 the opening ceremony has also moved a day earlier set to take place in the immediate run-up to the Qatar vs. Ecuador inaugural match.

The ceremony is expected to feature the tournament's official anthem songs from the soundtrack and the mascot of the 2022 World Cup.

The official FIFA World Cup soundtrack released its first single in April 2022 a song titled Hayya Hayya (Better Together) by American recording artist Trinidad Cardona alongside Nigerian singer Davido and Qatari singer AISHA. Lil Baby also has a single on the soundtrack with more expected.

Meanwhile the official World Cup mascot was revealed to be La'eeb at the World Cup Draw in April 2022. ""La’eeb"" is an Arabic word meaning super-skilled player.

When is the 2022 World Cup final?

The 2022 World Cup final will take place on Sunday December 18 at Lusail Iconic Stadium with kickoff at 6 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET / 3 p.m. GMT).

The date of the World Cup final coincides with Al-Yawm al-Watani li-Qaṭar or the National Day of Qatar which celebrates the nation's unification in 1878.

World Cup kickoff times

The group stage games will kick off at staggered intervals throughout the day with the opening matches set to be played at 1 p.m. local time (5 a.m. ET / 10 a.m. GMT). There are three other kickoff times that will be utilized during the group stage with the final window coming at 10 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. GMT).

Up to four matches will be played each day in the group-stage period.

In the knockout stage the kickoff times will be reduced to two main windows on any given matchday. Games in the knockout rounds will kick off at either 6 p.m. local time or 10 p.m. local time.

Why is the World Cup in November?

In a significant change from the World Cup's traditional schedule the 2022 edition of the tournament will be held in the Northern Hemisphere's winter.

Due to the high average temperatures in Qatar during the June-July period a decision was taken by FIFA to move the showpiece event from its usual spot on the calendar in the hope of more temperate conditions for both players and fans.

That means the World Cup will take place smack in the middle of the August-May club season calendar impacting domestic leagues schedules across the world including the English Premier League and others in Europe."
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtYXJrZXRlci5jb20vY29udGVudC9ob3ctcGFuZGVtaWMtY2hhbmdlZC1tYXJrZXRpbmctbWNkb25hbGQtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the pandemic changed marketing for McDonald's,"For one of the world’s largest restaurant chains the pandemic changed everything. Indoor dining was closed. Lockdowns shut down traffic. But it wasn’t just operationally: McDonald’s was just starting to work with a new agency Wieden + Kennedy when the US felt the COVID-19 crush. It turns out this was a blessing in disguise.

“We changed the way we went to market” Jennifer Healan vice president US marketing brand content and engagement at McDonald’s said in a session this week at The Brief a Marketing Brew event in New York City. “In the past McDonald’s had been living in this short-term transactional marketing environment and they're chasing a limited time offer that went month to month. March 2020 changed all that.”

Here's how the iconic brand pivoted from transactional marketing to brand-building in the long term:

Focus on your fans. Healan said the chain uses “fans” instead of “consumers” or “customers.” “The haters will always hate” she said. “We stopped focusing on the haters.” Instead McDonald’s turned to those who said “I’m lovin’ it” and created a book of “fan truths.”

One example is “the golden lights of midnight salvation” meaning you’ve come out of the club and need a bite to eat. But even that truth shifted in the pandemic. “If you see our lights on it means we are open which was an uncertain thing at that time [because so many places were closed]” said Brandon Pracht managing director McDonald’s Global at Wieden + Kennedy.

Turn to your community. In the early pandemic days this focus on fans meant first responders. McDonald’s was far from the only brand to do this but the chain made sure to draw back to its marketing plan. The brand found photos of first responders at McDonald’s as children and incorporated that into a TV spot. The chain also gave out 12 million free meals to healthcare workers and first responders.

Tap into celebrity. But not just any celebrity—make sure they’re fans. “Everyone has [a McDonald’s order] and it’s not a generic thing” Pracht said. Is it a Sprite with fries that you dip in barbeque sauce? That’s part of McDonald’s partner Travis Scott’s order. After the Scott spot was released fans began ordering by playing his music in the drive-thru  which Pracht said employees knew immediately what the customers were asking for.

Humanize your social media account. Healan says fans always reach out asking when a fan-favorite like the McRib will be back on the menu. The brand poked fun by tweeting  “it’s always ‘when is the McRib coming back’ and never ‘how are you doing person who runs the McDonald’s account.’”

Where the ad budget goes: As it shifts to brand-building McDonald’s was the No. 1 spender at $69.5 million in out-of-home advertising in 2021 according to data from the Out of Home Advertising Association of America and Kantar Media. It also ranked No. 9 in the top 20 for aired radio ad spots in the US during the first half of 2022 according to Media Monitors. McDonald’s was the No. 1 restaurant brand joined only by Wendy’s in the top 20.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLWphcGFuLWJlc3Qtd29yc3QtaXRlbXMtbm90LWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi11cy1waG90b3MtMjAyMi0xMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best and Worst Items at McDonald's in Japan You Can't Get in US,"On a recent trip to Japan I visited a McDonald's in Tokyo and tried several menu items that I can't get back at home in the United States.

I visited Japan in October right after it opened its borders to tourists. While there I ate at McDonald's in Tokyo. Christina Liao

In October Japan dropped all travel restrictions after closing its borders to visitors more than two and a half years as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Once I heard the news my cousin her boyfriend and I booked a ticket to arrive at the end of the month.

I first visited Japan in 2016 and until the pandemic traveled there quite frequently. Since that first visit I've spent anywhere between one to three months every year in the country.

One of the reasons I love to visit is for the local food. While I don't frequently dine at fast food restaurants I occasionally give into cravings. In Japan I've always been intrigued by unique menu items at McDonald's particularly the shrimp and teriyaki offerings that I can't get back home in Charlotte North Carolina.

So on this most recent trip when my cousin's boyfriend was keen on trying McDonald's in Japan the decision to have one meal there was settled.

We went to an outpost of the chain in the neighborhood of Ginza in Tokyo and tried seven items that you won't see on the menu in the US. Here's how I thought they ranked from worst to best.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb2xvcmFkb2FuLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvZm9ydC1jb2xsaW5zLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1zaG9vdGluZy12aWRlby12aWN0b3ItY29yd2luLWludGVydmlldy1wbGF5ZWQtY291cnQvNjk2NjA3MjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investigators reveal video suspect's confession in fatal shooting at Fort Collins McDonald's,"Investigators say video footage and a man's statements to police implicate him in the fatal shooting of a man experiencing homelessness outside the Midtown Fort Collins McDonald's in July 2021.

Christopher J. Johnson 39 of Fort Collins was fatally shot near the drive-thru of the McDonald’s in Midtown Fort Collins near the intersection of College Avenue and Drake Road the morning of July 19 2021.

Prosecutors played surveillance footage from inside the McDonald's and the restaurant's patio during an evidence hearing Friday. In the footage another man is seen interacting with Johnson multiple times across a span of 7 minutes. The man walks back and forth from Johnson — in and out of frame of the video — multiple times and the final time the man comes back does something with his waistband and Johnson falls back Fort Collins Police Services Detective Dollie Knab testified during Friday's evidence hearing.

Johnson's death was ruled a homicide by a gunshot wound to the head according to the Larimer County Coroner's Office.

In the footage Johnson never stands up or makes any movement to engage physically with the man Knab said and she is unsure what they were talking about.

Knab said investigators sent a bulletin to other area law enforcement agencies with images of the shooter and the vehicle he was driving from the surveillance footage and a Brighton police officer identified the man in the footage as Victor Corwin now 30 based on previous incidents involving him. An off-duty Boulder County deputy spotted Corwin in Berthoud the morning after the shooting and several officers from multiple agencies responded to arrest him.

The vehicle Corwin was seen driving in multiple surveillance videos had been reported stolen from Lakewood the morning of the shooting Knab said. The vehicle's owner told police he believed someone entered his home an stole his wallet and car keys and he received several alerts about fraudulent activity on credit cards that were in his wallet. A firearm was also in the car's glove box.

When Corwin was arrested in Berthoud he was found with the vehicle owner's credit cards and his firearm Fort Collins Police Services Detective CJ O’Loughlin testified.

Corwin has been charged with first-degree murder a Class 1 felony; identity theft a Class 4 felony; possession of a weapon by a previous offender a Class 6 felony; criminal possession of financial devices a Class 6 felony; aggravated motor vehicle theft a Class 6 felony; and petty theft.

In video played by prosecutors of Knab interviewing Corwin after he was arrested Corwin makes statements implicating himself 8th Judicial District Attorney Gordon McLaughlin said.

Corwin told Knab during the interview he ""shot him in the head"" referring to Johnson Knab said. In other parts of Knab's interview with Corwin not played in court due to sound issues Knab said Corwin said ""I did a 380 on someone’s head"" with the number 380 referring to the caliber of the firearm used in the shooting which investigators identified using a shell casing found at the scene.

Corwin made several statements during the interview that didn't make sense Knab said. He allegedly claimed to have shot Johnson because he believed Johnson was a wanted international terrorist Knab testified. Corwin was trying to get Johnson to come with him willingly and when Johnson refused Corwin told Knab he had to ""execute"" him she testified.

In response to questions from one of Corwin's defense attorneys Benjamin Iddings Knab said Corwin made additional statements that didn't make sense including that someone named Sgt. Rick — who Corwin said is his father — ordered him to arrest Johnson but also that Russian President Vladimir Putin is his father.

The defense is not able to introduce possible defenses including mental health-related defenses during evidence hearings.

Corwin was deemed legally competent to proceed in this case in September after two doctors who evaluated Corwin testified to 8th Judicial District Judge Gregory Lammons that they believed Corwin was competent to proceed likely because he had stopped using illegal substances and had started taking medication to treat delusional thoughts and voices he heard.

Legally competent means a defendant is able to consult with their attorney with ""a reasonable degree of rational understanding"" in order to assist with their own defense.

At the conclusion of Friday's hearing Lammons ruled there was enough evidence to continue charging Corwin in this case and to continue holding him in the jail without bond.

""You don't often see video and a confession"" in homicide cases Lammons said.

Corwin is next scheduled to appear in court Dec. 5.

So should surgery be any different? George Murgatroyd vice president and general manager of Digital Surgery believes the answer to that question is a resounding “No.” Murgatroyd is helping Medtronic lead the digital transformation of surgery by driving the connectivity of data surgical robots software and healthcare technology. Murgatroyd gave the following interview as part of the MedtronicTalks podcast series. It has been condensed here and edited for clarity.

George Murgatroyd vice president and general manager of Digital Surgery

What is your background?

It’s been an interesting journey. I come from a family of physicians. One of my siblings is a psychiatrist which can make family gatherings pretty interesting. I didn’t study medicine. I studied philosophy and was a drummer in a rock band. But it turns out job boards aren’t awash with jobs for philosophers. And the rock thing kind of fizzled out.

Healthcare has always been a really big draw for me because of my family. I started working at the National Health Service (NHS) almost 20 years ago in primary care which is the first time I came face to face with this paper-based system that really doesn’t have technology designed for physicians – and has limited data. And so for the past few years I've really tried to continue to drive better data better products for doctors their teams and healthcare systems. And it's been a really fun ride so far.

How did you find your way into the healthcare technology industry?

I worked at a leading health data science and software company that was acquired by a multibillion-dollar telecommunications group that was diversifying into health. And then I was approached by the Touch Surgery team. At that time it was a start-up trying to solve some of the key challenges in surgery. I remember my first interview. I turned up in a suit and the CTO (chief technology officer) was wearing shorts and a vest. The company was this amazing combination of technologists AI engineers surgeons medical experts all trying to drive some ambitious goals that convinced me to join and then we came to Medtronic in 2020. And now we're driving that connectivity of software devices robots and data together into something really exciting.

What does the Touch Surgery app do?

We all know surgeons have to be really good with their hands amazing athletes with their hands. But the founders of Touch Surgery were really focused on their cognitive ability the ability of learning and bringing your brain to work. The founders saw real opportunities to utilize technology to aid the education and training of surgeons. So one of the first products they built was an app to host simulations to help inform and train surgeons in the steps of surgery. They firmly believed surgery was a science that followed a certain path and by working with some VFX artists software developers and animators they bought surgery to life at the fingertips on mobile phones. Now thousands and thousands of surgeons have utilized it to learn and rehearse surgery. And I think this created the opportunity to digitize surgery to bring surgery online and move operating rooms away from the textbook into this world of consumer apps.

Why do you think the app is so popular with users?

I think there was just a dearth of access to an immersive experience in terms of surgical training. Most of it has been paper-based. Touch Surgery really brought the end-to-end procedure to life in a highly visual interactive way. Also I think surgery can be quite isolating. There's obviously a community of surgeons but a lot of the work they do is in a room with only themselves and their team. And what I think what we did was bring surgery to life by working with surgeons around the work to define their procedures and de-isolate surgery and bring it to their fingertips.

I think there’s also interest from the public as well. Everyone wants to understand how brain surgery is done how surgeons cut into the skull etc. So we do keep it open and free to the public to democratize really great learning on surgery.

The first AI-powered surgical video management and analytics platform for the operating room Touch Surgery™ Enterprise significantly simplifies the process of recording analyzing and sharing surgical video.

Where does Touch Surgery Enterprise fit into Medtronic?

Put your memory goggles on and rewind 20 years and you think about what your home was like 20 years ago. You watched your TV via cable. You watched your movies through a DVD player played your music by CD. You knew how much money you had in the bank because you got a paper statement. Now think about what's happening in our homes today. Software and technology are absolutely transforming our lives. If you think about the average operating room in terms of software and assisting surgeons to making their lives easier I think we're closer to 2002 than 2022. Surgeons still watch video through DVDs. They still use paper to order items. Their IT equipment is often over a decade old. Between 2002 and 2022 Medtronic has pioneered amazing technology precision engineered instruments robotics platforms and driven an amazing step change in putting these tools into the hands of surgeons.

But what’s missing – the final piece of the pie – is this critical digital element. Layering in this digitization of surgery can act as a force multiplier to devices robotics and medical know-how. We're really on the cusp of a digital transformation of surgery with software and computing focused on improving the clinical experience. We were brought into Medtronic to do precisely this: layer in digital solutions. We joined the surgical robotics division which I think was a very smart move to drive that force multiplier effect purposefully incorporated into a robotic and surgical ecosystem.

What does the future of surgery look like in 20 years?

I think as we move forward there will be increasingly robust information that's going to support surgeons as they train. And it's going to be really meaningful globally to democratize the best surgical practices. And the data element I think is really exciting. There's an opportunity to connect a lot of the information from operating rooms across the patient or surgical pathway and provide a holistic but very nuanced precise way of understanding patient care and surgery. I think a good analogy is smart cars. We have witnessed a revolution in cars becoming smarter assisting drivers with things computers or sensors can predict. We're going to see the same within surgery – and I truly believe lives will be both saved and improved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL21lZHRlY2gvbWVkdHJvbmljLWJlZ2lucy11cy1sYXVuY2gtaW5zdWxpbi1pbmZ1c2lvbi1zZXQtY2FuLWJlLXdvcm4tNy1kYXlz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medtronic begins US launch of 7-day insulin infusion set,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/medtronic-begins-us-launch-insulin-infusion-set-can-be-worn-7-days on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL21lZHRlY2gvbWVkdHJvbmljLWJlZ2lucy11cy1sYXVuY2gtaW5zdWxpbi1pbmZ1c2lvbi1zZXQtY2FuLWJlLXdvcm4tNy1kYXlz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vaGl0Y29uc3VsdGFudC5uZXQvMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9tZWR0cm9uaWMtbGF1bmNoZXMtaW5mdXNpb24tc2V0LWZvci1pbnN1bGluLXB1bXBzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medtronic Launches World's First and Only Infusion Set for Insulin Pumps,"What You Should Know:

Although one in every six people live with overactive bladder (OAB) and one in 12 with fecal incontinence these conditions are largely absent from health conversations in the United States.

“This is incredibly debilitating for people” said Mira Sahney president of the Pelvic Health business at Medtronic. “It takes away their freedom to live their lives whether that’s to work to be with family and to do activities that many of us take for granted.”

Overactive bladder disproportionately affects women with an estimated 40% of women in the U.S. living with this condition according to the American Urological Association. But incontinence can affect people of all ages and many people living with OAB don’t ask for help.

And while incontinence is commonly thought to be a normal part of aging that is simply not true Sahney said. It requires treatment like any other condition.

Despite the widespread prevalence of incontinence people with these conditions often go years suffering in silence due to the social stigma. Meanwhile it significantly impacts quality of life including social activities exercise intimacy and sleep.

In the past 25 years ago Medtronic Pelvic Health therapies have treated over 375000 patients. Learn more from Sahney about how Medtronic Pelvic Health is making treatment options more widely known easier to access and more equitable on the MedtronicTalks podcast.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

Meta Platforms reportedly fired or disciplined more than two dozen employees and contractors who allegedly compromised and took control of Facebook user accounts The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.

Bribery was involved in some cases the Journal reported citing sources and documents.

The report said users who were locked out of their Facebook accounts often weren't able to regain access through traditional means such as reaching out to Facebook directly. So some users resorted to seeking outside sources who have contacts within Meta who were willing to unlock accounts for them.

In some cases according to documents viewed by the Journal workers accepted thousands of dollars in bribes from hackers to compromise or access user accounts.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Meta Platforms appointed Sandhya Devanathan as its India head on Thursday days after Ajit Mohan quit to join rival Snap Inc.

WhatsApp's India head Abhijit Bose and Meta Platforms's public policy director in India Rajiv Aggarwal also resigned earlier this week.

Devanathan's appointment comes at a time when Facebook is facing regulatory challenges in India with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration tightening laws governing Big Tech companies.

The company has for years faced criticism for doing little to curb the spread of fake news and hate speech in India.

Devanathan has been with Meta since 2016 and will move into her new role in January.

MetLife Stadium is one of six NFL stadiums that is currently using slit film turf.

MetLife Stadium is currently reviewing proposals for new synthetic playing surfaces according to ESPN. Giants safety and team NFLPA union representative Julian Love confirmed that MetLife Stadium will be changing surfaces for next season.

""The Giants and MetLife are in the process of getting things done for next year"" Love told NJ Advance Media. ""That turf will be changed. The stats have shown that we are on one of the worst fields in the league.""

Love said that while he and the majority of NFL players would prefer to play on grass he would settle for the next best product if that is not an option.

""Part of the challenge is the two teams and all of the events that [happen] on that field and so we would love grass"" Love said. ""But if that's not feasible then the new state-of-the-art turf that is available will have to go down instead. The Giants are on the ball on that type of thing and I think there is now a push to make everybody the same way.""

Slit film turf is currently used in six stadiums: MetLife Stadium (New York Giants and New York Jets) Ford Field (Detroit Lions) U.S. Bank Stadium (Minnesota Vikings) Caesars Superdome (New Orleans Saints) Lucas Oil Stadium (Indianapolis Colts) and Paycor Stadium (Cincinnati Bengals).

In his letter NFLPA president JC Tretter noted that games played on slit film turf have higher in-game injury rates compared to other playing surfaces. Non-contact injuries and foot and ankle injuries are among the injuries that statistically occur more on slit film turf according to Tretter.

""The NFL and its experts have agreed with this data and acknowledge that the slit film field is less safe"" Tretter wrote. ""Player leadership wrote a letter to the NFL this week demanding the immediate removal of these fields and a ban on them going forward both in stadiums and for practice fields. The NFL has not only refused to mandate this change immediately but they have also refused to commit to mandating a change away from slit film in the future at all.""

Tretter is also asking the NFL to not allow games to be played on fields with clear visual abnormalities. He also wants the NFL to raise the field standards and test the safety and performance of all field surfaces. Lastly Tretter called on the NFL to clear excess people and dangerous equipment from the sidelines.

""We play one of the most dangerous sports in the world; it shouldn't be more dangerous because the clubs won't do anything to remove the simple injury risks on practice and playing surfaces"" Tretter wrote. ""If the league wants to actually use data to drive its decisions then do it already. We've been waiting for years for some of these changes.""

Tretter's concerns regarding slit film turf have merit. Just ask the 49ers who lost a host of players in 2020 after San Francisco played games at MetLife Stadium. Richard Sherman a 49ers cornerback at the time and currently the NFLPA vice president called on the NFL to ban slit film turf while using his spotlight as an Amazon analyst for Thursday night games.

""It needs to change immediately"" Sherman said via Cincinnati.com. ""The league champions player safety. And when there's clear evidence of a playing surface being dangerous -- there's nine more serious injuries on this surface than even other turfs -- like you need to change it now.""

Several current high-profile players have recently weighed in on the topic. Among them is Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow who offered a possible solution to the issue.

""Field quality is the first thing you notice when you walk out there"" said Burrow whose team is one of seven teams that currently uses slit film turf. ""Changes the cleats you wear. Changes how you cut how you run routes all the above. So I think having a universal turf would be a great thing for for us as players. I don't know the stats on it or injuries or anything based off of the playing surface.

""I personally like playing on turf but I do wish that each stadium had the same turf.""

Burrow's comments come after Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers challenged the NFL to look deeper into the correlation between field surfaces and player safety. Rodgers is an advocate for playing on grass fields.

""As much as I've enjoyed playing indoors over the years on turf I do think it's time to play on grass"" Rodgers said. ""I think you'd see less of these non-contact injuries.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2J1c2luZXNzam91cm5hbC5jb20vRGFpbHkvSXNzdWVzLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvRmFjaWxpdGllcy9NZXRMaWZlLUZpZWxkLXJlcGxhY2VtZW50LW5vLWdyYXNzLmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MetLife Stadium to replace field in 2023 won't add grass,"MetLife Stadium is “in the process of reviewing proposals to replace the current FieldTurf that has come under fire in recent years” according to Jordan Raanan of ESPN. The stadium which currently is using a version of FieldTurf “is contemplating new synthetic surfaces not the natural grass that players have publicly called for in recent weeks.” Players and the NFLPA “have been vocal in recent weeks” about wanting all grass fields “not just at MetLife Stadium.” However according to recent data the NFL's recent rate of non-contact injuries to the knee ankle and foot “is roughly the same on natural and artificial playing surfaces.” The numbers contradict anecdotal observations this season from a wide swath of players agents and coaches who have called for the league to convert all surfaces to grass in response to a series of high-profile injuries on artificial turf. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said earlier this month on 105.3 The Fan that the NFL “has no plans to do so” citing the current data (ESPN.com 11/17).

THE WORST: Giants S & Giants NFLPA Representative Julian Love said the stats have shown they are “on one of the worst fields in the league.” Love: “Part of the challenge is the two teams and all of the events that [happen] on that field and so we would love grass but if that’s not feasible then the new state-of-the-art turf that is available will have to go down instead.” He added “The Giants are on the ball on that type of thing and I think there is now a push to make everybody the same way.” NJ.com’s Bob Brookover notes complaints “have been coming in about the MetLife Stadium turf almost since its installation” in September 2020. The preference of the players “is obviously grass” but Love acknowledged that MetLife Stadium “presents a difficult set of challenges because two teams play there and it’s also host to concerts and other events in the offseason.” Other cities however “in similar climates have grass fields” (NJ.com 11/16).

HIGH INJURY RISK: ESPN’s Tony Reali said the NFLPA has “called for an immediate replacement and ban of all turf playing surfaces citing a higher risk of injuries. This has been something players have been calling out for years.” ESPN’s Mina Kimes said “I tend to side with the players … simply because there’s not a financial impetus for the PA to make this argument. They’re doing it because the players believe it is unsafe” but it is “costly to change these surfaces.” Kimes: “It does seem like a cost that’s reasonable to bear (and) it’s what the players want so I think they should do it.” But ESPN’s Sarah Spain said “once you have the science telling you that there isn’t that definitive difference what you’re dealing with is players who are probably reacting to anecdotal evidence which is a certain player that they or their teammates know that moved them on the topic.” Spain: “The numbers don’t bear out right now for that kind of expense.” The Washington Post’s Kevin Blackistone said “there should all grass” fields in the NFL but “you’ve got to make sure you take care of it.” ESPN’s Frank Isola: “If you have grass in cold-weather cities like Pittsburgh Cleveland Baltimore there’s no reason why everyone can’t have it” (“Around The Horn” ESPN 11/16).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4L21ldGxpZmUtc3RhZGl1bS10by1yZXBsYWNlLWZpZWxkLWluLTIwMjMtYnV0LW5vdC13aXRoLWdyYXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MetLife Stadium to replace field in 2023 but not with grass,"MetLife Stadium’s much-scrutinized field surface is getting replaced in 2023 — but it still won’t be grass.

“We evaluate our field each season and historically have replaced our playing surface every 3-4 years” MetLife Stadium said in a statement to ESPN on Thursday. “We have made the decision to replace the field in 2023 and are currently reviewing proposals from multiple vendors for a new synthetic surface.”

Giants safety Julian Love speaking to NJ Advance Media said the “stats have shown that we are on one of the worst fields in the league.”

The surface is currently a version of FieldTurf and it’s drawn plenty of criticism these season following Sterling Shepard’s season-ending ACL injury on Sept. 27 in a Giants loss to the Cowboys.

It was the latest in a string of injuries to players at MetLife. In 2020 the 49ers lost Nick Bosa and Solomon Thomas to torn ACLs during their Week 2 matchup with the Jets. In the 2022 season opener against the Jets Ravens corner back Kyle Fuller was lost for the year after tearing his ACL.

Thomas now a Jet has been among those calling for a change at MetLife.

Michael Carter N.Y. Post: Charles Wenzelberg

“I believe in the NFL we shouldn’t have turf fields” Jets tackle Solomon Thomas told The Post after Shepard’s injury. “I believe we should have grass fields like the Premier League in England. The risk of non-contact injury is significantly higher on turf fields. … I believe as players we should be protected better.”

According to data reviewed by ESPN on non-contact injuries to the knee ankle and foot those injuries occur at roughly the same rate on turf and grass surfaces. The data contradicts what players have been saying about changing to grass surfaces due to high-profile injuries that occurred on turf surfaces.

Despite that the NFLPA is glad that the MetLife turf is at least being upgraded.

“The players have been vocal and clear about this issue and it is a good step to hear them that change needs to be made” the NFLPA said in a statement to ESPN. “The change will not come soon enough though for players who will be at greater risk the rest of the season. We expect that whatever surface gets installed next year will meet the highest safety and performance standards possible.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vZ2lhbnRzLzIwMjIvMTEvZ2lhbnRzLXNhZmV0eS1qdWxpYW4tbG92ZS1zYXlzLW1ldGxpZmUtc3RhZGl1bS10dXJmLXdpbGwtYmUtY2hhbmdlZC1ieS1zdGFydC1vZi1uZXh0LXNlYXNvbi5odG1s0gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9naWFudHMvMjAyMi8xMS9naWFudHMtc2FmZXR5LWp1bGlhbi1sb3ZlLXNheXMtbWV0bGlmZS1zdGFkaXVtLXR1cmYtd2lsbC1iZS1jaGFuZ2VkLWJ5LXN0YXJ0LW9mLW5leHQtc2Vhc29uLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giants player rep Julian Love reveals MetLife Stadium turf — ‘one of the worst’ in NFL — will be changed by n,"The NFL turf wars have been brewing for a while now and the Giants and Jets have been right in the middle of the melee simply because of the place they call home.

Any racing fans out there have $1 million to spare? Wynn Las Vegas wants to make you a deal.

Ahead of next year’s Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix the hotel is advertising a “personally curated all-access” race weekend experience for the high high price of $1 million.

Included in the package are daily rides to and from the race as well as airport transportation; spa treatments; caviar; four nights in a three-bedroom duplex; luxury seating at a show; VIP passes for a variety of race-related events; and much much more.

The “all-access experience” is designed for six people to enjoy meaning that it averages out to about $167000 per head.

“This one-in-a-lifetime opportunity will really get your heart racing” Wynn’s advertisement says.

The pricey package may sound extreme but it’s well-matched with a racing event that’s expected to be one of the most expensive of the year. Price of admission starts at $500 which gets you a three-day general admission pass according to The Associated Press.

“We are going to deliver the greatest spectacle in the world as a statement of F1. That needs to be recognized and in terms of price positioning we are going to be on the top side because this is Las Vegas and that is the nature of the customer coming to Las Vegas” said Stefano Domenicali the CEO of Formula One to the AP.

Race organizers and sponsors are also trying to recoup the high costs of bringing a Formula One event to Las Vegas.

“For us as a company this will be the largest race in terms of revenues. It will also be the most expensive race in terms of costs” said Greg Maffei CEO of Liberty Media which owns Formula One to the AP.

Wynn Las Vegas is a founding partner of the race and so are MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Like Wynn the latter two companies plan to offer lavish race weekend packages for wealthy racing fans Front Office Sports reported.

“MGM CEO Bill Hornbuckle has said that the company will purchase between $20 million and $25 million in F1 tickets to offer in packages including some that cost upwards of $100000” the article said. “Caesars packages for race tickets food and a three-night stay average $2600 per night.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2RldmVsb3Blci1sYXVuY2hpbmctZmlyc3Qtc291dGhlcm4tbmV2YWRhLXdhcmVob3VzZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudHMtMjY3ODE4OS_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9kZXZlbG9wZXItbGF1bmNoaW5nLWZpcnN0LXNvdXRoZXJuLW5ldmFkYS13YXJlaG91c2UtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnRzLTI2NzgxODkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Developer launching first Southern Nevada warehouse developments,"Link Logistics which already owns around 9 million square feet of industrial space in the region recently announced plans for two new complexes in North Las Vegas.

Construction can start on first phase of Las Vegas Spaceport

New York financial giant Blackstone is a major landlord in Las Vegas with megaresorts on the Strip and other buildings in its portfolio.

Now an industrial real estate firm it owns is developing its first Southern Nevada warehouse projects.

Link Logistics which owns around 9 million square feet of industrial space in the region recently announced plans to build two new complexes in North Las Vegas that will span more than 1 million square feet combined.

One project Desert Palm will feature a 350000-square-foot facility on Cheyenne Avenue just west of Interstate 15. The other Desert Willow will consist of three buildings totaling 720000 square feet at Commerce Street and Gowan Road according to a news release.

Both are expected to be finished in the fourth quarter next year the release said. It noted that Link focuses across the U.S. on infill sites or plots surrounded by existing development.

Southern Nevada’s warehouse market grew considerably over the last several years and accelerated even more after the pandemic hit as increased online shopping fueled demand for distribution space. Industrial vacancies are at all-time lows and developers keep launching new projects especially in North Las Vegas.

Joe Williams director of development in the west region for Link told the Review-Journal that infill sites are near population centers and can serve local businesses.

Matthew Duplantis Link’s market officer for Nevada and Arizona also pointed to the business generated by the convention industry and said if a building is a certain distance away from say the Las Vegas Convention Center tenants are unlikely to get hired by attendees to truck in goods or materials.

Blackstone led by billionaire Stephen Schwarzman kicked off a real estate buying spree in Southern Nevada after the economy crashed a decade or so ago acquiring rental houses apartment complexes and office buildings.

It bought The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for $1.73 billion in 2014 then sold the flashy hotel-casino for $5.65 billion in a deal that closed this spring. It still has a heavy presence on the Strip having acquired as a landlord several MGM Resorts International-operated properties in recent years.

It purchased Bellagio’s real estate for $4.2 billion in 2019; teamed up to acquire MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay in 2020 in a deal that valued those properties at $4.6 billion; and purchased Aria and Vdara’s real estate last year for nearly $3.9 billion.

Blackstone acquired a huge portfolio of U.S. industrial buildings from Singapore real estate giant GLP for $18.7 billion in 2019 giving the buyer 179 million square feet of infill logistics properties.

Blackstone which formed Link Logistics in 2019 acquired more than 4.7 million square feet of industrial space in Southern Nevada through the GLP deal according to Duplantis.

Check out these Vegas bars and lounges,"You’ve brought your lover to Las Vegas but now you need to know where to take them. The pressure is off my friends because we’ve made the choice for you. Any of the following spots are perfect for a romantic rendezvous.

Sleek and sexy with a bit of old-school Vegas glamour is what S Bar at Mandalay Bay offers. The lounge filled with dark woods brass accents luxe drapery and plush seating offers eclectic live music and an impressive menu of specialty cocktails. Beautiful in presentation and delicious in flavor the cocktails are a mix of fruits juices and herbs. Might we suggest the That’s What I Like option—for $75 per person you get champagne and strawberries all evening. For those looking to love late into the night S Bar recently launched its after-hours party on Saturday nights “Late Affair.” The immersive evening is filled with sexy performance art guest engagement and sultry deep-house music from international DJs. This one-of-a-kind party begins after midnight and go until the sun rises.

While many people opt for dinner at The Mayfair Supper Club at Bellagio we prefer the lounge area for cocktails and conversation. The supper club feel and décor is simply stunning. We recommend grabbing a seat at the bar and browsing through an impressive menu of champagne (we love the champagne cocktails!) wine and both modern and classic cocktails. The ambience will truly transport you and your sweetie to old-school Vegas.

For a date with awesome views head to Alle Lounge on 66 at Resorts World Las Vegas. Entering the lounge on the 66th floor feels and looks as if you’ve entered some very rich person’s New York City loft. The look and design of the space is quite slick with floor-to-ceiling windows that look out over the city. There’s plenty of sofa seating and club chairs. And Alle on 66 also provides some very rare bottled brown spirits that’ll break the bank—so if you want to splurge this is place to do it. Guests can also enjoy a menu of elevated bar-food options like oysters on the half shell and wagyu sliders. Live jazz and contemporary music round out the experience.

One of the most-intimate bars and decadent in décor on the Strip is Rosina Cocktail Lounge at The Venetian. Try and snag one of the semi-private booths for real romance vibes. The champagne call button—yes they’ll bring you champagne with the push of a button—will keep you seated and your date happy and giddy all night.

Our last recommendation is off-Strip at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas. The Shag Room (I mean the name!) is bohemian-meets-Arabian nights-meets-Moroccan décor—visually it’s such a cool setting. Enjoy delicious bourbon and specialty cocktails and live music on the weekends and open-mic nights during the week.

Citing intelligence documents the outlet estimated that three-quarters of the components were found to be American-made despite Tehran being subjected to harsh sanctions.

The aim of the sanctions is largely to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons but includes other arms development such as drones.

Japanese Components Found

Ukrainian investigators also found Japanese components in Iranian Mohajer-6 drones captured intact after being hacked mid-flight.

Nearly a third of the drone’s components were of Japanese origin while roughly half were manufactured by US firms. The findings were revealed and verified by Kyiv-based nonprofit the Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO) which also inspected the drone.

The servomotors in the Mohajer-6 drone essential to maneuver the aircraft were made by Japanese firm Tonegawa-Seiko Co. according to the intelligence documents and NAKO report.

Third-Party Distributors

Similarly several electronic components of the drone were manufactured by German-owned Infineon Technologies AG and Arizona-based Microchip Technology Inc. two of the most prominent global chip manufacturers.

A spokesman for Microchip Brian Thorsen told The Wall Street Journal “without access to the device itself we are unable to advise whether it is a Microchip product or counterfeit product and if it is a Microchip product how it ended up in this particular application.”

He said that the company supplies its products to more than 120000 customers in the industrial aerospace defense and other sectors adding that third-party distributors also sell its products worldwide.

Israeli Infrared Lens in Iranian Drone?

The outlet also claimed that the Mohajer’s high-resolution telescopic infrared lens looks identical to a model made by Ophir Optronics Solutions Ltd. a Jerusalem-based firm citing the device image and company brochures.

The company’s parent organization MKS Instruments Inc. said they don’t supply to Iran.

The Israeli government responded to the report following a review saying that “the relevant international export control regimes indicate that the lens is neither a controlled defense item nor a dual-use item according to Israeli law based on international arrangements.”

Probe Ordered

The US officials responsible for export-control enforcement declined to verify the findings the outlet said.

However the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security has launched an investigation into the matter.

Iran’s mission to the United Nations also avoided a direct response saying that Tehran “is ready to meet with Ukraine at the level of technical experts and investigate drone- or parts-ownership claims.”

Export-Control Loopholes

Citing a report of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security The Wall Street Journal wrote that Chinese companies might be supplying Iran with counterfeit Western components essential to produce combat drones.

Industry and Western security officials said that many of the parts are not covered under export control and could have been bought on the internet and shipped to Iran through other countries a violation of the law but difficult to prevent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWxsaXNyYWVsLmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0b3JzLWZpbmQtaXJhbmlhbi1kcm9uZXMtaW4tcnVzc2lhLXMtYXJzZW5hbC1jb250YWluLW1vc3RseS13ZXN0ZXJuLW1hZGUtcGFydHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investigators find Iranian drones in Russia's arsenal contain Israeli-made parts,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWxsaXNyYWVsLmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0b3JzLWZpbmQtaXJhbmlhbi1kcm9uZXMtaW4tcnVzc2lhLXMtYXJzZW5hbC1jb250YWluLW1vc3RseS13ZXN0ZXJuLW1hZGUtcGFydHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E61092BA00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWxsaXNyYWVsLmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0b3JzLWZpbmQtaXJhbmlhbi1kcm9uZXMtaW4tcnVzc2lhLXMtYXJzZW5hbC1jb250YWluLW1vc3RseS13ZXN0ZXJuLW1hZGUtcGFydHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JhZGxlLmNvL2FydGljbGVzLWlkLzIxMTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ukraine claims Iranian drones used by Russia '75 percent US made': Report,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2lyYW4tdXNpbmctaXNyYWVsaS1jb21wb25lbnRzLWluLWl0cy1zdWljaWRlLXVhdnMtdGhhdC1ydXNzaWEv0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vaXJhbi11c2luZy1pc3JhZWxpLWNvbXBvbmVudHMtaW4taXRzLXN1aWNpZGUtdWF2cy10aGF0LXJ1c3NpYS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iranian Suicide UAVs Blasting Ukraine Use Israeli Technology; WSJ Report Says Most Other Parts Made In US & Japan,"Iranian drones employed by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine were found to feature Israeli-made infrared lenses which are utilized for attack and surveillance purposes WSJ reported.

The WSJ report includes documentation from Ukrainian experts who examined downed Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles and concluded that despite a strict sanctions framework most of the components were made in the United States Japan Israel and other Western nations.

The findings have startled Western analysts prompting the US government to investigate. It also comes at a time when the West is starting to perceive Tehran’s arsenal of unmanned aircraft as a threat after their effectiveness in Ukraine.

The discovery was made by Ukrainian researchers while investigating downed Iranian-manufactured drones including a Mohajer-6 that was hacked mid-flight and landed intact.

Images of the Iranian-made Mohajer-6 analyzed by experts show that the high-resolution telescopic infrared lens in the device is similar to a model designed by the Israeli company Ophir Optronics Solutions Ltd.

The WSJ was informed by MKS Instruments Inc the parent company of Ophir that it does not sell components to Iran and adheres to sanctions.

On November 16 in response to the report the Israeli Defense Ministry said that Israel is evaluating the findings. A preliminary investigation revealed that the lens in question is neither a regulated defense equipment nor a dual-use item.

Ukrainian intelligence believed that the infrared camera discovered aboard the Mohajer-6 was made by Oregon-based Sierra-Olympic Technologies Inc which uses Ophir lenses.

The company’s founder Chris Johnston told WSJ that while some aspects of the device look the same other parts are different indicating that his company didn’t make it.

Johnston said that the components might have come from downed Western aircraft in Iraq and Afghanistan or from middlemen who broke US sanctions.

Western Components In Iranian Drones

In addition to the Israeli component the researcher discovered around 200 other components from the United States Europe and other allied nations in Iranian drones used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.

Approximately half of the nearly 200 technical components in the captured Mohajer-6 were manufactured in the United States with the other third manufactured in Japan. The report noted that Japan’s Tonegawa-Seiko Co made the servomotors of the drone.

The Tonegawa-Seiko Corporation was charged by Japan’s Trade Ministry in 2021 for illegally shipping servomotors to China without required approval after UN inspectors discovered one in an Iranian drone.

The company asserted that it was unaware they would be utilized in military drones. The Iranian drone also contained components from Arizona-based Microchip Technology Inc and Infineon Technologies AG a German company.

The discoveries are the latest in a series of investigations and studies into Western-made parts found in Iranian drones.

Earlier this month a Mohajer-6 drone was found to have parts made by at least 15 different technological companies from North America the EU Japan and Taiwan including from the US-based Texas Instruments firm the Schemes investigation has found.

In response Texas Instruments said it does not export parts to Iran Belarus or Russia. Tehran has a global procurement network of front companies and other proxies in other nations.

Daniel Salisbury a senior research fellow with the Department of War Studies at King’s College London earlier told RFE/RL that exporters mistakenly believe they are selling to an end customer based in the [United Arab Emirates] or another third country when in reality the final user is in Iran.

In addition the Institute for Science and International Security discovered components made in Austria Germany the UK and the US in October after analyzing open-source data from the downed Iranian drones.

The Shahed-136 Shahed-131 and Mohajer-6 drones used significant amounts of Western-made parts. Meanwhile it was also recently revealed that Russia had given Western weapons to Iran in exchange for drones that helped Moscow attack Ukrainian cities.

According to a security source who spoke to Sky News a Russian military aircraft also secretly transferred a shipment of military hardware provided initially to Ukraine by the UK and US but “fell into Russian hands.”

The latest investigation report once more exposed the vast network of Iranian-backed proxy companies operating worldwide to buy Western-made components for its drone fleet."

The recent Chips 101 event hosted by Rochester Institute of Technology’s Government and Community Relations on Nov. 16 at the university kept to that premise. More than 50 regional government and corporate representatives learned how computer chips are designed and manufactured—and how universities government and workforce development initiatives will contribute to this area becoming a major U.S. resource in the end-to-end process of producing and assembling computer chips for consumer devices such as cell phones.

At RIT undergraduate students are learning how to produce computer chips; at other universities students are seeing this process for the first time in graduate school. Workforce training for corporations and veterans is also being done extensively at RIT where participants are immediately finding entry- and mid-level positions and regular training in advanced electronic assembly processing is taking place for students and companies.

‌ Gabrielle Plucknette-DeVito

Visitors at the event learned much about the fast-moving industry including a misconception that computer chips are only produced overseas. Southeast Asia is a dominating force and U.S. initiatives are focused on catching up and surpassing production. There are numerous fabrication facilities across the U.S. and more are planned but challenges to increase production are in time and resources. Today’s products require more transistors to ensure the highest speeds and processing power for multiple inter-related functions.

“It is amazing just how small the form factor is yet how thin and delicate these structures are. There are more components on the chip that need to communicate together. But better communication means better devices” said Karl Hirschman professor and director of the microelectronic engineering program in RIT’s Kate Gleason College of Engineering.

It takes three months to make computer chips. In 1971 2300 transistors were used for devices. In 2004 more than 125 million were used “which is relatively old compared to today’s technology where billions may be used for integrated circuits. And this trend is increasing upward” Hirschman explained.

Chips are vastly smaller — 20 to 30 nanometers which is one billionth of a meter — but far more powerful often stacked in confined spaces with specialty functions such as memory or imaging interfaces for example.

Micron Technology one of the top producers of computer memory chips recently announced a major investment in central New York that will enhance an ecosystem that includes the manufacturing required and necessary supply chain resources.

“What makes a fab special is its people and that is the reason we are here. Semiconductor companies build near other fabrication centers. The supply chain will continue to grow” said Carson Henry senior director U.S. Expansion Strategic Program Management. He oversees the development of two new and extensive fabrication facilities in the U.S. “Everyone has something to contribute and this area has a rich talent pipeline.”

Upstate New York’s ecosystem of universities and a rich talent pipeline the imaging and optics industries established in the region and natural resources are keys to the decision to invest in the region.

Producing chips is one part of the extensive equation to put chips into devices. Another entails the extensive workforce talent needed to assemble chips onto circuit boards for products.

Not only are more chips needed but the assembly process for the circuit boards that go into the broad range of devices and systems is intensifying said Martin Anselm associate professor of mechanical engineering technology in RIT’s College of Engineering Technology. He also is director of CEMA—RIT’s Center for Electronic Manufacturing and Assembly.

“We have a hand in all the different processes from designing computer chips to circuit boards to final products. CEMA is equipped with a manufacturing line you could find anywhere in the world and many of our graduates can be found in the semiconductor industry furthering their overall manufacturing process” Anselm explained. “We are teaching every step in the process.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2VtaWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9oaWdoLW5hLWV1di1jb21wbGljYXRlcy1ldXYtcGhvdG9tYXNrLWZ1dHVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High-NA EUV Complicates EUV Photomask Future,"The impact of EUV on mask spend increasing use of pellicles and whether circular masks are on the horizon.

The eBeam Initiative’s 11th annual Luminaries survey in 2022 reported EUV fueling growth of the semiconductor photomask industry while a panel of experts cited a number of complications in moving to High-NA EUV during an event co-located with the SPIE Photomask Technology Conference in late September. Industry luminaries representing 44 companies from across the semiconductor ecosystem participated in this year’s survey. Aki Fujimura CEO of D2S Inc. the managing company sponsor of the eBeam Initiative moderated the panel discussion about this year’s survey results. He was joined by Naoya Hayashi DNP Honorary Fellow; Harry Levinson Principal Lithographer at HJL Lithography; Ezequiel Russell Senior Director of Mask Technology at Micron Technology; and Noriaki Nakayamada Senior Technology Expert at NuFlare Technology. This is part one of the discussion.

Fujimura: The results of this year’s survey show a very bright outlook for multi-beam mask writing and EUV. Let’s look at EUV first. 78% of those surveyed said EUV masks would make a positive contribution to 2022 photomask revenues shown in figure 1. Harry EUV currently involves single patterning of the critical layers versus multiple patterning generating multiple masks for optical lithography. So why doesn’t that end up reducing mask revenues?

Fig. 1: Luminaries surveyed view EUV masks as a positive for mask revenues.

Levinson: Everything about EUV is more expensive. There are lots of reasons EUV masks are more expensive starting with the mask blank. I also think without pellicles people make multiple masks. So even though it’s single patterning you have multiple masks. But the EUV benefits are worth it – yield cycle time turnaround time (TAT). Suppose that we replace 10 layers triple-patterned with optical lithography with 10 single exposure EUV lithography steps. With 20 fewer lithography operations reduction of thin film depositions etches and cleans at 1.5 days between mask steps total process time is reduced by nearly one month by using EUV lithography! Basically EUV is “expensive but worth it.”

Russell: While EUV masks are more expensive the additional resolution that EUV brings makes the ROI positive for a lot of companies at the leading edge. EUV mask lifetimes are shorter so you order more of the same mask which increases the mask spend.

Hayashi-san: EUV mask production materials and process costs are quite high contributing to cost of EUV masks. Mask blanks are expensive and EUV-specific quality assurance tools are needed.

Nakayamada-san: Defect mitigation adds to cost. You need more EUV mask blanks which increases the total mask revenue.

Levinson: So EUV just costs more and it’s worth it because of improvement in wafer quality.

Fujimura: What about the EUV mask challenges – have they been solved for 0.33 NA? Let’s talk about pellicles first. In figure 2 luminaries surveyed think EUV pellicle usage is trending up.

Fig. 2: Luminaries surveyed see increasing use of EUV pellicles.

Hayashi-san: Pellicles are currently not a problem because we already know EUV pellicles are in high-volume manufacturing. Okay for now but of course improvements are always needed.

Levinson: Whether to use an EUV pellicle is a decision each company must make trading off between loss of transmission and yield. Michael Lercel from ASML presented a very good paper on this topic a few years ago. For memories you can take the risk of defects but for logic pellicles are a good thing. People seem to be following Lercel’s logic.

Fujimura: EUV mask inspection has been a challenge but the Luminaries remain confident again this year in EUV actinic inspection with 69% agreeing that it will be used in 2023 for HVM shown in figure 3. What changed from last year’s survey is the agreement on eBeam mask inspection which is down to 24% from 42% last year.

Fig. 3: Luminaries surveyed have confidence in actinic EUV inspection.

Hayashi-san: I think actinic could be taking attention away from eBeam inspection. In future High-NA EUV may need more resolution. Even actinic inspection may reach a resolution limit. eBeam inspection could be one of the candidates for High-NA EUV.

Fujimura: Let’s talk about High-NA EUV. New questions in this survey indicate that while High-NA EUV first usage could be by 2026 it will take until 2027 and beyond for broad HVM by more than one company (figure 4). Harry you’re on the IEEE International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). What’s the IRDS roadmap counting on?

Fig. 4: Luminaries answered new questions about High-NA EUV.

Levinson: Insertion is largely dependent on ASML’s timeline. Can’t be faster than ASML’s timeline which is early 2025. But for high-volume manufacturing you have to have multiple tools up and operational. When you look at multiple companies it would be difficult to see more than one company by 2026 but by 2027 I think we could see a lot of activity in wafer fabs.

Fujimura: Ezequiel I imagine you’re saying “we’re busy with .33” but any thoughts on High-NA EUV? When did you say it’d be broadly used by more than one company?

Russell: For memory applications it may be a little different than logic. First we will push .33 EUV to the resolution limit. For High-NA it’s not clear it will provide enough ROI for insertion because of other scaling difficulties. It may require a different architecture to overcome. So High-NA EUV may not be as attractive for memory makers. It will depend on when it’s available and when it’s cost effective for memory makers to transition.

Fujimura: What are the mask challenges for High-NA EUV?

Hayashi-san: The big difference for High-NA mask is the anamorphic optics which is 8x magnification in the Y direction and 4x in the X direction. This decision was made explicitly so that the existing mask infrastructure works. Maybe a challenge is the more critical specifications in the 4x direction or both directions.

Fujimura: What about the perspective from a mask writer Nakayamada-san?

Nakayamada-san: There is a good opportunity to align the writers to match a looser spec in the Y direction. Even though the spec doesn’t change it will still work.

Fujimura: What about circular masks? It’s related to High-NA. What’s the basic idea Harry?

Levinson: When you go to the anamorphic optics with 8x and 4x magnification and you keep the mask the same size it’s problematic on the wafer as the field size is only half of what we’re used to. Then you must utilize techniques like stitching which isn’t a trivial thing. What you really need is a bigger mask. I believe Intel made the observation if you could make your mask on 300mm round substrates it’s a familiar task. There are a lot of things that would need to be checked with circular masks. Would you have to modify the reticle stage in the scanner? Otherwise I think it’s a good proposal and worth looking at a lot more closely.

Hayashi-san: We tried round-shaped masks in the past a long time ago. Can the mask writer handle it? Writing uniformly across a bigger field is probably a challenge. Technology-wise circular masks are a good idea but not sure it’s a good business idea. A merchant mask house doesn’t have a 300mm process tool so that’s kind of a big challenge for us!

Fujimura: Nakayamada-san can the mask writers do that? Isn’t that a big change?

Nakayamada-san: The problem would be if a customer requests an interchangeable stage writing a square six-inch mask at the same time they want to write a circular 300mm mask.

Russell: I agree with the panel that from a technology point of view it’s feasible and it makes sense since we already have the 300mm machines in the wafer fabs. But I see this as a problem for mask shops. They don’t want to maintain dual equipment for regular six-inch masks as well as for circular masks. I don’t know how many nodes High-NA EUV will support and how many layers per node so we may be talking about a small number of masks. Changing the infrastructure for just a few nodes may not make economic sense.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1bWFucmVzb3VyY2Vzb25saW5lLm5ldC9taWNyb24tcy1jaGVyLXdlZS1zaW0td2UtbmVlZC10by10aGluay1kaWZmZXJlbnRseS1hYm91dC1vdXItdGFsZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS1hbmQtb3V0cmVhY2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron's Cher Whee Sim: We need to think differently about our talent community and outreach,"On the radar for Cher Whee Sim Vice President Global Talent Acquisition and Talent Mobility Micron Technology is the need to develop greater leaders who inspire.

In conversation with HRO's Lara Samson Sim talks about the multi-faceted approach that is required to cope with the current talent shortage.

Interview excerpts below:

Q What in your view are the top challenges and opportunities of leading HR in your sector and remit?

The top challenges and opportunities for the HR team are creating an inclusive culture where every person - no matter where they are in the world and regardless of their background makes an impact feels valued grows their career and prioritises wellbeing.

In addition the fierce talent competition requires HR to innovate and improvise our talent attraction development and retention strategies for the future of the workforce workplace and work.

Q With most organisations looking to recover and rebound where are you finding the headcount your team needs and how are you coping with the talent shortage?

We need a multi-faceted approach both internally and externally. It is critical to prioritise our internal team members' development upskilling and reskilling developing greater leaders who inspire retaining your talents and investing in strengthening our diversity equality and inclusion culture.

We also need to think differently about our talent community and outreach such as expanding your talent search and engagement beyond borders diverse industries and experience as well as shifting the mindset of being an employer to an educator and influencer in building a talent pipeline.

Q Brain drain is a real concern in Asia at the moment. In this time of manpower shortage how are you and the team preparing to manage these talent-related challenges?

We must relentlessly focus on our people culture and purpose strategies including people focused smart working future ready and community impact. These priorities include:

investing in our team members' wellbeing in five elements such as physical mental social career and financial

advancing learning and career development opportunities for our team members to enable skills for the future

equipping our team members with tools technology and knowledge to enable efficiency and effectiveness and

cultivating giving and volunteerism promoting social justice and sustainability.

Underpinning these strategies are our diversity equality and inclusion culture and leaders' development and empowerment.

Q Looking towards 2023 what's the biggest change that you believe needs to take place in HR?

HR must acquire skills and capabilities to build greater resilience and agility in the organisation as we will continue to lead in an unprecedented and uncertain environment. These capabilities include new institutional roles such as DEI business partnering workforce digital transformation leader team member advocate wellbeing specialist talent intelligence analyst and workplace experience designer.

Besides we need to diversify our HR footprint so we listen to our workforce and talent community and empower with 'lead local scale global' agility. Finally investing in upskilling the HR team through our digital academy programme functional master proficiency storytelling and having an 'I2I-Invigorate to Innovate' day in a month where we invest in group and self-learning and volunteering for our community is essential.

DEV-0569 is now tracked as Storm-0569. To learn about how the new taxonomy represents the origin unique traits and impact of threat actors and to get a complete mapping of threat actor names read this blog: Microsoft shifts to a new threat actor naming taxonomy.

Recent activity from the threat actor that Microsoft tracks as DEV-0569 known to distribute various payloads has led to the deployment of the Royal ransomware which first emerged in September 2022 and is being distributed by multiple threat actors. Observed DEV-0569 attacks show a pattern of continuous innovation with regular incorporation of new discovery techniques defense evasion and various post-compromise payloads alongside increasing ransomware facilitation.

DEV-0569 notably relies on malvertising phishing links that point to a malware downloader posing as software installers or updates embedded in spam emails fake forum pages and blog comments. In the past few months Microsoft security researchers observed the following tweaks in the group’s delivery methods:

Use of contact forms on targeted organizations’ websites to deliver phishing links

Hosting fake installer files on legitimate-looking software download sites and legitimate repositories to make malicious downloads look authentic to targets and

Expansion of their malvertising technique by using Google Ads in one of their campaigns effectively blending in with normal ad traffic

These methods allow the group to potentially reach more targets and ultimately achieve their goal of deploying various post-compromise payloads. DEV-0569 activity uses signed binaries and delivers encrypted malware payloads. The group also known to rely heavily on defense evasion techniques has continued to use the open-source tool Nsudo to attempt disabling antivirus solutions in recent campaigns.

In this blog we share details of DEV-0569’s tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) and observed behavior in recent campaigns which show that DEV-0569 will likely continue leveraging malvertising and phishing for initial access. We also share preventive measures that organizations can adopt to thwart DEV-0569’s delivery methods involving malicious links and phishing emails using solutions like Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and to reduce the impact of the group’s follow-on activities. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects the DEV-0569 behavior discussed in this blog including the code signing certificates in use and the attempts to disable Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown emerging or developing cluster of threat activity allowing Microsoft to track it as a unique set of information until we can reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity. Once it meets defined criteria a DEV group is converted to a named actor.

DEV-0569 attack chain: Delivery tactics tweaked

DEV-0569 has multiple methods for delivery of their initial payload. In some cases DEV-0569 payloads are delivered via phishing campaigns run by other malicious actors that offer delivery of malware payloads as a service.

Historical observation of typical DEV-0569 attack begins with malicious links delivered to targets via malicious ads fake forum pages blog comments or through phishing emails. These links lead to malicious files signed by the attacker using a legitimate certificate. The malicious files which are malware downloaders known as BATLOADER pose as installers or updates for legitimate applications like Microsoft Teams or Zoom. When launched BATLOADER uses MSI Custom Actions to launch malicious PowerShell activity or run batch scripts to aid in disabling security solutions and lead to the delivery of various encrypted malware payloads that is decrypted and launched with PowerShell commands.

Posing as legitimate software download sites

From August to October 2022 Microsoft observed DEV-0569 activity where BATLOADER delivered via malicious links in phishing emails posed as legitimate installers for numerous applications like TeamViewer Adobe Flash Player Zoom and AnyDesk. BATLOADER was hosted on attacker-created domains posing as legitimate software download sites (anydeskos[.]com for example) and on legitimate repositories like GitHub and OneDrive. Microsoft takes down verified malicious content from these repositories as they are found or reported.

Figure 1. DEV-0569 activity seen in September 2022 where the landing site hosted BATLOADER posing as a TeamViewer installer

Use of VHD file formats

Aside from using installer files Microsoft has also observed the use of file formats like Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) impersonating legitimate software for first-stage payloads. These VHDs also contain malicious scripts that lead to the download of DEV-0569’s malware payloads.

PowerShell and batch scripts for downloading

DEV-0569 has used varied infection chains using PowerShell and batch scripts that ultimately led to the download of malware payloads like information stealers or a legitimate remote management tool used for persistence on the network. The management tool can also be an access point for the staging and spread of ransomware.

NSudo to disable antivirus solutions

DEV-0569 also continues to tamper with antivirus products. In September and October 2022 Microsoft saw activity where DEV-0569 used the open-source NSudo tool to attempt disabling antivirus solutions.

Figure 2. High-level view of observed DEV-0569 infection chains between August to October 2022

September 2022: Adopting contact forms to gain access to targets and deliver information stealers

In September 2022 Microsoft observed a campaign using contact forms to deliver DEV-0569 payloads. Using contact forms on public websites to distribute malware has been seen in other campaigns including IcedID malware. Attackers use this technique as a defense evasion method since contact forms can bypass email protections and appear trustworthy to the recipient.

In this campaign DEV-0569 sent a message to targets using the contact form on these targets’ websites posing as a national financial authority. When a contacted target responds via email DEV-0569 replied with a message that contained a link to BATLOADER. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 detects the spoofing behavior as well as the malicious links in these emails.

The malicious links in the contact forms led to BATLOADER malware hosted on abused web services like GitHub and OneDrive. The installers launched a PowerShell script that issued multiple commands including downloading a NirCmd command-line utility provided by freeware developer NirSoft:

nircmd elevatecmd exec hide ""requestadmin.bat""

If successful the command allows the attacker to elevate from local admin to SYSTEM rights similar to executing a scheduled task as SYSTEM.

The PowerShell script also delivered additional executables from a remote website (e.g. updateea1[.]com) including an AES-encrypted Gozi banking trojan and the information stealer known as Vidar Stealer which used Telegram to receive command and control (C2) information. DEV-0569 frequently diversifies their payloads and has shifted from delivering ZLoader at the beginning of 2022 possibly in response to disruption efforts against Zloader in April 2022.

September 2022: Deploying Royal ransomware

Microsoft identified instances involving DEV-0569 infection chains that ultimately facilitated human-operated ransomware attacks distributing Royal ransomware. Based on tactics observed by Microsoft ransomware attackers likely gained access to compromised networks via a BATLOADER-delivered Cobalt Strike Beacon implant.

DEV-0569’s widespread infection base and diverse payloads likely make the group an attractive access broker for ransomware operators.

October 2022: Leveraging Google Ads to deliver BATLOADER selectively

In late October 2022 Microsoft researchers identified a DEV-0569 malvertising campaign leveraging Google Ads that point to the legitimate traffic distribution system (TDS) Keitaro which provides capabilities to customize advertising campaigns via tracking ad traffic and user- or device-based filtering. Microsoft observed that the TDS redirects the user to a legitimate download site or under certain conditions to the malicious BATLOADER download site. Microsoft reported this abuse to Google for awareness and consideration for action.

Using Keitaro DEV-0569 can use traffic filtering provided by Keitaro to deliver their payloads to specified IP ranges and targets. This traffic filtering can also aid DEV-0569 in avoiding IP ranges of known security sandboxing solutions.

Defending against DEV-0569

DEV-0569 will likely continue to rely on malvertising and phishing to deliver malware payloads. Solutions such as network protection and Microsoft Defender SmartScreen can help thwart malicious link access. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 helps guard against phishing by inspecting the email body and URL for known patterns. Since DEV-0569’s phishing scheme abuses legitimate services organizations can also leverage mail flow rules to capture suspicious keywords or review broad exceptions such as those related to IP ranges and domain-level allow lists. Enabling Safe Links for emails Microsoft Teams and Office Apps can also help address this threat.

Defenders can also apply the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat:

Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support SmartScreen which identifies and blocks malicious websites including phishing sites scam sites and sites that contain exploits and host malware. Turn on network protection to block connections to malicious domains and IP addresses.

Build organizational resilience against email threats by educating users about identifying social engineering attacks and preventing malware infection. Use Attack simulation training in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to run attack scenarios increase user awareness and empower employees to recognize and report these attacks.

Practice the principle of least-privilege and maintain credential hygiene. Avoid the use of domain-wide admin-level service accounts. Restricting local administrative privileges can help limit installation of RATs and other unwanted applications.

Turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission on Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These capabilities use artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats.

Turn on tamper protection features to prevent attackers from stopping security services.

Microsoft Defender customers can turn on attack surface reduction rules to prevent common attack techniques used in ransomware attacks:

The collaboration will see Nvidia utilizing Microsoft’s scalable virtual machine instances to accelerate advances in generative AI models like DALL-E.

Based on Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure the AI supercomputer will use tens of thousands of Nvidia’s powerful H100 and A100 data center GPUs and its Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform. According to Nvidia the combination of Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform and Nvidia’s GPUs networking and full AI suite will allow more enterprises to train deploy and scale AI — including large state-of-the-art models. The two companies will also collaboratively develop DeepSpeed Microsoft’s deep learning optimization software.

The explosive growth of AI has increased demand for supercomputers capable of scaling with it

In a statement Nvidia said the supercomputer could be used to “research and further accelerate advances in generative AI” a relatively new class of large language models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion that use self-learning algorithms to create a diverse range of content such as text code digital images video and audio. These AI models have seen rapid growth in recent years which has significantly raised the demand for powerful computing infrastructure capable of scaling alongside their development.

The new Microsoft Supply Chain Platform aims to enable organizations to orchestrate data from their disparate supply chain systems and make decisions on it.

The new platform uses Microsoft Cloud infrastructure and applications including Azure Dynamics 365 Microsoft Teams and Power Platform as the building blocks for customers to orchestrate the data create workflows and improve supply chain operations.

A core component of the new platform is the Microsoft Supply Chain Center which serves as a control tower for supply chain data and analyses according to Mike Bassani general manager for supply chain at Microsoft. The Supply Chain Center can take data from a company's existing supply chain systems including ERP systems Microsoft Dynamics 365 SAP and Oracle as well as standalone supply chain applications and discover where they may have issues.

The Supply Chain Center includes connectors to logistics and supply chain applications providers C.H. Robinson FedEx FourKites and Overhaul.

Microsoft Supply Chain Platform is available now as an open platform with capabilities from Dynamics 365 Azure and Microsoft 365 which are individually purchased and priced according to Microsoft.

Supply Chain Center is in public preview with licensing and pricing information to be determined at general availability. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management customers will automatically have access to Supply Chain Center with their existing licenses.

The Microsoft Supply Chain Platform enables companies to use data from various systems to get better visibility on supply chain issues.

Supply chain challenges are ongoing Supply chain disruptions have become a constant problem for organizations in the last few years which requires new applications to identify and mitigate issues before they affect business Bassani said. Companies are vulnerable to supply chain disruptions because they lack visibility to see what's coming as data is not current and can be trapped in various disconnected systems he said. The new supply chain platform originated from Microsoft's own supply chain disruptions and the lack of applications to deal with them said Panos Panay executive vice president and chief product officer at Microsoft during Supply Chain Reimagined a virtual conference that introduced the platform on Wednesday. Five years ago Microsoft's supply chain was run on Excel spreadsheets. ""It worked but once you start getting into the nuances of all the challenges that's not an effective way to do it"" Panay said. In the last five years Microsoft moved from Excel to a homegrown cloud-based system including 15 Azure products which served as the basis for its new supply chain offering he said.

Kraft Heinz gets better supply chain insights Consumer goods giant Kraft Heinz Co. has been using the new platform for the last two years said Mitch Arends senior vice president and head of operations for Kraft Heinz North America at the Supply Chain Reimagined event. Several issues including a drought in California that affected the supply of tomatoes Kraft Heinz sources for the Heinz ketchup brand put pressure on the supply chain Arends said. The pandemic changed consumer behavior to more in-home consumption leading to changes in how Kraft Heinz delivers products to market. All of this led to Kraft Heinz needing a more agile and resilient supply chain so that the company could for example forecast disruptions before they happen he said. ""[Microsoft Supply Chain Platform has] helped to increase our scalability and reliability and it's enabled us to see insights and trends faster"" Arends said. ""We can assess risks faster which enables us to have a greater level of collaboration not only internally but across the supply chain.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21pY3Jvc29mdC1oYWNrZXJzLWFyZS11c2luZy10aGlzLWNvbmNlcm5pbmctdGFjdGljLXRvLWRvZGdlLW11bHRpLWZhY3Rvci1hdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft: Hackers are using this 'concerning' tactic to dodge multi-factor authentication,"Microsoft has outlined several mitigations to protect against attacks on multi-factor authentication that will unfortunately make life more difficult for your remote workers.

Three years ago attacks on multi-factor authentication (MFA) were so rare that Microsoft didn't have decent statistics on them largely because few organisations had enabled MFA.

But with MFA use rising as attacks on passwords become more common Microsoft has seen an increase in attackers using token theft in their attempts to sidestep MFA.

In these attacks the attacker compromises a token issued to someone who's already completed MFA and replays that token to gain access from a different device. Tokens are central to OAuth 2.0 identity platforms including Azure Active Directory (AD) which aim to make authentication simpler and faster for users but in a way that's still resilient to password attacks.

Also: Cybersecurity jobs: Five ways to help you build your career

Moreover Microsoft warns that token theft is dangerous because it doesn't require high technical skills detection is difficult and because the technique has only recently seen an uptick few organisations have mitigations in place.

""Recently the Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) has seen an increase in attackers utilizing token theft for this purpose"" Microsoft says in a blogpost.

""By compromising and replaying a token issued to an identity that has already completed multifactor authentication the threat actor satisfies the validation of MFA and access is granted to organizational resources accordingly. This poses to be a concerning tactic for defenders because the expertise needed to compromise a token is very low is hard to detect and few organizations have token theft mitigations in their incident response plan.""

When accessing web applications shielded by Azure AD the user needs to present a valid token which they can get after signing into Azure AD using their credentials. Admins can set policy to require MFA to sign into an account from a browser. The token issued to the user is presented to the web application which validates the token and opens up access.

""When the user is phished the malicious infrastructure captures both the credentials of the user and the token"" Microsoft explains.

If both credentials and the token are stolen the attacker can use these for numerous attacks. Microsoft highlights business email compromise which is the largest cause of cybercrime financial losses today.

Also: Technology spending will rise next year. And this old favourite is still a top priority

Microsoft also warns of ""Pass-the-cookie"" attacks where an attacker compromises a device and extracts browser cookies that are created after authentication to Azure AD from a browser. The attacker passes the cookie to another browser on another system to bypass security checks.

""Users who are accessing corporate resources on personal devices are especially at risk. Personal devices often have weaker security controls than corporate-managed devices and IT staff lack visibility to those devices to determine compromise"" Microsoft notes. This is a greater risk for remote workers who use personal devices.

To counter the threat of token theft attacks on MFA Microsoft recommends shortening session and token lifetimes though this has a convenience cost to the user. Mitigations include:

Reducing the lifetime of the session increases the number of times a user is forced to re-authenticate

Reducing the viable time of a token forces threat actors to increase the frequency of token theft attempts

Microsoft recommends implemeting Conditional Access App Control in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps for users connecting from unmanaged devices

Microsoft also recommends implementing FIDO2 security keys Windows Hello for Business or certificate-based authentication for users.

Users with high-level privileges such as the Global Domain admin should have a segregated cloud-only identity. This will help reduce the attack surface from on-premises to cloud if an attacker compromises on-premises systems. These identities should not have a mailbox attached to them Microsoft said.

""We recognize that while it may be recommended for organizations to enforce location device compliance and session lifetime controls to all applications it may not always be practical"" Microsoft notes."

The senior fellow at the Cato Institute Dr. Jeffrey Singer joined Friday to talk more about this. Both Pfizer and Moderna are conducting clinical trials to determine if their COVID-19 vaccines could be contributing to possible cardiac issues.

""Well we've known for about a year that in young people mostly males but in females as well we seem to have vaccine-induced myocarditis. That's an only associated so far with the mRNA vaccines. For quite some time now we've known since the summer of 2020 that almost all of the serious illnesses and deaths occur in people who are over the age of 50 and usually have other comorbidities"" Singer explained. ""So there have been several experts who have been saying 'What's the rush in trying to get the young people who are at least risk for getting vaccinated through an emergency use authorization? Why don't we spend some more time studying it?' But nevertheless that's happened.""

The new opening hours of 9am to 7pm on Saturdays will now be in line with the current weekday opening hours of JTVCs and CVCs.

This is to make it more convenient for people coming forward to get vaccinated MOH said in a press release on Thursday (Nov 17).

“We have seen encouraging take-up of the bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine and vaccination/booster for children” the ministry added.

“As of Nov 16 over 186000 individuals have received the bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine dose or have booked an appointment.”

The vaccination centre at the former Hong Kah Secondary School in Jurong West will also be converted to a JTVC from Nov 21 to better serve residents in the area MOH said.

JTVC Jurong West will offer both the bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine and monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine.

JTVC Bishan which offers the Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine will be closed with its last day of operations on Nov 19.

The area will continue to be served by JTVC Ang Mo Kio for those who wish to receive the bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine.

MOH added it will maintain 10 active JTVCs to serve residents across the island.

Those who wish to receive the Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine may make an appointment at any of the 19 PHPCs Jurong Polyclinic and Yishun Polyclinic from Nov 21.

According to MOH about 20000 individuals are being administered vaccine doses per day.

APPOINTMENTS NOT NEEDED FOR CERTAIN GROUPS

MOH reiterated that those who are aged 50 and above can currently walk in to a JTVC to receive their vaccinations without appointments.

They are reminded that the less crowded hours are from Mondays to Thursdays before 6.30pm and on Saturdays after 2pm. Walk-ins should be avoided during peak periods of Friday and Saturday morning.

As previously announced the siblings of a child with an existing appointment on Mondays to Thursdays can also receive their vaccinations at the same time without the need for an appointment at the CVCs.

Parents are reminded to arrive at the CVC by 5.30pm on Mondays to Thursdays and to bring along their children’s identification documents for registration.

“Vaccination remains a key part of our Covid-19 strategy in ensuring our population is well protected against infection and severe illness” MOH said.

“Individuals including children are encouraged to receive Covid-19 vaccines recommended for them as soon as they are eligible to do so.”

Did the US military just convict Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel and sentenced him to death?!

Take a look at the viral claim and find out what the FACTS really are!

Claim : US Military Sentenced Stephane Bancel To Death!

On 15 November 2022 Michael Baxter (real name : Michael Tuffin) wrote an article claiming that a US military tribunal just convicted Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel and sentenced him to death!

It is long and rambling so please feel free to skip to the next section for the facts!

The U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps and Office of Military Commissions had difficulty finding three impartial panelists to hear evidence against Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel for every interviewee knew someone whose life the vaccine had shattered—or killed. Following a weeklong search JAG picked the three—two male Marine Corps officers and a female Navy captain—who expressed the least ill will toward Bancel. Nonetheless they found Bancel guilty of murder five minutes after Vice Adm. Darse E. Crandall rested JAG’s case and implored the panel to deliver upon Bancel a punishment commensurate to the damage his vaccines had caused the world. Vice Adm. Crandall said a Navy nurse had drawn Bancel’s blood shortly after he arrived at Guantanamo Bay. The blood was introduced onto a card containing fusion proteins that detect Covid-19 antibodies. He called to the witness stand Captain Richard G. Zeber Director U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay who stated his name rank and credentials for the record. Captain Zeber holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology and a Doctor of Optometry degree. His personal decorations include the Legion of Merit Defense Meritorious Service Medal Meritorious Service Medal Navy Commendation Navy Achievement and Good Conduct medals. Vice Adm. Crandall excused the witness then asserted to the panel that Bancel as Moderna’s CEO must have had full knowledge of the clot shot’s deleterious effects but concealed that data to maximize profits. Moderna’s Covid shot made Bancel a multi-billionaire. “I sincerely hope you won’t get to spend it” Vice Adm. Crandall told Bancel. The panel gave its verdict and held Bancel responsible for the deaths and injuries suggesting he be hanged by the neck until dead as restitution for his crimes against humanity. Upon hearing the panel’s decision a furious Bancel came out of his seat and began shaking his cuffed wrists in the air. “How can you do this? I am a businessman. I have two children—” “—Let’s hope you didn’t vaccinate them” Vice Adm. Crandall interjected. “This commission stands adjourned.” Bancel is scheduled to hang on November 18 at GITMO.

Truth : US Military Did NOT Sentence Stephane Bancel To Death!

The truth is – this is just another FAKE STORY created by Real Raw News just to generate page views and money.

Everything that Real Raw News posts must be regarded as FAKE NEWS until proven otherwise.

Fact #1 : Real Raw News Is A Fake News Website

Real Raw News is a FAKE NEWS website that capitalises on making shocking but fake stories to generate page views and money.

To protect himself from legal repercussions the owner and writer Michael Baxter (real name – Michael Tuffin) claims that his articles are “humour parody and satire“.

This disclaimer which is not clearly mentioned in his articles lets him keep creating fake news that will go viral and generate him money.

His articles have been regularly debunked as fake news so you should NEVER share anything from his website. Here are some of his fake stories that I personally debunked earlier:

Fact #2 : No Legitimate Report Of Stephane Bancel’s Arrest

Only Real Raw News has published his fantastical account of US special forces arresting Stéphane Bancel outside a DC restaurant. That’s because Michael Baxter / Tiffin made it up.

Naturally there is no news from any legitimate news outlet or the US military about Stephane Bancel’s arrest and sentencing.

How likely is it for a one-man operation like Real Raw News to have a scoop on this “story”?

Read more : Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel Arrested For Vaccine Fraud?

Fact #3 : Moderna Is A Public-Listed Company

Moderna is a public-listed company and is traded on the Nasdaq as MRNA. Its shareholders would have to be informed if their company CEO was really arrested and sentenced to death.

It is NOT POSSIBLE to keep quiet and pretend it didn’t happen. It’s not even legal to cover up such an event from the shareholders.

Fact #4 : Stéphane Bancel + Moderna Issued A Press Statement

On Thursday November 16 2022 – one day after Real Raw News published that fake story Moderna announced positive results for its two bivalent vaccines targeting the Omicron variant of COVID-19 – mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273.222.

Instead of being incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay as Michael Baxter/Tiffin claimed Stephane Bancel announced from Cambridge Massachusetts that:

We are pleased to see that both of our bivalent booster vaccine candidates offer superior protection against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variants compared to our original booster which is encouraging given COVID-19 remains a leading cause of hospitalisation and death globally. In addition the superior response against Omicron persisted for at least three months after the mRNA-1273.214 booster.

Only Michael Baxter / Tiffin can persist with such a stupid lie and only his idiotic fans will continue to believe his fake stories.

Fact #5 : Only Enemy Combatants Are Detained At Gitmo

It is ludicrous for Real Raw News to claim that a US military tribunal in Gitmo (Guantanamo Bay) convicted Stephane Bancel and sentenced him to death.

The Guantanamo Bay prison is only used to detain high-value enemy combatants. Stephane Bancel is not an enemy combatant by any military or legal definition and would never be detained there.

If Stephane Bancel really committed a crime in the United States he would have been brought to trial in an American court.

Fact #6 : US Military Tribunals Are Only For Foreign Combatants

It is also stupid for Real Raw News to claim that Bancel was trialed and convicted as an enemy combatant in a military tribunal when he is a French civilian.

Military tribunals in the United States can only be conducted for members of enemy forces during wartime. The United States is not at war with France.

Needless to say – Stephane Bancel is also not in the French military so even if he was arrested there is no way he would be tried in a military tribunal.

Fact #7 : Death Sentences Take Years To Execute

It is also hilarious that Real Raw News readers actually believe the bullshit that someone sentenced to death would be executed just days later.

That may be possible in a country like North Korea but certainly not in the United States

Death row inmates in the United States wait an average of 178 months – about 15 years after their sentencing before they are executed.

In fact none of the six Gitmo inmates charged with capital crime in the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the attack on USS Cole in 2000 have actually been trialled to date never mind convicted and sentenced to death.

Fact #8 : Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Under FDA Regulatory Oversight

The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was confirmed to be safe and effective after it successfully concluded its clinical trials with an efficacy of 94.5% against symptomatic COVID-19 infection in a large study involving over 30000 participants.

The VRBPAC committee vetted and discussed the study findings on 17 December 2020 and recommended that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine receive its Emergency Use Authorisation which the FDA granted on 18 December 2020.

Like ALL other vaccines the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was under FDA regulatory oversight. If Moderna lied about their results the FDA would not have continued to re-issue or amend its EUA and full approval time and time again.

Everything that Real Raw News posts should be regarded as FAKE NEWS.

In an email to distributors today as reported in Molson Coors’ Beer & Beyond newsletter Marino announced that the beer giant had reached a mutual agreement to end its partnership with coffee roaster La Colombe effective March 31 2023 just over two years since the two companies kicked off an exclusive 10-year pact for distribution of its canned Draft Latte line in 2021.

Philadelphia-based La Colombe will now seek to merge operations of its RTD business with its other bagged coffee and cold brew multi-serve segments according to the report. Addressing distributors Marino acknowledged that La Colombe’s move to consolidate distribution of various products “creates significant logistical challenges for our distributor partners while still requiring similar levels of investment on their part.”

“Over the past few years we have opened new lines of revenue for all our businesses as we leverage the competitive strengths of Molson Coors and expand beyond the beer aisle” said Marino. “We’ve had some hits and some misses but we’ve learned a ton and we have positioned ourselves for a bright future. One of the lessons we’ve learned is to quickly identify when something just isn’t going to work for us or for you.”

The report noted that La Colombe “would welcome the chance to stay involved with Molson Coors for certain classes of trade” but the coffee company recognizes “why that doesn’t make sense for them or many of their wholesalers.”

At the same time Marino also announced that Truss the joint venture between Molson Coors and Quebec-based cannabis producer Hexo Corp. to develop CBD drinks is being dissolving at the end of this year citing challenges to scaling in the current regulatory environment in which CBD remains illegal as a food or beverage ingredient under federal law.

In 2020 Molson and Hexo launched Truss to produce non-alcoholic CBD-infused beverages at a production base in Fort Collins Colorado. Its first release a three-SKU line of sparkling waters featuring 20mg CBD per 12 oz can was released that same year in Colorado and then expanded to 16 additional states in 2021.

The beverage conglomerate is hoping that less baggage will allow it to redirect resources to its non-beer options including energy drink ZOA and the forthcoming Topo Chico Spirited via a licensing partnership with The Coca-Cola Company.

“Not every project or innovation will meet our ambitions. What’s important is that we learn from each and build capabilities that will serve us well into the future” Marino said. “The key for us is to go big behind what’s working and smartly pivot out of what isn’t working from a scale standpoint like CBD beverages.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9jYW5uYWJpcy8yMi8xMS8yOTc4NDMxMC9tb2xzb24tY29vcnMtc2F5cy1mYXJld2VsbC10by1jYW5uYWJpcy1hbmQtaXRzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtaGV4by1oZXJlcy13aHnSAS1odHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vYW1wL2NvbnRlbnQvMjk3ODQzMTA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Molson Coors Says Farewell To Cannabis And Its Partnership With HEXO Here's Why - Molson Coors Beverage,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9jYW5uYWJpcy8yMi8xMS8yOTc4NDMxMC9tb2xzb24tY29vcnMtc2F5cy1mYXJld2VsbC10by1jYW5uYWJpcy1hbmQtaXRzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtaGV4by1oZXJlcy13aHnSAS1odHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vYW1wL2NvbnRlbnQvMjk3ODQzMTA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E610127F40>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9jYW5uYWJpcy8yMi8xMS8yOTc4NDMxMC9tb2xzb24tY29vcnMtc2F5cy1mYXJld2VsbC10by1jYW5uYWJpcy1hbmQtaXRzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtaGV4by1oZXJlcy13aHnSAS1odHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vYW1wL2NvbnRlbnQvMjk3ODQzMTA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb2xzb24tdG8tZW5kLWl0cy10cnVzcy1jYmQtdXNhLWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUtd2l0aC1oZXhvLTIwMjItMTEtMTjSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L21vbHNvbi10by1lbmQtaXRzLXRydXNzLWNiZC11c2Etam9pbnQtdmVudHVyZS13aXRoLWhleG8tMjAyMi0xMS0xOA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Molson to end its Truss CBD USA Joint Venture with Hexo,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/molson-to-end-its-truss-cbd-usa-joint-venture-with-hexo-2022-11-18 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb2xzb24tdG8tZW5kLWl0cy10cnVzcy1jYmQtdXNhLWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUtd2l0aC1oZXhvLTIwMjItMTEtMTjSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L21vbHNvbi10by1lbmQtaXRzLXRydXNzLWNiZC11c2Etam9pbnQtdmVudHVyZS13aXRoLWhleG8tMjAyMi0xMS0xOA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMTEwNzAyOS9taWxsZXItbGl0ZS12cy1jb29ycy1saWdodC1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miller Lite Vs Coors Light: Everything You Need To Know,"Miller Lite Vs Coors Light: Everything You Need To Know

Miller Lite and Coors Light are two heavyweight titans of the beer industry. Both brands are owned by the massive beer conglomerate Molson Coors (via Molson Coors). Additionally both are among the best-selling beers in America (via Restaurant Clicks). As their names indicate (albeit with alternate spellings) each are light beers with a low 4.2% alcohol content (per CraftJacks). But what if anything sets these two beers apart? Well for one their origin stories are quite different.

It may surprise people to learn about the beer that was eventually going to become marketed as Miller Lite was first developed by a biochemist named Joseph Owades (via All About Beer Magazine). It. was sold under the name Gablinger's Diet Beer by Rheingold Brewery where Owades was employed. However no one seemed interested in the concept of a diet beer at the time. And after another failed attempt at that angle under the moniker Mister Brau Lite the beer received a makeover from Miller. Luckily the transformation modified the recipe into a more drinkable low-calorie beverage that launched in 1975 to great commercial success initiating the light beer movement.

Coors Light entered the light beer fray in 1978 a full 100 years after Adolph Coors founded the Coors Brewery in 1873.

The CSD giant said it had taken the decision to issue the warning after discovering a manufacturing mistake. The error had led to “a small number” of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar multipacks being shipped containing cans of Coca-Cola Original Taste.

The affected multipacks are 24 x 33cl cases of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and are wrapped in Christmas-themed packaging. The company confirmed to Just Drinks there was no possibility of “mixed” cases containing both sugar-free and full-sugar products in them.

A Coca-Cola spokesperson said: “As a precaution we have taken the decision to issue a product safety notice regarding a small number of multipacks of 24 x 330ml cans of Coca-Cola Original Taste which have been wrongly wrapped in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Christmas packaging.

“The quality of the drink itself is not affected. However we advise anyone who has purchased 24 x 330ml multipacks of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar to ensure the product inside is as expected.”

The company added it was asking customers to contact its customer service team if they discovered Original Taste cans in their Zero Sugar multipack.

Mueller,"Scott D. Mueller 56 of Machesney Park IL passed away Friday November 18 2022 in his home. Born in Rockford IL on October 24 1966 Scott was the son of David Mueller and Betty (Jacobs) Mueller. His youth was well-remembered for a love of baseball basketball and an ultimately lifelong passion for music. Having lived in the Rockford area for the entirety of his life he met and married the love of his life Deborah (Mead) Mueller with whom he shared two children Kristen and Brandon. A life spent locally led to his graduation from Harlem High School leading to a 37-year career at Warner Lambert/Mondelez International Inc. He became a local legend at Toad Hall Record Store where his love of vinyls and cassette tapes led to a close relationship with fellow music-lovers in the Rockford area. This was not an anomaly for Scott as he was keen on using his passions to connect with friends and coworkers who would often describe him as a kind and caring man. His home in which he and his family lived for over two decades was a tribute to his loyalty to the Chicago Cubs the Chicago Bears and classic rock.

As a man with so many passions his love and pride for his family were unmistakable and lifelong. He shared a mischievous sense of humor with his brother Steve and son Brandon; many would remember their familial antics and the once-in-a-lifetime bond it gave the three of them. His brother Todd and sister Sue remember Scott fondly through a life spent as an unshakeable tribe of siblings through good times and bad. His daughter Kristen remembers him as a father who did his best to remain present in an increasingly distancing world from childhood and into adulthood. Scott Mueller will perhaps be remembered for a life lived without a shortage of love to give and described as one might describe classic rock: wild timeless and loved by many.

Survivors include daughter Kristen Mueller; siblings Susan (Donald) Kidd Todd (Cheri) Mueller; and sister-in- law Crystal Huene. Preceded in death by wife Deb Mueller; son Brandon Mueller; mother Betty Mueller; father David Mueller; and brother Steve Huene.

Memorial service will be held at 12:00 PM Wednesday November 30 2022 in Honquest Family Funeral Home with Crematory – Mulford Chapel 4311 N. Mulford Road Loves Park with a visitation from 11:00 AM until time of service.

The world’s worst plastic polluters have been revealed with Coca-Cola coming top of the list for the fifth year in a row.

This is especially embarrassing given the food and drinks company’s sponsorship of COP27 currently being held in Egypt.

“Instead of allowing companies like Coke to greenwash their image governments need to compel polluters to invest in reuse and alternative product delivery systems that avoid the problem in the first place” says Von Hernandez global coordinator for Break Free From Plastic.

The result comes from Break Free From Plastic’s 2022 annual audit which also saw Mondelez International Unilever Nestle and PepsiCo in the top five.

What are governments around the world doing about plastic waste?

The five top polluters have been found out through an audit which saw 200000 citizen scientists in 87 countries analysing trash they gathered on beaches and elsewhere.

Coca-Cola’s ‘trashiversary’ sees them not only land at the top spot for five years in a row they also doubled their trash footprint in the same time period.

Break Free From Plastic are using the findings to join calls for a Global Plastics Treaty with legally binding mechanisms and enforcement policies arguing the audit is evidence companies can’t be trusted to set their own targets.

“Governments worldwide now have the justification and opportunity to effectively address and reverse the plastic pollution crisis by coming up with a global plastics treaty” continues Hernandez.

Has there been any progress on a Global Plastics Treaty?

In March this year negotiations began at the United Nations Environment Agency for a framework to solve plastic pollution. But the talks have not come to fruition yet.

In 2018 the UN launched a New Plastics Economy Global Commitment with voluntary sign-up from consumer companies including the biggest plastic polluters. A progress report in 2022 said that targets set for 2025 will “almost certainly” not be met.

“The world’s top plastic polluters have littered the planet with plastic waste - and marked it clearly with their name” adds Rosa Pritchard plastic lawyer for ClientEarth.

“Consumers shareholders and NGOs are turning to litigation to jolt these companies out of their stupor on plastics.

“For these companies the risk of litigation looms especially large: we know they are driving the plastics problem. We know the harms caused by plastic pollution and the plastics lifecycle. Lawsuits holding them accountable are just a matter of time.”

Indeed the 5-year-old cyberattack appears to be turning the cyber insurance market on its head.

Mondelez International parent of such popular brands as Cadbury Oreo Ritz and Triscuit was hit hard by NotPetya with factories and production disrupted. It took days for the company's staff to regain control of its computer systems. The company filed a claim with its property and casualty insurer Zurich American for $100 million in losses. After initially approving a fraction of the claim — $10 million — Zurich declined to pay stating the attack was an act of war and thus excluded from the coverage. Mondelez filed a lawsuit.

Late last month Mondelez and Zurich American reportedly agreed to the original $100 million claim but that wasn't until after Merck won its $1.4 billion lawsuit against Ace American Insurance Company in January 2022 for its NotPetya-related losses. Merck's claims also were against its property and casualty policy not a cyber insurance policy.

Back in 2017 cyber insurance policies were still nascent so many large corporations filed claims for damages related to NotPetya — the scourge that caused an estimated $10 billion in damage worldwide — against corporate property and casualty policies.

What's Changed?

The significance of these settlements illustrate an ongoing maturation of the cyber insurance market says Alla Valente senior analyst at Forrester Research.

Until 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic cyber insurance policies were sold in a fashion akin to traditional home or auto policies with little concern for a company's cybersecurity profile the tools it had in place to defend its networks and data or its general cyber hygiene.

Once a large number of ransomware attacks occurred that built off of the lax cybersecurity many organizations demonstrated insurance carriers began changing their requirements and tightening the requirements for obtaining such policies Valente says.

The business model for cyber insurance is dramatically different from other policies making the cyber insurance policies of 2017 obsolete. Cyber insurance is in a state of flux with turnover in the carrier market lower limits on covered offered and more aggressive terms including exclusions over what was in place prior to 2020.

Defining an Act of War

Acts of war are a common insurance exclusion. Traditionally exclusions required a ""hot war"" such as what we see in Ukraine today. However courts are starting to recognize cyberattacks as potential acts of war without a declaration of war or the use of land troops or aircraft. The state-sponsored attack itself constitutes a war footing the carriers maintain.

In April 2023 new verbiage will go into effect for cyber policies from Lloyd's of London that will exclude liability losses arising from state-backed cyberattacks. In a Market Bulletin released in August 2022 Lloyd's underwriting director Tony Chaudhry wrote ""Lloyd's remains strongly supportive of the writing of cyber-attack cover but recognizes also that cyber related business continues to be an evolving risk. If not managed properly it has the potential to expose the market to systemic risks that syndicates could struggle to manage.""

Lloyd's went on to publish additional supplemental requirements and guidance that modified its rules from 2016 just prior to the NotPetya attack.

Effectively Forrester's Valente notes larger enterprises might have to set aside large stores of cash in case they are hit with a state-sponsored attack. Should insurance carriers be successful in asserting in court that a state-sponsored attack is by definition an act of war no company will have coverage unless they negotiate that into the contract specifically to eliminate the exclusion.

When buying cyber insurance ""it is worth having a detailed conversation with the broker to compare so-called 'war exclusions' and determining whether there are carriers offering more favorable terms"" says Scott Godes partner and co-chair of the Insurance Recovery and Counseling Practice and the Data Security & Privacy practice at District of Columbia law firm Barnes & Thornburg. ""Unfortunately litigation over this issue is another example of carriers trying to tilt the playing field in their favor by taking premium restricting coverage and fighting over ambiguous terms.""

For small and midsize businesses (SMBs) that get hit by a state-sponsored attack it could be ""lights out"" Valente says. Plus she emphasizes SMBs often are targeted if they are primary or secondary suppliers to a large enterprise with information the attacker wants. That means a state-sponsored attack on a small company without the right insurance coverage could be out of business simply because the attacker was a nation-state rather than a cybercriminal.

Understand What Is Covered

While the European and North American cyber insurance markets are similar they are by no means identical.

""Not every [American] policy will have language recommended by the London insurance market and those rules do not apply to American insurance carriers"" Godes says. ""As a best practice policyholders should consider whether London market insurance carriers are offering the most robust coverage after the recommended changes go into effect.""

Godes whose firm represents the insured rather than the carriers or brokers notes ""This case is an example to policyholders that when claims get really expensive carriers will do everything they can to fight coverage. The insured always should remember that the insurance carrier must prove that an exclusion applies. And sometimes"" he quips ""the insured will need to litigate with its carrier to get the coverage it thought it was buying.""

The upshot from the Merck and Mondelez cases as well as Lloyd's recent announcement: State-sponsored attacks now fall into the act-of-war exclusion.

""Many carriers are in the process of rewriting their act of war exclusions to address the realities of state-sponsored or assisted cyberattacks and also because courts as indicated in a few recent decisions and perhaps implied by the Mondelez settlement are looking skeptically at the application of clauses written for traditional guns and bullets warfare to cyberattacks"" says Kenneth Rashbaum a partner at New York law firm Barton. ""I think this is the most significant takeaway from Mondelez and those recent court decisions. Carriers who update their clauses will be more aggressive in denials of coverage for attacks that may be considered state-sponsored while those that do not update the clauses may be less inclined to rely on them.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0YXJnZXQuY29tL3NlYXJjaGVycC9mZWF0dXJlL1JGSUQtaW4tc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLTYtZXhhbXBsZXMtaW4tdXNlLXRvZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RFID in supply chain: 6 examples in use today,"RFID has long been a useful tool for better supply chain management. It still is.

While RFID is a comparatively older technology industry analysts predict RFID use in the supply chain will keep growing.

The global RFID market size was valued at $10.41 billion in 2020 and expected to hit $25.47 billion by 2030 according to the 2021 report ""RFID Market: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast 2021-2030"" by Allied Market Research and its use in the supply chain is part of that market. The increase in RFID use in manufacturing is a major contributor to this growth according to the same report.

As companies look to balance supply chain costs and efficiencies RFID's price point can be attractive.

RFID's price decrease over the last several decades has sparked greater adoption said Dan Luttner supply chain managing partner at MorganFranklin Consulting a management strategy consulting firm located in New York.

Here are some common examples of how companies use RFID in the supply chain.

1. Real-time inventory tracking The speed and ease of RFID scanning enables employees to check inventory levels more frequently which supports more accurate inventory counts order forecasts and order amounts resulting in decreased storage costs and overall costs. Ultra-high-frequency tags are often used for inventory tracking. RFID technology also provides continuous location information about valuable assets. ""I've had hospitals tell me that they may lose a million dollars a year [in equipment]"" said Tim Zimmerman vice president at Gartner. ""RFID provides the ability to know if a particular asset has been intentionally or unintentionally removed from a facility."" RFID tags can also help companies that ship sensitive materials like drug manufacturers because they can send an alert if someone tampers with packages. For example some RFID tags are attached to an item by looping the tag's wire around the item then inserting the end of the wire into an opening on the tag. Once a user has inserted the end of the wire into the opening the tag will send an alert via an RFID reader if someone tampers with the tag. Other types of organizations can also benefit from RFID's real-time tracking capabilities. Danone North America uses plastic pallets with embedded RFID tags from iGPS to track its Dannon yogurt shipments said Bob DePouw senior manager of upstream logistics at Danone North America a food and beverage company located in Denver. ""Pallet management … is so key from an asset and financial perspective"" he said.

2. Warehouse management RFID technology can help automate some of the tasks that occur during the receiving and shipping processes in turn increasing efficiency and reducing human error. Using an RFID reader to scan a product's RFID tag saves warehouse employees time because they don't have to record it manually Luttner said. RFID can improve the efficiency of the picking and packing process because the RFID tag on an item sends information like the item's location to a warehouse management system. An employee that is doing picking and packing can learn the item's location from the warehouse management system and go there directly rather than spending time searching for the product.

3. Customer service The inventory accuracy boost RFID offers can also help improve customer service. For example if a company's inventory counts are out of date a customer may order an item that is actually out of stock which leads to a poor customer experience. Using RFID in warehouses can help avoid these types of order-inventory misalignments.

4. Distribution RFID can also help companies improve delivery process efficiency. For example manufacturing employees can attach RFID tags to boxes before shipping the boxes to a warehouse. Warehouse employees can then use RFID readers to scan the tags and learn what's in the boxes enabling them to put away the items efficiently.

5. Cold chain management RFID tags can monitor refrigerated products' temperatures during distribution which will help ensure workers store the products at the appropriate temperature and that the products are safe to use. For example warehouse employees at a milk company can receive an alert on their RFID reader if the air conditioning in part of the warehouse has mistakenly been turned off and the RFID-tagged milk is reaching unsafe temperatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYWR2ZXJ0aXNlcnMtcmVhY3QtdG8tdHdpdHRlcnMtbmV3LW93bmVyc2hpcC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NTYwNjg4My5jbXPSAXRodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FkdmVydGlzZXJzLXJlYWN0LXRvLXR3aXR0ZXJzLW5ldy1vd25lcnNoaXAvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk1NjA2ODgzLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advertisers react to Twitter's new ownership,"Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website MIT MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation Visit Indian School of Business Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit IIT Delhi Certificate Programme in Data Science & Machine Learning Visit

Maybe Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) which has sold 1.3 billion iPhones since 2007 and reported a $19.4 billion profit last quarter?

Or Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) which went from selling just 937 cars in 2009 to over 300000 last year?

Some savvy income investors might consider Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO). The tobacco giant formerly Phillip Morris International Inc. has grown its dividends by 631% since 2002. That streak of dividend hikes is possible when you sell an addictive product to hundreds of millions of people.

But there’s one little-known company that left these household names in the dust.

The Unknown Stock That Beat Every Wall Street Darling

Monster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST) is a company no one ever described as changing the world. It’s not putting an iPhone into every third human’s hand or solving climate change.

Yet this energy drink company returned 87560% from 2000 to 2020 — enough to turn every $1 invested into $876.

Why was Monster Beverage able to dramatically outperform these world-changing companies?

Part of the reason comes from its size — Monster Beverage recorded $92 million in revenue in 2002 while Apple reported $5.7 billion. A smaller company can grow revenue — and ultimately its earnings and share price — much faster than a company that’s already a behemoth.

But there’s bigger factor at play. Apple spent $446 million on research and development in 2002 to stay ahead of its competitors and maintain its existing operations. By 2022 its annual operating costs had reached $274 billion.

To keep the lights on Apple had to spend $274 billion or the company could no longer make and sell products. By contrast Monster Beverage spent just $4.6 billion on operating costs in 2022.

It turns out that an energy-drink business is a lot less capital-intensive than a tech business — and this difference compounded over the years means that Monster Beverage had hundreds of billions of dollars more to plow into growing its business by expanding operations and claiming greater market share.

A similar dynamic benefitted Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO). If you’ve ever wondered why the ticker symbol is KO rather than CO or CC it’s because Wall Street settled on an acronym for “knock out.” The sentiment was that investing in Coca-Cola was a slam dunk because the invaluable brand name commanded loyalty from hundreds of millions around the world. How could investors go wrong?

Story continues

Sure enough $100 invested in Coca-Cola at the time of its 1919 initial public offering (IPO) would have turned into $1.25 million a century later. A lot of factors are behind that performance but it’s not a coincidence that Coca-Cola had to pay just $24 billion in operating costs in 2020 or less that 10% of what Apple paid.

Benzinga has a lot to say on the battles between tech giants to capture hundreds of billions of dollars in market share of revolutionary trends like blockchain technology 5G and clean energy. But as stocks like Monster Beverage show slow and steady can sometimes win the race.

Benzinga is tracking one company with striking parallels to Monster Beverage. It also has a product designed to improve energy levels and performance. It’s already profitable but with just $17 million in sales since 2012 is even smaller than Monster Beverage was at the turn of the century.

Hamilton’s name is emblazoned across the top of the can which features an eye-catching new design he created in collaboration with artist Mad Dog Jones. The zero sugar zero calorie vegan liquid inside has a peach nectarine flavour and comes in a plain and a £1.39 price-marked single can.

The launch is the latest in a busy pipeline of NPD from Monster which has helped it achieve an extra £77.6m worth of sales in the past year ( Nielsen ). This has taken the value of the Monster brand to more than £481.1m and has helped grow the value of the energy drinks sector to more than £1.6bn (ibid).

Zero sugar is a key driver of category growth with Monster’s zero sugar Ultra range up 38.5% (ibid) and retaining the no.1 zero sugar energy brand position in GB according to manufacturer and distributor of the Monster Energy portfolio Coca-Cola Europacifc Partners (CCEP) GB.

Martin Attock vice-president commercial development at CCEP GB said: “Monster is more than a drink it’s a lifestyle lived by the athletes and sports teams the brand works with and of course all their fans.

“During its 20th anniversary year Monster has broken records to become the number one deliverer of value growth in the entire soft drinks category [ibid].

The acquisition is made through Keppel’s China Urban Development Investment Programme and Keppel and a co-investor are each contributing 50 percent of the capital for a joint venture company which is developing a 93871 square metre (1 million square foot) residential project according to a Keppel statement to the Singapore Exchange Monday.

“Shanghai is one of Keppel Land China’s focus cities. We are positive on its long-term outlook and continue to look out for investment opportunities there” a Keppel Land China spokesperson told Mingtiandi. “Having worked together on successful projects such as China Chic in Nanjing and Upview in Shanghai we are confident of building in our partnership with Gemdale to create and capture value through the latest acquisition.”

The spokesperson referred to the project around six kilometres (3.7 miles) east of Shanghai’s Formula One raceway as a good opportunity for Keppel to jointly invest with Gemdale in a well-located mid-sized residential site at “an attractive land price”.

While Keppel did not disclose the name of its co-investor in the joint venture company named Taicang Jihui Real Estate Consulting Co Ltd shareholding information on the Qichacha business information platform shows the other shareholder to be Guangzhou Runshi Investment LLP an affiliate of mainland private equity firm High Fund.

Loan-to-Equity Conversion

The deal comes less than four months after Gemdale teamed with Shanghai Forest Manor Enterprise Management Consulting to outbid rivals Poly Developments and Holdings Group and Yuexiu Property in acquiring the 24908 square metre site in northwest Shanghai for RMB 1.6 billion in a land auction according to government records.

At the stated consideration the investment by the Keppel joint venture now values the project at RMB 1.72 billion or RMB 18323 per square metre of gross floor area.

Keppel said its JV has provided loans totaling RMB 344 million to Gemdale for its acquisition and development of the site and the loans are intended to be converted into a 28.6 percent stake in Taicang Xintao Real Estate Consulting Co Ltd a Gemdale subsidiary that owns 70 percent of the project company.

The conversion which will give Keppel and its partner the equivalent of a 20 percent stake in the project is expected to take place by December. The transaction is subject to approval by regulatory authorities said Keppel.

Located about 10 to 15 minutes’ walk from the Malu station on subway line 11 the site will be developed into a residential complex spanning eight condominium buildings of 18 storeys each and a 16-storey affordable housing tower according to a project plan published on the Jiading district government website.

The buildings are planned to yield 576 condominium units and 48 affordable housing units.

Current home prices in the area average roughly RMB 40000 per square metre according to Savills. Public records of the land sale show the suggested retail price for homes in the project is RMB 49800 per square metre.

Asian Brothers

“Singaporean and Hong Kong investors are more active making real estate investments in China compared with their western peers. They tend to have a more extensive on-the-ground presence long-term commitments and stronger developer and asset management backgrounds” James Macdonald head of Savills Research China told Mingtiandi.

Keppel entered the China market in the 1980s and has developed projects in nearly 30 Chinese cities according to a report by China News Service.

The Temasek Holdings-backed developer is familiar both with Jiading district and with the immediate neighbourhood of Gemdale’s project having acquired a shopping center project above the Malu metro station in 2016.

It has also worked with Gemdale to co-develop a residential project near the Malu site under the mainland company’s high-end Upview residential brand. Keppel is currently on track to complete its Park Avenue Central commercial project in Shanghai’s Jing’an district during 2024.

Keppel is also a lead investor in both Suzhou Industrial Park and Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city with both joint ventures supported by the Chinese and Singaporean governments.

Gemdale ranking seventh among mainland developers by contracted sales is one of the industry’s more financially stable firms but has also suffered from weak demand for its homes amid the current property crisis. The company’s contracted sales for the first ten months of this year were down 30 percent from the same period of last year.

In September Moody’s affirmed its corporate family rating for Gemdale at Ba2 which is non-investment grade and changed the outlook of all Gemdale entities to negative from stable citing weaker-than-expected contracted sales and weakening access to capital markets. The credit rating agency also revised down its contracted sales forecast for the developer in 2022 to RMB 220 billion from RMB 230 billion and for 2023 is estimating RMB 200 billion after earlier projecting RMB 245 billion.

Note: This story has been updated to clarify that Keppel had acquired its Malu shopping centre project in 2016 and not 2021. The story also has been updated to show that the Park Avenue Central project will be completed in 2024 and not 2023 as stated in the earlier version.

In Great Neck New York on Long Island Roei R. Gigi joined Morgan Stanley Wealth Management on Friday according to a source familiar with the move. Gigi had been managing $1 billion in assets according to Forbes which ranked him #11 in New York state and #114 on its list of the top next-generation brokers.

Gigi had been a producing manager (known as resident directors at Merrill) at an office in Hewlett about 16 miles away and spent his entire 22-year career at Merrill where he worked with wealthy families according to his former team page and BrokerCheck.

“He finds it tremendously satisfying to build client relationships that reach into the third and even fourth generations of the same family” Gigi’s former firm bio states. He moved along with two support staff Lori Faas and Ariella Kohansieh.

His former team website also lists managing director Saul Katz who spent all but nine months of his 21-year career at Merrill and remains with the firm.

Gigi has one recent client complaint on his BrokerCheck record a claim for unauthorized trading that was denied by Merrill in May.

A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley confirmed the hire. The firm has been targeting Merrill brokers in a national recruiting campaign that enlisted former Merrill brokers to give testimonials to prospects about their transition. It also offers high-end deals over 300% for large producers.

A Merrill spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.

Merrill for its part hired from Janney Montgomery Scott 38-year industry veteran Scott M. Nash who had worked from an office in Bala Cynwyd near Janney’s Philadelphia headquarters according to an announcement on LinkedIn.

Nash had spent all of his career at Janney according to BrokerCheck. Janney which is owned by Penn Mutual has around 850 brokers who manage around $125 billion.

A spokesperson for Janney declined to comment. The firm in May settled a customer claim over allegedly excessive trading by Nash for the full $64000 in damages requested according to his BrokerCheck.

“[T]he client authorized all trades in the account” Nash wrote in a comment appended to the disclosure. The claim was settled “without admitting liability in the interests of customer relations and to avoid potentially time-consuming and costly litigation” he said.

Merrill for several years has been targeting hires in community markets outside of its parent Bank of America’s footprint as well as relatively novice brokers with fewer than 12 years of experience. But it recently expanded its search to include rich offers for more veteran brokers.

It hired a team of private bankers managing around $1 billion from Citigroup in New York and also netted a million-dollar producer from Morgan Stanley in Huntsville Alabama. The latter joined through its community markets initiative.

Many firms are looking to usher in recruits before the year-end lull in hiring mandaged in part by a pause in processing new registrations at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Snow and wind whipped Chief Evan Taypotat's headdress on Thursday as he took the company to task for what he described as failures in its duty to consult and engage with Kahkewistahaw First Nation located approximately 175 kilometres northeast of Regina.

""Today I stand here frustrated offended slapped in the face but more importantly ready to fight"" the chief said.

""Mosaic Potash has lied to my people because they can in this province we call Saskatchewan.""

Taypotat spoke in front of Mosaic Stadium — a prominent example of the mark the company has left on the province.

'They'll throw you trinkets and beads': chief

Jobs and employment are at the heart of the dispute between the First Nation of approximately 2300 people and the Fortune 500 company which is headquartered in Tampa Fla.

Mosaic operates three potash mines in Saskatchewan some of which are close enough to Kahkewistahaw First Nation to be seen by the naked eye.

Taypotat says Mosaic has failed to award millions of dollars in contracts to Kihew Fabco a metal fabrication company that is partially owned by the First Nation.

Based out of Melville Kihew Fabco is close to the mines owned by Mosaic.

However instead of awarding contracts to a company that would provide employment to members of the First Nation Mosaic has repeatedly chosen companies that operate in other provinces Taypotat said.

As a result Kihew Fabco is now mostly empty. It employs a staff of four when it could be operating with as many as 80 full-time staff Taypotat said.

In a statement Mosaic said it understands the nation's frustrations but that Kihew Fabco has been included in 109 bids for work.

""They bid on three and after working closely with them we did award them work in 2022 in the hopes that this would lead to a mutually beneficial and long lasting relationship"" the statement read.

Taypotat confirmed the fabrication company did get awarded a contract but said it was relatively minor especially for such a large company.

""They'll throw you bread crumbs. They'll throw you trinkets and beads and then they think you're going to go away with your little profit you've made"" he said.

Taypotat said Kahkewistahaw First Nation has attempted to deal with Mosaic the ""right way."" He said representatives have flown to Tampa and held meetings at the company's headquarters and invited corporate representatives to the First Nation but have been unsuccessful in convincing them to change their practices.

Now Kahkewistahaw First Nation is going public with its concerns to encourage the provincial government to hold Mosaic accountable and assist members of the First Nation he said.

""Canada has failed them and I'll be damned if I'm going to let Mosaic potash and the Government of Saskatchewan run roughshod over them in their golden years"" Taypotat says.

Saskatchewan First Act looms

The dispute comes after the provincial government introduced its Saskatchewan First Act which it says will confirm the province's autonomy and jurisdiction over natural resources.

But First Nations have raised alarm over the legislation which they say infringes on their inherent and treaty rights.

The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations says treaties only outline the sharing of land to the 'depth of a plow' which would mean the mining of minerals and other resources are retained by First Nations and not by governments or private industry. Taypotat made that argument again on Thursday.

The province has said it disagrees with that argument.

On Thursday during question period in the provincial legislature the Opposition pressed the provincial government on its commitment to the duty to consult.

""This government does take duty to consult seriously and that's exactly what we're doing"" Lori Carr the minister in charge of SaskBuilds said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNS1sYXJnZXN0LWZlcnRpbGl6ZXItY29tcGFuaWVzLXdvcmxkLTEyMzU0ODEyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World,"In this article we will take a look at the 15 largest fertilizer companies in the world. To skip our analysis of the recent market trends you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World.

The Fertilizer Industry: An Analysis

The growing global population climate change and water scarcity problems have joined forces to put a strain on the production of agricultural products globally. With a growing demand the need to generate higher crop yields from the existing arable land is rising. This is where fertilizer companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (NYSE:ADM) CF Industries Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CF) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) enter the picture. For healthy growth plants require three main nutrients: Nitrogen Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK). Farmers use fertilizers to fill the soil deficiencies in these nutrients for healthy growth of their crops.

Before we delve into the recent market trends for the fertilizer industry we need to understand the basics of how fertilizers are made. Basic Nitrogen-based fertilizers such as urea urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) and ammonium nitrate require ammonia as a feedstock produced most commonly from natural gas and coal in some cases. On the other hand Phosphorus and Potassium based fertilizers require mineral deposits of these elements.

Fertilizer prices have risen significantly in the recent past and may remain elevated at least in the near-term. Urea prices surpassed their 2008 peaks while phosphates and potash prices are close to 2008 levels according to the World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook. The Russia-Ukraine conflict led to sanctions on Russia and Belarus the two leading producers of fertilizers. The crisis was further exacerbated with the reduction in ammonia production due to higher natural gas prices. In addition China the largest producer of Nitrogen and Phosphorus imposed export restrictions to cater to domestic demand.

We have picked the top 15 fertilizer companies based on their market capitalization that are involved in the production and delivery of fertilizers. These companies are some of the largest producers of fertilizers worldwide with products including nitrogen potash and phosphate-based commodity fertilizers as well as complex and specialty fertilizers.

Apart from the public companies included in this list there are several privately-owned or state-owned companies that hold a significant market share in the fertilizer industry. Belarus-based Belaruskali OAO is the world’s second largest producer of potash. Prior to the sanctions imposed on the country the company through state-owned Belarusian Potash Company exported more than 10 million tons of its products per annum to 140 countries globally. China Brazil and India were its major customers.

Story continues

Moscow-based UralChem is a privately-owned producer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. It is the second largest ammonium nitrate producer in the world with production capabilities of 2.7 million tons of ammonium nitrate 2.2 million tons of ammonia 0.8 million tons of MAP and DAP 0.8 million tons of complex fertilizers and 0.5 million tons of urea.

EuroChem is a privately-held vertically integrated fertilizer producer with mining assets in Russia Kazakhstan and Brazil production assets across four continents and a global sales and distribution network. The company ranks among the top five mineral fertilizers producers globally with 27 million tons of fertilizer produced in 2021.

Thursdsay morning chief and members of the Kahkewistahaw First Nation stood in the chilly weather making a stand against Mosaic Potash and the Saskatchewan government on strengthening efforts on working together.

“Today I stand here frustrated offended slapped in the face” said Chief Evan Taypotat. “Kahkewistahaw First Nation has built a business thinking we would be able to participate and employ our members and other surrounding First Nation workers through trades like welding and pipe fitting and other trades only to be completely shut out.”

The First Nation owns a custom steel fabrication plan in Saskatchewan called Kihew Fab-Co Ltd. located in Melville which now sits empty according to Chief Taypotat. He said his First Nation approached Mosaic Potash to supply work which he claims they refused.

“(A) million-dollar facility sits empty because Mosaic ten kilometers from my First Nation won’t give us work” he said. “We don’t want free. We want to work for what we got.”

The Kahkewistahaw First Nation is located approximately 175 kilometers northeast of Regina.

Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email as it happens.

The Chief was accompanied by several members of his band to speak their minds on wanting answers from Mosaic Potash and the provincial government. An elder from the Kahkewistahaw First Nation said the government has a duty to consult as was agreed in the treaties – to share this land the depth of the plow.

“For years our people have lived under the thumb of the Indian Act. That didn’t allow us to grow” said Sharon Green. “We’re still being held out. We’re still not allowed to thrive … the contracts that would help the economy of Saskatchewan the contracts that would help the local businesses where are they going? They’re not going to (Kihew Fab-Co). They’re not going to Kahkewistahaw. They’re not going to Ochapowace. They’re going elsewhere.”

In a release Malcolm Macpherson who represents Kahkewistahaw stated the company has refused to meaningfully engage with the Kahkewistahaw First Nation.

“Potash extraction by Mosaic at the expense of Kahkewistahaw is all done under the watch of Premier Scott Moe’s government which is poised to introduce The Saskatchewan First Act” stated Macpherson. “Premier Moe’s government says the legislation is designed to clearly define that Saskatchewan — and Saskatchewan alone — has the exclusive jurisdiction over its natural resources and economic future.”

In an emailed statement to Global News Mosaic responded to concerns brought forward and said they understand Chief Taypotat’s frustration and said in the last two years Mosaic had included Kahkewistahaw fabrication shop in 109 bids for work and that they have responded to three.

“After working closely with them we did award them work in 2022 in the hopes that this would lead to a mutually beneficial and long-lasting relationship” stated Sarah Fedorchuk Mosaic vice-president of government and public affairs.

“On resource sharing Mosaic will pay $1.2 billion in resource taxes and royalties to the Government of Saskatchewan in 2022 which is used for services for all of its citizens. This is far and away the most exhaustive resource tax regime in the world with our global competitors paying 40% less taxes than the Canadian potash producers.”

Mosaic added that they have made significant progress on all of their key pillars and are on track or exceeding the targets this year on Indigenous Engagement.

“The work we do with our Indigenous partners is key to our success and it is our hope that we can have a constructive and engaging relationship with all of the communities that surround our operations” stated Mosaic."

The letter is a forecful response to a controversial CTIA report earlier this week (November 15) from telecoms lobby group CTIA which attacked the efficacy of spectrum sharing via a direct takedown of CBRS as a basis for future spectrum releases in the US. The CTIA report authored by Recon Analytics claimed CBRS has “low utilization low market demand and a dearth of innovative use cases”.

In response the new pro-CBRS letter – addressed to FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel and NTIA administrator Alan Davidson and seen by Enterprise IoT Insights – states that over 285000 CBRS base station devices are now live on CBRS airwaves at 3.55-3.7 GHz in the US. The total has been reached in just three years they declare since the FCC opened the band for shared and private cellular usage – and compares with 69543 new radio deployments by public mobile operators in the same period and 418887 in the “entire 40-year history” of public cellular in the US.

In other words new CBRS cell sites are going-in three times (300 percent) faster than the rate of public network expansion. The numbers also undermine any kind of shaky counter-argument that public cellular is an upgrade exercise originally on the grounds the three-year CBRS count is two thirds (69 percent) of the 40-year total for commercial cellular – even if it is so far an apple-and-orange measures of (mostly) 4G micro and 5G macro cells.

The signatories are mostly CBRS familiars from the telecoms space such as Airspan Networks Amazon Celona Charter Communications Comcast Cox Communications Federated Wireless Hewlett Packard Enterprise Mavenir Systems Motorola Solutions and Pollen Mobile. A handful of parties with more traditional ‘vertical’ interests have also signed notably agricultural giant Deere & Company and real estate firm JBG SMITH Properties.

The education sector (blurring with the healthcare and the municipal realm) is also represented by the American Library Association the Purdue Research Foundation and the Schools Health & Libraries Broadband Coalition (SHLB). The letter states that the whole of US industry “support[s] an inclusive approach to spectrum policy”; it recites use cases for CBRS networks variously in manufacturing farming logistics education and healthcare.

This gang of CBRS champs also urge the FCC and NTIA to follow the CBRS model for future spectrum releases on the grounds that it is efficient. In total 228 organizations have won priority-access (PAL) licenses at auction which is “almost 10 times the number of winning bidders in the exclusive-use 3.45 GHz band” the letter states. The general-access (GAA) portion of the CBRS band hosts nearly 900 different users across many sectors it says.

The CBRS model has made the US appear progressive and worth following the letter declares. It suggests Brazil Germany France Japan Sweden and the UK have all followed the US lead with mid-band ‘vertical’ spectrum. “The US has shown the world” they write. “In light of other countries’ moves toward greater spectrum sharing the US should extend its leadership by nurturing and growing CBRS.”

The letter concludes: “The CBRS allocation has fulfilled its promise as the ‘innovation band’ in an incredibly short period of time. The framework should be advanced for future spectrum allocations including in the lower 3 GHz band to enable greater competition innovation efficiency and American leadership. Thank you for continuing to support a spectrum policy that demonstrates America’s inventive spirit at its finest.”

The letter is copied in full below.

Last month Kelly Hill executive editor at RCR Wireless summed up: “Conversations on spectrum policy are shifting focus to renewing the pipeline of airwaves under consideration for future use both for 5G and as-yet-unstandardized 6G systems.” Federal agencies are also reconsidering how to shape the spectrum pipeline wrote Hill and where spectrum sharing may help to “bolster commercial spectrum access”.

Hill quoted the NTIA at a panel discussion at the Spectrum Policy Symposium in Washington D.C. “There are not a lot of easy bands left if any and we need better tools to be able to innovate our way through it” said the NTIA. A report from Coleago Consulting from July last year said average urban needs for mid-band spectrum (around 1.5-7.125 GHz) would be over 2000 megahertz by 2025-2030 and as high as 3690 megahertz in rich cities.

The same article also cited a study by Analysys Mason commissioned by CTIA which ranked the U.S. ahead of 15 global markets for licensed low-band and unlicensed mid-band provisions but eleventh of 15 for licensed mid-band spectrum availability.

Meanwhile the FCC has launched an inquiry into the use of up to 550 megahertz of spectrum at 12.7-13.25 GHz. The 12-13 GHz range falls into the “high midband”. The FCC has said it is “ideally suited for mobile broadband use as it is already allocated for terrestrial mobile services on a primary basis domestically.” It has extended an existing freeze on new operations in the band.

November 17 2022

Dear Chairwoman Rosenworcel and Administrator Davidson

Wireless spectrum is essential to America’s future technology leadership industrial might and global competitiveness. That’s why a remarkably broad swath of companies and organizations – representing manufacturing automotive agriculture energy retail commercial real estate communications media and supply chain industries as well as schools libraries and civil society groups – support an inclusive approach to spectrum policy. America needs a balanced policy that considers the needs of an extraordinarily diverse range of spectrum stakeholders who are investing in advanced networks to power the “5G economy”.

As we consider new spectrum options that can be made available to serve the American people we urge you to build on the demonstrated success of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum sharing model. The innovative CBRS licensing framework has driven innovation in the next generation of wireless networks. These networks advance investment protect critical U.S. leadership and security by enabling ongoing Department of Defense (DoD) and Federal missions in shared bands drive innovation and competition and maximize efficient use of the limited yet essential spectrum resource. Every day more devices services and organizations require access to a wider array of spectrum resources. Implementing approaches that promote a wide variety of advanced communications applications will powerfully advance the public good.

Spectrum Sharing Advances Investment

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) first authorized commercial equipment in the CBRS band just three years ago and completed its auction of shared licenses just two years ago. In that short timeframe CBRS is now being used throughout the country with over 285000 CBRS base station devices (CBSDs) already deployed in under three years. For comparison the commercial wireless industry has built 418887 cell sites over its entire 40-year history. (During the same three-year period that CBRS has been active cellular providers built 69543 cell sites – of which more than 10000 use CBRS.) As further evidence of a dynamic equipment ecosystem the FCC has certified 187 different CBRS base station models and 496 different end user client devices ranging from traditional smartphones and IoT modules and gateways to security cameras barcode scanners and building management sensors. Use of the CBRS band is vibrant and growing at an impressive pace.

Spectrum Sharing Drives Innovation

The CBRS framework provides users with flexibility to choose from the broadest range of technologies and service models driving innovation and competition in the private wireless market. Because CBRS spectrum is accessible to a wide variety of operators it provides options for operators in suburban rural and remote areas that are not adequately served by traditional carriers while also enabling private network users to customize networks to meet their needs.

CBRS is emerging as the home spectrum band for a myriad of advanced wireless use cases. For example:

– CBRS-powered networks are improving the efficiency of supply chains warehouses and critical seaports.

– CBRS is enabling advanced manufacturing techniques that enhance worker productivity and safety helping – American firms maintain their competitive edge.

– Farms are using CBRS to increase efficiency yields and cost savings.

– Transportation and shipping hubs are using private networks to support automated-guided vehicles moving cargo and to improve real-time logistics through faster wireless communications.

– Schools and libraries are using CBRS to close the digital divide and homework gap for underserved communities.

– Hospitals are using CBRS to triage and monitor patients including by connecting outdoor hotspots to indoor networks so nurses can test and triage patients outside the hospital setting.

– Airports entertainment venues and stadiums are using private CBRS networks to improve the guest experience by providing additional and dedicated bandwidth for venue operations.

These and many other use cases demonstrate that CBRS networks – along with complementary technologies like industrial automation artificial intelligence precision agriculture and edge computing providers – are essential to enabling an enterprise technology stack that propels American innovation and advanced industrial practices.



Spectrum Sharing Spurs Competition



CBRS enables “converged” delivery models that both compete with and bolster traditional wireless network services provided over exclusively licensed spectrum. It is also proving complementary to Wi-Fi. No single private entity or industry should hold the key to an enterprise university or other entity’s ability to access the public airwaves needed to deploy an innovative purpose-built network. The CBRS framework helps ensure that does not happen. This competition drives still more innovation creating a virtuous cycle.



Spectrum Sharing Maximizes Efficiency of a Limited Resource



CBRS uniquely combines auctioned and non-auctioned authorizations into a single frequency band maximizing the scale of the equipment ecosystem to the benefit of many different types of users. The FCC conceived of the CBRS shared-license model to allow the DoD to avoid band clearing (and its associated costs) and continue its critical operations while also allowing a wide variety of commercial operators to use spectrum in the same band. This tiered spectrum sharing model ensures the protection of America’s national security interests while allowing other users to make the most of a critical resource.



Both the auctioned (Priority Access License or PAL) and non-auctioned or licensed-by-rule (General Authorized Access or GAA) portions of the CBRS bands have demonstrated substantial success. The PAL auction resulted in 228 diverse winning bidders – almost 10 times the number of winning bidders in the exclusive-use 3.45 GHz band. PAL winners included wireless internet service providers and electric utilities cable operators and nationwide and regional mobile network operators. The GAA portion of the band hosts nearly 900 different users including factories cities school districts hospitals research centers schools public libraries utilities and other critical infrastructure. Most importantly unused PAL spectrum does not lie fallow and can be efficiently put to use by GAA spectrum users.

That all of these different user types can “cohabitate” in a single spectrum band is an achievement to be celebrated and replicated. At the same time as new technologies and techniques become available to make the CBRS automated dynamic sharing regime even more efficient it provides a framework for iterative improvement over time.

Spectrum Sharing Is Internationally Recognized

CBRS has become a model for spectrum sharing around the world. Recognizing the value of midband private 5G networks other countries are also working to make spectrum available in new ways for new users and uses. For example Germany France the United Kingdom Japan Brazil Sweden and other countries have all designated substantial amounts of shared midband spectrum for private and local networks.

– In Germany the Frankfurt Airport is working toward deploying a private 5G network to “control data and voice communication autonomously.”

– In Japan Sony is working to deploy internet service that will minimize “service disruptions caused by heavy traffic” in certain residential complexes.

– In the U.K. Verizon is using shared midband spectrum to develop a private 5G wireless network for the Associated British Ports.

– In Europe CEPT is studying CBRS-like dynamic sharing of low/medium power networks with satellite systems in the 3.8-4.2 GHz band.



With CBRS the United States has shown the world that spectrum can be made available without requiring inefficient allocations for a wide variety of different uses. In light of other countries’ moves toward greater spectrum sharing the United States should extend its leadership by nurturing and growing CBRS.



Conclusion



The undersigned parties believe that the CBRS allocation has fulfilled its promise as the “innovation band” in an incredibly short period of time. The framework should be advanced for future spectrum allocations including in the lower 3 GHz band to enable greater competition innovation efficiency and American leadership. Thank you for continuing to support a spectrum policy that demonstrates America’s inventive spirit at its finest.

GV previously named Google Ventures is the venture capital investment arm of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) which was founded in 2009 by Bill Maris. GV provides seed venture and growth stage funding to startups in the Internet software life science healthcare artificial intelligence transportation cyber security and agriculture sectors.

Though tech companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have well-rounded investment divisions others may not be as committed to their venture arms. With a US recession on the horizon some venture capitalists are hesitant to keep pouring into startups while their own revenues and profits are dwindling.

GV currently has more than $8 billion in assets under management with over 400 active portfolio investments across North America and Europe. Some of its prominent investment outcomes include Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLB) and Verve Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV). To date 65 of Alphabet-backed startups have had successful initial public offerings and 175 companies have been part of prominent M&A agreements.

Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a California-based company that provides sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic and genomic analysis. The genomic solutions are utilized in research and clinical settings for life sciences oncology reproductive health agriculture and other emerging applications.

The venture capital arm of Google first invested in Grail an American biotechnology company focusing on developing an early cancer screening test for people who do not have active symptoms. In September 2020 Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) announced an agreement to purchase Grail for $7.1 billion. Currently Alphabet’s GV Management holds a stake worth nearly $10 million in Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN).

Like Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLB) and Verve Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV) Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is one of the premier holdings in the Alphabet investment portfolio.

Story continues

Polen Capital made the following comment about Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) has had a very difficult year on what we believe are transitory issues. First the company closed its acquisition of Grail a startup early-stage cancer testing business it re-acquired (Grail was founded inside Illumina originally) for $8 billion without regulatory approval. Illumina management believes that European regulators have no jurisdiction over the transaction as Grail had no European presence or revenue and member states did not complain within the timeframe specified in applicable regulations. The regulators have challenged these assertions and are likely to try to require Illumina to divest Grail subject to Illumina’s appeal. In the meantime Grail has already been very dilutive to Illumina’s earnings and Illumina may have to sell the asset at the end of it all. It is unknown how much Grail could be sold for in this environment if Illumina is forced to divest. Second Illumina’s core sequencing business has also slowed. This is not unusual as the business has always been a bit lumpy but there are new competitors trying to prove that they can sequence genomes cheaper than Illumina without sacrificing accuracy. Our research here suggests: 1) competitor technologies do not seem to be as cost-effective or accurate in the real world as advertised providing limited risk to Illumina’s core business; 2) Illumina has unveiled its own next-generation technology which lowers the cost of sequencing the human genome to only $200 including data processing costs with world-class accuracy; 3) the slowdown in the core business is more macroeconomic as customers are looking to reduce consumables inventory levels in tough times and should pass quite quickly considering customers are continuing to use their sequencers at high levels; and 4) even if Illumina were forced to divest Grail we think they would likely be able to sell it for above what it purchased it for as all of the clinical data on the company’s Galleri cancer screen is now publicly available (it is very positive in our view). Grail has made significant commercial progress since its acquisition and the company should only be closer to U.S. regulatory approval. We believe we can buy the shares today at an extremely cheap valuation for the core business of a company that we view as having an unmatched position in a market that should be multiples of its current size in the years to come.”

“Beam Therapeutics Inc. is a biotechnology company pioneering a novel technology called base editing which allows for individual base pairs (the letters of DNA) to be modified. Shares fell along with other biotechnology stocks driven by a sudden rise in treasury yields. Early stage biotechnology stocks are particularly sensitive to interest rates because their cash flows are further in the future.

Its platform provides a comprehensive suite of cloud software products and financial technology solutions to its customers to connect front-of-house with back-of-house operations across all customer channels. Toast’s core module is its point-of-sale software solution and requires all customers to use Toast as their payment processor. Customers then have the option to bundle or add-on additional modules across operations digital ordering and delivery marketing and loyalty team management and back office. Toast today powers 48000 restaurants within the 860000 U.S. restaurant industry largely focusing on small- and medium-sized (“SMB”) restaurant customers (generally fewer than 10 locations but up to 50) with some larger enterprise customers as well. Toast is the clear market leader in SMB restaurant technology with the best product offering and only full end-to-end platform. We believe that as restaurants continue to invest in technology at an accelerated pace emerging from COVID Toast will be a big beneficiary given its leading market position and best-in-class product. At less than 6% penetration of U.S. restaurants and 3% penetration of its $15 billion recurring-revenue TAM Toast has a long runway for growth by signing on additional locations to the platform and increasing the attach rate of its value-add modules. Only 54% of customers today use 4 or more of Toast’s 10-plus modules each of which provide significant value to the customer and would drive Toast’s recurring revenue stream higher.”

I recently wrote about how renewable energy cannot easily respond to the large fluctuations in energy demand that occur throughout the day nor during temperature extremes thus the need for utility grid-level battery solutions. This week we'll explore energy storage solutions for mobility. In other words this is mostly about electric vehicle (EV) batteries - a much wilder and more early-stage world than one would imagine when seeing the growing number of EVs on the road.

Why now?

Multiple factors are making this an opportune time to look at this sector:

Geopolitics are creating multiple tailwinds

Governments worldwide are pushing for cleaner energy such as in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development signed by all members of the United Nations in 2015. But as the deadline nears pressure is intensifying as the world is not on track to meet those goals. At this month's COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the world is on a ""highway to climate hell"" and repeatedly hailed renewables as ""the only credible path"" to real energy security.

Domestically there is growing support. For example the U.S. Department of Energy has funded $209 million for twenty-six new laboratory projects focused on electric vehicles advanced batteries and connected vehicles. In addition the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes significant extensions expansions and enhancements of credits intended to support the widespread adoption of electric vehicles for both individual and commercial use as well as incentivizing efforts to on-shore parts of the electric vehicle manufacturing supply chain.

Past underinvestment likely means accelerating future funding in the space. According to Bloomberg in 2021 global investment in the low-carbon energy transition totaled $755 billion up from $595 billion in 2020 and just $264 billion in 2011. According to Bloomberg's New Energy Outlook energy transition investment needs to average $2.1 trillion between 2022 and 2025 about three times the total in 2021 to get on track for net zero goals. It will further need to double again to $4.2 trillion over the years 2026-2030.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) the invasion of Ukraine further emphasized the need for nations to have greater resilience when it comes to satisfying their energy needs which means for most pushing faster toward renewables.

Technology is reaching a price and performance tipping point

As with any new technology the first generation is expensive and has relatively poor performance compared to later generations. Think about the price and quality of flat-screen TVs when they first came out or for those of you who can remember this far back the size and functionality of the first mobile phones which looked and weighed more like bricks than the portable computers you have in your pockets and purses.

As adoption grows and supply chains get sorted out prices tend to go down and performance increases. This relationship between price and cumulative installed capacity is called the 'learning curve.' For lithium-ion batteries this learning curve means that prices have dropped an average of 18.9% every time the installed capacity has doubled. That means that the price of lithium batteries has declined a whopping 97% over the past three decades.

A battery with a capacity of one kilowatt-hour would have cost $7500 in 1991 but was just $181 in 2018 - that's a 41x decline and prices are still falling steeply. The cost of Li-ion batteries halved in the four years between 2014 and 2018. To put this decline in prices in context in 2018 the battery for a Tesla Model S 75D (which has a 75 kWh battery) would have been around $13600 but in 1991 it would have been $564000.

Many investors and fund managers are increasingly looking to build portfolios that reflect their preferences for clean energy solutions

Harvard announced last year that it no longer invests in fossil fuels. Instead it will use its $42 billion endowment to support the green economy. In 2020 the University vowed to work with its investment managers to create a path to ""net zero"" greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Early in 2022 Apollo Global Management pledged not to invest in fossil fuels in its next buyout fund. They are not alone and the trend is likely only going to grow from here.

The Problems

Over the past thirty years the lithium-ion battery developed by Professor John Goodenough (imagine having him grade your papers) in the 1970s has come to dominate electric energy storage particularly in transportation. While battery-powered transportation removes vehicle emissions it has its own problems:

Raw materials

The two biggest lithium-producing regions are Australia and Chile with China and Argentina producing to a lesser degree. In addition over half of lithium cobalt and graphite processing and refining capacity is in China.

The rapid increase in EV sales during the pandemic tested the resilience of battery supply chains and Russia's invasion of Ukraine further exacerbated the challenge. At the same time prices of raw materials such as cobalt lithium and nickel have surged. Russia supplies 20% of global high-purity nickel. The price of nickel is up over 80% over the past five years and nearly 50% over the past three years. Demand is only going to increase. For example the supply of lithium would need to rise by up to one-third by 2030 to match the demand for EV batteries to satisfy the pledges and announcements in the International Energy Agency (IEA) Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) and as you’ll read later this kind of growth will be exceptionally challenging.

Supply chains.

Despite the nearly ubiquitous Li-Ion battery there is a stunning lack of battery manufacturing outside Asia-Pacific. In 2021 the region accounted for 90% of global battery manufacturing but the recent pandemic and geopolitical tensions have increased the desire for manufacturing capacity in the West. Around three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries are produced in China alone which is also home to 70% of the production capacity for cathodes and 85% of the production capacity for anodes - both are critical components of batteries.

While Europe is home to over 25% of global EV production very little of the supply chain apart from 20% of the world's cobalt processing is in the region. Likewise the United States has an even more minor role in the global EV battery supply chain producing only 10% of the world's EVs and is home to just 7% of battery production capacity. With Asia-Pacific dominating EV and battery production most battery cell companies are not listed on US exchanges and/or are part of conglomerates.

Temperature sensitivity

Lithium-ion batteries perform best and live longest when kept at a comfortable temperature of between 68 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit. During normal operation Li-ion batteries can typically withstand a temperature range of -22F and 140F and during recharge they can withstand temperatures between 32F and 122F. The thing is these batteries generate a lot of heat during operation and their temperature must be brought down to within operating ranges. At high temperatures (between 158°F and 212°F or 70°C and 100°C) thermal runaways can occur causing a chain reaction that destroys the battery pack and can cause fires.

During fast charges Li-ion batteries must also be cooled down. This is because the high current going into the battery produces excess heat that must be extracted to preserve the high charging rate and not overheat the battery. They may also need to be heated as cells cannot be charged below 32F.

Potential Solutions

Since Li-ion batteries will likely dominate for many years the focus is on making them safer more resilient last longer and recycle as much as possible at the end of their useful life.

One of the significant challenges with lithium-ion batteries is to widen their operating temperature range. A paper recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (and really who doesn't subscribe?) discusses progress engineers at the University of California San Diego have made in developing lithium-ion batteries that can perform well at temperature extremes. With these batteries electric vehicles could travel farther on a single charge in cold climates and would put less demand on cooling systems to keep from overheating in hot climates extending range.

Another problem is the useful life of a Li-ion battery. As a battery charges and discharges the maximum potential energy it can hold and distribute slowly starts to degrade. Anyone with a smartphone tablet or laptop has experienced this lovely phenomenon. It is one thing to purchase a new phone after a few years when your current one's battery doesn't last but it is entirely different when talking about a car. The problem is compounded by the reality that many car manufacturers are dealing with the weight of the battery by incorporating it into the overall frame making it impossible to swap out.

Jeff Dahn a professor at Canada's Dalhousie University and research partner with Tesla (TSLA) since 2016 is working on what is being referred to as the 100-year 4-million-mile battery. Tesla’s current Lithium Iron Phosphate battery has lower energy density than more widespread Lithium-Ion alternatives but is cheaper more durable and allegedly safer too. They can last up to 12000 charge-discharge cycles. In contrast Professor Dahn's NMC 532 cells (the 4-million-mile battery) showed no capacity loss after nearly 2000 cycles and his team's paper extrapolates this to imply a 100-year lifespan.

Current potential lithium-ion alternatives

A paper in the August edition of the journal Nature by MIT Professor Donald Sadoway and 15 others at MIT described an aluminum-sulfur battery made from inexpensive abundant materials. In their experiments Sadoway's team showed that the battery cells could endure hundreds of cycles at exceptionally high charging rates with a projected cost per cell of about one-sixth that of comparable lithium-ion cells. This technology has spawned a new company called Avanti which has licensed the patents to the system.

Another option is a graphene battery which can be so thin as to be essentially just two-dimensional. Graphene Manufacturing Group Ltd (GMGMF) is working on such a solution. Graphene conducts electricity better than copper and can do so at a fraction of the weight with five times the energy density of a typical lithium-ion battery. One of this technology's many challenges is how to mass manufacture the thin sheets. The Chinese carmaker GAC recently announced the development of a graphene-based battery that can be recharged to 80% in eight minutes.

In 2017 the Samsung (SSNLF) Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) announced a breakthrough with a graphene battery but then went silent. As I mentioned earlier alternatives will arrive but will likely take decades to get to widespread use.

Another option comes from Solid Power in which both BMW (BMWYY) and Ford (F) have invested. The company is a leading producer of solid-state batteries for EVs. Its technology is expected to produce and scale next-generation all solid-state batteries that can provide an extended range at a lower cost and make for safer electric vehicles using existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure.

Regarding battery recycling there are not many publicly traded options for investors

Umicore SA (UMICY) treats pollutants metals and other industrial materials generating the majority of revenue from cleaning technologies including emission control devices components for rechargeable batteries and recycling solutions. Approximately half of the total sales derive from Europe.

Other ways to invest

Here are two ETFs for investors looking for a diversified way to invest.

Like most of the market Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) is down this year falling around 15% but has gained more than 180% over the past three years. The fund seeks to provide investment results that generally correspond to the price and yield performance before fees and expenses of the Solactive Global Lithium Index.

The fund seeks to provide investment results that generally correspond to the price and yield performance before fees and expenses of the Solactive Global Lithium Index. Amplify Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (BATT) is also down for the year around -25% YTD but is up over 120% from its March 2022 lows. The fund seeks investment results that generally correspond to the price and yield of the EQM Lithium & Battery Technology

There are a few options for those preferring to invest in natural resources used in Li-ion batteries. To keep up with demand experts predict that existing suppliers will all need to double their output every two to three years for the next ten years. But according to Albermarle (ALB) president Eric Norris no one has yet been reliably able to accomplish that which means price pressures will continue.

Albermarle is the world's largest lithium producer with salt brine deposits in Chile and the U.S. and hard rock joint ventures in Australia. The company is also a major producer of oil refining catalysts so this isn't a pure green energy play.

Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) is developing three lithium production assets: two brine resources in northwestern Argentina and a clay resource in Nevada U.S. but currently has no lithium production. The company expects the first Argentina resource to enter production in early 2023 and the Nevada project to enter production in the middle of the 2020s with the second brine resource Pastos Grandes to enter production in the late-2020s.

Much of the battery manufacturer space is pretty Wild West with some companies enjoying market caps of over $1 billion with little to no revenues.

Freyr Battery (FREY) went public last year via a SPAC and is a Norwegian-based emerging producer (meaning no revenues yet) of clean battery solutions. It aims to design and manufacture high-density and cost-competitive lithium-ion batteries with a reduced carbon footprint for electric mobility stationary energy storage marine and aviation applications. Rumor has it KKR is in talks with the company to invest half a billion.

QuantumScape Corp (QS) is another ""pre-revenue"" company. It is engaged in developing next-generation solid-state lithium-metal batteries for electric vehicles. It claims to have developed an anode-less cell design which delivers high energy density while lowering material costs and simplifying manufacturing.

The bottom line is that as the world moves towards emission-free transportation the demand for li-ion batteries and their components will experience accelerating demand which creates enormous opportunities in this surprisingly nascent investment arena.

NetApp BlueXP offers multiple capabilities for multi-cloud data storage environments including the following:

unified storage management across NetApp's broad portfolio of on-premises offerings as well as NetApp technology that resides within major public cloud providers such as Amazon FSx for NetApp OnTap Azure NetApp Files and Google Cloud Volumes;

integrated intelligence for health monitoring based on NetApp's ActiveIQ technology and telemetry data;

a ransomware dashboard along with governance monitoring to support cyber-resilience and ensure compliance across multi-cloud environments;

data mobility capabilities designed to simplify data movement tiering and caching across multiple platforms; and

the ability to centralize and simplify management of NetApp's flexible consumption models across its multiple offerings.

The announcement was coupled with a strategic vision for BlueXP to become a conduit for NetApp customers to reach an ""evolved cloud"" -- a hybrid and multi-cloud environment that simplifies and automates operations.

From distributed cloud to 'evolved cloud' At Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) we have been discussing the concept of the distributed cloud for a while now using it as a way to highlight how complex contemporary IT and application environments have become. Environments today span multiple disparate distributed locations including data centers public clouds colocation facilities and edge locations. As environments scale they become more distributed and complex and the task of managing maintaining and optimizing these environments is being spread across more teams that use different tools processes and procedures. The complexity of distributed IT and application environments cripples operations. According to ESG research 64% agree that the complexity of their IT infrastructure slows IT operations and digital initiatives. Addressing the challenges of the distributed cloud and achieving an evolved state should be the priority of every IT executive. Businesses simply need more from public and private cloud services -- or as NetApp would say the world needs an evolved cloud. The public cloud has changed the way we all operate but like all great innovation the world eventually adopts and embraces it and it becomes table stakes. Just using public cloud services isn't going to provide a competitive edge anymore -- because everyone else is doing so as well. Is NetApp the right partner to make it happen? Time will tell but I won't bet against it. NetApp has a history of being right with its visionary direction. In 2014 NetApp was discussing the need to extend a data fabric across clouds something nearly every organization desperately needs today. There is an early mover advantage here. While not the first NetApp also is not late to the space. And while the world needs a unified control plane for multi-cloud when it comes to multi-cloud environments data placement and movement are some of the most difficult problems to solve. If NetApp only helps address that one issue they likely have a winner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYmxvY2tzYW5kZmlsZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvZnVuZ2libGUtZmlnaHRpbmctZm9yLWFkb3B0aW9uLWJ5LWN1c3RvbWVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Competition gets heated on Fungible's DPU patch – Blocks and Files,"Data processing unit startup Fungible is facing increasing competition as its avenues for growth become restricted and ever more fiercely contested.

The company was founded in 2015 to develop and build data processing unit (DPU) chips which would offload intrasystem storage network and security processing in large-scale datacenters from server x86 CPUs. DPU chips can process the instructions in these tasks more efficiently than general-purpose x86 CPUs. Offloading such east-west traffic and processing loads would enable x86 processors to do more application processing and save costs in datacenters with hundreds or thousands of such servers.

However seven years later and three years after its last funding round it faces five strong competitors – AMD Intel Kalray Marvell and Nvidia – and has yet to announce any major customers or OEM deals.

Pradeep Sindhu and Betrand Serlet

Founders Pradeep Sindhu and Bertrand Serlet both have illustrious tech backgrounds. Sindhu was the founding CEO and chairman of Juniper Networks then vice chairman CTO and chief scientist leaving to startup Fungible. Serlet was SVP of Software Engineering at Apple after which he founded consumer cloud storage business Upthere which was bought by Western Digital in 2017. Prior to that he was SVP of Software Engineering at Apple a software engineering director at Steve Jobs’ NeXT before that and a one-time researcher at Xerox PARC where he overlapped with Sindhu another PARC alumnus.

Fungible raised $32.5 million in an A-round in 2017 followed by $60 million in a B-round the same year. Then it took in a further $200 million in 2019.

It developed two impressive DPU chips: the device front-end F1 for storage analytics AI server or security appliance use and the server-based S1 for bare-metal server virtualization node security storage initiator local instance storage and network function virtualization (NFV).

Fungible FS1600 storage node with lid removed

Two F1s are used in Fungible’s FS1600 scale-out disaggregated storage node with storage accesses coming in across an NVMe over TCP interconnect.

Acquisition and composability

Fungible bought the assets of composability software developer Cloudistics in September 2020. This became part of Fungible’s Data Center Composer a centralized software suite that enables bare-metal composition provisioning management and orchestration of infrastructure at all scales.

At the time Sindhu said: “We are doubling down on our vision of revolutionizing datacenter infrastructure at all scales. We see progress towards this grand vision in two parts. The first which we’ve already achieved is to develop a new class of microprocessors called the Fungible DPU that promises to provide significant improvements in infrastructure performance economics security and reliability.”

“The second equally important part is to build software that dynamically composes disaggregated DPU-powered servers into one or more computational clusters each designed to run a specific workload. With these two parts working together synergistically we are taking a leap forward toward the holy grail of providing high performance and high agility in datacenters.”

That holy grail proved unreachable.

Eric Hayes

Eric Hayes was hired as CEO in July last year. The company has built up a sales channel with a global program launch in April this year and has partners in Asia.

Also in April it launched Fungible GPU-Connect (FGC) a technology to link pools of GPUs to servers across a virtual PCIe network running on Ethernet and managed by its DPU hardware. Service provider customers could compose (provision allocate deploy and manage) GPU resources to servers on demand. There was no partnership with any GPU vendor announced and Nvidia had its own competing GPUDirect technology.

In August the Hayes-led Fungible laid off staff and scaled its composable systems ambitions back to concentrate on its storage cluster technology. It said the pivot was required as the composability market’s development was slow partly due to an absence of standards.

At the time it said: “Two years ago Fungible decided to augment its DPU portfolio with higher-level composability software solutions through acquisition and organic development. Despite our best efforts Fungible was unable to realize traction in the orchestration space compared to the success it has experienced with its DPU-based storage technology.”

Entrenched DPU player competition

The main players in the DPU market are AWS with its in-house Nitro tech; Intel with its IPU sold to hyperscalers; AMD which bought DPU chip startup Pensando; Nvidia with its in-house BlueField tech which it claims is faster than Fungible; newcomer Kalray with its MPPA tech; and Marvel with its Octeon 10 product.

Nvidia has a strong partnership with VMware Kalray has announced a big OEM deal while AMD Intel and Marvell are companies with strong channels through which they can pump product. All this limits Fungible’s DPU market. For example VAST Data has chosen Nvidia’s BlueField DPU for its Ceres storage enclosures; that’s one potential OEM gone. Dell is buddying up with VMware and Nvidia for VxRail systems; that’s another door closing.

AMD’s Pensando DPU is available from the top server OEM’s factories: Dell’s VxRail HCI DPU-powered system and PowerEdge servers and HPE’s ProLiant. Chris Ratcliffe Networking Solutions Group marketing lead at AMD said: “That means we’re good for a diverse set of enterprise and CSP/SP workloads.”

The composable systems market is fast developing and settling around CXL as the standard but this requires a new generation of servers using AMD’s Genoa and Intel’s Sapphire Rapids processors. It also needs CXL end-point hardware and system software neither of which is a Fungible core competency. That helps explain Fungible’s pivot away from composability.

The storage market for shared NVMe SSD chassis is hotly contested with Dell HPE IBM NetApp Pure Storage and VAST Data present – all well-funded and delivering products to the market. Like Lightbits Fungible focused on NVMe over TCP seeing it as the logical upgrade to iSCSI SANs but the mainstream suppliers support NVMe/TCP as well. Increased array speed and lower-latency becomes a relatively small benefit in the overall scheme of things when set against mainstream suppliers’ sales channel strength and customer loyalty.

The funding door for storage tech startups has also been closing unless they are concerned with data analytics software think Alation ($123 million) or key:value SSDs think Pliops ($100 million) but Fungible competitor Lightbits swam against this tide by raising $42 million in June as did edge HCI player Scale Computing which took in $55 million in July.

We understand from sources that Fungible tried to raise more money but could not do so. Some more people were let go and now the executives board and investors face the quandary of how to sustain the company’s growth and future in a market with strongly entrenched competitors. We have even begun to hear unconfirmed rumors of it being acquired.

Asked about this Fungible VP for marketing Jennifer Bell said: “Fungible remains committed to its clients and partners and does not comment or speculate on acquisition rumors.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYmxvZ3MvYXBuL3lvdXItZ3VpZGUtdG8tdm13YXJlLWNsb3VkLW9uLWF3cy1hdC1yZWludmVudC0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your Guide to VMware Cloud on AWS at re:Invent 2022 | Amazon Web Services,"By Bianca Velasco Product Marketing Manager – AWS

However Züs boasts a parallel design that its leaders claim makes it faster than those competitors. Whether that claim can be backed up remains to be seen – as does Züs itself.

Web3 decentralized storage (dStorage) is typically based on a peer-to-peer network of private or small business IT resource providers using blockchain to verify that they are supplying what they should. Cryptocurrency payments and rewards are used so they supply it in a trustworthy manner like a centralized storage provider such as AWS Azure or Google. Culturally decentralized storage (and compute) suppliers position themselves as democratizing IT so that it is provided by the people for the people – often presented with evangelical fervour.

Züs is a rebrand of 0Chain which says its vision “has always been to empower people with access to and control over their own data. Züs the God of the Sky will finally take Web3 beyond the cloud.” See? Evangelical fervour.

CEO Saswata Basu issued a canned statement: “0Chain has evolved from a blockchain technology a journey we embarked on five years ago to a cloud solution platform that empowers people and businesses to be limitless. Züs is ready to power the full arrival of Web3.”

Performance

We are told Züs can store data with better security privacy availability and performance than traditional cloud. It creates an economy for small business growth and passive income for individuals.

Züs’s parallel design involves breaking a file into chunks and writing them in parallel to individual storage nodes (blobbers in its jargon). It says it’s able to match AWS S3 performance and is suitable for applications with faster performance needs than storing cold data. Züs says that “while platforms like Filecoin and IPFS are good for archival storage their slower-than-average transaction speeds present long-term limits for Web3 storage.”

An 0Chain document claims: “we provide a competitive speed relative to NetApp’s Cloud offering” – referring to NetApp’s Cloud Volumes service on AWS. It asserts “for enterprises 0Chain dStorage provides a fast throughput for your data and transactions.”

We were told by a Züs spokesperson that: “0chain (Züs) was founded in 2017 around the same time as Filecoin and has simply approached the same problem from a different direction resulting in measurably better results when compared against the industry-leading centralized storage products.”

We have asked for but haven’t seen any “measurably better results” – like say detailed benchmark runs or comparative quantified I/O speeds.

Decentralized storage jargon

The spokesperson also told us that “many decentralized technologies still rely on centralized cloud data storage.” We asked for names and were given the example of NFT Marketplaces – websites where users can trade non-fungible tokens or NFTs.

It’s typical with Web3 decentralized storage providers like Filecoin and Züs that there are no brochures or data sheets or any other documentation types associated with traditional (Web 2.0) storage providers. Instead Züs relies DevOps style on GitHub (this for example) and has its own level of near-impenetrable jargon. For example: “0Chain provides an easy-to-scale infrastructure through Miners Sharders and Blobbers that perform several duties necessary for functional blockchain and storage systems.”

The developers behind decentralized storage present their internal blockchain mining technical concepts like this in a way that is quite foreign to traditional storage suppliers such as NetApp Pure Dell etc. Interested parties have to go through a steep conceptual learning curve before they can even understand what’s going on.

For interested parties more information about Züs can be found here and also here.

Comment

The inherent complexity of decentralized storage – with blockchain-verified transactions and potentially huge peer-to-peer networks of cryptocurrency-using small-scale suppliers – will limit its I/O speed and its acceptability to customers. Because dStorage suppliers want philosophically to tear down the public cloud titans and other centralized storage suppliers like Dropbox they are asking if not requiring their customers to adopt the same philosophical choice.

This and their dense jargon will distance them from customers who have an intrinsically centralized approach in their own business activities. Any business with an on-premises IT infrastructure has by default a centralized approach – and may well find decentralized storage and compute concepts alien to its way of thinking.

Züs was supposed to arrive on October 26 yet the website is still parked at GoDaddy. The 0Chain website makes no mention of Züs beyond a “something is coming” teaser and the @Zus_Network twitter feed has made no posts. We asked the company what is going on. It didn’t tell us.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlaXJlbGFuZC5pZS8yMDIyLzExLzE4L25vdmVtYmVyLWVtcGxveW1lbnQtcm91bmR1cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,November Employment Roundup: Tánaiste confirms Twitter redundancy notice received for over 100 jobs,"Our November 2022 roundup of some employment news around Ireland continues with news that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar has confirmed his Department has received a redundancy notice from Twitter on 18 November ‘confirming about 140 redundancies’.

ICTU: ‘Appalling’ the manner and approach Twitter has taken

The General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions Owen Reidy has said the manner and approach taken by Twitter in laying-off some staff in Dublin is ‘appalling’.

According to Reuters Twitter Inc temporarily closed its offices and cut workers’ access to internal systems on 04 November after telling employees they would be informed by email about whether they were being laid off.

The move comes after a week of uncertainty under the social media company’s new owner Elon Musk.

AFP said Mr Musk is looking to cut around 3700 Twitter staff or about half the workforce.

#BREAKING Twitter tells staff 'roughly 50%' of workforce hit by layoffs internal document says pic.twitter.com/7A4zUpNfbr — AFP News Agency (@AFP) November 4 2022

Reuters believe that staff who worked in engineering communications product and content curation were among those impacted by the layoffs according to tweets from Twitter staff.

‘Shock and awe’

Reuters reported that some staff tweeted they lost access to work email and Slack channels before receiving an official notice ‘which they took as a sign they had been laid off’.

Twitter employees took to the social media network to express their feelings about the layoffs using the hashtag #OneTeam.

Looks like I’m unemployed y’all. Just got remotely logged out of my work laptop and removed from Slack. #OneTeam forever. Loved you all so much. So sad it had to end this way 💔 — simon balmain (@SBkcrn) November 4 2022

Reuters also reported that Twitter has hired consulting firm KPMG in some international markets to assist with the layoffs ‘according to one person familiar with the manner’.

Twitter’s Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) headquarters are in Dublin employing around 500 people.

Reuters said a member of security staff at the Dublin 2 headquarters told reporters that ‘nobody was coming into the office on Friday and employees had been told to stay home’.

According to Reuters another member of security staff locked the revolving doors at the front of the building in George’s Quay Plaza.

Mick Barry Socialist Party and Solidarity TD for Cork North Central condemned the layoffs as a ‘massacre’.

Elon Musk's jobs massacre and lockout show capitalism's true face. Whether it's William Martin Murphy in 1913 or a tech billionaire today profit is king under this system and workers will be treated like dirt if it suits them. Organise! #TwitterLayoffs — Mick Barry TD (@MickBarryTD) November 4 2022

ICTU General Secretary Owen Reidy said the decision by Twitter ‘given its recent takeover to restructure and lay off some staff in Dublin is not in itself unusual’.

However he added ‘what is appalling is the manner and approach the company has taken’.

The union said the approach as reported ‘is all about shock and awe’.

“It’s about destabilising and undermining workers’ confidence and their capacity to react and challenge in any way this brutal decision” it said in a statement.

The Communications Workers’ Union said it called on Twitter to respect collective redundancy legislation in Ireland.

All companies must obey the law and Twitter is no exception. The CWU calls on the company to notify and engage with the Minister and to respect collective redundancy legislation here in Ireland. Talk to the staff representatives.#Joinaunion #twitterlayoffs — CWU Ireland (@CWU) November 4 2022

ICTU’s Owen Reidy said the action by Twitter ‘highlights the need for fair and strong labour standards globally’.

“These workers should have had the right to consultation and the consideration of alternative decisions. In most unionised environments including many global cutting-edge companies collective engagement and consideration of alternatives take place before such a decision.”

“This decision today highlights the need for stronger workers’ rights and in particular the right for workers to organise and ensure that their collective voice is heard and heeded” added Mr Reidy.

Primark creates 300 new jobs for re-opening of new store in historic Belfast building

Primark which is what Penneys trades as in the UK has announced it is creating nearly 300 new jobs at its reopened store in Belfast.

The historic Bank Buildings which housed the flagship store was reduced to a shell in August 2018 by a large fire.

The new Primark at The Bank Buildings was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of Belfast on Tuesday morning 01 November.

Lord Mayor of Belfast Councillor Tina Black said:

“It’s really wonderful to be here today to see the reopening of this iconic Belfast building. As a former Primark employee myself I have many happy memories of working here during my university years and now a new chapter begins for the staff. When the fire devastated Bank Buildings back in 2018 it was hard to imagine ever reaching this point; but over the last few years we’ve witnessed the painstaking work that has gone in to restoring this beautiful heritage building and like everyone I’m thrilled to see it reopen its doors today with the added boost of creating new jobs.”

Between the Yellowjackets plane crash Severance’s creepy-ass office and the big hole in Outer Range there’s lots to occupy your fan theory group chats. Joining that ever-growing list is 1899 on Netflix — and it’s a doozy. The eight-episode-long series packs a frankly astonishing number of mysteries and twists into its runtime making it an ideal binge. I’m still not entirely sure what if anything it all means but I had a blast trying to fit the pieces together.

1899 comes to us from Jantje Friese and Baran bo Odar the same creative team behind another Netflix thriller the German series Dark. 1899 is a multilingual affair. It takes place on a passenger ship during (obviously) the year 1899 and the vessel is carrying a group traveling from Europe to the US. There’s a newlywed French couple (Mathilde Ollivier and Jonas Bloquet) a brooding German captain (Andreas Pietschmann) a Spanish priest and his spoiled brother (José Pimentão and Miguel Bernardeau) a Chinese mother and daughter (Gabby Wong and Isabella Wei) Polish and English coal shovelers and a lower deck stuffed with poor Danish passengers among many others. It’s an ensemble affair but at the center of it all is Maura (Emily Beecham) an English woman who studies medicine but can’t actually practice because she’s a woman.

As is common in these kinds of stories the characters don’t have much in common at first aside from the fact that they’re running away from something — and they’re all hiding an important secret. As in the early days of Lost each episode opens with a flashback to a specific character giving you a bit of insight into who they are and why they’re on the ship. That would be enough drama but 1899 isn’t content to be a character study. Things get downright strange pretty quickly.

The mysteries feel par for the course for a story about a bunch of people stuck on a boat. But then the ship comes into contact with the Prometheus a nearly identical boat that mysteriously sunk four months prior. There are possible ghost sightings and a fog so thick it would make Stephen King proud. There are characters with lost memories unclear motivations and eventually even a mutiny as people die and angers flare. But those early reveals become tame in comparison to the true reality of 1899.

That takes a while however. It’s really not until the final few minutes that the scale of the show becomes evident. Before that you’re treated to far too many clues and mysteries to count. Seriously this is a show you’ll want to pay very close attention to partly because you won’t want to miss important details but also because the dialogue is in multiple languages. The camera loves to linger over clues making sure you notice the number of a room cabin or the text in a handwritten letter.

The fun of the show is less in the ultimate reveal and more in following all of the small and strange details that get you to that point. It won’t be long before you’re spotting triangles and pyramids everywhere. It’s really hard to say too much without spoiling things but I can confirm that despite being a puzzle box narrative connoisseur I still found myself frequently unable to figure out where the show was headed which was refreshing. Just when I thought I had a grasp on things some bizarre new wrinkle was introduced.

There are a few oddities. The show has a very strange tendency to end each episode with a classic rock song which feels entirely out of place amidst its otherwise harsh industrial score. And the characters really love to monologue in front of people who have no idea what they’re saying because of the language differences. These monologues aren’t necessarily bad but it’s hard to believe the other passengers would sit around nodding along when they don’t understand a single word. I should also warn that it’s a pretty grim story all grey and gloom with very little humor and one particularly disturbing depiction of sexual violence.

For mystery fans though it’s the ideal kind of show: one that even if you aren’t satisfied by the ending is a blast to talk about. I’ve been DMing everyone I know telling them to watch just so I have people to swap theories with (especially now that Twitter is let’s say preoccupied). There are few better distractions than asking your friends why one of the crew members’ face won’t heal or figuring out why there are shimmering bugs on a ghost ship."

A Timmins mine has announced a major investment in its water treatment efforts.

Today Premier Doug Ford was in town to make the $160-million announcement for Newmont Porcupine.

Few details about the facility were made available at the event that was also attended by Timmins MPP and Minister of Mines George Pirie Minister of Northern Development and Indigenous Affairs Greg Rickford and Newmont Porcupine general manager Dawid Pretorius.

While the Premier revealed the news the province has not contributed to the initiative.

""That’s Newmont they’re investing in it. We’re so grateful for that” said Ford.

During his comments Ford said the new water treatment facility is a ""huge vote of confidence in the sustainable future of Ontario mining.""

""And it’s another clear sign that Ontario’s mining industry can lead the world in responsible mining because Northern Ontario’s blessed with some of the most mineral-rich deposits anywhere in the entire world. These are the critical minerals needed for advanced technologies clean energy solutions and the electric vehicles of the future” he said.

No one from Newmont was available to comment on the project at the announcement.

In a news release the company said the water treatment plant will be finished before the end of the year and begin discharging in 2023. Once in operation it will return 13 million cubic metres of treated water into the Mattagami Frederickhouse and Upper Kapuskasing watersheds.

""Throughout 2021 and 2022 Newmont made a $160-million investment into the new plant which will benefit the entire ecosystem and surrounding watershed through the collection treatment and return of impacted water. Provincially this plant will have among the lowest effluent discharge limits within the mining sector"" reads the news release.

During his 31 years at News Corp Dore edited four mastheads for Murdoch and was the most powerful editorial executive in his Australian business.

He was close to the co-chairman of News Corp Lachlan Murdoch who was made general manager of Queensland Newspapers in the 1990s and then was publisher of the Australian.

As well as being editor-in-chief of the Australian for four years Dore edited the Daily Telegraph the Courier Mail and the Sunday Times in Perth and was deputy editor of the Sunday Telegraph.

But when he announced his resignation on Wednesday citing “personal health issues” there were no accolades from the Murdochs or the company’s top brass.

Sources said there was a meeting of the News Corp Australia editorial board which Dore chairs on Wednesday afternoon and an email went out to staff soon after saying Dore was leaving the company. Even the editorial executives at Holt Street were blindsided by the news.

Three weeks earlier Dore joined News Corp’s global chief Robert Thomson and executives from Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal at the WSJ Tech Live conference in California held at Laguna Beach between 24 and 26 October.

Speakers included the model and skin care entrepreneur Hailey Rhode Bieber and the now-embattled crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried.

Guardian Australia has confirmed Dore attended the event and was witnessed chatting with top executives at one of a number of cocktail parties held at the event.

Sources said after witnessing Dore’s behaviour News Corp management told him to take an extended break.

He never returned to the company.

The WSJ Tech Live conference was a News Corp global event attended by the company’s sponsors advertisers and executives. It was hosted by the CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of the WSJ Almar Latour and Thomson.

News Corp declined to comment on the exact circumstances of Dore’s abrupt departure not just from the newspaper but from the company.

In an email to staff the News Corp Australasia executive chairman Michael Miller said: “Chris is also undergoing surgery this week and we wish him the best.

“I have asked Michelle Gunn to continue to edit the Australian” Miller’s note said.

“Michelle who also began her career as a cadet on the Australian has been editor since May 2020 and previously was editor of the Weekend Australian for eight years.”

Miller went on to praise Gunn as having an “insightful understanding of the Australian’s audience and the issues and debates that interest them most which are at the heart of the nation’s future” without a word of praise for Dore.

In his own note to staff Dore said he was “exhausted” and “can’t keep going on like this”.

“I have long-standing personal health issues I need to resolve and am leaving News to concentrate on restoring my health” he said. “I will also be undergoing surgery this week so will have to postpone farewells until a later time.”

In his note to staff Dore said he had been “blessed” to edit four Murdoch titles.

“I am beyond proud that this year the Australian recorded its most profitable result in our near 60-year history as Robert Thomson noted at the News Awards and has transformed into a genuine digital powerhouse built on the biggest subscriber base of loyal passionate readers and a group of innovative and adventurous journalists photographers designers and editors” he said.

In March Dore was asked by the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas to be the first in a series of editors to speak about his craft.

In his lecture he said the media industry was being tarnished by activist journalists who had “an irrational and tireless obsession with tearing down News Corporation journalism”.

He said some journalists were so “vain self-obsessed craving indulgent needy” that they were “undermining their profession” and they should stick to reporting and not give their opinion.

“Too many journalists are inserting themselves into their stories or worse still into other reporters’ stories” Dore said. “Some reporters are chasing the cheap wild and ready-made approval of the in-crowd instead of chasing the more elusive yarn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvbXVyZG9jaC1kZWFsLXdpbGwtc3RydWdnbGUtYmUtZmFpci1iYWxhbmNlZC0yMDIyLTExLTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breakingviews - Murdoch deal will struggle to be fair and balanced,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/murdoch-deal-will-struggle-be-fair-balanced-2022-11-17/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvbXVyZG9jaC1kZWFsLXdpbGwtc3RydWdnbGUtYmUtZmFpci1iYWxhbmNlZC0yMDIyLTExLTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3Bpbm9mZi5jby5uei9tZWRpYS8xNy0xMS0yMDIyL3RoZS1ydXBlcnQtbXVyZG9jaC1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLWJpbGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Rupert Murdoch protection bill,"Following reports that Rupert Murdoch might be ‘plotting a return’ to New Zealand Toby Manhire looks at the global shadow he casts in media business and politics across more than six decades – including a heated 1965 parliamentary debate between Holyoake and Kirk.

Even now the front page of a tabloid packs a visceral punch. Giant headlines bloated puns garish images; there is nothing quite like it. All the more so if it’s a News Corp title. Then it becomes also a sign a smoke signal a message not quite from God but close: the most dangerous man in the world Rupert Murdoch.

That’s how it went last week when the headline on the late edition of the New York Post responded to a disappointing night in the midterms for the Republicans by hailing “DeFUTURE”. The celebration of Florida governor Ron Desantis “romping to victory” was an unsubtle dig at Donald Trump against whom he is expected to run for the presidential nomination. Even less subtle was the next day’s splash. “TRUMPTY DUMPTY” it read pointing the finger of blame at a man perched eggily on a wall. “Don (who couldn’t build a wall)” chortled the coverline “had a great fall – can all the GOP’s men put the party back together again?”

Those front pages together with a Trump-critical mood in the Wall Street Journal and on Fox News had commentators immediately divining confirmation that Murdoch was done with Trump and his Maga tribe. Murdoch had “appeared to make clear that he would prefer to cast aside Trump in favor of DeSantis” said CNN. “A marriage of convenience that paid huge political and financial dividends has ruptured in spectacular fashion” said the Financial Times. Even Saturday Night Live pounced on “the week Murdoch officially turned on Donald Trump”

Implicit in so much of the coverage is Murdoch’s place in the political firmament. The epithet above – the most dangerous man in the world – is not my hyperbole but Joe Biden’s. My guess is Murdoch would be thrilled. Bestriding the worlds of media business and politics across the western world Murdoch the press baron embodies the Machiavellian maxim that it is better to be feared than loved. Feared even by Trump a man impervious to normal human emotion. Only Murdoch can exact revenge deliver schadenfreude. It’s all there in Vanity Fair’s headline. “Rupert Murdoch knees Trump in the balls while he’s doubled over coughing up blood.”

Murdoch the man is softly spoken. But his voice his influence – sometimes real sometimes exaggerated sometimes imagined always obsessed over – has echoed through the halls of politics for more than six decades. Little wonder then that a less violent local headline this month “Murdoch plots New Zealand return” sent a shiver down spines. The Australian mogul has been a fascination here as almost everywhere since the 60s when Keith Holyoake and Norman Kirk debated the meaning of Murdoch with passion and at length in the New Zealand parliament.

‘Do we want Murdoch to take over and eliminate our newspapers?’

New Zealand was the first foreign media foray for a young and tenacious Rupert Murdoch. In January 1964 he sailed across the Tasman and toured New Zealand with friends in a Morris Minor. The 32-year-old then steadily building his Australian portfolio from a single newspaper in Adelaide (all that was left of his father Keith’s once strong media stable) happened on the news that Lord Thomson a powerful UK-based Canadian press baron was seeking to purchase a controlling stake in Wellington’s Dominion newspaper. Murdoch decided to take him on.

The next month a commentator in London’s Financial Times noted the counter-bid by the “energetic young Australian newspaper proprietor” writing: “Mr Murdoch unlike Lord Thomson likes editorial power as much as he likes making money and lays down some pretty controversial policies in his papers … New Zealanders at large seem to wish a plague on both bidders.”

Murdoch outfoxed Thomson (from whom years later he would purchase the establishment title he so coveted the Times of London) purchasing a number of shares on the open market and secured a dominant stake of almost 30% in the Wellington Publishing Company.

The two moguls’ tussle for the newspaper led to Keith Holyoake driving through New Zealand’s parliament the News Media Ownership Bill of 1965 which would limit future overseas ownership of news operations to 20%. The National prime minister wrote biographer Barry Gustafson “played a more prominent and passionate role in the debate in parliament on this bill than on almost any other piece of legislation during his long career”. Its intention Holyoake told parliament was to protect homegrown journalism against the fickle or malign self-interest of foreign press barons.

Labour leader Norman Kirk railed against an “obnoxious iniquitous repressive” bill. The government’s real concern he judged was maintaining the sympathetic press coverage it enjoyed under the status quo. “This is not a News Media Ownership Bill but a National Government Protection Bill” said Kirk. “It is a first step towards removing the independence of the press.”

Others accused Holyoake of doing Murdoch’s bidding. Labour MP Warren Freer asked whether it was “designed as a means of rewarding a certain individual by the name of Mr Rupert Murdoch” who had already established a toehold in the New Zealand media. Freer pointed to “mysterious secret hole-in-the-corner negotiations with the prime minister” that saw Murdoch “a hard-headed businessman forgo some of his voting privileges”.

The president of the New Zealand Journalists’ Association was similarly opposed. “The effect of the legislation” he said “is specifically to protect the interests of one overseas investor the News Limited group of Adelaide headed by Mr Rupert Murdoch.”

Holyoake accepted that he had held discussions with Murdoch but his motives were the same: to limit foreign influence. Those calling the legislation the “Murdoch Protection Bill” were quite wrong he said. On the contrary “the issue at this stage is do we want Murdoch to take over and eliminate our newspapers?”

‘The most humble day of my life’

Fast forward 46 years from Holyoake and Kirk to another bigger parliament and a scene that must sit at the centre of any Murdoch biopic. It was the summer of 2011 and the line outside the Wilson Room at Portcullis House began forming before 7am. The box-office attraction: Rupert Murdoch along with his son James the boss of the family’s UK operations appearing before Westminster’s culture media and sport committee to face questions over the phone hacking at the News of the World.

The scandal revealing illegal activity on a near-industrial scale had engulfed the paper and the wider company and dominated British headlines for many months. A week before the father-son pair faced the parliamentary committee Murdoch Snr had taken the jaw-dropping decision to fold the 168-year-old title to put a bullet in the head of his beloved first British media property acquired a full 43 years earlier.

Murdoch had poured blood sweat and ink into the tabloid which had grown on his watch into the biggest selling newspaper in the western world. Shovelling freshly raked scandal into millions of homes across Britain every Sunday morning its fascination with what happened between the bedsheets saw it nicknamed “the Screws”. Its own humiliation was another parade of celebrities except this time they were pointing the finger and the villain was the rag and its hacks. The end of the World was the revelation that along with dozens of footballers and actors the victims of the illegal phone hacking schemes included the murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler.

“This is the most humble day of my life” the 80-year-old press baron told MPs that morning. Frequently mumbling sometimes appearing baffled unflinchingly deferential Murdoch rejected a host of accusations from MPs from the charge of “wilful blindness” to one MP’s suggestion he resembled a “mafia boss”.

The exchange – though not its climax when Murdoch’s then wife Wendi Deng pursued a protester who clown-pied her husband – was paid fictional homage eight years later on HBO when Logan Roy and his son Kendall appeared before a senate subcommittee probing abuses in Waystar Royco’s cruise division. It was “the worst day of my life” intoned Logan. Succession draws on many monsters and media dynasties but the Murdochs are the mother lode a gruesome pantheon of siblings and spouses of sycophants regents and schemers.

James Murdoch’s swagger seemed not to recover from the hacking scandal. Or maybe it was his conscience. He quit the News Corp board in 2020 citing “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets”. James’s main objection was thought to centre on climate change coverage.

By then his older brother Lachlan was cemented as heir. After his own mysterious stint out of the fold Lachlan returned to his father’s company and in 2004 was appointed co-chairman of News Corp. A new biography of Lachlan is called The Successor. Joining a groaning shelf of Murdoch books it details claims of fraternal fallings-out and speculates about the possibility of his siblings conspiring to wrest control of the media business away from their brother after Rupert’s death.

‘The incestuous relationship between politicians and press’

Three years after the parliamentary hearing I joined another long and early queue in London curling up the spiral staircase to the public gallery at the Old Bailey. Late in the morning in courtroom 12 Rebekah Brooks was called from the dock where she sat alongside six other defendants including her husband Charlie Brooks and her former colleague and lover Andy Coulson.

In the first of her seven days on the stand Brooks who had been editor of the News of the World and the Sun insisted she knew nothing of the so-called “dark art” of phone-hacking. The jury believed her and she was acquitted on all charges. Murdoch who bankrolled her bravura defence team later appointed her head of his UK news operations.

It was different for Andy Coulson another former editor. He too claimed ignorance saying he didn’t know about the practice when he left the Murdoch empire to become chief spin-doctor for David Cameron the man he would join at the apex of British power in Downing Street. “I’m extremely sorry that I employed him” Cameron said following Coulson’s conviction. “It was the wrong decision and I’m very clear about that.”

Milly Dowler’s sister Gemma said her family was clear on the “most important and damaging” problem exposed by the scandal: “the incestuous relationship between our top politicians and the press.”

After a day at the Old Bailey I caught up with Nick Davies the Guardian journalist who broke the story and went on to literally write the book about it. Phone hacking was not the point he told me for a Listener feature. “It’s really rather a petty crime … The reason why it became important isn’t actually because of the crime within newsrooms it’s because of what it then exposed about the Murdoch power network. So I’ve always said all the way through it’s not a story about journalists behaving badly. This is a story about power and the abuse of power.”

He said: “It’s about the links between the Murdoch network and the police and the government the corporate world and to a lesser extent the press regulator. And it’s about fear. And it’s about tens of millions of adults electing a government and one Australian – now an American – being able to tell that government what to do. If we had told exactly the same story about a trade magazine that tells you about how to look after your pets at home nobody would really have given a fuck because it wouldn’t have had all that connotation of power.”

‘Fair and balanced’

Rupert Murdoch was a disruptor long before that word became part of the Ted Talk lexicon. He transformed media markets and broke union movements. Politicians and parties that shared Murdoch’s free-market worldview that smoothed the regulatory way were rewarded; opponents were lambasted or lampooned. His titles stood ready to lift a sail and catch the popular wind. Sometimes they tried to engineer the weather.

On election day in 1992 with the British Labour Party leading in the polls the Sun infamously ran a front page featuring the party leader Neil Kinnock’s head in a lightbulb with the words “Will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?” Labour lost prompting what was very much not one of Murdoch’s most humble days. “IT’S THE SUN WOT WON IT” went the headline. Tony Blair and the New Labour project focused great energy on courting Murdoch. In 1995 Blair infuriated Kinnock by accepting an invitation to travel to Australia to address a News Corp conference. It paid off. Two years later the Sun switched teams and endorsed Blair. During his time at No 10 Blair was made godfather to one of Murdoch’s daughters.

In 2007 Murdoch’s acquisition of the Wall Street Journal provided a long-sought authoritative newspaper in the US a vehicle with which to take on the loathed New York Times and the high-minded equivalent of his newspapers the Times and the Australian. But he could not buy the admiration of rivals. In the late 60s Britain’s Private Eye dubbed him “the Dirty Digger” a label that stuck. The Columbia Journalism Review called him “a force for evil”. The venerated British dramatist Denis Potter loathed him so deeply he named his terminal cancer “Rupert”.

When the world was debating a possible war in Iraq in 2003 Murdoch’s newspapers more than 150 around the globe New Zealand included endorsed a US-led invasion. Editors denied emphatically any suggestion they had been handed an edict from their proprietor. Critics said he hardly needed to.

In the US Murdoch’s influence continued to grow. In 1976 he had purchased the New York Post turning a liberal paper into a rightwing scandal sheet. Two decades later Fox News was launched. Alongside Roger Ailes Murdoch built a Conservative powerhouse under the audaciously untrue strapline “fair and balanced” providing a platform for outspoken rightwing partisans including Glenn Beck Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson.

The network which in 2017 swapped out its slogan for “Real news. Real honest opinion” was instrumental in the rise of Trump whose reactionary polarising showmanship in turn turbo-charged Fox ratings. Trump was by numerous accounts glued to the channel in the White House. In the year 2019 he personally posted 657 tweets responding to Fox News or Fox Business.

Malcolm Turnbull found himself the target of attack from Murdoch papers during his time as Australian prime minister despite leading a party of the centre-right. But it was the American impact of his compatriot that most appalled him. In a recent memoir Turnbull argued that what happened on January 6 2021 “was nothing less than an attempted coup promoted and encouraged by the president himself and his media allies like Murdoch who through Fox News has probably done more damage to US democracy than any other individual”.

Backing his former rival Kevin Rudd’s call for a Royal Commission on Murdoch’s media sway Turnbull said “the same forces that amplified and enabled Trump are still at work in the US and here in Australia.” A subsequent Australian senate committee called Murdoch’s News Corp the nation’s “clearest example of a troubling media monopoly”.

Those who have worked closely with Murdoch attest to his rolled-up-sleeves attention to detail to the journalism running in his veins and to his insistence even as he became one of the most powerful media moguls the world has seen that he was an outsider (a self-assessment incidentally he shares with Trump). Murdoch and his sons – much like the Roy family in Succession – struggled with the digital world from MySpace on. And yet many media executives would later regret not following his early lead of standing up to Google.

A Time cover to mark Murdoch’s purchase of the New York Post and New York magazine (which he no longer owns)

Murdoch has been a staunch even romantic advocate of print newspapers and kept alive a number of quality titles through long periods of loss-making. His titles are home to some of the world’s best journalists. He and his editors have staunchly opposed state censorship and repudiated libel laws – even if Lachlan is currently suing the small Australian news site Crikey for defamation over an article on the storming of the Capitol which included a characterisation of the Fox-owning Murdochs as “unindicted co-conspirators”.

Murdoch barely ever speaks directly in public. A brief ill-advised stint on Twitter made Murdoch seem less like a ruthless mogul than just another muddled granddad. His final tweets in 2016 were a series of fat-fingered empty replies and this: “No more tweets for ten days or ever! Feel like the luckiest AND happiest man in world”. But he’d long since revealed a heroic embrace of – well call it lack of self-awareness or comfort with contradiction. In a 1972 lecture back home in Australia Murdoch unironically chided the new journalism the “young men and women with an unquenchable desire to force their narrow view of humanity on the rest of humanity” people who sought “to control the content and views of newspapers and through them the thinking of the population”.

Not banned and not bothered

The Business Desk headline “Murdoch plots New Zealand return” overcooked the report that followed. The return being plotted looks modest: a “dedicated New Zealand section on the website of The Australian the group’s paywalled right-leaning broadsheet”. Such an initiative and the hiring of a couple of local journalists would at most put it on par with the existing footprint of the Guardian in New Zealand. And as with the Guardian the basis is straightforward. The audience numbers for stories about and from Aotearoa are encouraging; let’s try to extract more reader revenue out of the place.

Murdoch sold his New Zealand newspaper operations in 2003 at a time when his focus was largely on television growth. By then thanks in large part to the management of Alan Burnet they had grown to cover most of the country as Independent Newspapers Ltd. He dipped his toe again with Murdoch companies at times holding stakes in both Sky TV and APN (forerunner to NZME) but these days he has no obvious direct ownership in New Zealand media companies.

His reputation is such however that even in absence Murdoch radiates controversy. International newswires’ fact checking services have repeatedly moved this year to quash false claims that his companies are banned in New Zealand.

One of the statements in question went like this: “Asked why New Zealand does not suffer from the rage of older white men like in other western Anglo countries PM Jacinda Adern [sic] replied ‘Because we’ve never allowed Rupert Murdoch to set up a media outlet here.’ The guy has wreaked havoc on civil society in the US.”

Not true. Or not certainly the banning bit. Reuters theorised the fabricated quote might have stemmed from commentator David Cormack’s assessment that “a huge reason that our politics is not so extremely polarised and so far out there is because we no longer have Murdoch-owned press in New Zealand and it’s never taken a foothold.”

It is hard to argue with that. The tenor of Australian politics is palpably harsher and more hostile its culture entwined in inflamed symbiosis with the Murdoch press. But don’t recline your seat. Cormack’s comments were for an October 2020 Guardian feature looking at Aotearoa’s relatively low level of populism conspiracy theory and Covid-19 scepticism. Plenty has transpired since.

In fact Murdoch does have an outlet in Aotearoa already if you count Sky News Australia which broadcasts around the clock via the (unrelated) Sky TV platform. The rolling news channel recently restored a reporting presence at parliament in Wellington after a pause prompted by the Covid crisis.

Like Fox News Sky News Australia typically gets noticed less for its news output than its voluble night-time hosts. The roster of supercilious silver-haired shock jocks such as Andrew Bolt and Rowan Dean take an occasional interest in events across the Tasman evincing a particular swivel-eyed interest in te ao Māori and – of course – “wokeism”. Last week Dean threw a tantrum on-air about Six60 producing a tour poster in te reo Māori.

For all that he might be a details man it’s highly unlikely Murdoch cares much about the chunterings of a third-rate controversialist at an outpost of his global empire. And it’s hard to imagine him being engaged if he’s even aware of the Australian newspaper hiring a reporter or two in New Zealand. Like another mythic media monster Don Draper he probably doesn’t think about us at all. Business Desk did however note speculation that he might fancy an acquisition – the NBR perhaps.

There is little in law to stop him. In 1975 Labour fulfilled its pledge and repealed the News Media Ownership Bill. In the decades that followed foreign ownership of non-state New Zealand news outlets became the norm. There is today a character test on overseas purchases of “media entities that have an impact on New Zealand’s media plurality” but that should be a breeze.

Maybe as he approaches his 92nd birthday Rupert remembers fondly that Morris Minor road trip that land of humility his conversation with Holyoake in some smoke-filled room. There are worse places to slide into semi-retirement. Fox News is available. So is HBO.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvbmV3LXlvcmstcG9zdC10cnVtcC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Post Takes Aim at Trump and Hits a Nerve (Published 2022),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvbmV3LXlvcmstcG9zdC10cnVtcC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60EF14970>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvbmV3LXlvcmstcG9zdC10cnVtcC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL25vdi8xOC9tdXJkb2NoLXYtdHJ1bXAtcnVwZXJ0cy1wYXBlcnMta2ljay1kb25hbGQtYnV0LWZveC13b250LXBsYXktYmFsbNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL25vdi8xOC9tdXJkb2NoLXYtdHJ1bXAtcnVwZXJ0cy1wYXBlcnMta2ljay1kb25hbGQtYnV0LWZveC13b250LXBsYXktYmFsbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Murdoch v Trump: Rupert’s papers kick Donald but Fox won’t play ball,"Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers don’t do subtlety when it comes to political attacks.

Over the last week readers of his US titles have been informed that Donald Trump is “Trumpty Dumpty” the “biggest loser” in Republican politics and the man who meant the “red wave” never crested in the US midterm elections.

The New York Post marked Trump’s latest bid for election with something more damning: outright mockery.

Under the headline: “Florida Man makes announcement” the formerly pro-Trump newspaper directed readers to a story deep inside the newspaper on page 28.

“With just 720 days to go before the next election a Florida retiree made the surprise announcement Tuesday night that he was running for president” said the deadpan news report.

The tabloid’s print edition has a dwindling readership but the former US president is still said to be a regular reader – which means it probably hurt when they mocked his Mar-a-Lago home – raided by the FBI in August – as a “classified documents library”.

Yet while the newspaper editorials have led to suggestions that Murdoch has completed a clean break with the former US president this misses the more positive reaction on Murdoch’s Fox News television channel.

“Murdoch has very little control over his most important outlet which is Fox” said Michael Wolff the media commentator who has written three books on Trump.

“Let’s assume Murdoch was giving a message to the Post … he can’t do that at Fox. And Fox is the all-important thing.”

Although there has been criticism of Trump on Fox News in recent weeks several presenters such as Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson have their own loyal audiences who have been fed pro-Trump material for years. A rapid U-turn may be too much for them to take especially if the network is accused of betrayal.

As Wolff puts it: “Each of the voices at Fox is going to be motivated by their own ratings – and if their own ratings are dependent on Trump then they’re not going to deviate. Hannity does not seem to have deviated one increment off his absolute fealty to Trump. Tucker likewise.”

In the background is Murdoch’s attempt to reunite two parts of his business empire and ultimately hand over control to his 51-year-old son Lachlan. The family’s main media interests are separated into two businesses as a result of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal which saw the legally troubled outlets separated.

The core business is the US-focused television business Fox while the newspaper assets – including its UK titles – are controlled by News Corp.

Combining the two makes little business sense but would tidy up family succession planning according to the media analyst Alice Enders: “It’s not about Rupert being back in charge it’s about Lachlan taking over and pursuing the same traditional classic conservative agenda.”

She said that it would be hard for Fox News to find a way to let go of Trump without risking some of the hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising that flows to the network.

“Fox is the jewel in the crown. The influence that the Murdochs want to exercise is through Fox News. What’s super interesting is they want to maintain their currency as the go-to news channel for conservative voters – and they have to do that in a way that balances the Trumpistas against everyone.”

The focus on US politics also reflects a physical change in Rupert Murdoch’s location.

He has spent a substantial time in the UK in recent years alongside his now ex-wife Jerry Hall and his daughter Elisabeth.

During the Covid pandemic they were based at an Oxfordshire mansion where he took the decision to sign up Piers Morgan for the launch of TalkTV and went to get his Covid vaccine – at the same time that his US media outlets were casting doubts on its effectiveness.

Now the recently divorced nonagenarian is increasingly based at a newly acquired ranch in rural Montana a remote state favoured by billionaires. Official documents show that last month he paid £13000 to fly the former prime minister Boris Johnson there for a meeting while corporate filings suggest he is running his business empire from the ranch and has permission to hold board meetings there.

This raises the question of which Murdoch is now calling the shots: 91-year-old Rupert or Lachlan who is managing part of the business from his family home in Australia – working late into the night on video calls due to the time difference.

The Trump years weighed heavily on Murdoch with Fox News facing a $1.6bn lawsuit over claims it amplified Trump’s false allegations about fraud at a voting machine company after his election defeat. Murdoch’s son James has left the family business and had made barely coded criticisms of Fox News which hit hard according to Wolff.

“In terms of Rupert himself he has always detested Trump. Trump has been the cross to bear in his life and the Trump effect at Fox has essentially broken up his family.”

Trump banned from Twitter and struggling to get airtime has not taken his ostracism lightly whining that they were favouring Florida governor Ron DeSantis.

“NewsCorp – which is Fox the Wall Street Journal and the no longer great New York Post – is all in for Governor Ron DeSanctimonious” Trump said.

But as Enders puts it: “Murdoch doesn’t back losers. Trump is a loser.”"

During his 31 years at News Corp Dore edited four mastheads for Murdoch and was the most powerful editorial executive in his Australian business.

He was close to the co-chairman of News Corp Lachlan Murdoch who was made general manager of Queensland Newspapers in the 1990s and then was publisher of the Australian.

As well as being editor-in-chief of the Australian for four years Dore edited the Daily Telegraph the Courier Mail and the Sunday Times in Perth and was deputy editor of the Sunday Telegraph.

But when he announced his resignation on Wednesday citing “personal health issues” there were no accolades from the Murdochs or the company’s top brass.

Sources said there was a meeting of the News Corp Australia editorial board which Dore chairs on Wednesday afternoon and an email went out to staff soon after saying Dore was leaving the company. Even the editorial executives at Holt Street were blindsided by the news.

Three weeks earlier Dore joined News Corp’s global chief Robert Thomson and executives from Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal at the WSJ Tech Live conference in California held at Laguna Beach between 24 and 26 October.

Speakers included the model and skin care entrepreneur Hailey Rhode Bieber and the now-embattled crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried.

Guardian Australia has confirmed Dore attended the event and was witnessed chatting with top executives at one of a number of cocktail parties held at the event.

Sources said after witnessing Dore’s behaviour News Corp management told him to take an extended break.

He never returned to the company.

The WSJ Tech Live conference was a News Corp global event attended by the company’s sponsors advertisers and executives. It was hosted by the CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of the WSJ Almar Latour and Thomson.

News Corp declined to comment on the exact circumstances of Dore’s abrupt departure not just from the newspaper but from the company.

In an email to staff the News Corp Australasia executive chairman Michael Miller said: “Chris is also undergoing surgery this week and we wish him the best.

“I have asked Michelle Gunn to continue to edit the Australian” Miller’s note said.

“Michelle who also began her career as a cadet on the Australian has been editor since May 2020 and previously was editor of the Weekend Australian for eight years.”

Miller went on to praise Gunn as having an “insightful understanding of the Australian’s audience and the issues and debates that interest them most which are at the heart of the nation’s future” without a word of praise for Dore.

In his own note to staff Dore said he was “exhausted” and “can’t keep going on like this”.

“I have long-standing personal health issues I need to resolve and am leaving News to concentrate on restoring my health” he said. “I will also be undergoing surgery this week so will have to postpone farewells until a later time.”

In his note to staff Dore said he had been “blessed” to edit four Murdoch titles.

“I am beyond proud that this year the Australian recorded its most profitable result in our near 60-year history as Robert Thomson noted at the News Awards and has transformed into a genuine digital powerhouse built on the biggest subscriber base of loyal passionate readers and a group of innovative and adventurous journalists photographers designers and editors” he said.

In March Dore was asked by the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas to be the first in a series of editors to speak about his craft.

In his lecture he said the media industry was being tarnished by activist journalists who had “an irrational and tireless obsession with tearing down News Corporation journalism”.

He said some journalists were so “vain self-obsessed craving indulgent needy” that they were “undermining their profession” and they should stick to reporting and not give their opinion.

“Too many journalists are inserting themselves into their stories or worse still into other reporters’ stories” Dore said. “Some reporters are chasing the cheap wild and ready-made approval of the in-crowd instead of chasing the more elusive yarn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvbXVyZG9jaC1kZWFsLXdpbGwtc3RydWdnbGUtYmUtZmFpci1iYWxhbmNlZC0yMDIyLTExLTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breakingviews - Murdoch deal will struggle to be fair and balanced,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvbXVyZG9jaC1kZWFsLXdpbGwtc3RydWdnbGUtYmUtZmFpci1iYWxhbmNlZC0yMDIyLTExLTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60F3FEA10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvbXVyZG9jaC1kZWFsLXdpbGwtc3RydWdnbGUtYmUtZmFpci1iYWxhbmNlZC0yMDIyLTExLTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3Bpbm9mZi5jby5uei9tZWRpYS8xNy0xMS0yMDIyL3RoZS1ydXBlcnQtbXVyZG9jaC1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLWJpbGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Rupert Murdoch protection bill,"Following reports that Rupert Murdoch might be ‘plotting a return’ to New Zealand Toby Manhire looks at the global shadow he casts in media business and politics across more than six decades – including a heated 1965 parliamentary debate between Holyoake and Kirk.

Even now the front page of a tabloid packs a visceral punch. Giant headlines bloated puns garish images; there is nothing quite like it. All the more so if it’s a News Corp title. Then it becomes also a sign a smoke signal a message not quite from God but close: the most dangerous man in the world Rupert Murdoch.

That’s how it went last week when the headline on the late edition of the New York Post responded to a disappointing night in the midterms for the Republicans by hailing “DeFUTURE”. The celebration of Florida governor Ron Desantis “romping to victory” was an unsubtle dig at Donald Trump against whom he is expected to run for the presidential nomination. Even less subtle was the next day’s splash. “TRUMPTY DUMPTY” it read pointing the finger of blame at a man perched eggily on a wall. “Don (who couldn’t build a wall)” chortled the coverline “had a great fall – can all the GOP’s men put the party back together again?”

Those front pages together with a Trump-critical mood in the Wall Street Journal and on Fox News had commentators immediately divining confirmation that Murdoch was done with Trump and his Maga tribe. Murdoch had “appeared to make clear that he would prefer to cast aside Trump in favor of DeSantis” said CNN. “A marriage of convenience that paid huge political and financial dividends has ruptured in spectacular fashion” said the Financial Times. Even Saturday Night Live pounced on “the week Murdoch officially turned on Donald Trump”

Implicit in so much of the coverage is Murdoch’s place in the political firmament. The epithet above – the most dangerous man in the world – is not my hyperbole but Joe Biden’s. My guess is Murdoch would be thrilled. Bestriding the worlds of media business and politics across the western world Murdoch the press baron embodies the Machiavellian maxim that it is better to be feared than loved. Feared even by Trump a man impervious to normal human emotion. Only Murdoch can exact revenge deliver schadenfreude. It’s all there in Vanity Fair’s headline. “Rupert Murdoch knees Trump in the balls while he’s doubled over coughing up blood.”

Murdoch the man is softly spoken. But his voice his influence – sometimes real sometimes exaggerated sometimes imagined always obsessed over – has echoed through the halls of politics for more than six decades. Little wonder then that a less violent local headline this month “Murdoch plots New Zealand return” sent a shiver down spines. The Australian mogul has been a fascination here as almost everywhere since the 60s when Keith Holyoake and Norman Kirk debated the meaning of Murdoch with passion and at length in the New Zealand parliament.

‘Do we want Murdoch to take over and eliminate our newspapers?’

New Zealand was the first foreign media foray for a young and tenacious Rupert Murdoch. In January 1964 he sailed across the Tasman and toured New Zealand with friends in a Morris Minor. The 32-year-old then steadily building his Australian portfolio from a single newspaper in Adelaide (all that was left of his father Keith’s once strong media stable) happened on the news that Lord Thomson a powerful UK-based Canadian press baron was seeking to purchase a controlling stake in Wellington’s Dominion newspaper. Murdoch decided to take him on.

The next month a commentator in London’s Financial Times noted the counter-bid by the “energetic young Australian newspaper proprietor” writing: “Mr Murdoch unlike Lord Thomson likes editorial power as much as he likes making money and lays down some pretty controversial policies in his papers … New Zealanders at large seem to wish a plague on both bidders.”

Murdoch outfoxed Thomson (from whom years later he would purchase the establishment title he so coveted the Times of London) purchasing a number of shares on the open market and secured a dominant stake of almost 30% in the Wellington Publishing Company.

The two moguls’ tussle for the newspaper led to Keith Holyoake driving through New Zealand’s parliament the News Media Ownership Bill of 1965 which would limit future overseas ownership of news operations to 20%. The National prime minister wrote biographer Barry Gustafson “played a more prominent and passionate role in the debate in parliament on this bill than on almost any other piece of legislation during his long career”. Its intention Holyoake told parliament was to protect homegrown journalism against the fickle or malign self-interest of foreign press barons.

Labour leader Norman Kirk railed against an “obnoxious iniquitous repressive” bill. The government’s real concern he judged was maintaining the sympathetic press coverage it enjoyed under the status quo. “This is not a News Media Ownership Bill but a National Government Protection Bill” said Kirk. “It is a first step towards removing the independence of the press.”

Others accused Holyoake of doing Murdoch’s bidding. Labour MP Warren Freer asked whether it was “designed as a means of rewarding a certain individual by the name of Mr Rupert Murdoch” who had already established a toehold in the New Zealand media. Freer pointed to “mysterious secret hole-in-the-corner negotiations with the prime minister” that saw Murdoch “a hard-headed businessman forgo some of his voting privileges”.

The president of the New Zealand Journalists’ Association was similarly opposed. “The effect of the legislation” he said “is specifically to protect the interests of one overseas investor the News Limited group of Adelaide headed by Mr Rupert Murdoch.”

Holyoake accepted that he had held discussions with Murdoch but his motives were the same: to limit foreign influence. Those calling the legislation the “Murdoch Protection Bill” were quite wrong he said. On the contrary “the issue at this stage is do we want Murdoch to take over and eliminate our newspapers?”

‘The most humble day of my life’

Fast forward 46 years from Holyoake and Kirk to another bigger parliament and a scene that must sit at the centre of any Murdoch biopic. It was the summer of 2011 and the line outside the Wilson Room at Portcullis House began forming before 7am. The box-office attraction: Rupert Murdoch along with his son James the boss of the family’s UK operations appearing before Westminster’s culture media and sport committee to face questions over the phone hacking at the News of the World.

The scandal revealing illegal activity on a near-industrial scale had engulfed the paper and the wider company and dominated British headlines for many months. A week before the father-son pair faced the parliamentary committee Murdoch Snr had taken the jaw-dropping decision to fold the 168-year-old title to put a bullet in the head of his beloved first British media property acquired a full 43 years earlier.

Murdoch had poured blood sweat and ink into the tabloid which had grown on his watch into the biggest selling newspaper in the western world. Shovelling freshly raked scandal into millions of homes across Britain every Sunday morning its fascination with what happened between the bedsheets saw it nicknamed “the Screws”. Its own humiliation was another parade of celebrities except this time they were pointing the finger and the villain was the rag and its hacks. The end of the World was the revelation that along with dozens of footballers and actors the victims of the illegal phone hacking schemes included the murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler.

“This is the most humble day of my life” the 80-year-old press baron told MPs that morning. Frequently mumbling sometimes appearing baffled unflinchingly deferential Murdoch rejected a host of accusations from MPs from the charge of “wilful blindness” to one MP’s suggestion he resembled a “mafia boss”.

The exchange – though not its climax when Murdoch’s then wife Wendi Deng pursued a protester who clown-pied her husband – was paid fictional homage eight years later on HBO when Logan Roy and his son Kendall appeared before a senate subcommittee probing abuses in Waystar Royco’s cruise division. It was “the worst day of my life” intoned Logan. Succession draws on many monsters and media dynasties but the Murdochs are the mother lode a gruesome pantheon of siblings and spouses of sycophants regents and schemers.

James Murdoch’s swagger seemed not to recover from the hacking scandal. Or maybe it was his conscience. He quit the News Corp board in 2020 citing “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets”. James’s main objection was thought to centre on climate change coverage.

By then his older brother Lachlan was cemented as heir. After his own mysterious stint out of the fold Lachlan returned to his father’s company and in 2004 was appointed co-chairman of News Corp. A new biography of Lachlan is called The Successor. Joining a groaning shelf of Murdoch books it details claims of fraternal fallings-out and speculates about the possibility of his siblings conspiring to wrest control of the media business away from their brother after Rupert’s death.

‘The incestuous relationship between politicians and press’

Three years after the parliamentary hearing I joined another long and early queue in London curling up the spiral staircase to the public gallery at the Old Bailey. Late in the morning in courtroom 12 Rebekah Brooks was called from the dock where she sat alongside six other defendants including her husband Charlie Brooks and her former colleague and lover Andy Coulson.

In the first of her seven days on the stand Brooks who had been editor of the News of the World and the Sun insisted she knew nothing of the so-called “dark art” of phone-hacking. The jury believed her and she was acquitted on all charges. Murdoch who bankrolled her bravura defence team later appointed her head of his UK news operations.

It was different for Andy Coulson another former editor. He too claimed ignorance saying he didn’t know about the practice when he left the Murdoch empire to become chief spin-doctor for David Cameron the man he would join at the apex of British power in Downing Street. “I’m extremely sorry that I employed him” Cameron said following Coulson’s conviction. “It was the wrong decision and I’m very clear about that.”

Milly Dowler’s sister Gemma said her family was clear on the “most important and damaging” problem exposed by the scandal: “the incestuous relationship between our top politicians and the press.”

After a day at the Old Bailey I caught up with Nick Davies the Guardian journalist who broke the story and went on to literally write the book about it. Phone hacking was not the point he told me for a Listener feature. “It’s really rather a petty crime … The reason why it became important isn’t actually because of the crime within newsrooms it’s because of what it then exposed about the Murdoch power network. So I’ve always said all the way through it’s not a story about journalists behaving badly. This is a story about power and the abuse of power.”

He said: “It’s about the links between the Murdoch network and the police and the government the corporate world and to a lesser extent the press regulator. And it’s about fear. And it’s about tens of millions of adults electing a government and one Australian – now an American – being able to tell that government what to do. If we had told exactly the same story about a trade magazine that tells you about how to look after your pets at home nobody would really have given a fuck because it wouldn’t have had all that connotation of power.”

‘Fair and balanced’

Rupert Murdoch was a disruptor long before that word became part of the Ted Talk lexicon. He transformed media markets and broke union movements. Politicians and parties that shared Murdoch’s free-market worldview that smoothed the regulatory way were rewarded; opponents were lambasted or lampooned. His titles stood ready to lift a sail and catch the popular wind. Sometimes they tried to engineer the weather.

On election day in 1992 with the British Labour Party leading in the polls the Sun infamously ran a front page featuring the party leader Neil Kinnock’s head in a lightbulb with the words “Will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?” Labour lost prompting what was very much not one of Murdoch’s most humble days. “IT’S THE SUN WOT WON IT” went the headline. Tony Blair and the New Labour project focused great energy on courting Murdoch. In 1995 Blair infuriated Kinnock by accepting an invitation to travel to Australia to address a News Corp conference. It paid off. Two years later the Sun switched teams and endorsed Blair. During his time at No 10 Blair was made godfather to one of Murdoch’s daughters.

In 2007 Murdoch’s acquisition of the Wall Street Journal provided a long-sought authoritative newspaper in the US a vehicle with which to take on the loathed New York Times and the high-minded equivalent of his newspapers the Times and the Australian. But he could not buy the admiration of rivals. In the late 60s Britain’s Private Eye dubbed him “the Dirty Digger” a label that stuck. The Columbia Journalism Review called him “a force for evil”. The venerated British dramatist Denis Potter loathed him so deeply he named his terminal cancer “Rupert”.

When the world was debating a possible war in Iraq in 2003 Murdoch’s newspapers more than 150 around the globe New Zealand included endorsed a US-led invasion. Editors denied emphatically any suggestion they had been handed an edict from their proprietor. Critics said he hardly needed to.

In the US Murdoch’s influence continued to grow. In 1976 he had purchased the New York Post turning a liberal paper into a rightwing scandal sheet. Two decades later Fox News was launched. Alongside Roger Ailes Murdoch built a Conservative powerhouse under the audaciously untrue strapline “fair and balanced” providing a platform for outspoken rightwing partisans including Glenn Beck Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson.

The network which in 2017 swapped out its slogan for “Real news. Real honest opinion” was instrumental in the rise of Trump whose reactionary polarising showmanship in turn turbo-charged Fox ratings. Trump was by numerous accounts glued to the channel in the White House. In the year 2019 he personally posted 657 tweets responding to Fox News or Fox Business.

Malcolm Turnbull found himself the target of attack from Murdoch papers during his time as Australian prime minister despite leading a party of the centre-right. But it was the American impact of his compatriot that most appalled him. In a recent memoir Turnbull argued that what happened on January 6 2021 “was nothing less than an attempted coup promoted and encouraged by the president himself and his media allies like Murdoch who through Fox News has probably done more damage to US democracy than any other individual”.

Backing his former rival Kevin Rudd’s call for a Royal Commission on Murdoch’s media sway Turnbull said “the same forces that amplified and enabled Trump are still at work in the US and here in Australia.” A subsequent Australian senate committee called Murdoch’s News Corp the nation’s “clearest example of a troubling media monopoly”.

Those who have worked closely with Murdoch attest to his rolled-up-sleeves attention to detail to the journalism running in his veins and to his insistence even as he became one of the most powerful media moguls the world has seen that he was an outsider (a self-assessment incidentally he shares with Trump). Murdoch and his sons – much like the Roy family in Succession – struggled with the digital world from MySpace on. And yet many media executives would later regret not following his early lead of standing up to Google.

A Time cover to mark Murdoch’s purchase of the New York Post and New York magazine (which he no longer owns)

Murdoch has been a staunch even romantic advocate of print newspapers and kept alive a number of quality titles through long periods of loss-making. His titles are home to some of the world’s best journalists. He and his editors have staunchly opposed state censorship and repudiated libel laws – even if Lachlan is currently suing the small Australian news site Crikey for defamation over an article on the storming of the Capitol which included a characterisation of the Fox-owning Murdochs as “unindicted co-conspirators”.

Murdoch barely ever speaks directly in public. A brief ill-advised stint on Twitter made Murdoch seem less like a ruthless mogul than just another muddled granddad. His final tweets in 2016 were a series of fat-fingered empty replies and this: “No more tweets for ten days or ever! Feel like the luckiest AND happiest man in world”. But he’d long since revealed a heroic embrace of – well call it lack of self-awareness or comfort with contradiction. In a 1972 lecture back home in Australia Murdoch unironically chided the new journalism the “young men and women with an unquenchable desire to force their narrow view of humanity on the rest of humanity” people who sought “to control the content and views of newspapers and through them the thinking of the population”.

Not banned and not bothered

The Business Desk headline “Murdoch plots New Zealand return” overcooked the report that followed. The return being plotted looks modest: a “dedicated New Zealand section on the website of The Australian the group’s paywalled right-leaning broadsheet”. Such an initiative and the hiring of a couple of local journalists would at most put it on par with the existing footprint of the Guardian in New Zealand. And as with the Guardian the basis is straightforward. The audience numbers for stories about and from Aotearoa are encouraging; let’s try to extract more reader revenue out of the place.

Murdoch sold his New Zealand newspaper operations in 2003 at a time when his focus was largely on television growth. By then thanks in large part to the management of Alan Burnet they had grown to cover most of the country as Independent Newspapers Ltd. He dipped his toe again with Murdoch companies at times holding stakes in both Sky TV and APN (forerunner to NZME) but these days he has no obvious direct ownership in New Zealand media companies.

His reputation is such however that even in absence Murdoch radiates controversy. International newswires’ fact checking services have repeatedly moved this year to quash false claims that his companies are banned in New Zealand.

One of the statements in question went like this: “Asked why New Zealand does not suffer from the rage of older white men like in other western Anglo countries PM Jacinda Adern [sic] replied ‘Because we’ve never allowed Rupert Murdoch to set up a media outlet here.’ The guy has wreaked havoc on civil society in the US.”

Not true. Or not certainly the banning bit. Reuters theorised the fabricated quote might have stemmed from commentator David Cormack’s assessment that “a huge reason that our politics is not so extremely polarised and so far out there is because we no longer have Murdoch-owned press in New Zealand and it’s never taken a foothold.”

It is hard to argue with that. The tenor of Australian politics is palpably harsher and more hostile its culture entwined in inflamed symbiosis with the Murdoch press. But don’t recline your seat. Cormack’s comments were for an October 2020 Guardian feature looking at Aotearoa’s relatively low level of populism conspiracy theory and Covid-19 scepticism. Plenty has transpired since.

In fact Murdoch does have an outlet in Aotearoa already if you count Sky News Australia which broadcasts around the clock via the (unrelated) Sky TV platform. The rolling news channel recently restored a reporting presence at parliament in Wellington after a pause prompted by the Covid crisis.

Like Fox News Sky News Australia typically gets noticed less for its news output than its voluble night-time hosts. The roster of supercilious silver-haired shock jocks such as Andrew Bolt and Rowan Dean take an occasional interest in events across the Tasman evincing a particular swivel-eyed interest in te ao Māori and – of course – “wokeism”. Last week Dean threw a tantrum on-air about Six60 producing a tour poster in te reo Māori.

For all that he might be a details man it’s highly unlikely Murdoch cares much about the chunterings of a third-rate controversialist at an outpost of his global empire. And it’s hard to imagine him being engaged if he’s even aware of the Australian newspaper hiring a reporter or two in New Zealand. Like another mythic media monster Don Draper he probably doesn’t think about us at all. Business Desk did however note speculation that he might fancy an acquisition – the NBR perhaps.

There is little in law to stop him. In 1975 Labour fulfilled its pledge and repealed the News Media Ownership Bill. In the decades that followed foreign ownership of non-state New Zealand news outlets became the norm. There is today a character test on overseas purchases of “media entities that have an impact on New Zealand’s media plurality” but that should be a breeze.

Maybe as he approaches his 92nd birthday Rupert remembers fondly that Morris Minor road trip that land of humility his conversation with Holyoake in some smoke-filled room. There are worse places to slide into semi-retirement. Fox News is available. So is HBO.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvbmV3LXlvcmstcG9zdC10cnVtcC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Post Takes Aim at Trump and Hits a Nerve (Published 2022),"Since Election Day last week The New York Post’s front pages have been merciless to former President Donald J. Trump. First the paper heralded his political rival Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida as “DeFUTURE.” A day later it illustrated Mr. Trump as Humpty Dumpty about to have a great fall.

Then on Wednesday the paper relegated Mr. Trump’s announcement about his latest run for president to a small headline at the bottom of the page: “Florida Man Makes Announcement.”

All three covers shot around social media putting the 221-year-old tabloid at the center of the national discussion about Mr. Trump’s future and elevating its print front page from New York City newsstands to Twitter’s global public square.

The covers also had the news media and political worlds talking about whether the recent Trump coverage was another sign that Rupert Murdoch’s media empire which includes The Post and Fox News among other news organizations had broken permanently from the former president after supporting him for years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL25vdi8xOC9tdXJkb2NoLXYtdHJ1bXAtcnVwZXJ0cy1wYXBlcnMta2ljay1kb25hbGQtYnV0LWZveC13b250LXBsYXktYmFsbNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL25vdi8xOC9tdXJkb2NoLXYtdHJ1bXAtcnVwZXJ0cy1wYXBlcnMta2ljay1kb25hbGQtYnV0LWZveC13b250LXBsYXktYmFsbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Murdoch v Trump: Rupert’s papers kick Donald but Fox won’t play ball,"Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers don’t do subtlety when it comes to political attacks.

Over the last week readers of his US titles have been informed that Donald Trump is “Trumpty Dumpty” the “biggest loser” in Republican politics and the man who meant the “red wave” never crested in the US midterm elections.

The New York Post marked Trump’s latest bid for election with something more damning: outright mockery.

Under the headline: “Florida Man makes announcement” the formerly pro-Trump newspaper directed readers to a story deep inside the newspaper on page 28.

“With just 720 days to go before the next election a Florida retiree made the surprise announcement Tuesday night that he was running for president” said the deadpan news report.

The tabloid’s print edition has a dwindling readership but the former US president is still said to be a regular reader – which means it probably hurt when they mocked his Mar-a-Lago home – raided by the FBI in August – as a “classified documents library”.

Yet while the newspaper editorials have led to suggestions that Murdoch has completed a clean break with the former US president this misses the more positive reaction on Murdoch’s Fox News television channel.

“Murdoch has very little control over his most important outlet which is Fox” said Michael Wolff the media commentator who has written three books on Trump.

“Let’s assume Murdoch was giving a message to the Post … he can’t do that at Fox. And Fox is the all-important thing.”

Although there has been criticism of Trump on Fox News in recent weeks several presenters such as Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson have their own loyal audiences who have been fed pro-Trump material for years. A rapid U-turn may be too much for them to take especially if the network is accused of betrayal.

As Wolff puts it: “Each of the voices at Fox is going to be motivated by their own ratings – and if their own ratings are dependent on Trump then they’re not going to deviate. Hannity does not seem to have deviated one increment off his absolute fealty to Trump. Tucker likewise.”

In the background is Murdoch’s attempt to reunite two parts of his business empire and ultimately hand over control to his 51-year-old son Lachlan. The family’s main media interests are separated into two businesses as a result of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal which saw the legally troubled outlets separated.

The core business is the US-focused television business Fox while the newspaper assets – including its UK titles – are controlled by News Corp.

Combining the two makes little business sense but would tidy up family succession planning according to the media analyst Alice Enders: “It’s not about Rupert being back in charge it’s about Lachlan taking over and pursuing the same traditional classic conservative agenda.”

She said that it would be hard for Fox News to find a way to let go of Trump without risking some of the hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising that flows to the network.

“Fox is the jewel in the crown. The influence that the Murdochs want to exercise is through Fox News. What’s super interesting is they want to maintain their currency as the go-to news channel for conservative voters – and they have to do that in a way that balances the Trumpistas against everyone.”

The focus on US politics also reflects a physical change in Rupert Murdoch’s location.

He has spent a substantial time in the UK in recent years alongside his now ex-wife Jerry Hall and his daughter Elisabeth.

During the Covid pandemic they were based at an Oxfordshire mansion where he took the decision to sign up Piers Morgan for the launch of TalkTV and went to get his Covid vaccine – at the same time that his US media outlets were casting doubts on its effectiveness.

Now the recently divorced nonagenarian is increasingly based at a newly acquired ranch in rural Montana a remote state favoured by billionaires. Official documents show that last month he paid £13000 to fly the former prime minister Boris Johnson there for a meeting while corporate filings suggest he is running his business empire from the ranch and has permission to hold board meetings there.

This raises the question of which Murdoch is now calling the shots: 91-year-old Rupert or Lachlan who is managing part of the business from his family home in Australia – working late into the night on video calls due to the time difference.

The Trump years weighed heavily on Murdoch with Fox News facing a $1.6bn lawsuit over claims it amplified Trump’s false allegations about fraud at a voting machine company after his election defeat. Murdoch’s son James has left the family business and had made barely coded criticisms of Fox News which hit hard according to Wolff.

“In terms of Rupert himself he has always detested Trump. Trump has been the cross to bear in his life and the Trump effect at Fox has essentially broken up his family.”

Trump banned from Twitter and struggling to get airtime has not taken his ostracism lightly whining that they were favouring Florida governor Ron DeSantis.

“NewsCorp – which is Fox the Wall Street Journal and the no longer great New York Post – is all in for Governor Ron DeSanctimonious” Trump said.

But as Enders puts it: “Murdoch doesn’t back losers. Trump is a loser.”"

In conjunction with the acquisition and creation of the new portfolio NextEra Energy Partners has entered into a convertible equity portfolio financing with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (Ontario Teachers') a leading global infrastructure investor to invest $805 million into the new portfolio.

""The transactions announced today demonstrate NextEra Energy Partners' continued ability to execute on its long-term growth plan and continued access to attractive low-cost sources of capital"" said John Ketchum chairman and chief executive officer. ""The acquisition of the high-quality long-term contracted renewable energy assets further enhances the diversity of the partnership's existing portfolio. Combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of six existing NextEra Energy Partners' assets through the convertible equity portfolio financing with a global infrastructure investor is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders including a low cash coupon and the ability to retain upside from the share price appreciation for up to 10 years. This significant access to low-cost capital leaves NextEra Energy Partners uniquely positioned to take advantage of the transformation underway in the energy industry and meet its long-term growth objectives. In our view NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to deliver unitholder value going forward.""

Portfolio acquisition details

The contracted renewables portfolio of wind and solar assets to be acquired has a cash available for distribution (CAFD)-weighted remaining contract life of approximately 15 years and average customer credit rating of A+ at S&P and A2 at Moody's Investors Service. The assets included are:

49% of the membership interests in Emerald Breeze  an existing portfolio holding company which indirectly owns:

Great Prairie Wind an approximately 1029-MW wind generation facility located in Texas and Oklahoma .



Appaloosa Run Wind an approximately 172-MW wind generation facility located in Texas .



Eight Point Wind an approximately 111-MW wind generation facility located in New York .



Yellow Pine Solar an approximately 125-MW solar generation and 65-MW storage facility located in Nevada .

100% of the indirect membership interests in:

Elk City Wind II an approximately 107-MW wind generation facility located in Oklahoma.



Sac County Wind an approximately 80-MW wind generation facility located in Iowa .



Sholes Wind an approximately 160-MW wind generation facility located in Nebraska .

NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the interests in the assets for total consideration of approximately $805 million plus the assumption of its share of the portfolio's estimated $1.5 billion in tax equity financing subject to working capital and other adjustments. NextEra Energy Partners expects to complete the acquisition later this year subject to customary closing conditions. At the time of the closing all of the assets other than Appaloosa Run Wind Eight Point Wind and Yellow Pine Solar will be in operation with Appaloosa Run Wind and Eight Point Wind expected to be in service in December 2022 and Yellow Pine Solar scheduled to begin initial operations by the end of the third quarter of 2023. If any of those projects do not achieve commercial operation by Nov. 30 2023 NextEra Energy Partners will have the right to require the seller to repurchase the ownership interests in such projects for the same purchase price paid by NextEra Energy Partners. Following the acquisition and all of the projects achieving commercial operation the portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $210 million to $230 million and CAFD of approximately $62 million to $72 million each on a five-year average annual run-rate basis beginning Dec. 31 2023.

Creation of a new portfolio

Immediately following the acquisition NextEra Energy Partners will contribute its interests in the newly acquired projects to a new portfolio alongside six of the partnership's existing wind assets: Alta Wind VIII Brady Wind Brady Wind II Golden West Wind Osborn Wind and Oliver Wind III.

Financing details

In conjunction with the acquisition and creation of the new portfolio NextEra Energy Partners has entered into a convertible equity portfolio financing agreement of approximately $805 million with Ontario Teachers' (the investor). Under the terms of the financing the investor will initially fund approximately $645 million which will be used by NextEra Energy Partners to finance its acquisition of the newly acquired assets. A second funding of approximately $160 million is expected to occur by the end of the third quarter of 2023 upon the achievement of the commercial operations of Appaloosa Run Wind Eight Point Wind and Yellow Pine Solar.

The investor is expected to earn an effective annual coupon of approximately 2.8% on the outstanding investment over its initial 10-year period. The financing is expected to provide NextEra Energy Partners the flexibility to periodically buy out the investor's equity interest at a fixed approximately 7.0% pre-tax annual return (inclusive of all prior distributions) between the 5-year and 10-year anniversaries of the agreement. NextEra Energy Partners has the right to pay 100% of the buyout amount in NextEra Energy Partners common units issued at no discount to the then-current market price.

Outlook

From a base of its fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83 NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect 12% to 15% growth per year in limited partner distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025 subject to the usual caveats. NextEra Energy Partners expects the annualized rate of the fourth-quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit.

NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run-rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million respectively reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022.

NextEra Energy Partners also continues to expect Dec. 31 2023 run-rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $2.220 billion to $2.420 billion and CAFD in a range of $770 million to $860 million reflecting calendar year 2024 expectations for the portfolio at year-end 2023.

These expectations are subject to the usual caveats and include the impact of incentive distribution rights (IDR) fees as these fees are treated as an operating expense.

This news release refers to adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectations. NextEra Energy Partners' adjusted EBITDA expectations represent projected (a) revenue less (b) fuel expense less (c) project operating expenses less (d) corporate G&A plus (e) other income less (f) other deductions including IDR fees. Projected revenue as used in the calculations of projected EBITDA represents the sum of projected (a) operating revenues plus (b) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits plus (c) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits plus (d) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits and plus (e) the reimbursement for lost revenue received pursuant to a contract with NextEra Energy Resources.

CAFD is defined as cash available for distribution and represents adjusted EBITDA less (1) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits less (2) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits less (3) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits less (4) debt service less (4) maintenance capital less (5) income tax payments less (6) other non-cash items included in adjusted EBITDA if any. CAFD excludes changes in working capital and distributions to preferred equity investors.

Adjusted EBITDA CAFD and limited partner distributions and other expectations assume among other things normal weather and operating conditions; positive macroeconomic conditions in the U.S.; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion support for wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no changes to governmental policies or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD do not represent substitutes for net income as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted EBITDA and CAFD run-rate expectations have not been reconciled to expected net income because NextEra Energy Partners' net income includes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to derivative transactions which cannot be determined at this time.

Immediately following the acquisition NextEra Energy Partners will contribute its interests in the newly acquired projects and in six existing renewables assets to a new portfolio. In conjunction with the acquisition and creation of the new portfolio NextEra Energy Partners has entered into a convertible equity portfolio financing with Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board (Ontario Teachers) a global infrastructure investor to invest $805 million into the new portfolio.

“The transactions announced today demonstrate NextEra Energy Partners’ continued ability to execute on its long-term growth plan and continued access to attractive low-cost sources of capital” states John Ketchum chairman and CEO. “The acquisition of the high-quality long-term contracted renewable energy assets further enhances the diversity of the partnership’s existing portfolio.”

“Combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of six existing NextEra Energy Partners’ assets through the convertible equity portfolio financing with a global infrastructure investor is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders including a low cash coupon and the ability to retain upside from the share price appreciation for up to 10 years” Ketchum adds. “This significant access to low-cost capital leaves NextEra Energy Partners uniquely positioned to take advantage of the transformation underway in the energy industry and meet its long-term growth objectives. In our view NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to deliver unitholder value going forward.”

The contracted renewables portfolio of wind and solar assets to be acquired has a cash available for distribution (CAFD)-weighted remaining contract life of approximately 15 years and average customer credit rating of A+ at S&P and A2 at Moody’s Investors Service. The assets included are 49% of the membership interests in Emerald Breeze an existing portfolio holding company which indirectly owns:

Great Prairie Wind an approximately 1029 MW wind generation facility located in Texas and Oklahoma. It includes Appaloosa Run Wind an approximately 172 MW wind generation facility located in Texas; Eight Point Wind an approximately 111 MW wind generation facility located in New York; and Yellow Pine Solar an approximately 125 MW solar generation and 65 MW storage facility located in Nevada. The company will have 100% of the indirect membership interests in Elk City Wind II an approximately 107 MW wind generation facility located in Oklahoma; Sac County Wind an approximately 80 MW wind generation facility located in Iowa; and Sholes Wind an approximately 160 MW wind generation facility located in Nebraska.

NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the interests in the assets for total consideration of approximately $805 million plus the assumption of its share of the portfolio’s estimated $1.5 billion in tax equity financing subject to working capital and other adjustments. NextEra Energy Partners expects to complete the acquisition later this year subject to customary closing conditions. At the time of the closing all of the assets other than Appaloosa Run Wind Eight Point Wind and Yellow Pine Solar will be in operation with Appaloosa Run Wind and Eight Point Wind expected to be in service in December 2022 and Yellow Pine Solar scheduled to begin initial operations by the end of the third quarter of 2023.

If any of those projects do not achieve commercial operation by Nov. 30 2023 NextEra Energy Partners will have the right to require the seller to repurchase the ownership interests in such projects for the same purchase price paid by NextEra Energy Partners. Following the acquisition and all of the projects achieving commercial operation the portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $210 million to $230 million and CAFD of approximately $62 million to $72 million each on a five-year average annual run-rate basis beginning Dec. 31 2023.

The Los Angeles Lakers legend transcended sports to become a philosopher and teacher to his legions of fans worldwide.

Throughout most of his NBA career Bryant was notoriously private. However in his later years Bryant evolved from a surly shooting guard to an approachable elder statesman. Fresh off a storybook playing career Bryant transitioned into a new role as a filmmaker and author.

In addition to taking over Hollywood and winning an Emmy in short order Bryant participated in more candid interviews than ever. Despite being only 40 years old Bryant seemingly had centuries of knowledge. Many of his lessons live on in viral clips on various social media platforms.

January 2023 will mark two years since Bryant's untimely passing. Unfortunately for fans salt has been poured into the wound by the inaccessibility of officially-licensed Kobe gear. Specifically shoes from Bryant's signature sneaker line with Nike.

Limited edition sneaker releases have been sporadic at best. Nike has not released a shoe from the Kobe line since May 2022.

The situation is delicate but it's fair for consumers to ask what the plan is for the future of the Nike Kobe signature line. To understand how we got here we must look back at recent events.

History of the Nike Kobe Protro Line

In August 2018 Nike launched the Kobe 'Protro' line. Bryant's retro shoes were updated with technological upgrades. Nike re-released the first fourth and fifth shoes from the Kobe line from 2018-2020.

Understandably production was put on hold following the tragic events of January 26 2020. Seven months later production of the Kobe 5 Protro in new colorways resumed. In December 2020 the Nike Kobe 6 Protro began to be released in very limited quantities.

From there the situation worsened. In April 2021 a nearly two-decade-long partnership between Nike and the Bryant estate expired. A public disagreement between Bryant's widow Vanessa Bryant and Nike began when an unreleased colorway honoring Gianna Bryant appeared online.

Eventually cooler heads prevailed and the two parties did not reach an agreement on a new contract until March 2022. The Nike Kobe 6 Protro 'Mambacita - Sweet 16' was released in limited quantities with 100% of the proceeds going to the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation the nonprofit charitable foundation that in 2020 was renamed to honor Gianna.

Future of the Nike Kobe Line

Nike has remained silent about the future of the Nike Kobe Protro line. Fans have been left in the dark while professional players have had mixed results. Bryant's shoes remain as popular as ever in the NBA. Players have worn older models and unreleased colorways of the Nike Kobe 6 Protro.

There have been rumors about the release of the Nike Kobe 6 'Prelude' as well as the launch of the Nike Kobe 8 Protro. However nothing has come from the rumors.

It has been over six months since Nike last released one of Bryant's shoes and the future appears uncertain. Bryant built his signature line not just with consumers in my mind but specifically for the people.

The Kobe line was once known for its prolific amount of options and accessibility to the average fan. Now it is another over-hyped sneaker worsened by artificial shortages.

Kobe fans are loyal and dedicated to carrying on the ""Mamba Mentality"" in any way they can. They haven't had many reasons to cheer over the past two years. A general release of a new Kobe model would be nice. But then again business isn't nice.

The claim was made in a sweeping gender discrimination lawsuit filed in 2018.

The alleged pay gap had been sealed in court records. It was unsealed after a court challenge.

Nike has disputed the calculation and said it's achieved pay parity.

Nike employees had an alleged gender pay gap of $11000 between 2015 and 2019 according to newly unsealed court documents.

The number had been under seal in a sweeping gender discrimination lawsuit which was filed in 2018 in the wake of reports about a toxic ""boys' club"" culture at the sportswear giant.

Nike fought to keep the number from public view claiming it's an erroneous calculation. The company has also repeatedly said it's achieved pay parity.

The alleged pay gap was unsealed on Wednesday after a successful court challenge by Insider the Oregonian and the Portland Business Journal. The number appears in a motion for class certification which had been partially redacted because of a protective order.

The news outlets argued for release of the number given the public interest in the lawsuit which is one of the most high-profile corporate lawsuits filed in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

The alleged pay gap was calculated by an expert witness for plaintiffs who used data provided by Nike during the discovery phase of the lawsuit. The calculation adjusts for numerous variables such as experience and education.

Plaintiffs allege the calculation shows women on average were paid less ""even though women had the same or better performance ratings educational background and work experience.""

""There is less than a 1 in 1 billion chance that these disparities occurred by random chance"" plaintiffs wrote in the motion for class certification.

An attorney for plaintiffs declined comment on the newly unsealed documents. Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the alleged pay gap.

In an April 2022 court filing an expert witness for Nike criticized the methodology plaintiffs used to determine the alleged pay gap.

""Far from comparing apples-to-apples this aggregated approach compares apples to oranges grapefruits pineapples and more than 1200 other types of fruit"" the expert witness wrote. ""It simply does not make sense.""

Since the lawsuit was filed Nike has taken numerous steps to address its pay and promotion practices including a round of raises in July 2018. It's also stopped asking employees for information about past salaries.







In its latest corporate-responsibility report Nike said it has achieved 100% pay parity. In response to previous questions a company spokesperson directed Insider to the report and noted previous reports also disclose information about pay parity.

The lawsuit awaits a ruling on a motion to make the case a class action. If certified it would grow from a lawsuit on behalf of 14 named plaintiffs to a lawsuit on behalf of roughly 5000 current and former Nike employees at the company's Oregon headquarters.

But any plan to slow down clean energy spending looks more limited now even as the GOP claimed a majority in the House yesterday.

Republicans now have at least 218 House seats ensuring a slim majority with seven races yet to be called. Democrats are already assured of keeping control of the Senate meaning Republicans will have a harder time getting their way on appropriations and any plans for permitting reform.

Still Republicans will have power in the House to conduct oversight investigations and hold hearings on how the Biden administration spends billions of dollars in loans and grants passed in this year’s Inflation Reduction Act and last year’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) who is in line to become chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee has likened the climate law to “Solyndra on steroids” and vowed strict oversight that could slow down the distribution of grants.

“I think you’ll see efforts to make it very difficult for the Biden administration. There could also be efforts to complicate the Biden administration moving forward through executive action” said Barry Rabe professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.

An October letter from committee Republicans to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm previewed likely avenues of investigation on energy policy asking for the portfolio of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office and information about the review process for loan guarantee decisions (Greenwire Oct. 11).

The climate law was not a centerpiece of GOP fury in the way the Affordable Care Act was in the 2010 midterms but it did not get a single Republican vote in either chamber.

Last week House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California who won the GOP nomination for House speaker yesterday retweeted a message linking to the GOP “Commitment to America” which attacks Biden on oil and gas production and notes higher electricity and gasoline prices during his administration.

Not even the Conservative Climate Caucus — a group of more than 70 House Republicans dedicated to working on climate issues — is promising to stay away from the law. A spokesperson for the caucus said that “the final so-called ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ comprehensively was a bad piece of legislation.”

“We stand at the ready to support each relevant Republican committee chair’s efforts to conduct proper oversight of these funds and the impact of the IRA” they said. The spokesperson added that “it’s effectively impossible to know how individuals feel about each provision” because it did not go through regular order.

Yet the power of House Republicans to go after the Inflation Reduction Act “is really limited” said Conrad Schneider advocacy director for the Clean Air Task Force. “They can conduct oversight and ask questions but they can’t really slow down the Treasury the IRS and DOE from implementing these programs.”

“The ball is in the Biden administration’s court to get these programs set up and get the money out as quickly as possible” he said.

However with Democrats keeping narrow control of the Senate — they currently hold 50 seats and could add another depending on the outcome of a Dec. 6 runoff in Georgia — the ability to use the climate law’s programs as bargaining chips in budget negotiations is reduced.

“Given that there is such bad blood it’s hard to imagine Republicans walking away and saying. ‘We’re not going to touch anything’” said Rabe.

The promise of GOP investigations has brought back memories of the DOE’s fateful $535 million loan guarantee to solar manufacturer Solyndra after the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which catalyzed more than $31 billion in clean energy investments from DOE.

The company’s bankruptcy in 2011 brought the loan office under blistering attack from conservatives who accused the Obama administration of squandering tax dollars on a fanciful clean energy technology. The attacks helped slow the office’s loanmaking in subsequent years although the Biden administration has championed its work.

Jonathan Silver who directed the DOE’s Loan Programs Office starting in 2009 just after the Solyndra loan said the office’s track record remains strong. He said its overall portfolio of loans has turned a profit for the federal government and enjoys some support from more centrist Republicans.

And he downplayed the possibility that the Loan Programs Office might once again go dark. “There’s no special target on its back” said Silver now chair of the global climate council at private equity firm Apollo Global Management.

Still Silver said that he doubted greater Republican control in Congress would change much about the country’s energy transition. While he said it would be “messy for the next couple of years” he added that “I don’t think it’s going to be any messier than environmental legislation has been at any other time.”

“My overriding perception here is that the war is over. Clean has won” Silver added.

Where action won’t be stopped

The cornerstone of President Joe Biden’s clean energy program — 10 years of federal tax credits written into the Inflation Reduction Act — is likely set in stone climate policy advocates said.

“Importantly most of the investments in [the Inflation Reduction Act] come in the form of tax credits with no dollar or unit caps and are set to remain in place for at least ten years meaning that the more states cities and businesses do to accelerate clean energy deployment now the more reductions and societal benefits will be achieved in the long-term” according to a report released this month funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies.

Of the Inflation Reduction Act’s estimated $369 billion 10-year cost two-thirds of the amount come from tax credits for clean energy generation carbon sequestration renewable fuels and clean energy manufacturing according to Moody’s Analytics. The other one-third of the legislation’s clean energy and climate investments represent appropriations for grants for technology and energy efficiency Moody’s Analytics said.

A research team led by Princeton University estimated that tax incentives in the law could potentially accelerate growth in wind and solar installations dramatically. Annual increases in wind generation could go from 15 gigawatts in 2020 to 39 gigawatts by 2025-2026 and utility-scale solar could climb from 10 gigawatts a year in 2020 to 49 gigawatts a year also by middecade the researchers estimated.

League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski said on a call with reporters last week that with the Inflation Reduction Act passed green groups’ attention could shift to the administration to maximize its deployment even with Republican gains in the election.

“The progress we need to make implementing the bill executive action on steroids and progress in the states will continue even if they’re in charge of the House” Karpinski said.

A campaign by House Republicans next year to slow the Biden clean energy initiatives would also run into clean energy policies pushed by Democratic state governors and support for clean energy in some GOP-led states whose governors want the investment and jobs that come with these projects. Democrats gained trifecta control in four states last week and held on to close gubernatorial races elsewhere opening more opportunities for state-level energy programs (Energywire Nov. 10).

Most of the large investor-owned utilities also have clean energy goals.

Lloyd Yates CEO at NiSource Inc. whose power and gas operations run from Indiana into Pennsylvania was asked recently about the impact of a GOP House victory on the company’s goal to achieve zero-carbon power by 2040.

He said NiSource is preparing to spend an average of $3 billion a year on capital projects over the next 10 years including coal plant retirements and solar farms. He said the company assumes the federal incentives will be there but it will go ahead in any case.

“While the political process is very important to NiSource” Yates said “our long-term commitment to clean energy will not waver.”

Possibilities for cooperation

Further complicating the politics around the Inflation Reduction Act is the fact that the benefits will flow to red states and districts where renewable energy is produced said Colin Hayes a former staff director for Republicans on the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee.

“It will be interesting to see how those red-state members balance an embrace of economic development in the clean energy sector against oversight and investigations work meant to catch the Biden Administration slipping” said Hayes now a founding partner at lobbying firm Lot Sixteen.

“The clean energy industry has become well industrial; it is a major economic force now” he added. “So even though the debate over what to do on climate policy has been fairly polarized I’d expect to see a continued increase in bipartisan cooperation on clean energy.”

Still there are some potential areas where energy policy could emerge from Congress. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is working to pass permitting reform legislation that would make it easier to approve renewable energy and oil and gas projects.

Although that bill stalled amid progressive opposition Democratic leaders have said it could come back in the lame-duck session or next year. Some backers — including the White House — have suggested tying it to the National Defense Authorization Act but the authors of the defense bill have thrown cold water on the idea (E&E Daily Nov. 16).

Republicans meanwhile have also urged a more sweeping bill that would pull back environmental reviews for a wide range of energy projects a longstanding goal. With Democrats eager to get faster approval for the transmission lines and renewable energy projects that will be crucial to harnessing the Inflation Reduction Act’s benefits a permitting bill could emerge as a rare piece of bipartisan legislation.

In a press appearance at the United Nations climate summit in Egypt last week members of the House Conservative Climate Caucus said there were opportunities to gather bipartisan support for some smaller-scale programs. Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) said that there are “bite-size pieces where we are on the same page” including more energy efficiency funding redesigning the grid and funding research into “economically sustainable and environmentally sustainable” climate solutions.

The narrow margins of the House could offer more moderate members inclined to work on climate change an opening to move bipartisan bills or to block more extreme measures. However the same holds true of the party’s far-right wing which largely opposes clean energy and climate work.

Paul Bledsoe a former climate adviser in the Clinton White House said that with polls showing strong support for the Inflation Reduction Act and clean energy in general Republicans who pushed too hard against them risked getting “over their skis.”

“The rejection of so many Trump candidates was not just about election denial but also over the predilection of Trump acolytes to deny facts whenever it suits them politically which includes climate issues” said Bledsoe now with the Progressive Policy Institute. “On the other hand moderate swing voters in key states like Pennsylvania and Ohio continue to embrace the economic benefits of shale gas with successful candidates like [Democratic Sen.-elect John] Fetterman supporting climate action through both renewables and natural gas.”

Interior in the spotlight

Along with affecting money flowing through the Department of Energy the Biden administration’s Interior Department is expected to be caught more firmly in the crosshairs of political fights over climate and energy policy on public lands with a Republican House.

The administration will likely face additional scrutiny from committee bully pulpits when climate policies appear to hamper fossil fuel industries. And GOP lawmakers are expected to use their muscle to question or undercut climate policies where they can like in the budgeting process according to observers.

“It’s going to be an incredibly adversarial hostile confrontational Congress that is going to try to thwart and stymie pretty much any and every initiative that Interior tries to do” said Brett Hartl government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity.

But Kathleen Sgamma president of the Denver-based Western Energy Alliance which represents oil and gas companies said the upcoming pushback is exactly what’s needed.

The Republican House will be a “firewall” against anti-energy legislation born in the White House and the agencies will be held accountable for public land energy decisions via oversight hearings Sgamma said.

“We just haven’t had any oversight of the agencies over the last two years so being able to ask them tough questions is important” she said. “Agencies left to themselves are not healthy.”

The Interior Department plays a key role in the White House’s energy policies including the goal to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind. The agency will also oversee policies on mining reform offshore oil and gas leasing renewable energy development on federal lands and regulations like methane rules for oil and gas developers on public lands.

While GOP lawmakers won’t have direct control over these initiatives they can try to affect the amount of resources agencies have for their clean energy and climate policies said Hartl with the Center for Biological Diversity.

Hartl said what’s unclear is how the Biden administration will counter new congressional pushback and whether it will look for consensus across the aisle — something Hartl associated with former President Barack Obama’s approach. Another option: Follow the Trump administration’s example and aggressively implement an energy agenda.

Hartl said he’s hoping for aggressive action because the Biden administration is running out of time to get regulations on fossil fuels finished before the presidential elections in 2024 he said.

“The Obama administration made catastrophic errors of judgments by sort of playing along and conceding the premise: let rules drag on for three four or five years because of Republican concerns reopening comment periods and trying to appease them” Hartl said. “It didn’t work and it didn’t help.”

Sgamma said the White House agenda is unlikely to shift or retreat despite new political pressure from the House.

Sgamma said the benefit of more tension on Capitol Hill is that Interior officials will be forced to answer questions publicly . That back-and-forth could be important in courtroom battles when the agency’s energy policies end up in litigation she said.

About 110 trains use the bridge daily including Amtrak MARC and Norfolk Southern.

The current bridge is moveable and consists of two tracks but has capacity limitations which requires trains to slow down when crossing.

To speed up and enhance travel two new fixed bridges will be built in its place.

Five additional miles of track realignment and construction is also expected to be completed as part of the project.

Total cost of construction is estimated to be at least $1.5 billion. Some of that will be funded by the recent infrastructure bill passed by the U.S. congress while the state has committed $3 million so far towards the design.

Contracts for the project will be awarded sometime in 2023.

As the longest moveable bridge on the Northeast Corridor the Susquehanna River Rail Bridge is used by Amtrak Maryland Area Regional Commuter (MARC) rail and Norfolk Southern to support more than 110 passenger and freight trains daily.

Currently crossing the bridge requires trains to slow to a speed of 90 mph resulting in capacity and reliability constraints. To resolve this issue two newly constructed two-track fixed bridges will replace the existing two-track movable bridge

$1.5B infrastructure investment to enhance Northeast Corridor travel

BALTIMORE – Amtrak is moving forward with a major infrastructure project to replace the 116-year-old Susquehanna River Rail Bridge. Two new bridges will replace the current bridge; and overhead power signal safety and security systems will be modernized to improve railroad efficiency on the Northeast Corridor. The total construction cost to replace the Susquehanna River Rail Bridge is estimated to be at least $1.5 billion.

“The bridge was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad at the turn of the 20th century and while it was well-constructed and remains safe it is a significant bottleneck on the Northeast Corridor” said Amtrak Executive Vice President Capital Delivery Laura Mason. “Once complete both new bridges will reduce trip time and improve reliability for passenger and freight trains that rely on this critical connection.”

“The Federal Railroad Administration is proud of the federal investments being made in the Susquehanna River Rail Bridge Project. We are eager to see those investments move Amtrak riders commuters and freight faster and more efficiently” said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. “With the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we have the opportunity to update and replace more aging rail structures like the Susquehanna River Rail Bridge and we look forward to working with States and entities to deliver the rail projects people across the country need and deserve.”

Currently crossing the bridge requires trains to slow to a speed of 90 mph resulting in capacity and reliability constraints. To resolve this issue two newly constructed two-track fixed bridges will replace the existing two-track movable bridge along with five miles of additional track realignment and construction.

Amtrak the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and MDOT MTA plan to award both contracts in 2023.

As a funding partner for the project the Maryland Department of Transportation Maryland Transit Administration (MDOT MTA) has committed $3 million toward a design grant that was recently awarded. Amtrak and MDOT MTA are in discussions about jointly pursuing additional grant funding for the cost of construction under the Federal State Partnership Program.

“We are pleased to invest $3 million to partner with Amtrak to complete final design on the Susquehanna Bridge” said MDOT MTA Administrator Holly Arnold. “The Susquehanna Bridge provides a critical link for service to the north and this project will provide improvements to MARC Train capacity trip time and safety.

“The 116-year-old Susquehanna Railroad Bridge needs to be replaced with crossings that can accommodate faster travel and support our efforts to modernize the Northeast Corridor” said Senator Ben Cardin. “This is a critical project that will create jobs improve safety and reliability and facilitate the efficient flow of rail service. The federal government remains a committed partner in this important project and I look forward to seeing it progress in its implementation.”

“Historic investments from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are making the replacement of the Susquehanna River Bridge a reality. This project is critical to ensure the safety of Maryland commuters and the reliability of our supply chains up and down the East Coast. I was proud to join members of the Maryland Congressional Delegation this summer to announce $20 million for the completion of the design work for this project and I will keep working to deliver federal funding for the needed modernization of our state’s infrastructure” said Senator Chris Van Hollen.

“If we want to keep people and products – and our economy – moving forward we must invest in our aging infrastructure” said Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger. “I proudly supported federal funding for this critical project which will make the commutes of Marylanders faster and safer while strengthening our supply chain and creating jobs.”

“I am very pleased to hear that Amtrak is moving forward with its plan to replace the Susquehanna bridge with two new bridges. Given that the Susquehanna bridge was built eight years before World War I replacing this heavily used and older bridge will improve the safety of all travelers including maritime traffic below it. This replacement project will also create economic opportunity for residents of the First District and I look forward to seeing the completion of this project” said Congressman Andy Harris.

Amtrak is inviting firms interested in the program to attend an Industry Day in December 2022 to learn more about the project. Interested contractors should monitor Amtrak’s Procurement Portal located here for further information about Industry Day. The Procurement Portal will offer additional solicitation information and submittal requirements. Attendance at Industry Day is not required to submit a proposal but is highly encouraged.

The Susquehanna River Rail Bridge was identified on the recently released Northeast Corridor Project Inventory list issued by the Federal Railroad Administration. The project is one of several major infrastructure projects that Amtrak’s newest department Capital Delivery is advancing. Earlier this year procurement launches were announced for the replacement of the B&P Tunnel in Maryland and the Connecticut River Bridge. Amtrak will continue announcing similar procurement opportunities in the coming months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoZWxieXN0YXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8xMS8xOC9zaGVsYnktYnJlYWtzLWdyb3VuZC1vbi1sb25nLWF3YWl0ZWQtcmFpbC10cmFpbC82OTY1NjU0MzAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shelby breaks ground on long awaited rail trail,"The ground has been broken on the first phase of Shelby’s rail trail bringing a long awaited dream one step closer to reality.

The name of the trail “Carolina Harmony Trail” was also unveiled during a ceremony Wednesday afternoon.

Renderings of what the bike and walking path will look like were on display and a small crowd gathered near the Bobby Bell Pavilion where work will begin at the intersection of Martin and Marion streets.

The total $25 million project has received some grants as well as local dollars. The city applied for a large grant earlier this year but was not awarded the funds. They plan to apply again next year. Although the trail runs through the county the city owns the entire corridor. So far county commissioners have not pledged support of the trail.

Sherry Henderson and Shea Stuart two local bike riders said they are looking forward to having a local trail option. Currently they drive the one-hour round trip to the Thermal Belt Rail Trail in Rutherford County.

Henderson said in addition to providing recreation opportunities it will benefit uptown businesses.

“This is a huge day for our city” said Mayor Stan Anthony in a brief ceremony before City Council and staff dug a shovel full of sand for a symbolic gesture of the groundbreaking.

He said there have been many people involved in the venture and who have helped make it happen from city staff and the city manager to members of council.

Anthony said it was 2007 when the railway saw its last train go down the tracks.

“Norfolk Southern made the decision to deactivate the line” he said.

Eight years ago he remembers receiving a letter notifying him the transportation corporation was beginning the process of rail banking and wanted to know if the city was interested and soon after the city purchased the entire rail corridor from Norfolk Southern.

The first seven tenths of a mile will soon be under construction and the first phase is expected to be completed in approximately seven months.

Anthony said the first section of trail details so much beauty and nature as it threads its way through an urban environment. Not only is the trail harmonious in a natural sense but the name is also a nod to the county’s rich musical heritage.

Once the first section is complete the city still has around 10 more miles as the former railway winds through Patterson Springs and ends in Earl near the South Carolina border.

“I know we’re going to see this come to fruition sooner rather than later” Anthony said. “This is a big day for our community.”

He hopes a Friends of the Trail group will be started as it will need advocacy to move forward.

Violet Arth one of the three original council members who was serving at the time the railroad was decommissioned said it was fantastic to see the project become a reality.

“It’s really exciting after all these years to see it come to fruition” she said.

She said not only will it offer opportunities for recreation and exercise for locals but will draw in visitors from outside the county.

Janet was shortlisted and crowned winner for her commitment during challenging times and outstanding contribution to volunteering in the health and care sector through her volunteering services as a Beauty Therapist to patients and families receiving palliative care in the Macmillan Unit Antrim Area Hospital.

Janet Potts - Volunteer of the Year

In addition to this Janet also volunteers with the Look Good Feel Better charity who work in partnership with the Northern Trust. She organises virtual beauty therapy sessions via zoom to patients who are receiving treatment after a cancer diagnosis. This was particularly important during the Covid 19 pandemic providing that much needed connection and support to patients.

Nicola McAleese Macmillan Volunteer Coordinator said: “Janet has been volunteering for over 21 years and is passionate about her volunteering roles. She brings so much joy and happiness to the lives of so many when their mood is low and they are at their most vulnerable. Volunteering is a huge part of Janet’s life and she is the embodiment of what a volunteer can bring to an organisation like Macmillan Cancer Support LGFB and the Northern Trust.”

Janet said: “It was a wonderful day celebrating at the awards ceremony in London which was made even better by winning the Volunteer of the Year (NI) Award. I am delighted to accept this award for all the volunteers at Macmillan in Northern Ireland who give up their time freely and willingly to help others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxoZWFsdGgubmV0LzIwMjIvMTEvbm9ydGhlcm4taXJlbGFuZC10by1iZW5lZml0LWZyb20tbmV3LWRpZ2l0YWwtaW1hZ2luZy1zeXN0ZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northern Ireland to benefit from new digital imaging system,"Northern Ireland is set to transform its health and social care diagnostic services with a new digital archiving system in partnership with Sectra.

The new software system provided by Sectra called NIPACS+ will allow clinicians in the region’s Health and Social Care (HSC) to view any patient image regardless of location.

Bringing together millions of digital patient images into one single system will help Northern Irish trusts break down silos of imaging information and enhance care for patients.

The NIPACS+ programme will deliver a single imaging system with Northern Ireland healthcare professionals able to access and interact with patient images across a range of disciplines. Patient care is set to be enhanced with images from all hospitals being available through the system.

Dr Cathy Jack chief executive at Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said: “This programme signals a major step forward in medical diagnostics for Northern Ireland.

“Moving to one imaging system will mean that from a single point of access healthcare professionals can instantly see all the imaging they need to support patient care.”

It will also support the creation of diagnostic hubs and the development of training facilities. Home reporting capabilities will offer workplace flexibility and help with the recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals.

Jane Rendall managing director for Sectra in the UK and Ireland said: “Northern Ireland is an example for the world in integrated diagnostics.

“NIPACS has already delivered so much digitising radiology and more recently pathology and the benefits delivered are about to be extended and accelerated for more healthcare professionals and their patients across the region. This is an extremely exciting project for Sectra to support.”

The digital pathology project builds on the original Northern Ireland Picture Archiving and Communication System (NIPACS) which over the past decade has digitised and connected radiology and pathology services."

The latest example of that approach is found in Northrop Grumman's Wednesday announcement that its newest board member is Arvind Krishna chairman and chief executive of IBM.

Krishna became IBM's CEO in April 2020 and added the board chairman title in January 2021 after a nearly three-decade career at Big Blue.

His key focus areas at IBM have included artificial intelligence cloud computing quantum computing and blockchain.

But for IBM and the overall tech ecosystem at-large: the global computer chip shortage has taken higher precedence over any of those four areas.

Just about everything of importance in the world runs on chips in some way shape or form. Defense platforms and systems are no exception.

Northrop has also felt the effects of that supply crunch and called it out for investors to factor in as a headwind to the business.

A lot of people deserve credit for the team’s unexpected success this year. One name we haven’t heard much of is Shane Waldron the offensive coordinator who’s helped turn Geno Smith into a fringe MVP candidate. Folks are taking notice though.

Waldron has made a list of potential 2023 head coaches at NFL.com. Here’s what Tom Pelissero had to say about Waldron’s candidacy.

“Waldron first appeared on this list in 2018 just before he interviewed for the Bengals job that went to Rams staff-mate Zac Taylor instead. Since then Waldron has gotten more experience at the front of the room and Year 2 in the Seahawks’ offense — really the first year with a QB running Waldron’s system as opposed to the mishmash of concepts Russell Wilson liked in 2021 — has been a big step forward.”

The numbers certainly support Waldron’s case. Heading into Week 11 Seattle’s offense ranks No. 7 in DVOA and No. 5 in scoring.

A number of factors played into steel prices dropping.

After U.S. steel prices appeared to flatten the descent for hot rolled coil cold rolled coil and hot dipped galvanized prices accelerated throughout October. Hot rolled coil prices now sit at their lowest level since November 2020. Plate prices however remain sideways experiencing only modest declines throughout October.

Nucor Keeps Plate Prices Flat in December

Source: Insights Chart & Correlation Analysis Tool

American steel giant Nucor announced no change in discrete plate prices for December meaning they will hold at $1620/st. This marks the second consecutive month that Nucor kept prices flat after the company lowered them by $120/st in mid-September.

As flat rolled steel prices remain in free fall plate prices continue to diverge from the larger trend. Since plate prices peaked nearly seven months ago they have so far declined only 14.76%. For comparison HRC prices fell a whopping 52.69% during that same period.

For months buyers have complained about the widening spread between the two commodities. Until HRC prices peaked in October 2021 plate prices averaged around $107/st over HRC. However that average has since ballooned to almost $600/st with the current spread sitting at an all-time high of $1014/st.

Are you under pressure to generate steel cost savings? Make sure you are following these five best practices.

New Brandenburg Mill to Test Sideways Plate Trend

The sideways trend will face its next major threat as new capacity comes online. Indeed operations at Nucor’s Brandenburg Kentucky plate mill officially began on October 20. At full capacity the mill can produce up to 1.2 million short tons per year. That said operations remain in their early stages and it is still unclear when the mill will reach maximum production.

According to the company the mill will primarily supply the renewable energy sector providing plate for solar and wind energy projects. Nonetheless as the mill begins to add supply to the plate market the sideways price trend will face increasing downside pressure. Thus far steel prices have resisted any meaningful decline. However this new mill could prove the tipping point.

Average Mill Lead Times (weeks)

Still mill lead times have substantially retraced since last year ultimately returning to levels well within their historical range. For this reason the supply/demand equation is unlikely to be the only driver of the current high prices. Overall plate remains a small market with few major domestic producers. On top of continued demand from infrastructure spending this has given those producers more control over price relative to other forms of steel.

Strong Plate Prices Offset Narrow Margins for Other Steel Prices

Steel producers remain eager to keep plate prices elevated as much as possible. After all falling prices continue to eat away at profit margins for other forms of steel. Indeed high input costs and demand destruction amid a worsening economic outlook put heavy pressure on steel companies’ Q3 earnings. For instance in its latest earnings report Nucor noted that the drop in earnings between Q2 and Q3 “was caused primarily by metal margin contraction and reduced shipping volumes.”

Nucor Corp. stocks have strongly correlated (92%) with plate prices since 2012. This would suggest that plate prices likely have a substantial impact on company profits. Moreover they have likely helped offset the impact of declining prices for other forms of steel. Still the diverging price trends have in part led to increased volatility for Nucor Corp. They also remain a significant drag on shares.

In the same report Nucor warned of another expected decline in earnings between Q3 and Q4. The company noted “increasingly challenging market conditions amid economic uncertainty” on top of declines due to seasonality. This gloomy outlook appears to forecast continued weakness in steel prices which may begin to extend to plate prices. It could also trigger Nucor and other producers to focus on keeping plate prices flat upon expectations of declines in steel prices elsewhere.

Governor Kay Ivey announced on Wednesday that First Solar Inc. plans to invest $1.1 billion to establish a photovoltaic (PV) solar module manufacturing facility in Lawrence County creating over 700 new jobs in North Alabama. The new factory is part of the company’s previously announced investment in scaling its American manufacturing footprint to over 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2025.

The facility in Lawrence County’s Mallard Fox West Industrial Complex is expected to be commissioned in 2025 with a planned annual capacity of 3.5 GW. The new fully vertically integrated facility will join three factories in Ohio including one that will come online in the first half of 2023 to form First Solar’s expanded domestic manufacturing footprint.

“First Solar is a world-class manufacturer and its solar modules are poised to play an increasingly important role in U.S. energy self-sufficiency” said Governor Ivey. “I’m thrilled to see the company’s growth project headed to Lawrence County because I know it will create good jobs and have a major economic impact on this rural region.”

The Alabama facility is expected to advance a strategic push by the company to scale its U.S. manufacturing base in support of the effort to decarbonize the American economy and achieve self-sufficiency in reliable and competitive renewable energy technologies.

“This facility along with its sister factories in Ohio will form part of the industrial foundation that helps ensure this transition is powered by American innovation and ingenuity” said CEO of First Solar Mark Widmar.

Designed and developed at its research and development (R&D) centers in California and Ohio First Solar’s advanced thin film PV modules set industry benchmarks for quality durability reliability design and environmental performance.

“Our commitment to Responsible Solar includes operating facilities that are among the cleanest safest and most diverse in the country and we’re pleased to bring our model of responsible solar manufacturing to Alabama” added Widmar. “We are proud of the role that this facility will play in creating stable good-paying manufacturing jobs in the state demonstrating the economic and social value that clean energy can deliver.”

Tempe Arizona-headquartered First Solar is unique among the world’s 10 largest solar manufacturers for being the only U.S.-headquartered company and for not manufacturing in China. Its latest investment is expected to bring the company’s total investment in American manufacturing to over $4 billion.

“As it works to develop the next generation of solar technologies First Solar represents the kind of innovative technology-forward company that can help power Alabama’s economy into the future” said Alabama Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield. “This investment supports sustainability and advances America’s energy security — and it’s great news for Alabama.”

First Solar estimates that its new investments in Alabama and Ohio now estimated at approximately $1.3 billion will add at least 850 new manufacturing and over 100 new R&D jobs taking its total number of direct jobs in the U.S. to over 3000 people in four states by 2025 which is believed to make it the largest employer in the American solar manufacturing sector.

Tabitha Pace president and CEO of the Lawrence County Industrial Development Board said she is excited about First Solar’s decision to locate its manufacturing facility in the rural North Alabama County.

“Our team from the state down to the local level has worked extremely hard to make this project a reality. First Solar will have a tremendous impact on our economy and region” said Pace. “We look forward to building those relationships for a successful future.”

Tennessee Valley Authority President and CEO Jeff Lyash welcomed First Solar to the North Alabama region.

“First Solar and TVA share a commitment to sustainability and innovation as well as supporting our local communities. As the nation’s largest solar panel manufacturer First Solar is bringing hundreds of quality jobs to the region” said Lyash. “We are proud of our partnership with Joe Wheeler Electric Membership Corp. the State of Alabama and other economic development agencies to help make North Alabama the region of choice for their newest location.”",,,

It's 3rd of January next year and a GeForce Special Event keynote for the CES tech jamboree in Las Vegas albeit Nvidia will be conducting the event remotely.

Beyond describing the event as detailing ""the latest technologies products and software from GeForce"" Nvidia isn't getting more specific. However we're expecting to see two main announcements at the event.

On the desktop side very likely we'll finally see what Nvidia has done with the cancelled RTX 4080 12GB model. Odds are it will be rebranded RTX 4070 Ti and be announced on the 3rd at that CES event.

Given the RTX 4080 12GB boards were already in mass production when Nvidia had a change of heart we're not expecting much by way of a change in specifications in the transition to RTX 4070 Ti branding.

So that's 7680 shaders aka CUDA cores in Nvidia parlance 240 texture units 80 ROPs and 12GB of memory running over a 196-bit bus. Roughly speaking those numbers are around 40 to 45 percent of the flagship RTX 4090 GPU. While it's possible Nvidia may tweak some of those specs for the purported RTX 4070 Ti via a video BIOS update we're not expecting a dramatic deviation.

Instead the big unknown is pricing. The RTX 4080 12GB was priced at $899 and the assumption is that the RTX 4070 Ti will be cheaper. But how much cheaper? Odds are we'll know on January 3.

Top-spec mobile GPUs should match the hardware features of the desktop RTX 4080 (Image credit: Future)

The other major announcement at the CES event is expected to be mobile variants of Nvidia's RTX 40-series GPUs otherwise known as Ada Lovelace. We're expecting to see RTX 4080 and 4070 branded mobile GPUs announced at minimum with the possible addition of a mobile RTX 4090 and 4060 mobile chips to top and tail the range.

Based on the best currently available information the mobile lineup would therefore look something like this. At the very top the RTX 4090 will use the same AD103 GPU as the desktop 4080 card and pack 9728 shaders 304 texture units and 112 ROPs all running over a 256-bit memory bus. Clock speeds would be significantly lower than the desktop 4080 at approximately 1.4GHz.

The RTX 4080 and 4080 Ti mobile will step down to the AD104 GPU briefly seen in that cancelled 4080 12GB desktop board with the Ti model offering much the same hardware features as the 4080 12GB desktop but running at lower clock speeds. Subtract roughly 15 percent from the shader texture and ROP counts to arrive at the non-Ti model. The smaller AD104 chip should clock a little higher in a mobile implementation and might flirt with as much as 2GHz in higher performing installations. However the usual lower-power Max-Q variants for thin-and-light will inevitably be much slower.

As for the RTX 4070 mobile that's likely to be based on the as-yet unannounced AD106 chip. Specs will likely fall around 4608 shaders 144 textures and 48 ROPs plus a 128-bit memory bus. Finally the RTX 4060 could use another unannounced chip AD107 with further cut-down specs likely to be around 2560 to 3072 shaders 80 to 96 texture units and around 32 ROPs. Mercifully AD107 is currently expected to stick with a 128-bit memory bus rather than stepping down even further to a 96-bit bus.

So there you have it: what to expect on January 3rd. Let us know below whether that sounds exciting or if it just adds to the frustration at the latest GPU launches.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtaXNzdWVzLXN0YXRlbWVudC1vbi1tZWx0aW5nLTEydmhwd3ItcG93ZXItYWRhcHRlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia on Melting 16-Pin Adapter: Connectors Weren't Plugged in Correctly,"After studying multiple incidents involving melting and overheating 12VHPWR power adapters with the GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards for several weeks Nvidia has finally issued an official statement.

""We are actively investigating the reports"" a statement by Nvidia reads. ""We are aware of about 50 cases globally. Our findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card. To help ensure the connector is secure we recommend plugging the power dongle into the graphics card first to ensure it is firmly and evenly plugged in before plugging the graphics card into the motherboard. We are investigating additional ways to ensure that the connector is secure before powering on the graphics card. Nvidia and our partners are committed to supporting our customers and ensuring an expedited RMA process regardless of the cable or card used.""

The company is aware of 50 melting 16-pin 12VHPWR adapter cases globally and will keep investigating further. So far the company has found that melting and overheating have happened when the adapter's connector is not securely plugged into its socket. The company advises GeForce RTX 4090 owners to securely connect the adapter before installing the board into its PCIe slot. Meanwhile the company and its partners promise to replace damaged hardware promptly for those affected by the issue.

Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 is the company's $1599 flagship product. News of the adaptor problems became well-known through forum and reddit posts which created an impression that it was a widespread issue. So far Nvidia says it has investigated 50 reports of melting adaptors which isn't egregiously high considering that Nvidia and its partners have sold tens if not hundreds of thousands of GeForce RTX 4090 graphics boards so far.

Nvidia is still investigating the reports and ways to ensure the adapter is seated correctly before powering on the card though the company didn't elaborate on whether the latter entails a modification to the existing design or other measures. We'll update as necessary.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5leHRwbGF0Zm9ybS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9kYXRhY2VudGVyLWNhbi1jYXJyeS1udmlkaWEtdGhyb3VnaC10aGUtcm91Z2gtc3BvdHMv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV4dHBsYXRmb3JtLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE3L2RhdGFjZW50ZXItY2FuLWNhcnJ5LW52aWRpYS10aHJvdWdoLXRoZS1yb3VnaC1zcG90cy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Datacenter Can Carry Nvidia Through The Rough Spots,"After a decade and a half of ceaseless and focused work Nvidia has created a modern compute platform and a unique one at that. And while the collapse of the PC market and the Dot Coin Bust has not done its financials any favors in recent quarters Nvidia’s datacenter business is clipping along despite the economic uncertainties out there on Earth.

In fact that Nvidia datacenter business seems poised to expand in the coming years thanks to its entry into CPUs and DPUs the need for high bandwidth networking and the ongoing adoption of GPU compute for HPC AI and now data analytics workloads. And this despite increasing competition in GPUs and already fierce competition in CPUs.

The trajectory of that datacenter business is clear and made even more dramatic by the drop in sales for GPUs dedicated to gaming and professional visualization that continued in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 ended in October. Take a look:

For those of you who like the raw data too here are the sales for the last seven quarters by Nvidia division:

The channel has been flooded with GPUs that are no longer used to make Etherium cryptocurrency at the same time that the voracious appetite for new PCs – caused by the coronavirus pandemic – has waned.

This is an economic pincher for the GPU businesses of both AMD and Nvidia and the white-knuckle drop is obviously very hard on the 22500 employees of Nvidia starting at the top with co-founder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang. That Nvidia employee count is up 63 percent from the start of the pandemic. While the tech sector in the United States has laid off around 67000 workers this year so far there is no such talk about that at Nvidia. The GPU maker has a balance sheet that is plenty strong enough to ride this out and get to the other side when gaming and professional visualization sales recover.

The future revenue streams from Nvidia’s datacenter business – and therefore its ability to ride out the gaming and pro viz downturns – may hinge on the pricing that Nvidia decides to set for its “Hopper” H100 GPU accelerators which have been shipping in volume since September and its “Grace” Arm server CPUs which will have production samples in Q1 2023 and ramp in the first half of 2023. If Nvidia charges too much – as IBM did with its ES/9000 mainframes in September 1990 when a recession was underway and as Sun Microsystems did with its UltraSparc-III systems in September 2001 as another recession was underway – then this can drive customers into the loving arms of competitors.

But as we have pointed out before you make the money while you can and cut prices when you must. IBM and Sun did that with their systems and we see no reason to believe that Nvidia will behave any differently with its Hopper GPUs and Grace CPUs. Back in May we used pricing and performance history to guess where the H100 prices might land and have subsequently revised those upwards. We would not be surprised to see the SXM5 version of the Hopper GPU sell for $25000 with the PCI-Express version being somewhat lower maybe $19500. That is somewhere between 3X and 6X the performance for around 2.5X the price.

Because Nvidia has built a platform with 35000 customers – that is the first time we have seen this number but here it is:

And this composite chart used in Nvidia’s most recent financial briefing deck is also interesting particularly the column chart on the left:

That bar chart shows sales of Nvidia compute GPUs to the hyperscalers and cloud builders over the first eight quarters that these devices were first available. The V100 did 2.7X more revenue than the P100 among these customers in the first two years after their respective launches and the A100 did 3X the revenue compared to the V100. Considering the appetite for GPU compute it is not hard to believe that H100 will do more than 3X the revenue of A100 in its first eight quarters – provided Nvidia can keep supply feeding demand. We will find out just how hungry the datacenter is for GPUs over the next eight quarters.

The growth rate for the Datacenter division has slowed but we think this has more to do with the H100 ramp which didn’t really start until September halfway through Nvidia’s Q3 of fiscal 2023 than it does with any kind of waning demand. Nvidia has had Q3s that were tripling datacenter revenue (Q3 F2017) doubling datacenter revenue (Q3 F2018) and one in between (Q3 F2021). It had Q3s that went negative (Q3 F2016 and Q3 F2020) and ones that were up a reasonable amount considering the limit of large numbers. Q3 F2019 was up 58.1 percent and Q3 F2022 was up 54.5 percent. Against this the 30.6 percent growth in Q3 F2023 for the Datacenter division is not stellar but again it is the beginning of the H100 ramp and there are still supply chain constraints holding things back.

With that 30.6 percent growth in Q3 Nvidia raked in $3.83 billion in sales up seven-tenths of a point sequentially and setting a new high bar for datacenter sales helped no doubt by sales of Quantum-2 InfiniBand and Spectrum-4 Ethernet switching and perhaps even a contribution from the BlueField-2 DPUs. The fact that Nvidia customers are willing to make do with A100 accelerators is certainly helping keep the money rolling in for Nvidia we think and most big supercomputer deals we see for Nvidia GPUs these days seem to have a mix of the devices – or are based on a combination of AMD CPUs and GPUs. (Ahem.) Customers no doubt would like to have all H100s and we think there are supply issues that make this not possible. Why else would Meta Platforms have made such a big deal of buying a back-generation system that is only just now fully installed or of using Microsoft to assemble a virtual supercomputer also based on A100s?

In the quarter Nvidia has had to deal with “macroeconomic challenges new export controls and lingering supply chain disruptions” as Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress put it adding that the year on year growth was driven by the hyperscalers and big cloud builders in the United States as well as a widening number of Internet companies that are building large language model recommender system and generative AI applications that run on Nvidia GPUs and that we think in the latter case are created with the Nvidia AI Enterprise software platform. The auto and energy businesses were also singled out as driving sales increases for datacenter products.

Which brings us to China. The export controls that the US government put in place in September to halt the sales of A100 and H100 GPUs in China were expected to have a negative impact of $400 million on the quarter but by crimping the A100 back to 600 GB/sec of memory bandwidth with a new product dubbed the A800 Nvidia was largely able to keep most of that revenue it expected. The PCXI-Express 4.0 x16 version of the A100 normally has 1.9 TB/sec of bandwidth and it is unclear how much the bandwidth drop puts a governor on the floating point and integer performance of the A100. Probably a lot. And so politicians not realizing that supercomputing applications are made to scale out have merely forced China to buy 2X or maybe even 3X the number of A800 GPUs because they can’t get a real A100 and maybe 6X to 9X the number of A800 GPUs because they can’t get a real H100.

Now here is the real boomerang effect: Because Nvidia has such a lock on its software stack and such good GPUs and there is more demand than supply for all datacenter-class GPUs imagine that Nvidia can charge the same amount – or even close to the same amount – for an A800 GPU as it was charging for an A100 GPU. Now Chinese organizations will spend 2X or 3X or more to get the same performance and Nvidia wins! Instead of losing $400 million Nvidia might make $800 million or even $1.2 billion! Abd the Chinese HPC centers have to then pay these enormous electric bills on datacenters that are 2X to 3X bigger than they might otherwise be. And if they were thinking about H100 GPUs they have to spend maybe 6X to 9X as much!

China will be stuck in the 2020 GPU market and Nvidia can benefit handsomely from this. The same logic will hold for AMD Instinct MI200 series and Intel Max Series GPUs that are governed down. In fact Intel may find more customers in China than in the United States and Europe for its low-end half-stack Max Series GPU because indigenous GPU maker Biren Technology is going to have its own issues getting its chips out of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s foundries because of other controls being put on Taiwan by the United States.

Crazy isn’t it?

Across all of its divisions Nvidia’s sales fell by 16.5 percent to $5.93 billion and net income collapsed by 72.4 percent to $680 million. Nvidia burned $3.3 billion in the last quarter and another $3.9 billion in this quarter to pay its dividend to ramp current products and to keep investing in its future products and now its cash hoard stands at $13.1 billion.

The company’s Compute & Networking group which includes datacenter GPUs DPUs and NICs and switch revenues but which does not include some things categorized in the Datacenter division rose by 26.7 percent to $3.82 billion. When Nvidia announced the deal to buy Mellanox Technology several years ago it was doing about $400 million a quarter and these days it is doing roughly $800 million a quarter. It would be nice if Nvidia actually broke this out better – and ditto for datacenter GPUs versus boards and systems.

Nvidia is expecting a tiny bit of sequential growth for its Datacenter Gaming and Automotive divisions as it moves into Q4 2023. Perhaps this is the bottom for the gaming business and sales can resume their uphill climb back to the old heights soon.

Starbucks will open a third Bridgeport location next year according to city officials. (Scott Anderson/Patch file photo)

BRIDGEPORT CT — Starbucks will open a new location in the west side of Bridgeport in April next year marking the coffee chain's third shop in the city according to officials.

The new site will be at the intersection of Fairfield Avenue and Mountain Grove Street (1705 Fairfield Ave.) and will join a recently opened O'Reilly Auto Parts Store in a new $4 million retail complex by developer Richard Korris. ""With Bridgeport quickly growing and becoming a forefront for new businesses and live entertainment making these projects and infrastructure improvements a reality has the potential to add significant momentum to the revitalization of our City as well as improve the quality of life for neighborhood residents on the east and west sides of Bridgeport"" said Mayor Joseph Ganim about the addition of a third Starbucks.



The city's other Starbucks locations are on the East Side at Steelpointe and in the North End at Brookside Shopping Center. According to city officials the building for the new location already has its steel framing in place and should be completely enclosed before the winter. Once completed it will include drive-thru service and café seating.

Korris is continuing his work on the project after finishing the redevelopment and lease of the North Park Shopping Center on Park Avenue. ""They see the steady population growth and the increasing level of investment being made throughout the city more of the national chains are taking a look at the city"" Korris said about the new Starbucks. ""We’re pleased to be able to bring this popular brand to Bridgeport.""



In preparation for an April opening Starbucks will start its employment process in the late winter.

My son Ray and I have both been music lovers our whole lives. (Well I was first!)

In 1980 I was at The Brighton Bar in Long Branch my sneakers sticking to the beer-covered floor waiting to see the band The Chronic Sick.

In 2010 Ray walked to Brighton on a blistery cold Friday night from our home a few blocks away to try to catch Grant Hart from Hüsker Dü.

That was the Brighton Bar.

attachment-1 loading...

A symbol of all that was great about youth music and Long Branch.

Open since 1915 the Brighton Bar in Long Branch owned since 1996 by Greg Macolino closed in April 2021 and according to reports demolition is slated for today.

It's a sad day.

The story of the Brighton Bar is legendary:

Greg and his rock band The Chronic Sick used to play at the Brighton. After working there he purchased the business and began bringing in original rock bands of all ages giving hopes of stardom to all of them.

While Brighton Bar specialized in punk rock bands over the years they also had jazz bands country artists blues acts even poetry and artists.

In fact Its Wall of Fame is a Who's Who of artists including Fountains of Wayne (""Stacy's Mom"") Three Doors Down (""Kryptonite"" ""Here Without You"" ""Let Me Go"") and even Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi.

Oh lest I forget my son Raymond's band Secret Mountain had a gig there too.

An article in the Long Branch paper last year said:

""It was a badge of honor to play on stage with the Brighton lights behind you. Closing will no doubt break a lot of new young rocker's hearts. There was no place to play on stage for the first time like the Brighton. Greg kept The Brighton going through good times and bad until the present.""

On @newjerseyhardcore Instagram account users are weighing in with their memories:

""The cbgb of the jersey shore. Just a little cleaner.""

""Honored to have played on that stage.""

""Damn this one hits hard. Countless memories as a musician and a participant""

The Brighton bar's Facebook page looks forlorn. Its last post there was from November 2021. A year later and its demolition day is set.

The neighborhood where the Brighton Bar stands was once called a ""little Greenwich Village"" with a Bohemian feeling. It's where the Village-esque coffee house The Inkwell was located before its post-COVID closing. It was also home to the turntable record shop where you'd wait in line for tickets to anything from Dead Kennedys to Bruce Springsteen.

The ""West End"" neighborhood attracted us: the artists the misfits the misunderstood the musicians and poets. The area's gentrification isn't surprising but still like all change has its happy and its sad.

The slogan of this legendary Jersey Shore bar was ""The Home of Original Live Music.""

""Long Branch had no business getting the caliber of punk bands that Brighton Bar managed to get somehow"" Ray mused.

But that's the thing. They did. And the reason they were able to attract those bands is this: The grungy little place stood for something. And with fewer and fewer venues for indie music and small local bands to hone their chops that something will be missed.

OXY,Occidental Petroleum,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnRlbmVyZ3kuY29tL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZXMvZXhjbHVzaXZlLW94eXMtYmFiYXR1bmRlLWNvbGUtZGlzY3Vzc2VzLXBlcm1pYW4tYmFzaW4tc3RyYXRlZ3ktd2F0Y2gtMjAzMDM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: Oxy's Babatunde Cole Discusses Permian Basin Strategy [WATCH],"Occidental Petroleum Corp. is a leading producer in the Permian Basin and its plans extend beyond oil and gas.

While producing a half-million boe/d from the Permian Basin Oxy is reducing emissions sustainably managing water growing a leading CO₂-capture portfolio and more.

Babatunde Cole the president and general manager of Occidental Petroleum’s Delaware Basin business unit spoke with Hart Energy following his presentation at the Executive Oil Conference in Midland Texas about how the Permian Basin fits within Oxy’s sustainable goals.

Jordan Blum: What is Oxy doing with the groundbreaking direct air capture technology in the Permian and where do things stand? What’s the timeline now?

Babatunde Cole (00:33): Yeah really exciting opportunity for us with the direct air capture. Just to take stock of where we are today we announced recently that we started early site construction on our first DAC here in Midland. We’re really excited. We went through an extensive front engineering design process and also did some testing and validation of the technology with carbon engineering to get us to where we are today. So we’re definitely excited to break ground with some early construction. And based on the current timeline we hope that it’s operational by late 2024.

JB: And this will literally be sucking CO₂ out the sky. Can you talk about how that fits with Oxy’s EOR focus?

BC (01:26): Yeah I think they’re kind of two separate things. But on the DAC side it’s an integral part of our net-zero strategy direct air capture. What we want to do there is we want to remove carbon from the air running through a series of chemical reactions and create a pure CO₂ stream. And that CO₂ stream can either be permanently retired downhole or it can be used to create other derivative products that add utility and value whether it's construction materials polymers. So just really creating a carbon value chain with that process.

And our EOR comes in handy. We have 40 years of experience with carbon management. We have extensive knowledge of the subsurface and the surface processing facilities. And we feel like that expertise is going to be very vital for being able to manage carbon whether it’s through retiring the carbon underground or using that carbon for other products in the future.

JB: Oxy just announced too a new deal with the Historic King Ranch in South Texas to potentially do DAC plans there. Can you talk about how that might work out?

BC (02:45): Yeah a really exciting agreement that we got done. We recently announced it. It’s a huge acreage position. It’s located perfectly in terms of just being close to an industrial hub and the goal there is to facilitate the storage of CO₂ and the capture of CO₂ in that area. When you look at the King Ranch opportunity for us I think from what we announced it has about 3 billion tons of storage capacity geological storage capacity and over time our goal is to scale up our annual carbon capture on that lease peaking at about 30 million tons of carbon captured a year. So really exciting opportunity for us and yeah we’re ready to get going.

JB: Oxy has talked about doing up to 30 DAC plants on the King Ranch acreage. I mean that sounds really ambitious. What’s the potential timeline there?

BC (03:48): Without getting into a timeline specifically I think one thing we’ve done well as a company Oxy is we were able to set ambitious goals and create bottoms up plans to hit those goals. I won’t put out a timeline I’m not sure if we put one out already but I can tell you that we have teams working hard to make it a reality.

JB: Certainly a big part of the business going forward.

BC (04:17): Yes.

JB: Just going back to the Permian Oxy is also doing a lot more with water recycling. How is that process going? How’s that fitting with the environmental goals?

BC (04:26): Oh no it’s huge for us. Like I said during the conference we’re in the water management business also. Parts of the Permian you’re producing more water or just as much water as your oil. So having a really good water management practice and a way to deploy technology to reduce your reliance on fresh water is key.

Again Oxy is recognized as a leader in terms of our ability to have sound water management practices. We partner with universities government organizations and private organizations to help educate on recycled produced water and other uses of recycled produced water. So it’s huge for us.

We have recycling hubs in our core areas. We released that we recycled about 25 million barrels of water in our New Mexico operations in 2019 and we’re still recycling up until today. And in our Midland Basin operations we’re recycling water at our South Curtis Ranch facility.

So again huge goal for us is to continue that process and expanded long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9laWEtb2lsLXN1cHBseS1kYXRhLWhlYWRsaW5lcy0xMzA3MDEwMTQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EIA Oil Supply Data Headlines: Crude Stocks Down Fuel Up,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9laWEtb2lsLXN1cHBseS1kYXRhLWhlYWRsaW5lcy0xMzA3MDEwMTQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E6104E52D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9laWEtb2lsLXN1cHBseS1kYXRhLWhlYWRsaW5lcy0xMzA3MDEwMTQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vZXRmcy1hbmQtZnVuZHMvc2VjdG9ycy9zcDUwMC13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1tYWtlcy1hbGwtaGlzLW1vbmV5LWZyb20tc3RvY2tzLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Makes All His Money From Just 11 Stocks,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-warren-buffett-makes-all-his-money-from-stocks-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vZXRmcy1hbmQtZnVuZHMvc2VjdG9ycy9zcDUwMC13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1tYWtlcy1hbGwtaGlzLW1vbmV5LWZyb20tc3RvY2tzLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNS1iaWdnZXN0LWV4cGxvcmF0aW9uLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tY29tcGFuaWVzLTEzMzYxNDUzOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Biggest Exploration and Production Companies in the World,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='finance.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/15-biggest-exploration-production-companies-133614538.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E6104E44C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNS1iaWdnZXN0LWV4cGxvcmF0aW9uLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tY29tcGFuaWVzLTEzMzYxNDUzOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am95b25saW5lLmNvbS9waWFjLXJlYWZmaXJtcy1ub25wYXltZW50LW9mLTEwMC1taWxsaW9uLWludG8tcGV0cm9sZXVtLWhvbGRpbmctZnVuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PIAC reaffirms nonpayment of $100 million into Petroleum Holding Fund,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am95b25saW5lLmNvbS9waWFjLXJlYWZmaXJtcy1ub25wYXltZW50LW9mLTEwMC1taWxsaW9uLWludG8tcGV0cm9sZXVtLWhvbGRpbmctZnVuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E6104E4040>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am95b25saW5lLmNvbS9waWFjLXJlYWZmaXJtcy1ub25wYXltZW50LW9mLTEwMC1taWxsaW9uLWludG8tcGV0cm9sZXVtLWhvbGRpbmctZnVuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The Social Science Research Center (SSRC) at Old Dominion University recently completed data collection for the 13th annual Life in Hampton Roads (LIHR) survey. The purpose of this survey is to gain insight into residents’ perceptions of the quality of life in Hampton Roads as well as other topics of local interest such as perceptions of police politics the economy education health and COVID-19 transportation and other issues. A total of 639 telephone surveys were completed between May 31 and Aug. 19 2022. Surveys this year were all completed over the telephone as was the case prior to 2020. In 2020 due to COVID-19 surveys were completed via online web panels. In 2021 a mixture of online web panels and telephone surveys were utilized. This year a mixture of listed and random-digit dial (RDD) cellphone and landline telephone numbers were used. From 2012 to 2019 RDD landline and cell phone samples were used. This change limits to some degree the ability to compare this year’s results with those from previous years or to confidently generalize the results to the Hampton Roads population as a whole. However as with previous years this year’s survey data was weighted to match a city’s population distribution on several variables including race Hispanic ethnicity age and gender along with access to broadband internet service. For more detailed information on the methodological changes and potential impacts please see the Methodology section in the full report or contact the SSRC directly.

Politics

The Life in Hampton Roads survey always includes a few questions about political attitudes. In 2022 the questions included party affiliation political ideology job approval of President Biden Gov. Youngkin and local mayors.

Political party affiliation among respondents to the survey continued to lean substantially toward the Democratic Party in line with past surveys in Hampton Roads. Nearly three in 10 (27.7%) respondents said they felt closest to the Democratic party when asked the question “Do you generally feel closer to the Democratic Party the Republican Party or do you consider yourself to be an independent or something else.” Another 16.3% identified with the Republican Party. But this represents a substantial decline for both parties from last year with the portion of respondents who indicated that they were political independents or affiliated with some other party surging to the highest levels we have seen in some time. Last year we found “a trend toward more individuals indicating a major party they felt closest to especially on the Democratic side” but this trend seems to have sharply reversed in 2022 with a majority of individuals indicating that they are political independents or affiliated with some other party.

This year we also brought back a political ideology question that hadn’t been asked for several years. Individuals were asked to describe their political views on a seven-point scale ranging from extremely liberal to extremely conservative. This item suggests that the region is quite balanced ideologically with nearly equal numbers of liberals moderates and conservatives.

As can be seen in the chart the largest group of respondents were those who said they were moderate (27.1%). The next largest groups were those who described themselves as liberal (16.1%) and conservative (15.4%). Overall 31.6% of respondents described themselves as liberal (summing across the three liberal categories) and 31.1% described themselves as conservative. Roughly one in 10 respondents either refused to state their ideology (6.6%) or indicated that they did not know (3.6%).

Overall respondents’ attitudes towards President Joe Biden’s job performance were down from the 2021 survey in line with changing national trends in his approval rating. The percentage who strongly approved of Biden’s job performance dropped by about 10 percentage points (from 14.7% to 4.3%) and the percentage who approved also dropped by more than five points (from 41% to 35.2%).

At the time that the survey was conducted Glenn Youngkin had been governor for several months. Opinions of his job performance were mixed with 43.7% approving or strongly approving and 34.9% disapproving or strongly disapproving. More than 20% of respondents indicated that they either did not know (15.7%) or refused to answer (5.6%). Since Youngkin received roughly 45% of the vote in the November 2021 gubernatorial election within the seven cities surveyed (217129 out of 479886 votes) this level of approval seems consistent with neither major gains nor losses in popularity for the governor at this point in his administration.

One of the issues Gov. Youngkin campaigned on was education and an early action by the governor in involved an executive order banning “inherently divisive concepts” including Critical Race Theory in Virginia public schools. Evaluations of this action were much more negative than overall evaluations of the governor and divided the governor’s support base to a somewhat greater degree than his opponents. Approximately one-third (32.9%) of respondents indicated that they approved or strongly approved of the order but nearly half (48.7%) disapproved. As with the gubernatorial job approval question a substantial portion of respondents indicated that they did not know or refused to answer the question (18.5%). The executive order divided the governor’s supporters. Almost a quarter of the respondents who approved or strongly approved of the governor’s job performance disapproved or strongly disapproved of the executive order (23.6%) among Republicans 13.4% disapproved or strongly disapproved the action and among respondents who identified as conservative or extremely conservative 21.1% disapproved or strongly disapproved. The governor’s opponents more uniformly failed to approve the order with 7.4% of Democrats 6.7% of those who disapproved of the governor and 4.6% of those who identified as liberal or extremely liberal voicing approval or strong approval for the executive order.

We also asked about mayoral job approval. Responses to this question were relatively strong for most mayors. More than half of respondents indicated that they approved (54.2%) with only 16.9% voicing disapproval. We observed similar patterns for most regional cities with the exception of Portsmouth. Only 31% of Portsmouth residents surveyed indicated that they approved of “the job your local mayor is doing” while 57.1% indicated that they disapproved. It is important to remember that the overall sample sizes here are quite small at the city level – only 38 Portsmouth residents responded to the survey. Nonetheless the data seem› to suggest that while the residents of most cities are relatively happy with the job performance of their mayor Portsmouth residents appear to be an exception.

News Sources

This year for the first time respondents were asked to identify their sources of information about local news with the question: “Which of the following sources do you typically use to learn about local news in Hampton Roads?” Respondents could select all that applied from among the following options: local television news; newspapers; internet sites social media or blogs; radio news or talk shows; and other. Respondents could also indicate that they do not obtain local Hampton Roads news as well as “don’t know” or “refused.”

Most respondents selected at least one news source. Among the four sources newspapers had the smallest share with one in four respondents (25.3%) indicating that they use them to learn about local news. Radio news (40.4%) and local television news or talk shows (55.7%) had substantially larger proportions and internet sites social media or blogs were the most common source used by almost two-thirds of respondents (64%).

Slightly more than half of respondents named at least two news sources (55.7%) and slightly more than a third of respondents (38.7%) named only one news source. There were striking differences across the news sources in the frequency with which the news source was the only source of information. Only 4.9% cited newspapers as their only source. By contrast more than a quarter of respondents who relied on local television (26.1%) and the internet (28.6%) had no other source of information.

Does it matter how many sources of information one has about local news? More than a quarter of respondents to the local mayor job approval question indicated that they either did not know (22.5%) or that they refused to answer (6.4%). Perhaps unwillingness or inability to answer the question reflects a lack of information about that performance in part due to consuming minimal amounts of local news. More than half of the respondents who consult none of the four categories of news sources did not express an opinion about the job performance of their local mayor (58.3%) while a third or less of the respondents in all other categories did not evaluate the job performance of their local mayor. Failure to attend to local news may render citizens less able to effectively participate in local politics.[1]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vb2R1c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvd29tZW5zLWJhc2tldGJhbGwtdG8tcGxheS1hdC14YXZpZXItc2F0dXJkYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women's Basketball to Play at Xavier Saturday,"Old Dominion (2-1) at Xavier (3-0)

The basic physics of having too much heat trapped in too small a space is leading to tangible problems like consumer products that are too hot to hold. Far worse however is the loss of power and reliability as overheated DRAM has to continually refresh and chips become even more stressed in high-heat sectors such as automotive.

“In an ideal world you would have your die made of copper and your substrate would be 100% copper” said Nathan Whitchurch senior staff mechanical engineer at Amkor. “But even if you could you wouldn’t get any more performance because of some other limiting factors in the package.”

Thermal issues are becoming an earlier design and packaging decision in 2.5D and 3D packages. “Thermal dissipation is one of the key issues that we have to consider in memory on logic but also in logic on logic stacking said Yin Chang senior vice president of sales and marketing at ASE.

As the industry seeks solutions microfluidics and thermal interface materials (TIMs) are key areas of development. The former is seeing breakthroughs. The latter is making incremental improvements. To remove heat liquid coolers can be direct bonded to chips or channels can be built into the chips themselves. On the TIM side sintered silver epoxy is gaining use.

Microfluidics may soon make the transition to production. “I’m betting that microfluidics is going to start appearing beyond just the hyper exotic places especially if you start stacking high performance logic” said Rob Aitken distinguished architect at Synopsys. “If you don’t do anything about cooling then your stacked logic is limited to the thermal dissipation that a single die had. There’s a massive economic push to solve such problems. Given that and given people’s creativity I would bet that somebody will solve it in some clever way.”

Status of microfluidics

For the last 40 years commercial microfluidics technology has been just around the corner. The idea of embedding liquids in micro/nanoscaled channels to cool semiconductors was first described in a now-classic paper by Tuckerman and Pease in 1981.1 Variations have been tried ever since and now some projects are showing real and practical promise for cooling.

Two years ago a group from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland demonstrated a prototype that brought the cooling liquid as close as possible to the heat source. The design was a working version of an often-discussed microfluidics goal — integrating channels directly within a chip rather than relying on TIMs or bonding the latter of which makes the commercial market skittish due to reliability issues.

The Swiss team overcame the challenges by creating in the language of their paper “a monolithically integrated manifold microchannel cooling structure [in which] heat fluxes exceeding 1.7 kilowatts per square centimetre can be extracted using only 0.57 watts per square centimetre of pumping power.”2

The paper attracted interest from investors and their idea progressed from the lab into a start-up. Its first author Remco van Erp along with his EPFL professor Elison Matioli and COO Sam Harrison have co-founded a company called Corintis3 which has received funding from the Swiss government to create commercial versions of their innovation.

“From the thermal point of view Corintis’ approach is a very interesting cooling solution as the coolant can get as close as possible to the location of the heat sources and several thermal barriers can be eliminated in this configuration” said Herman Oprins principal member of technical staff at imec. But he cautioned that commercial adoption is not a given. “This is a disruptive cooling solution that requires a tight co-design between the fluidic channel structures and the electronic devices in order to achieve the full potential of this cooling method. It is very well suited for challenging applications with very high power densities such as the power bar structures shown in the paper. For CMOS applications with power densities in the range of several hundreds W/cm² separate cooling blocks with more relaxed channel diameters of several hundreds of µm could be used.”

Imec presented its own microfluidics prototype three years ago. Its press release describes the concept as “a Si microchannel heat sink assembled to a high performance chip for cooling the latter one. [It] achieves a low total thermal resistance of 0.34K/W to 0.28K/W at less than 2W pump power.”4

“We have two main types of prototypes” Oprins explained. “One is the silicon microchannel cooler. There the main development is the bonding to the chip with low thermal resistance. The second one is the direct liquid cooling on the chip using 3D printed cooling geometries in complex shapes.”

While the imec efforts have not yet been commercialized companies already are offering similar designs according to Oprins.

Describing the origin of the imec prototype Oprins said “We leveraged our knowledge of wafer-to-wafer bonding to bond the cooler to the chip with a very low thermal resistance of less than 1 mm2-K/W. Thus instead of using a thermal interface material we can use fusion bonding or oxide bonding or metal bonding. The main advantage for semiconductor processing is that there could be strict tolerances with a very thin line.”

Oprins points to several issues. “For the mechanical integrity of your package you need to compensate for the absence of the lid with a stiffener ring” he said. “If you make the channels too small the pressure drop that you need to push your coolant through will be too high. You’re limited how small you can go with the liquids.”

However he noted that while higher pressure is a potential drawback it is not a show-stopper. “The main reasons for slow adoption are reliability concerns (leaks) the need for maintenance and system complexity.”

Oprins classified the current and proposed commercial approaches to liquid cooling into four distinct types:

Bolt-on cooler . This is the current state-of-the-art in data centers. A cold plate sits on top of the lid instead of a heatsink. TIMs are used above and below.

This configuration is beginning to be adopted in some places. The cooler is directly bonded to the chip with only one layer of thermal interface material. Imec’s prototype uses this layout with modifications.

Imec’s prototype uses this layout with modifications. Backside cooling. Only presented in research this layout allows the coolant to be closer to the heat source. Instead of bonding it uses a dielectric liquid that makes direct contact to the chip. Because there is a vertical connection between the liquid and the chip it avoids the thermal gradient problems of a lateral design.

Only presented in research this layout allows the coolant to be closer to the heat source. Instead of bonding it uses a dielectric liquid that makes direct contact to the chip. Because there is a vertical connection between the liquid and the chip it avoids the thermal gradient problems of a lateral design. In-chip cooling. This is the idea that Corintis is trying to commercialize. The coolant is contained within channels embedded in the chip. While it can offer optimal cooling one potential challenge is that there may not be enough space for channels at lower pitches.

In addition to this work Sam Sadri senior process engineer at QP Technologies recently showed off a prototype of an internally cooled package. Created with 3D technology it’s made of ceramic alumina that uses thick-film technology for top metallization onto which several SiC FETs will be attached.

“Alumina is already an oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) and copper oxidizes easily so the two oxides bond together and that’s how this interface is made” Sadri explained. “This is by far the cheapest way to build a power module with a ceramic. There are ways to further reduce the cost. An isolated metal substrate (IMS) basically is like any PCB fabrication technology but it uses heavy copper. While most PCB copper contains 0.25 to 0.5 ounces of copper this is closer to 3 or 4 ounces. This is what I’ve seen as far as something that’s more cost effective than alumina with the same footprint.”

The prototype’s dimensions are approximately 4″ x 2 ½” x ¾” deep. While it’s thicker than a typical substrate what makes this rectangular structure special is that it has channels that tunnel all the way through with exit holes on its shorter sides. “This is one of the coolest things I’ve seen in power” said Sadri. “When you power it up to full duty cycle the module puts out a lot of heat. How do you get rid of the heat? You send a coolant such as cold air nitrogen coolant or some other cold substance through the channels. As it is operating it’s also cooling down too.”

Improving TIMs

As shown above both bolt-on coolers and directly bonded coolers use TIMs to optimize heat conduction between the chip and cooler as do many other configurations. TIMs use a wide variety of materials that can include “thermal greases gap fillers insulating hardware materials thermal pads and films graphite pads and films thermal tapes phase change materials and thermal epoxies [as well as] thermally conductive ceramics e.g. aluminum oxide aluminum nitride and beryllium oxide” according to a recent review of cooling systems.5

Yet many TIMs turn out not to be as efficient as their widespread use would suggest. “Thermal interface materials become an important thermal bottleneck as the liquid cooling performance improves” said Oprins. “The system integrators have a lot of questions about how TIMs can be replaced by better performing materials and what the reliability risks are.”

The challenge is to discover a material that has very high thermal conductivity while at the same time being very pliant and soft so it can follow the topology of different components.

“Typically most materials that have good conductivity are also very rigid so not only will they not conform they can add to the stresses” Oprins explained. “You’re looking for a combination that’s difficult to find. So there will be no single material that will have these properties. Researchers will have to engineer one by making composites. For example instead of just using a silicone paste like in the past now there can be thermally conductive particles inside to increase the thermal performance. There can be composites. There even could be carbon nanotubes or graphene sheets. There’s a lot of advancement in that particular area. We started with the silicone based materials and eventually we will end up with metal-based thermal interface materials but there are a lot of reliability issues to be solved first.”

Given the urgent need for novel materials Amkor’s Whitchurch emphasized that all engineers should respect how crucial material science breakthroughs will be to solving thermal problems — and that the industry has a long way to go to find materials that can be flexible reliable and economical.

“We’re exploring many different TIMs which are no longer polymer-based” he said. “Things that used to be exotic are becoming less so like the sintered silver category and you end up with a very hard high thermal conductivity matrix of a silver alloy between lid and die. Another example would be softer metal materials such as ones based on indium. Gallium scares people because it reacts with aluminum so we haven’t seen as much of that kind of environment. A couple years ago we were talking frequently about phase change material but that seems to have died off as people realized the reliability and other advantages just weren’t there. The other things that I’ve seen like graphite pads they also have some engineering challenges that are too difficult to overcome. Graphite in a single direction is highly thermally conductive but actually getting that into a package is a difficult challenge.”

To get rid of the power in a flip chip package Sadri said “Traditionally a back side metallized SiC power FET die is attached to a heatsink using solder (e.g. AuSn). Today sintered silver epoxy has shown better thermals so folks use both pressureless (e.g. Atrox) or pressured sintered epoxy (Argomax). In a flip chip scenario a heatsink is designed with nickel-plated copper which kisses the back of the chip with thermal interface material (TIM) in the interface. Other innovations use a number of wires in the back of the chip and then land the wires on a ground plane in the PCB to improve thermals. Copper-tungsten and copper-moly are other types of heat sinks that folks like for the CTE match to silicon but they are expensive. Copper is still the best thermal interface and very cost effective.”

An alternative approach would eliminate the need for TIMs altogether which is one of the motivations behind imec’s work on microfluidics. “You want to find alternative cooling solutions so you can avoid the interface materials so that’s what we’re doing with the liquid cooling” said Oprins. “We want to bring it closer to the chip so we can eliminate these materials. I would say that’s the bottom line. You either improve the materials or you get rid of them.”

Conclusion

The result of these challenges is that solving thermal problems has increasingly moved up the list of budget priorities. “Customers are often surprised that they have to dedicate so much budget to thermals” Whitchurch said. “But in order for a package to simply work we’re all going to have to pay attention because ultimately a package that works is cheaper than a package that doesn’t work. We’re starting to see a lot of our customers come to those realizations and start to engage our more advanced engineering skill and experience for products that 10 years ago would never have shown up on my radar.”

Still change takes time. “The industry is very conservative” Oprins said. ”It takes a lot of convincing to switch to something they don’t know. Everything you introduce comes with a lot of complexity. I understand the reluctance to adopt something new until it’s proven to have worked and all the liability issues have been tackled. Nevertheless there are many great ideas out there. We know they still need a lot of work and we are looking for new recruits who can help.”

This federal research funding will complement existing large investments from the semiconductor industry which plows about one-fifth of revenue into research and development. Robust investments in research including semiconductor research are vital to maintaining our country’s technological edge according to the SIA and SRC.

“SRC is excited to select in close collaboration with our industry members Professor Tajana Rosing for the University Research Awards in semiconductor design” said Dr. Todd Younkin President and CEO of SRC a non-profit consortium that works with industry government and academia partners on university research on behalf of its members. “She joins a distinguished lineup of past award winners based on their incredible contributions into the semiconductor industry.”

Rosing is the director of the System Energy Efficiency Lab at UC San Diego. Her research interests are in energy-efficient computing cyber-physical and distributed systems. Inspired by the human brain Rosing’s research work on hyperdimensional computing systems has been accelerated using GPUs field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and processing in memory and storage to handle high-dimensional vectors in data-intensive applications including for genomics COVID-19 analysis mass spectrometry machine learning recommendation systems and many other applications.

Her approaches are delivering impressive accuracy in learning from big data with excellent performance extreme energy efficiency and robustness.

Her work has also had practical applications to optimizing data analysis both in the cloud at the edge and in the Internet of Things resulting in systems that are significantly more energy efficient. Her recent projects include federated and distributed learning in the Internet of Things optimization and deployment of sensing and actuation for the Smart Cities power thermal and reliability management for the datacenters and mobile systems and many others.

Rosing is a fellow of both Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZmVkdGVjaG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMTEvbmlzdC1vdXRsaW5lcy03LW9wcG9ydHVuaXRpZXMtdXMtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NIST Outlines 7 Opportunities for U.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing,"1. Update Metrology for Material Purity Properties and Provenance

New metrology — the science of measurement and its applications — is needed to meet increasingly stringent requirements for semiconductor material purity physical properties and provenance (​​which records the journey of a material from production to end use) across a diverse supply chain.

Even microscopic defects or inadequacies can severely limit the performance of next-generation devices. Plus different manufacturers may not have the same standards for accuracy in measurements or may have different assessment methods.

NIST calls for the development of measurement technologies properties data and standards focused on defect and contaminant identification. The goal is to support uniform material quality and traceability across the supply chain.

2. Developing Advanced Metrology for Future Microelectronics

The challenge here is to make sure that critical metrology advances keep pace with cutting-edge and future microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing. Complex 3D devices are being incorporated more often and the metrology tools needed to measure them are often expensive and contain capability gaps.

NIST’s solution is to develop advanced physical and computational metrology tools that are adaptable to the next-generation manufacturing of advanced complex integrated technologies and systems.

3. Enabling Metrology for Integrating Advanced Packaging Components

Advanced packaging is key in microelectronics. This involves enabling different devices to be integrated and packaged together to meet application-specific requirements. The materials and processes used to create advanced packaging impact metrology and inspection.

Nonstandard materials may impact inspection requirements and advanced packaging presents unique measurements for back-end processes and technologies.

NIST proposes R&D to develop metrology to enable the integration of sophisticated components and new materials to support the domestic advanced microelectronics packaging industry.

4. Reviewing Semiconductor Materials Designs and Components

Modeling and simulation are used in the semiconductor industry to reduce development time. However next-generation semiconductor materials and devices will require advanced metrology tools to be modeled and simulated effectively.

More complex future technologies will test the limits of current systems and may cause reductions in performance and accuracy.

The proposed solution is to create advanced design simulators using multiphysics models and next-generation concepts such as artificial intelligence and digital twins."

What You Need to Know Theranos founder Elizabeth Homes has been sentenced to 11 years and three months in federal prison.

Holmes was convicted on four counts of fraud and conspiracy for defrauding Theranos investors.

The company promoted blood-testing technology that didn't work with backing from high-profile. investors

The scandal was described in the book Bad Blood and the TV series The Dropout.

""I stand before you taking responsibility for Theranos."" a tearful Holmes told U.S. District Judge Edward Davila shortly before he sentenced her according to media reports from the courthouse. """"I am devastated by my failings. I have felt deep pain for what people went through because I failed them. To investors patients I am sorry."" Holmes had maintained a stoic demeanor throughout the trial and much of the sentencing hearing.

A jury convicted Holmes on Jan. 3 of three counts of wire fraud and one of wire fraud conspiracy for bilking investors as Theranos founder and CEO. She was acquitted of four similar charges of defrauding patients. One count of fraud related to a patient was dismissed during trial and a jury couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on three other charges of investor fraud.



Holmes the mother of a one-year-old child who is pregnant had sought a sentence of home confinement and community service and no more than 18 months of prison. Prosecutors requested 15 years of prison and restitution of $804 million. Holmes' probation officer recommended a sentence of nine years. She's due to surrender to authorities on April 27.

The sentencing which brought a media circus to the steps of the federal courthouse in San Jose California shines an unwelcome spotlight on Silicon Valley's venture capitalists just as they're in the news again for backing bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Trevor Milton another company founder backed by respected financial institutions was convicted in October of three charges of fraud for misleading Nikola Corp. (NKLA) investors shortly after the electric truck developer's initial public offering. Former Theranos Chief Operating Officer Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani Holmes' former boyfriend faces a Dec. 7 sentencing on 10 counts of fraud and two of conspiracy for defrauding investors as well as patients.

Like many startup founders including Elon Musk and Sam Bankman-Fried Holmes promoted the image of a trailblazing wunderkind. She was 19 when she founded the company that would become Theranos. As documented in Bad Blood the bestseller by the Wall Street Journal reporter who uncovered the fraud at Theranos and in the Hulu series The Dropout Holmes secured funding from Silicon Valley elite including Oracle Corp. (ORCL) founder Larry Ellison despite lacking the technical skills to deliver the technology she championed.

""The watchword in the industry has been fake it until you make it"" NBC News legal analyst Dean Johnson told television viewers.

As CEO Holmes regularly wore black turtlenecks in imitation of Steve Jobs. During her sentencing hearing the prosecution noted she once wrote ""They don't put attractive people like me in jail."" During the trial lawyers for Holmes argued Balwani abused her and controlled her every move as CEO. Defense lawyers submitted more than 140 letters to the judge ahead of the sentencing from her family and friends including U.S. Senator Cory Booker.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yODEyODQ3L2ludGVncmF0aW9uLXNvZnR3YXJlLWFzLWEtc2VydmljZS1tYXJrZXQtaXMtYm9vbWluZy13b3JsZHdpZGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Integration Software as a Service Market Is Booming Worldwide | Celigo Mulesoft Adaptris Boomi,"Integration Software as a Service Market Is Booming Worldwide | Celigo Mulesoft Adaptris Boomi

Ball which makes aluminium packaging examined consumer attitudes in the UK US Mexico Brazil France and Germany. When asked about household and personal care product packaging 38% of UK respondents said they were most impressed by claims that a product ‘uses less plastic’.

Victoria Marletta commercial vice-president at Ball Aerosol Packaging (BAP) said:“As consumers continue to demonstrate a growing preference for environmentally friendly products there is an incredible opportunity for household and personal care brands to introduce innovative packaging options that are better for the planet.""

Concern about plastic was significant in all the other countries surveyed with more than 1500 participants in total but no other placed it top of the list.

UK legislators have recently called for a total ban on plastic exports noting that the country creates around 2.5 million tonnes a year of plastic packaging waste 60% of which is exported.

Greenpeace this week launched a petition urging the Government to fix what it called the UK’s ""plastic waste crisis"" saying that only 12% is currently being recycled.

In Ball's survey the desire for reduced plastic use was narrowly ahead of ‘better for the ocean’ cited by 37% of UK consumers while ‘circular economy’ was chosen by 16% of respondents and ‘closed loop’ by only 9%.

Among respondents 68% wanted household product packaging in environmentally friendly formats to be more readily available and easier to purchase.

SANTA CLARA Calif. Nov. 17 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks® (NASDAQ: PANW) the global cybersecurity leader announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Cider Security (Cider) a pioneer in application security (AppSec) and software supply chain security. The proposed acquisition supports Palo Alto Networks Prisma® Cloud's platform approach to securing the entire application security lifecycle from code to cloud. Combined with its recently announced Software Composition Analysis (SCA) capabilities Prisma Cloud will now provide the industry's most comprehensive supply chain security solution as part of its code-to-cloud security platform.

The diversity velocity and dynamic nature of today's software engineering ecosystem have introduced a wide array of new security challenges and gaps which have made the software supply chain one of the biggest emerging attack vectors for cyber attackers. The average CI/CD pipeline can have hundreds of developer tools connected to it which poses an enormous security risk. While much attention has been put on where code comes from very little has been placed on the applications and software used in the development pipeline.

""Any organization using public cloud has an application infrastructure with hundreds of tools and applications that can access their code and yet they have limited visibility to their configuration or if they are secured"" says Lee Klarich Chief Product Officer for Palo Alto Networks. ""Cider has made it possible to connect into infrastructure analyze the tools and identify the risks as well as how to remediate them. We are acquiring Cider for their innovation that will help enable Prisma Cloud to provide this capability that anyone doing cloud operations has to have.""

""We designed an AppSec platform that allows engineering to continue to move fast without making compromises on security. It's only fitting that we join Palo Alto Networks a company built upon landmark cybersecurity 'firsts'. There couldn't be a better fit for Cider"" said Guy Flechter CEO at Cider Security. ""By scanning and securing the CI/CD pipeline we can help identify where there may be vulnerabilities in your code. Prisma Cloud will now be the ultimate solution for code to cloud security.""

Under the terms of the agreement Palo Alto Networks will acquire Cider Security for approximately $195 million in cash excluding the value of replacement equity awards subject to adjustment. The proposed acquisition is expected to close during Palo Alto Networks' second quarter of fiscal 2023 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financials.

Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud is the industry's most complete cloud-native application protection platform  an early mover in the cloud security space revolutionizing how organizations protect their multi-cloud environments with a platform approach rather than relying on multiple disparate cloud security products. A year ago Prisma Cloud ""shifted left"" with the release of Cloud Code Security which has been amongst Prisma Cloud's fastest adopted modules. This was followed up with the September 2022 release of context-aware SCA. Cider furthers Prisma Cloud's mission by unifying Cloud and Application Security with a unique approach that cannot be achieved by point solutions.

The deal valued at $195 million is expected to close before February 2023. In addition to the acquisition Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora (pictured above) also touted the company's continued financial momentum along with early XSIAM partner and customer traction.

The Palo Alto Networks-Cider Security announcement is technology M&A deal number 962 that MSSP Alert and sister site ChannelE2E have covered so far in 2022.

Rumors about Palo Alto Networks potentially acquiring Cider Security had swirled since around October 2022 (see item A1 here).

Application Security Supply Chain Security: Cider Business Background

Cider Security founded in late 2020 is based in Tel Aviv Israel. The company has 94 employees listed on LinkedIn. Co-founders Guy Flechter and Daniel Krivelevich previously held key posts at LivePerson.

Cider Security in March 2022 raised $38 million in Series A funding led by Tiger Global Management. At the time Cider's AppSec software was ""already in use with dozens of global companies"" -- though the security company did not disclose any revenue figures associated with those deployments.

Cider Security's technology will align with Palo Alto Networks' Prisma Cloud as part of a supply chain security solution and code-to-cloud security platform the buyer said.

Palo Alto Networks Acquires Cider Security: Executive Perspectives

In a prepared statement about the deal Lee Klarich chief product officer for Palo Alto Networks said:

""Any organization using public cloud has an application infrastructure with hundreds of tools and applications that can access their code and yet they have limited visibility to their configuration or if they are secured. Cider has made it possible to connect into infrastructure analyze the tools and identify the risks as well as how to remediate them. We are acquiring Cider for their innovation that will help enable Prisma Cloud to provide this capability that anyone doing cloud operations has to have.""

Added Guy Flechter CEO at Cider Security:

""We designed an AppSec platform that allows engineering to continue to move fast without making compromises on security. It's only fitting that we join Palo Alto Networks a company built upon landmark cybersecurity 'firsts'. There couldn't be a better fit for Cider. By scanning and securing the CI/CD pipeline we can help identify where there may be vulnerabilities in your code. Prisma Cloud will now be the ultimate solution for code to cloud security.""

Palo Alto Networks has maintained steady M&A activity. Noteworthy acquisitions include:

Palo Alto Networks: Financial Performance

Meanwhile Palo Alto Networks also disclosed Q1 financial results for fiscal 2023. Among the metrics to note:

Revenue was $1.6 billion up 25% compared to the corresponding quarter last year.

Net income of $20 million compared to a net loss of $103.6 million.

The figures generally beat Wall Street's expectations. Moreover the security company raised its financial forecast for the current fiscal year -- which suggests certain security market leaders continue to overcome economic and recession concerns.

Autonomous Security: Early XSIAM Partner and Customer Momentum

On the partner front Palo Alto Networks continues to tout autonomous security operations opportunities. The effort involves XSIAM -- which is short for Extended Security Intelligence & Automation Management.

Palo Alto Networks positions XSIAM which is now generally available to disrupt the traditional SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) market. Describing XSIAM partner and customer momentum CEO Nikesh Arora (pictured top) said:

""Most recently we've had two multimillion-dollar commitments from XSIAM design partners as they expanded into production deployments. At this point the majority of our design customers have transitioned to paying customers. In fact we are carefully managing how we onboard future XSIAM customers because we want to ensure fast customer time to value. Our interest list is north of 50 customers who would like us to deploy XSIAM. We're qualifying them and carefully onboarding them so that we can scale the business appropriately and give them value.""

The deal is “approximately $195 million in cash excluding the value of replacement equity awards subject to adjustment” ($300 million is the total value per our sources) and is expected to close in Q2 of fiscal 2023.

“Any organization using public cloud has an application infrastructure with hundreds of tools and applications that can access their code and yet they have limited visibility to their configuration or if they are secured” says Lee Klarich Chief Product Officer for Palo Alto Networks. “Cider has made it possible to connect into infrastructure analyze the tools and identify the risks as well as how to remediate them.

Our original article from earlier today:

More consolidation is afoot in the world of cybersecurity. TechCrunch has learned from sources that Palo Alto Networks is going to be announcing the acquisition of Cider Security for $200 million in cash and a further $100 million in shares. The deal has been rumored for weeks but we understand that investors have now been informed and staff is also being looped in on the deal which will be made official when Palo Alto reports its earnings later today.

Palo Alto has not responded to our request for comment.

Cider Security based out of Israel is one of a number of companies that focuses on application security which includes not just technology to monitor malicious or suspicious activity around live applications in the cloud but observability of the full ecosystem around those applications specifically code deployments and other kinds of modifications and updates covering code CI/CD and the wider supply chain around those apps.

The company had raised $44 million from investors that included Tiger Global and Glilot Capital Partners — representing a decent exit for them at a time when valuations are seeing a lot of pressure and many investors (including Tiger) have made drastic mark-downs in some of their holdings.

That’s not to say that prices are buoyant here: One source tells us that Palo Alto may well publicize this as a $200 million cash deal with the $100 million share part disclosed later in order not to alarm the market.

Palo Alto Networks currently has a market cap of close to $47 billion. Relatively speaking while it has been hit like other tech companies by a dropping share price it has seen significantly less volatility and decline than some of its more valuable bigger consumer-facing counterparts. The company has made a number of acquisitions over the years to expand its reach in the market but this appears to be the first and only one in 2022 (the two most recent before this are Expanse and BridgeCrew respectively for $800 million in 2020 and $156 million in 2021).

Palo Alto already has a division that focuses on application security which was in part formed by way of acquisitions. Evident.io which it acquired in 2018 for $300 million forms the basis of its Prisma Cloud business which is focused on end-to-end application security. Cider will bring Palo Alto a product built from the ground up envisioning more holistic observability and communication between engineers and security teams.

Notably along with the rumors of this Cider deal it had been reported that Palo Alto Networks had been eyeing another application security startup Apiiro Security; however reports claim that PA “walked away” due to a much higher price tag of $600 million. Interestingly Apiiro looks like it is set to go it alone for now: just earlier this month it announced a $100 million round of funding.

Cloud security and application security specifically continue to be hot areas in the enterprise IT world not least because the high amount of network activity and systems exposure both make the space vulnerable to attacks. It was estimated to be a market worth some $6.2 billion in 2020 and it’s growing fast."

We’ve been hearing that phrasing quite a bit over the past few months as media congloms have been thinning out their top executive ranks and targeting efficiencies to improve their balance sheets in a time when the effects from the pandemic are being exacerbated by the impact of the economic slowdown high inflation and a looming recession.

CBS president and CEO George Cheeks used the “restructuring and streamlining” language in his memos yesterday announcing the exits of Kelly Kahl a 26-year CBS veteran who is stepping down as President of CBS Entertainment and Thom Sherman who is departing as Senior EVP of Programming. (While Sherman had been at CBS for 5.5 years he had been with the larger company for 16.5 years having previously worked at the CW which until recently was a joint venture between CBS and Warner Bros.)

Last month another top exec from the CBS part of Paramount Global Showtime Chairman and CEO David Nevins exited after 12 years. And the month before Jo Ann Ross a 30-year CBS veteran also stepped down. No outside executives have been brought in as replacements with Nevins’ duties divvied up among other top Paramount Global execs including Cheeks Ross’ role as President of Paramount Advertising taken over by COO John Halley while Kahl and Sherman’s positions were consolidated into one Entertainment President which will be held by CBS head of current Amy Reisenbach.

That plays into the notion that Paramount Global has been top-heavy especially post-merger with multiple senior executives at the highest level in various areas.

Kicked off by Ross’ exit the ad sales restructuring continued yesterday with layoffs of close to 100 employees. The move of Paramount TV Studios previously overseen by Nevins to Cheeks’ portfolio where it joins CBS Studios also is expected to result in layoffs at both studios largely in business and other non-creative areas with the two development teams remaining separate.

“We have always been mindful of cost management as a company and we are now taking additional steps to improve efficiency across our organization” Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said on the company’s recent quarterly earnings call following soft financial results citing the current ad market downturn.

Bakish has been advocating closer cooperation across divisions which he hopes some of the recent moves would help with.

“This change has also given us the opportunity to more closely align our studios networks and streaming operations as we execute on our vision and strategy for the future” he said following Nevins’ exit.

Paramount Global is not the only company that has been slimming down and long-time TV executives have been departing at a steady pace across the industry. Just weeks ago we saw the exit of the CW CEO and Chairman Mark Pedowitz after 11.5 years. And while CBS went from two Kahl and Sherman to one executive at the helm of its entertainment division that is still more than the other two Big 3 broadcast networks amid an ongoing decline in linear viewing. Neither ABC nor NBC have a dedicated programming executive for the broadcast network with Craig Erwich overseeing both ABC and Hulu’s original programming (as well as Disney Branded Entertainment) and Susan Rovner shepherding both NBC and Peacock.

In the case of Paramount there are likely other factors too. Ross Nevins Kahl and Sherman were the last remaining top-level executives on the CBS side of the company who had not been appointed by Bakish or someone hired by him but by former CBS CEO Les Moonves.

Additionally Cheeks did not make any major executive changes when he joined then-ViacomCBS at the start of 2020. He is now putting his own stamp with Reisenbach’s promotion which could bring a creative shift at the network.

CBS has done well maintaining its title as the most watched broadcast network for 14 straight seasons. Beyond outlier Ghosts the other successful new scripted additions during Kahl and Sherman’s tenure have been procedurals and spinoffs from established franchises including FBI FBI: Most Wanted and FBI: International The Equalizer NCIS: Hawai’i and new breakout Fire Country as well as traditional multi-camera sitcoms The Neighborhood Bob ♥ Abishola and Ghosts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvcGFyYW1vdW50LWdsb2JhbC1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktb2YtaGlwLWhvcC0zMDE2ODE3NDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paramount Global Celebrates 50th Anniversary of Hip Hop,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvcGFyYW1vdW50LWdsb2JhbC1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktb2YtaGlwLWhvcC0zMDE2ODE3NDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60F1D9240>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvcGFyYW1vdW50LWdsb2JhbC1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktb2YtaGlwLWhvcC0zMDE2ODE3NDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtYXJrZXRlci5jb20vY29udGVudC9wYXJhbW91bnQtZmFjZXMtcmVzdHJ1Y3R1cmluZy1hbWlkLWluY3JlYXNlZC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1zdHJlYW1pbmctYWQtZG9sbGFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paramount faces restructuring amid increased competition for streaming ad dollars,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtYXJrZXRlci5jb20vY29udGVudC9wYXJhbW91bnQtZmFjZXMtcmVzdHJ1Y3R1cmluZy1hbWlkLWluY3JlYXNlZC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1zdHJlYW1pbmctYWQtZG9sbGFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E612173820>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtYXJrZXRlci5jb20vY29udGVudC9wYXJhbW91bnQtZmFjZXMtcmVzdHJ1Y3R1cmluZy1hbWlkLWluY3JlYXNlZC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1zdHJlYW1pbmctYWQtZG9sbGFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGxib2FyZC5jb20vcHJvL3BhcmFtb3VudC1oaXAtaG9wLTUwLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXByb2dyYW1taW5nLXBsYW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paramount's Plans for Hip-Hop's 50th Anniversary,"Already looking ahead to 2023 Paramount Global is announcing a cross-brand partnership involving its broadcast cable streaming and digital brands to commemorate the 50th anniversary of hip-hop.

In a recent court filing Paycom asked an Oklahoma court to order the release of information that could directly and indirectly identify specific individuals who accessed free-market materials from OCPA.

The company’s request echoed the legal strategies used by segregationists targeting the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1950s Alabama.

However an Oklahoma County district judge denied Paycom’s request to compel OCPA to reveal the potentially personally identifying information of its supporters or those who follow OCPA’s work finding it was not relevant.

In a Sept. 2 motion Paycom’s attorneys at McAfee & Taft asked a judge to order OCPA to identify “all email addresses” of individuals who sign up for OCPA’s newsletters who might have received a March 23 2020 story that briefly mentioned the public political advocacy of Paycom’s CEO who called for broader COVID shutdowns in Oklahoma.

The company also asked the court to order OCPA to identify how many individual IP addresses accessed the news story on OCPA’s website.

OCPA objected to those requests noting OCPA’s member list is protected by the First Amendment and the information is immaterial to Paycom’s lawsuit. Paycom claims it has lost business due to OCPA publicizing the public political stance of the company’s CEO. OCPA’s response noted that Paycom can already determine if it lost business because of its CEO’s political activity by simply contacting its former clients.

OCPA’s response noted that Paycom “appears to be engaging in a speculative fishing expedition” in order to “harass both OCPA and those individuals who choose to associate with OCPA” and in the process subvert “clear precedent protecting against this very circumstance.”

“Without limitation to the free rein which Paycom requests with the identity of OCPA’s supporters the inevitable effect of producing such to an adverse party—particularly one specializing in individual’s personal data management—is a chilling effect of the desire to associate and deems privacy no longer essential or worthy of protection” OCPA’s response stated.

Paycom’s request had parallels to a 1950s case in which the state of Alabama sought to force the release of the identities of individual donors to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) at a time the NAACP was working to overturn segregation laws.

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. State of Alabama ultimately went before the U.S. Supreme Court which sided with the NAACP and ruled that “privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association.”

Paycom and its CEO Chad Richison have been active in Oklahoma state politics in recent years.

In a public letter released in March 2020 Richison called for temporary closure of a range of businesses “which includes but is not limited to hair salons nail salons spas and massage parlors” as part of the state’s COVID response. He also endorsed requiring grocery stores to provide “drive-thru pick up or delivery for all customers” and mandating that undefined “critical” businesses be required to coordinate “with state government.” Richison also called on state government to mandate how “food preparation and other critical portions of the supply chain” are handled under undefined “newly established uniform standards to prevent transmission of the virus.” Richison also called for postponement of so-called unspecified “elective surgeries” and endorsed having the government collect “all essential medical supplies” normally used for those surgeries or by “med spas and other medical organizations.” And Richison called for a ban on “all non-essential” travel from Oklahoma airports.

In a 2021 earnings call Richison indicated the COVID-19 pandemic financially benefited his company by prompting more businesses to use providers like Paycom.

Paycom sued the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs after OCPA published a news story that briefly referenced Richison’s March 2020 demands and linked to his public letter.

Paycom officials were also active in this year’s gubernatorial race providing financial support to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Joy Hofmeister. Public records show several individuals working for Paycom or sharing an address with a Paycom employee—including Paycom CEO Chad Richison and Charis Richison—were financial backers of Hofmeister’s campaign.

During the campaign tens of millions of dollars were spent by nebulous special-interest organizations on ads attacking incumbent Gov. Kevin Stitt. Many of those groups are not required to disclose their donors and it is not known if or to what degree Paycom officials helped fund the attack ads.

Former U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts who now sits on Paycom’s board of directors did an ad for one of the outside groups in which he endorsed Hofmeister. A recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows that Paycom has provided Watts $311720 in total annual compensation as a board member including $86750 paid in cash and $224970 in stock awards.

In an election-night tweet A.J. Griffin director of government and community affairs for Paycom suggested voters living outside Oklahoma City and Tulsa are retrograde thinkers holding the state back.

Stitt carried 74 of Oklahoma’s 77 counties while Hofmeister prevailed only in Oklahoma Cleveland and Tulsa counties. Griffin responded by tweeting a meme of one individual (labeled “voters in OKC and Tulsa”) physically dragging another individual (labeled the “rest of Oklahoma”) into a car that was labeled the “21st Century.”

But I wrote last week’s column to tee up the thing I actually want to talk about: the long-term plan to make Twitter less dependent on advertising.

On October 29th Musk pal Jason Calacanis said on his podcast All-In “There’s no doubt that I think Elon can turn this around pretty quickly and make it massively profitable.” Even when he said it it wasn’t quite true. Elon Musk already had a foray in media: the notable failure Thud which apparently never had a plan to be profitable. After the events of the last couple weeks I feel like I’m dunking on Calacanis just by quoting him. But whatever we’re less than a month in and it’s possible that in the long term Calacanis is right so I am going to do my best to take this all seriously.

Here is something else Calacanis said that I am attempting to take seriously:

I think making everything verified and a path to verification which Elon has talked about publicly many times and payments which he has talked about publicly many times just those two things alone could make the experience of being on Twitter absolutely delightful. If everybody could verify themselves this thing could turn around quickly.

Musk has a history with verifying users. He was bad at it.

Well I think we all know how the Twitter Blue experiment went — canceled after two days! — but in fairness to Calacanis that is not quite the same thing as verification. Musk is going to take another crack at it later. I hope it will be better because I truly do love Twitter unfortunately and I would prefer not to see some arrogant out-of-touch Gen Xers drive it into the ground because they aren’t ready to deal with two generations of internet zooborns. On the other hand you know there is something karmically correct about Twitter trolling itself out of existence.

So let’s discuss verification! Musk has a history with verifying users. He was bad at it.

The entities that bought Twitter X Holdings were a reference to X.com a business Musk started in 1999. That was when Musk “began to hone his trademark style of entering an ultracomplex business and not letting the fact that he knew very little about the industry’s nuances bother him in the slightest” writes Ashlee Vance in his Musk biography. “He had an inkling that the bankers were doing finance all wrong and that he could run the business better than everyone else.”

X.com sounds like an early version of a super app with electronic payments checking accounts stock trades and mutual funds. A lot of X.com’s ideas seem ahead of its time like being able to use an email address to send payments. Customers got a $20 bonus on a cash card when they signed up and $10 for everyone they referred — and there were no overdraft fees Vance writes. If you are thinking hmm that sounds like a business that’s hemorrhaging money you are right!

“A runaway fraud problem”

At X Musk dodged “know your customer” rules which require banks to make sure you are who you say you are. “Of course there was nothing stopping X’s customers from lying about who they were and where they lived when they signed up for an account which they did all the time” writes Max Chafkin in his biography of Peter Thiel the other PayPal mogul. “Every day the mail carrier would stop at 394 University and deliver a giant bag of letters that X had sent to its customers that having arrived at fake addresses had been returned to sender.”

X shared office space with Thiel’s company Confinity which developed PayPal. The two money-losing companies eventually merged but that didn’t help what Thiel called “a runaway fraud problem” in a speech at a 2015 conference held by the Center on Capitalism and Society:

Years ago I was thinking of doing a book on PayPal and the working title I had for it was Risky Business and the whole thing was how we went from one frightening insane risk after another. The chapter title on Elon — at the time Elon Musk was working with us very closely we sort of combined two companies — was going to be entitled “The Man Who Knew Nothing About Risk” ... We had decided to give credit cards to absolutely anybody who wanted them. You got a up to $10000 credit limit. Elon had told the woman who was rolling the service out that he wanted a million people to be using the new credit card by the end of the year. Fortunately it was about two levels down from the front page and so not that many people were able to discover this. Some people did; they wrote us back and said “This is fantastic I haven’t had credit in years. I can’t believe you’re offering me credit. I haven’t even had a checking account in 10 years.” These were people who wrote so many bad checks that banks wouldn’t allow them to have checking accounts. It turned out we ended up with something like a 50 percent charge-back rate. The worst subprime companies were like 4 to 6 percent. Then happily we rolled that product back very quickly.

Anyway Thiel did a coup and booted Musk from the CEO job in 2000. The company got renamed for its successful product PayPal.

Okay but that was more than 20 years ago and we’ve all learned things since then. For instance in 1999 I had a learner’s permit and now I have a driver’s license! Let’s see what Musk has learned about payment companies.

What has Musk said so far about Twitter and payments?

At Musk’s first meeting with Twitter employees he did discuss his ambitions to make Twitter a place for payments. It’s a “high priority!” More to the point:

I think there’s this transformative opportunity in payments. And payments really are just the exchange of information. From an information standpoint not a huge difference between say just sending a direct message and sending a payment. They are basically the same thing. In principle you can use a direct messaging stack for payments. And so that’s definitely a direction we’re going to go in enabling people on Twitter to be able to send money anywhere in the world instantly and in real time. We just want to make it as useful as possible.

In that speech Musk indicates that he’s aware of the possibilities of people buying credit card information and scamming so that’s good! But he also says he’s going to recycle his old plans for user acquisition saying that in order to acquire users he’s going to “give them some amount of money like 10 bucks or something that they can send anywhere in the system.”

Twitter needs money transfer licenses for that which Musk says he’s applied for. But his ambitions sound bigger than just payments — he wants high-yield money market accounts “so that having a Twitter balance is the highest-yield thing that you can do” he says. And you know debit cards and checks and maybe eventually loans. But payments Musk says would make Twitter more friendly to e-commerce.

The creator economy... on Twitter?

One sort of obvious way to make payments make sense on Twitter is to leverage the creator economy. Right now it’s hard to monetize on Twitter though Tips and Super Follows exist and may be one way to do it.

So I called up Hank Green YouTuber and CEO of Complexly — in other words a creator economy OG who knows an awful lot about the business end of it all. I asked him what he thought about Twitter as it stands right now and he told me “Thinking about Twitter in a rational economics way would lead you not to make content on Twitter. There’s more downside than upside and a lot of people with reputations to protect left over the last 10 years.”

“I’ll watch a hockey highlight or Chris Hayes say something but if it’s more than a minute you’ve gotta give me a good reason to watch that.”

If you have a large enough audience you can market things on Twitter but the conversion rate is sort of terrible and everyone knows it Green says. But that’s also true of regular marketing. Still “the customer acquisition costs on Twitter are higher and that’s why you don’t see the same kind of ads on Twitter as you do on Instagram” he says.

Musk has talked about rebuilding Vine an early video platform Twitter developed to compete with TikTok. One way to lure content creators away from TikTok (or YouTube or Instagram) is to make it easier for them to make a living perhaps through payments. But Vine as it was isn’t great for that because the videos aren’t long enough. The reason YouTube is still king in terms of revenue for creators is that you can make 10-minute videos running preroll and midroll advertising.

But since Twitter is primarily a text product videos are not what people come to the service for. “I’ll watch a hockey highlight or Chris Hayes say something but if it’s more than a minute you’ve gotta give me a good reason to watch that” Green says.

You can imagine Musk creating like a Vine tab that lives within the app. But that has its own problems — specifically copyright. You need a content ID system that prevents people from using an unauthorized Britney Spears song or something because otherwise you are In Trouble with the record labels. You can ban all Britney on the platform but users will hate that. And also users are going to set videos to Britney no matter what — so enjoy the record labels’ lawyers I guess. Better to make a deal like TikTok to let users create videos with snippets of music. But will the labels be into it? “I don’t think they’re going to take a meeting with Twitter unless and until they build something big” Green says.

And to compete with YouTube he’s going to need to figure out how to beat that 55 percent revenue split while also making money to pay off the $1 billion in annual interest payments that Musk’s acquisition saddled the company with.

Twitter also has to be stable enough to let people build businesses there

Meanwhile the overall advertising slowdown has hit the creator economy which has never been through a recession. The creator economy in its current form started to take shape in 2009 or so Green says. “That’s when the upswing began and it’s been on cocaine ever since the cocaine of zero percent interest rates.” Those days are over! So it’s not clear what a recession would do to people who build businesses on social media.

There is a place where Twitter has an advantage though — and it’s over Discord. Right now there’s a plug-and-play setup with Patreon where you can pay to get access to your favorite creator’s Discord. The problem with Discord is that it requires extensive do-it-yourself moderation. Twitter however is a one-to-many communication service. That might be more attractive for people who don’t want to spend a lot of time on community moderation Green says.

If Musk can figure out a way to make inroads into the creator economy that could maybe bring people to the platform in a way that’s cheaper than the $10 sign-up bonus he’s proposed. Most creators’ fans want them to continue to be able to make stuff and are willing to pay to support that. If there’s a way to keep the most fun prolific Twitter users on the platform — either by paying them directly or by letting their fans pay them — I can imagine a world in which that creates a revenue stream that makes Twitter less dependent on advertising.

But Twitter also has to be stable enough to let people build businesses there and the chaos of the last few weeks is scary for any business owner. Creators routinely complain about algorithm changes on YouTube or Instagram hurting their business! Recently and famously the Kardashians complained so loudly that they reversed a product change on Instagram precisely because it was bad for their business. Substituting creators for advertisers means that Musk has a different set of constituents to make happy.

Crypto???

When I wrote up my stupid little outline for this story last week I thought it might be nice to end on a hopeful note. So I was going to say something about how crypto Twitter is actually growing. And in Musk’s texts to his brother Kimbal he says “I think a new social media company is needed that is based on a blockchain and includes payments.”

In this vision users pay a “tiny amount” to register their messages on a blockchain. (Musk thinks this will cut out “the vast majority of spam and bots”; I disagree and I think the recent hijinks around Twitter Blue prove my point but whatever.) I can sort of imagine this like a blockchain Venmo — where part of the fun is watching other people transact. Make a UI that’s friendly and onboard the normies sure why not!

“As the saying goes invest in the products you use. (Not financial advice).”

After all one of the Twitter investors Musk enticed was Changpeng “CZ” Zhao — a crypto world heavy hitter. “Twitter is a platform I use heavily” Zhao wrote in a thread explaining the investment. “As the saying goes invest in the products you use. (Not financial advice).” He also didn’t seem too concerned about a roadmap saying “Don’t ask me about a plan. Never had a plan for Binance. Entrepreneurs don’t plan.”

I was planning to engage with this seriously when FTX melted down and I think that alone has changed the risk/reward profile of the kind of network Musk is proposing. Part of that is my suspicion that regulators will be coming hot and heavy for anything that is even a little bit cryptocurrency-related. But more significantly Zhao is now a direct target for regulators in the US because of his role in the debacle. That makes it riskier to lean on his expertise to develop the kind of blockchain-based network Musk was proposing — I imagine that any regulators looking to put Zhao’s head on a spike will start by investigating any US-based entity close to him."

Mauro Porcini is PepsiCo’s first ever Chief Design Officer and the 2022 Laureate of The American Prize for Design. Given in conjunction with The Chicago Athenaeum’s historic Good Design Awards The American Prize for Design honors a specific design practitioner with the highest public accolade for producing design that promotes design excellence innovation and lasting design.

He joined the food & beverage corporation in 2012 and in said role he is infusing design thinking into PepsiCo’s culture and is leading a new approach to innovation by design that impacts the company’s product platforms and brands which include Pepsi Lay’s Mountain Dew Gatorade Sodastream Doritos Lifewtr bubly Aquafina Cheetos Quaker 7Up Mirinda amongst many others.

His focus extends from physical to virtual expressions of the brands including product packaging events advertising fashion and art collaborations retail activation architecture and digital media. He leads teams based in New York City Purchase Dallas Chicago Los Angeles Orlando Miami London Dublin Moscow Il Cairo New Delhi Shanghai Bangkok Mexico City Sao Paulo and Cape Town.

In this conversation with Pavlos Amperiadis Publisher of Global Design News Mauro explains his thinking behind his new book ‘The Human Side of Innovation: The Power of People in Love with People’ and unveils secrets on human-centricity innovation and design thinking.

A “unicorn” combines vision curiosity and innovative thinking with respect kindness and optimism

GDN: Hi Mauro is this your home office? Because it looks magnificent!

Mauro: Yes this is my home workspace in New York and we are so happy about the weather being sunny here in November.

But should we be happy or alarmed about it?

GDN: Mauro would you be able to explain to our readers the aim of your latest publication ‘Human Side of Innovation: The Power of People in Love with People? ‘

Mauro: I have always been interested in philosophy literature and writing. It felt that now it is the right time for me mentally to sit down and write with all my heart and not feeling that I need to do it with a deadline.

In reality the concept and ideas have been circulating in my mind for years and I have been designing the structure of it the last three years.

I didn’t want it to be an endorsement or a milestone of my career but rather a truthful exploration of my ideas that can help people in the design profession and outside.



The aim is to express the idea of “people in love with people” and how innovation is deeply rooted in this idea. It has also been the right time for me because of emotional stability with my wife Carlotta and our family. It felt like I finally have enough clarity to write a book now.

In school I would like my son to have classes on kindness on optimism on respect; to be taught to be curious but also empathetic

GDN: How important is it to localize the design process to specific cultures internationally and celebrate them?

Mauro: This is what we call the “Glocal Approach” in PepsiCo in our attempt to combine the global reach of our organization and the respect for local cultures globally.

A characteristic example is when I designed the Lay’s campaign to localize the packages but also flavors to be specially influenced by different cultures of the world.

For example we had wasabi flavor and we did not aim it solely to the Japanese customers but also for Japanese minorities that live in all parts of the world.

Same thing we did with a lot of different cultures and minorities worldwide to give them a voice.

There was this article I read this morning in The Economist where at some point Italy was portrayed in a most stereotypical way about South European politics compared to British politics. This is exactly what we do differently in PepsiCo when we approach different cultures.

The only real term is people. There are no consumers or users or customers or clients but people human beings

GDN: At one point in the book you mention: “taking the user by the hand that same person that the business world loves to call the consumer.”

What do you consider to be the difference between user and consumer and is it a linguistic difference or essential?

Mauro: The only real term is people. There are no consumers or users or customers or clients but people human beings.

What in the business world is called ‘consumer’ refers to a non-sustainable model of people consuming endlessly and results in negative connotations.

On the other hand the ‘user’ exists as a second stage when a person makes good use of a product and enjoys the design and the result. When the value of a product takes place.

The person as the last phase is when as a designer I see how a product can really create happiness for somebody. How it can add real value to their lives.

GDN: “Kindness in the business world.” Is this possible?

Mauro: Design thinking and practicing are humancentric should be humancentric. When I started for example working at 3M many a project was failing as obsolete practices were implemented into certain occasions.

My approach as Chief Design Officer in the corporations that I have worked with from the start has been to focus on the people and to establish non-toxic or competitive relationships between them; to establish kindness as a virtue in the team.

From experience I have witnessed many roadblocks in the productivity of companies because lack of kindness results into lack of teamwork. There is an older view in managing that implementing competitive feelings between employees makes them more productive but no trust means no productivity and no progress.

In difficult times and situations you need people you trust next to you in order to help you overcome a situation. I’ve had that happening in my life and along with time the second most important thing has been loving friends and colleagues who supported me through comfort and high spirits.

We cannot afford drama in a company that looks towards maximizing its creativity and productivity a corporation that looks toward the future.

Of course this is not the only necessity in leading a team; you need vision strategy speed resilience the ability to dream and if you combine the above with kindness then you can reach excellence.

GDN: “The Unicorn” is a central idea in the book. Would you be able to share with our readers in short the characteristics of the unicorn in innovation and design? Are “unicorns” born or they can be created?

Mauro: Everything is designed either by mother nature or by human design.

The concept of the “unicorn” is a humancentric conceptual design that combines different virtues for a person to acquire in order to be happier more productive and more successful.

The characteristics of a “unicorn” combine vision with curiosity innovative thinking respect kindness and optimism.

Even if sometimes people think that these are values that you either have or not this is not the truth.

It is our responsibility to educate our children into acquiring these elements in their education.

In school I would like my son to have classes on kindness on optimism on respect; to be taught to be curious but also empathetic.

GDN: Can you share with our readers new projects and new initiatives that you are working on?

What I would like to share is an example of a holistic approach on design thinking that circulates around four pillars: sustainability personality technology and customization.

If you think like a unicorn and approach a design holistically you can unlock incredible possibilities.

A project that we are working on and is an excellent example of what I am describing is a new smart reusable bottle in PepsiCo that has a vast variety of features to make the life of the person using it of the end-user easier and happier. For example it can calculate the nutrients of the bottle’s drink like calcium and magnesium and provide to the person information that makes the reusable so worthy to use that there is no need to use non-reusable plastic cups or bottles.

The current project is sustainable it makes excellent use of technology to achieve its features it can be customized and personalized and most of all it helps people and creates real value for the person that will buy the product.

Pfizer said its omicron booster triggers a stronger immune response against a number of emerging Covid subvariants circulating in the U.S.

The booster triggered more antibodies against omicron sublineages BQ.1.1 BA.4.6 BA.2.75.2 and XBB.1 in adults older than 55 compared with a fourth dose of the original vaccines according to new data released by the company on Friday. Antibodies are a key part of the immune system that block the virus from invading cells.

Pfizer developed its booster against omicron BA.5 at the request of the Food and Drug Administration. BA.5 was the dominant strain of Covid in the U.S. over the summer but is now fading away as subvariants such as BQ.1.1. start becoming more dominant.

BQ.1.1 and its sibling BQ.1 are causing about 48% of new infections in the U.S. right now according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. BA.5 meanwhile has declined to about 25% of new Covid cases. BA.4.6 and BA.2.75.2 still make up a very small proportion of new infections while XBB.1 is not present in significant enough numbers to show up in the data yet.

Antibodies against BQ.1.1 were about nine times higher in people who received an omicron booster while they were about two times higher in those who received a fourth dose of the original vaccine. Among the emerging subvariants the omicron booster elicited the strongest immune response against BA.4.6 with antibodies 11 times higher and the weakest response against XBB.1 with antibodies about five times higher.

The booster triggers the strongest immune response against omicron BA.5 the variant it was designed against with antibodies increasing 13 times in people older than 55 according to data previously released by Pfizer.

Moderna on Monday said its omicron booster induces an immune response against BQ.1.1 though the company didn't provide specifics.

U.S. health officials have said the boosters should provide better protection against the emerging subvariants because they are all omicron and many are descended from BA.5.

Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters target both omicron BA.5 and the original strain of Covid that emerged in Wuhan China in 2019. The original vaccines only target the first Covid strain and their effectiveness has declined substantially against infection and mild illness as the virus has evolved over the past several years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWVyY2ViaW90ZWNoLmNvbS9iaW90ZWNoL3NlZWtpbmctYnJvYWQtZHVyYWJsZS1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLXBmaXplci1hbmQtYmlvbnRlY2gtbW92ZS10LWNlbGwtZW5oYW5jaW5nLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer BioNTech move T-cell enhancing COVID vaccine into clinic,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/seeking-broad-durable-protection-pfizer-and-biontech-move-t-cell-enhancing-covid-19-vaccine on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWVyY2ViaW90ZWNoLmNvbS9iaW90ZWNoL3NlZWtpbmctYnJvYWQtZHVyYWJsZS1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLXBmaXplci1hbmQtYmlvbnRlY2gtbW92ZS10LWNlbGwtZW5oYW5jaW5nLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3R5bGVycm91c2gvMjAyMi8xMS8xOC9uZXctcGZpemVyLWJpb250ZWNoLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtaXMtbW9yZS1lZmZlY3RpdmUtdGhhbi10aGUtb3JpZ2luYWwtc3R1ZHktc2hvd3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Pfizer-BioNTech Covid Vaccine Is More Effective Than The Original Study Shows,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2022/11/18/new-pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine-is-more-effective-than-the-original-study-shows/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3R5bGVycm91c2gvMjAyMi8xMS8xOC9uZXctcGZpemVyLWJpb250ZWNoLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtaXMtbW9yZS1lZmZlY3RpdmUtdGhhbi10aGUtb3JpZ2luYWwtc3R1ZHktc2hvd3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi9wFodHRwczovL3d3bXQuY29tL25ld3MvY29yb25hdmlydXMvcGZpemVyLW1vZGVybmEtcmVzZWFyY2hpbmctaGVhcnQtaW5mbGFtbWF0aW9uLXNpZGUtZWZmZWN0LXJlbGF0ZWQtdG8tY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZXMtY29yb25hdmlydXMtcGFuZGVtaWMtZHItamVmZnJleS1zaW5nZXItY2F0by1pbnN0aXR1dGUtbXJuYS1teW9jYXJkaXRpcy1tdXNjbGUteW91bmctcGVvcGxlLXNpZ25zLXN5bXB0b21zLXNob3RzLWNhcmRpYWMtaXNzdWVz0gH7AWh0dHBzOi8vd3dtdC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvY29yb25hdmlydXMvcGZpemVyLW1vZGVybmEtcmVzZWFyY2hpbmctaGVhcnQtaW5mbGFtbWF0aW9uLXNpZGUtZWZmZWN0LXJlbGF0ZWQtdG8tY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZXMtY29yb25hdmlydXMtcGFuZGVtaWMtZHItamVmZnJleS1zaW5nZXItY2F0by1pbnN0aXR1dGUtbXJuYS1teW9jYXJkaXRpcy1tdXNjbGUteW91bmctcGVvcGxlLXNpZ25zLXN5bXB0b21zLXNob3RzLWNhcmRpYWMtaXNzdWVz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer Moderna researching rare side effect linked to COVID vaccines,"With a triple-threat virus sweeping across the country pharmaceutical companies have launched their own clinical trials on vaccines in young adults and the possible impact of heart conditions.

The senior fellow at the Cato Institute Dr. Jeffrey Singer joined Friday to talk more about this. Both Pfizer and Moderna are conducting clinical trials to determine if their COVID-19 vaccines could be contributing to possible cardiac issues.

""Well we've known for about a year that in young people mostly males but in females as well we seem to have vaccine-induced myocarditis. That's an only associated so far with the mRNA vaccines. For quite some time now we've known since the summer of 2020 that almost all of the serious illnesses and deaths occur in people who are over the age of 50 and usually have other comorbidities"" Singer explained. ""So there have been several experts who have been saying 'What's the rush in trying to get the young people who are at least risk for getting vaccinated through an emergency use authorization? Why don't we spend some more time studying it?' But nevertheless that's happened.""

Singer said since there have been some cases the manufacturers themselves Pfizer and Moderna are going to research if myocarditis is a significant side effect in vaccinated young people.

The first thing Hidalgo was asked elicited some laughter from the live audience to nobody’s surprise.

Hidalgo is appointment viewing on and off the court.

“My teammates call me a gnat because I’m all over them” Hidalgo said when asked if she has a go-to nickname.

There were a couple other quick-hitting questions thrown Hidalgo’s way. She said the high point of her career so far was Notre Dame winning the ACC Tournament in March. The low point was Notre Dame losing to Oregon State in the Sweet 16. She gave props to her parents and coaches for getting her to where she is today.

Here’s everything else Hidalgo said at the summit.

On arriving at Notre Dame and becoming one of the best players in the country as a true freshman…

“I know what God instilled in me. I know the gifts that he’s placed in me even from a young age. I’m big on my faith. I know God as blessed me with a talent so it’s so easy to be able to just go out there and just play my game. Also I have coaches and teammates that have so much confidence in me. When they tell me to go score the ball we need you to score we need you to play defense like you do it just makes everything so easy to just go out and do it when they give you the keys to do so.”

On Notre Dame head coach Niele Ivey being a players’ coach…

“It’s definitely a blessing to be able to have that connection with your coach to be able to go to her and say ‘This isn’t working’ or ‘What do you see? I don’t know what to do in this situation.’ It just makes the game so much easier and it makes me as a player want to run through a wall for a coach like that who gives everything and instills everything in you. It’s truly a blessing to be able to have that connection with her.”

On Notre Dame’s chances of winning the national title in the next few seasons…

“Absolutely. Absolutely. Not to be cocky but we have a lot of talent. Women’s basketball in general has a lot of talent. You can find it all over. But we have a lot of injuries coming back and transfers especially players like Olivia Miles coming back. A lot of people might have forgotten but she’s going to come back and shock the world with the talent she has. Emma Risch Cassandre Prosper. We just have so much firepower coming back. It’s going to be exciting.”

On someone she looks up to…

“[Skylar Diggins-Smith] for sure. Obviously she went to Notre Dame but she is just a dog on the court. Her being a smaller guard and just the defensive firepower that she brings I’m able to look at that and kind of model my game after that.”

More on what Ivey means to her…

“Just to persevere. Obviously Coach Ivey went through some stuff during the season and just to be able to see her come out on the court with all the stuff that she had gone through and was still going through and still to be able to come to practices and talk to recruits even through everything that she had been through it was amazing to see. I saw how much she persevered through all the stuff she was going through.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"An attorney for P.G. Sittenfeld asked a federal appeals court on Thursday to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion saying he didn't commit a crime.

If the convictions are allowed to stand attorney Yaakov Roth told a three-judge panel during oral arguments it could expose every elected official in the country to prosecution for accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld a former Cincinnati city councilman was found guilty of the charges in 2022 and sentenced last year to 16 months in prison. He's five months into that sentence now. But he is appealing his convictions and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Thursday.

The roughly 40-minute hearing took place in a courtroom packed with Sittenfeld supporters as well as attorneys interested in the outcome of the appeal which partly centers on what is corrupt when it comes to a politician accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld himself was not in the courtroom.

Roth began his argument by pointing to amicus briefs filed by 16 former federal public corruption prosecutors as well as a bipartisan group of former attorneys general and federal judges.

All of them Roth said are trying ""to tell this court that something has gone wrong.""

Judges question both sides

The judges − John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy − continuously asked questions of both sides throughout.

Many questions focused on whether Sittenfeld's actions were sufficient to be considered crimes. The judges also asked about topics that were raised repeatedly throughout the trial and in post-trial court filings.

Some questions centered on whether there was clear and unambiguous evidence of an exchange of money for official action − a quid pro quo.

At one point Nalbandian pointed out that Sittenfeld had promised to ""deliver the votes"" and get a ""veto-proof majority"" of City Council to support a development project in exchange for a $20000 donation to his political action committee.

Why couldn't the jury conclude that was evidence of corruption? he asked Roth.

Roth responded that prosecutors had strung together Sittenfeld's statements ""to make it into something it's not.""

Judges focus on conversation with developer

Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Singer spent much of his 15 minutes of argument time responding to questions from the judges.

Two judges asked specifically about a recorded conversation between Sittenfeld and a local developer during which they talked about supporting Sittenfeld's then-planned mayoral campaign.

As Sittenfeld and the developer Chinedum Ndukwe talked about campaign donations Sittenfeld said: ""You don't want me … to be like 'Hey Chin like love you but can't.'""

Prosecutors at trial said Sittenfeld was threatening to withhold support for the project unless Ndukwe contributed. But Roth argued that the statement wasn't sufficient evidence of a crime and said it seemed as if prosecutors had stopped focusing on it.

During arguments Thursday Nalbandian asked Singer if prosecutors were ""running away"" from the ""love you but can't"" comment.

Singer said the statement was one part of a ""corrupt solicitation"" that involved multiple statements. It was ""evidence the jury could consider"" he said.

What's next

A decision is not expected to come for some time possibly not until after Sittenfeld completes his prison term.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G.

For me that would be the sheer scale of the photovoltaic (solar) panel system. In total we are planning to install more than 10000 panels over seven hectares. As part of the efforts to reduce our impact on the environment we have planted 999 trees in the area to compensate for the land preparation to create the space. At Sampoerna we consider nine a lucky number so 999 was an especially lucky number of trees for the project.

What’s the next step in this project?

We aim for the photovoltaic (solar) panels to be installed by the end of March 2023 and for the biomass boiler to be in place by June the same year.

The plan is to shut off the old gas boiler and the gas-powered trigeneration engine—everything will then be powered by steam from the biomass boiler and electricity will be supported by the photovoltaic (solar) panels and the grid. There will still be a small amount of natural gas usage which we will balance with offsetting activities. Offsetting will be done for unavoidable carbon emissions ideally by insetting projects developed in our supply chain and generating certified carbon credits and alternatively by purchasing carbon credits.

The electricity we get is from a state-owned company with a green certificate (renewable energy certificate)—meaning that the electricity they provide is also sustainable and comes from a renewable energy source such as solar panels wind or water-powered turbines. Combined with our direct actions to construct the biomass boiler and photovoltaic (solar) panels this will enable us to meet the targets from Scope 1 + 2 (direct operations).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9pbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2lwbS1pbmRpYS1jb21tZW1vcmF0ZXMtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1tZW4tcy1kYXktdG8tc3BvdGxpZ2h0LW1hbGUtcm9sZS1tb2RlbHMtODg3MTY5MzcwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IPM India Commemorates International Men's Day to Spotlight Male Role Models,"MUMBAI India Nov. 18 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On the occasion of International Men's Day IPM India Wholesale Trading Private Limited ('IPM India') salutes all the forward-looking men out there who are not only great contributors to their family company and society but also who are stepping away from their usual role of patriarchy. The company celebrates the day to highlight the positive values that men bring to the world their families and communities.

Since time immemorial it is observed how men and women complete each other in all aspect of life. The philosophical concept of Ying & Yang describes opposite but interconnected forces this is similar to the role played by masculine and feminine in the society. While a lot has been spoken about the upliftment of women it is crucial to highlight the liberal and dynamic men behind overall women empowerment. Behind every successful man there is supportive woman similarly behind every successful woman is a progressive man.

Sharing his perspective Alexander Reisch Managing Director IPM India said - ""Over the course of several years the society has functioned in a manner that stereotypes the roles for 'men and 'women' which are socially constructed more than biologically. Subconsciously men have been forced to not display their vulnerabilities or express their emotions reinforcing the traditional social norms. It is important to celebrate these new-age men who can be the role models for others. It is a historic period where gender roles are being realigned and hence it is important to support and celebrate men who are adopting new roles empowering women and challenging stereotypes to truly create a world of equals. On this occasion of International Men's Day I would like to raise a toast to all the men of IPM India for their contribution to our business and value that they bring to the table every single day.""

Raising a toast to the occasion Shray Mehandiratta Director Finance IPM India said - ""According to Edwin Louis Cole 'Being a male is a matter of birth. Being a man is a matter of choice' and representing the same gender I very well support this saying. It is important for every man to further become a role model for his family his friends and for his colleagues at work. I would like to wish all my male colleagues a very Happy International Men's Day.""

Arunabh Suman Senior Counsel IPM India said ""Men have a greater responsibility in today's day and age to bring back the harmony and balance between both the genders and create a safe space for people around them to flourish. I wish all the men at IPM India a very Happy International Men's Day.""

Saurabh Paliwal National Sales Manager IPM India said ""It's an imperfect world therefore instead of pushing society determined standards of perfection this International Men's Day we should celebrate our uniqueness and our individuality.""

Nitin Govind Manager Brand Engagement IPM India said ""Being a male role model is about constantly striving to be the best versions of ourselves. Living sincerely and earnestly while accepting vulnerabilities and challenging pre-defined labels!""

Priyank Gupta Manager Commercial Planning IPM India said ""If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you If all men count with you but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it And—which is more—you'll be a Man my son! -- Here's an excerpt from my favorite poem by Rudyard Kipling which epitomizes 'being a man' for me of course it applies to women too but on this day I'd like to dedicate this to all men at IPM to try and become better versions of themselves in the multiple roles they play in their life.""

IPM India has been constantly transforming for a future ready new age work culture and has policies to support and empower men to contribute equally to their personal and professional lives. This is an essential component in the company's endeavor of fostering an egalitarian inclusive and diverse space at work. In order to encourage men to balance their personal and professional lives the 'Circle In' platform was introduced. The platform encompasses tools and stories to enhance productivity physical & mental well-being and engagement. This year IPM India is hosting an Intra-IPM Cricket tournament for all its employees.

Globally PMI has joined the worldwide Movember project to highlight the important topic of men's health and to further encourage conversations around mental health. The aim in joining this cause is to raise awareness around the biggest health issues facing men around the world and encourage employees to sign up to the Movember challenge.

However these measures alone will not allow the UK to meet its 2030 smoke-free ambition – bolder action is required now.

It’s time the UK allowed adult smokers better access to – and information about – the full range of smoke-free alternatives available. We know people want this – 86 percent of adults support the idea**. And more than three-quarters of adults (77 percent) believe policy makers need to better consider the views of tobacco and nicotine consumers when deciding on regulations for tobacco and nicotine-containing products.

Philip Morris is playing its part. We are the only major tobacco company that has pledged to go smoke-free. And we’ve made incredible progress.

We’ve cut the vast majority of commercial support for our combustible cigarette business. To date we have invested more than $9bn in smoke-free products to help adults who don’t quit switch away from combustible cigarettes. Just eight years ago we were a cigarette business. At the end of our last quarter more than 30 percent* of our total net revenues came from smoke free products. And 13.5 million adults across the globe have switched to one of our products and abandoned cigarettes completely. Our commitment to transformation is undeniable. We are aiming for 50 percent of our total net revenues to come from smoke-free products by 2025.

But we cannot shape the UK’s smoke-free future alone.

If the UK embraces smoke-free innovation combined with the right regulatory and policy approach it can help accelerate an end to smoking once and for all.

LLC (CPChem)—a joint venture of Chevron Corp. and Phillips 66—and QatarEnergy have reached positive final investment decision (FID) to move forward with construction of the partners’ previously delayed grassroots petrochemical complex along the Texas Gulf Coast in Orange Tex. about 113 miles east of Houston (OGJ Online July 15 2019).

To be named Golden Triangle Polymers Co. LLC—a newly formed joint-venture partnership of CPChem (51%) and QatarEnergy (49%)—the proposed $8.5-billion integrated polymers complex will include a 2.08-million tonne/year (tpy) ethylene cracker and two 1-million tpy high-density polyethylene (HDPE) units for production of proprietary Marlex polyethylene pellets for sale primarily to manufacturers in the Asia Pacific Europe and Latin America the partners said upon announcing FID on Nov. 16.

Targeting 25% lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than similar US and European plants in support of CPChem and QatarEnergies’ commitments to enabling a reduced-carbon future the complex comes as part of the companies’ aim of meeting increased global demand for polymers as well as the next phase of QatarEnergies’ downstream growth strategy which includes major investments in ethylene ethylene derivatives and general polymers said Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi QatarEnergy’s president and chief executive officer.

Scheduled for immediate start of construction the Golden Triangle Polymers complex is slated for commissioning in 2026 the companies said.

Earlier this year CPChem and QatarEnergy confirmed they also are moving forward with a previously announced plan to jointly build and operate the proposed Ras Laffan petrochemical project (RLPP) in Ras Laffan Industrial City Qatar (OGJ Online June 9 2022). The RLPP too will feature a 2.08-million tpy ethane cracker and two HDPE units.

CPChem and QatarEnergy already serve as JV partners in Ras Laffan Olefins Co. and Qatar Chemical Co. Ltd. which respectively operate petrochemical production complexes in Ras Laffan and Mesaieed Qatar.

The partners previously deferred taking FID on the Golden Triangle Polymers project in 2020 amid a then-uncontrolled global pandemic (OGJ Online Aug. 2 2021; Aug. 3 2020).

Activists Now Want Biden to Impose Tougher ...,"A coalition of environmental activists and advocacy groups is urging the Biden administration to toughen federal regulations around soot pollution a step that they said could prevent thousands of deaths each year from respiratory disorders.

The coalition organized by the Climate Action Campaign drafted a letter to President Joe Biden earlier this week calling on federal officials to institute the most rigorous air quality standards for fine particulate matter or PM 2.5 to denote bits of pollution smaller than 2.5 microns—about one-thirtieth the diameter of a human hair.

The current standard for particulate matter from soot pollution is 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air as an annual average. The advocacy groups asked Biden to toughen that standard to 8 micrograms per cubic meter.

Soot pollution has been linked to cardiac arrest asthma attacks and what experts call “premature deaths” from a range of cardiovascular and breathing disorders. Most particulate matter is generated by vehicle exhaust and emissions from power plants and other industrial operations.

“Each day that passes without updated limits is another day that millions of Americans are exposed to unhealthy and potentially dangerous levels of soot pollution” the advocates wrote in a letter that was signed by more than 150 environmental groups from across the country.

The advocates cited a study released earlier this year by the Environmental Defense Fund which found that as many as 19600 deaths each year that are attributed to the harms of particulate matter could be avoided.

Margie Alt campaign director of the Climate Action Campaign noted that the federal standards on soot pollution have not been updated since 2012 and that over the past decade scientists have learned more about the potential adverse health effects related to particulate matter.

“We know the science is better and we know the technology is better” Alt said in an interview. “We know that exposure to soot leads to increased mortality leads to more hospitalizations and more visits to the emergency room. Asthma is the most obvious disease that’s triggered by it but it can also trigger heart attacks and strokes and Parkinson’s and COPD”—chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—“and risk for preterm births and infant mortality.”

Alt said strengthening the standard for soot pollution is part of a broader campaign undertaken by her organization to ensure that emissions overall are reduced by at least half by the end of the decade.

Tightening the standards for soot pollution is a significant part of that effort Alt said noting that it is “essential to all Americans to our health to the health of the planet and to the U.S. role in the world when it comes to climate.”

Paul Billings national senior vice president of public policy for the American Lung Association said in an interview that the establishment of new standards at the federal level would set in motion a series of steps that would prompt states to identify communities that have excessive pollution levels.

States would then draft plans including a specific time frame—which under federal guidelines should not exceed nine years—for when they will achieve healthy air standards Billings said.

At the same time the standards would also drive EPA to propose more protective cleanup strategies and more rigorous rules for all pollution sources.

Billings noted that the general public may mistakenly believe that the particles do not pose a threat because they are so small. “Why should the public care?” he asked. “Because particulate matter PM pollution soot whatever you want to call it it kills people. And it kills tens of thousands of people every year.”

“These small particles get past the body’s natural defense mechanisms” Billings said. “The big particles they get caught in the nose the mouth you cough them out. The small particles get down deep and they get into the bloodstream and cause a wide range of adverse health effects. Coughing wheezing. Shortness of breath. They’ve also been linked to lung cancer heart attack stroke and thousands and thousands of premature deaths in the United States every year.”

Raul Garcia legislative director for healthy communities at the advocacy group Earthjustice noted that the adverse effects of particulate matter pollution are not distributed evenly—people of color are 61 percent more likely to live in areas with unhealthy air quality.

“This also means that they are more likely to suffer from diseases and conditions like asthma and other very harsh respiratory conditions” Garcia said during a virtual news conference Tuesday about the Climate Action Campaign letter. “And so we have to have urgency.”

Garfield Clunie president of the National Medical Association—the nation’s oldest group for Black physicians—said during the news conference that the benefits of a tougher soot pollution standard are “critically important to addressing health equity in this country not just for people of color but for everyone.”

Garcia noted that federal officials had been expected to rule as early as Monday—roughly three months after the Environmental Protection Agency forwarded a proposed updated pollution standard to the Office of Management and Budget. He urged officials to move quickly to enact the proposal.

The management and budget office typically does not comment on pending policy reviews. The EPA decided to reexamine the standard after the Trump administration declined to raise the standard in 2020.

“We really have to look at this as a critical public health and environmental justice issue” Garcia said. “This isn’t rulemaking that simply sits on a piece of paper. This is something that’s going to have real world impacts to everyone’s lives but particularly those communities who have had to bear the burden of energy consumption across the country. It’s important that these standards be lowered to an adequate level because we know that the current standards do not protect human health to the level that they should.”

“We need this rule to come out today” Garcia said “and we need this rule to be a set of strong standards so that communities can actually live and breathe air that isn’t going to kill them.”

But Alabama and West Virginia stand out like back-row students who pole-vaulted to the head of the class.

Between the 2010-2011 school year the first for which we have consistent data from the National Center for Education Statistics and 2018-2019 Alabama and West Virginia launched themselves from 40th and 27th in the nation in the rate of students who graduated from high school in four years to first and third respectively joining No. 2 Iowa at this pinnacle of education achievement. (Data since the pandemic which scrambled public school schedules and standards is not yet available.)

What’s behind this apparent public education miracle? Our embarrassingly glib answer is of course data. After all it would’ve been tough to make that chart without it. But on closer examination that answer may be less glib than it sounds.

Until the past decade nobody knew how well state school systems were doing in terms of graduation rates. States reported their own metrics with their own definitions of graduates and dropouts and comparisons between states were difficult.

Skip to end of carousel Department of Data We here at the Department of Data are dedicated to exploring the weird and wondrous power of the data that defines our world. Read more. End of carousel This proved inconvenient for policymakers who — after years of fussing over test scores — began to realize that graduation mattered even more. And its importance has increased with every passing year: In the mid-1970s a high school dropout could earn almost three-quarters of the U.S. median wage. By the early 2000s that figured had plummeted to about half.

So in 2008 at the tail end of the George W. Bush administration an update to Bush’s signature No Child Left Behind initiative required states to follow a consistent process for measuring and reporting graduation rates and set ambitious targets for improving them over time.

Unlike the school-based testing requirements that initially formed the controversial backbone of No Child Left Behind the new focus on graduation appears to have worked. The once-stagnant graduation rate rose substantially over the following decade.

“It seems like the greatest success story of NCLB” said Tulane University economist Douglas Harris director of the National Center for Research on Education Access and Choice.

Calling it “probably the most positive result that we have for accountability period” Harris pointed out that while we all obsessed over test scores transformative results were quietly piling up in a metric that wasn’t even an initial goal of NCLB. And as our glib answer above implied simple inexpensive data collection really did drive the transformation.

“We don’t have many policy levers that can increase these outcomes without a substantial financial cost” Harris said. “For graduation rates accountability seems to be one of those levers.”

West Virginia and Alabama were some of the earliest most enthusiastic and most persistent adopters of graduation-rate targeting said Robert Balfanz director of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University.

“They took it seriously as a state-level problem often with the involvement of the governor and the state Department of Education” Balfanz said “and they made it a priority over quite a long period of time.”

In particular the two states focused on what Balfanz called an early warning system tracking behavior attendance and grades in the ninth grade a critical point at which many future dropouts fall through the cracks in the transition from middle school to high school.

While some students leave because they got a job or got pregnant Balfanz said “the biggest number of kids dropping out were the kids who were falling behind in ninth grade and not catching up.”

Both states worked with outside vendors to track vulnerable students and to share detailed data with their teachers. This data-driven approach allowed teachers to target specific students and figure out what was keeping them out of class or causing them to fail whether it be work family bullies or social isolation. It was “nothing dramatic” Balfanz said. “Just lots of problem-solving and small efforts that help students stay on track.”

To be sure there are reasons to be skeptical of the sudden improvement. As economists often say when a measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure.

“In general people don’t suddenly get better at their jobs so sudden improvements in measures usually mean they are misleading” Harris said. “That said part of the good news here is that the increase was fairly gradual.”

The numbers themselves seem solid: A Post analysis of census data shows the share of 19-year-olds with diplomas closely tracks the trend in reported graduation rates over the period for which they’re available.

And the big jump in performance in Alabama and West Virginia doesn’t seem impossible. While the Census Bureau data isn’t quite as dramatic our analysis found that both states ranked comfortably near the top for fastest growth in the share of young people with high school diplomas over the past decade.

Harris nonetheless initially maintained a healthy skepticism of NCLB’s quiet graduation-rate revelation. So in a recent Brookings analysis with his Tulane colleagues Lihan Liu and Nathan Barrett and Ruoxi Li now a PhD candidate at Yale University Harris looked at several possible means by which schools could game the system. They found no smoking gun at least at the state level.

Most schools don’t seem to be cutting corners they found: In fact many of the gains occurred as schools were also trying to raise test scores to meet NCLB standards which would typically depress graduation rates.

It seems possible that Alabama goosed its graduation rate by axing a required pre-graduation exit exam in 2013 a common move as states realized that such exams hurt the most vulnerable students without providing any clear benefit. Alabama ditched the exam as part of a shift toward more practical measurements of college and career readiness such as earning an AP credit or obtaining a professional certification. Those measurements as it happens have just been enshrined as a new graduation requirement starting with the Class of 2028.

“What we ended up having over the last several years was a graduation rate that has been slowly ticking up because there was no longer that exam between you and graduation” said Mark Dixon president of A+ Education Partnership an Alabama nonprofit advocate.

But it wasn’t smoke and mirrors Dixon said. Alabama made measurable improvements to career readiness even as graduation rates rose. And Harris and his colleagues found that states with exit exams actually saw a slightly larger increase in graduation rates than states that didn’t have such exams or states that abolished them.

When we talked as he was leaving the gym and getting ready to head out to a Saturday football game Harris also made a surprising point: If the graduation-rate targets caused some districts to lower standards there could be a silver lining.

Sure students may lose specific knowledge if they are quietly passed in a home economics course they were about to fail or allowed to make up a failed English class with an easy credit-recovery program. But their lost knowledge in those subjects may be less important than the knowledge they gain in other subjects simply by staying in school.

“Even if there was some relaxation of standards where they’re giving D’s instead of F’s that’s keeping kids in school longer” Harris said. “There’s more class time — they’re taking more courses as a result.”

Those courses may be producing a more skilled workforce and a more informed electorate — even if high school diplomas are a little bit easier to come by.

SHARP & Mercedes-Benz Canada

Pop-up exhibitions galleries and stores are by no means a new concept however one that encapsulates retail Canadian design talent and the world of Mercedes-Benz luxury is a fresh interpretation of the format that’s easy to get behind. Think for a moment about how scarce top-tier Mercedes-Maybach and Mercedes-AMG cars are and how infrequently you spot one cruising through any Canadian city? A visit to Maison Mercedes will provide an up-close look at the pinnacle of the Mercedes-Benz portfolio and its key specialty brands — Mercedes-Maybach G-Class and Mercedes-AMG — from November 18th through December 24th. In addition visitors can also use the opportunity to acquire unique gift items from the location’s luxury retail boutique.

Maison Mercedes is bringing Torontonians a sensorial exhibition of luxury in a space built to highlight the world’s most desirable cars while immersing consumers in the world of Mercedes-Benz luxury. It’s a gateway for shoppers in Yorkville to explore and experience the world of Mercedes-Benz and an opportunity to shop a curated selection of brands from Canada and around the world. Taking over a massive footprint at 100 Bloor Street West the venue will feature two interactive environments that will give visitors an inside look at the brand’s interpretation of what luxury means today.

First the Haute Universe space is inspired by the Mercedes-Maybach Haute Voiture which brings together the world’s of automotive excellence and haute couture to set a new pinnacle for sophisticated luxury. The limited-edition concept Mercedes-Maybach Haute Voiture — a rare creation that was first unveiled this past spring and that’s coming to market in 2023 — has been transported from Europe to Toronto and will be on display throughout the event. Unlike past creations from other automakers who partnered with fashion houses on collaborations Mercedes-Maybach hired an entire independent team from the fashion industry to craft the luxurious and boundary-pushing interior of the Haute Voiture creating a new vision of the intersection between automobiles and fashion.

Alongside the Haute Universe the Manufaktur Marketplace will highlight more adventurous luxury with the G-Class and performance luxury with Mercedes-AMG while showcasing Manufaktur — a new customization program offered by Mercedes-Benz where customers can select from a wide variety of exterior and interior finishes to create a vehicle that reflects their unique styles. With its range of high-end interior and exterior finishes the offering can feel boundless as Mercedes-Benz customers can create more than a million combinations with Manufaktur. From historic tones and colours to head-turning modern matte and satin finishes interior appointments like bespoke leathers and custom upholstery combined with wood or piano lacquer trim the end result is a first-class cabin experience like no other.

Bringing this vision of personalization to life in the Maison Mercedes space the G-Class interactive installation will use projection mapping that will allow guests to customize the display vehicle and backdrop to create a scene that speaks to their unique vision/lifestyle/aesthetic. The space will also offer the ability to secure more information and book a test drive from a local Mercedes-Benz dealership.

Given this clear focus on the intersection between luxury automotive fashion and lifestyle the space won’t be entirely centered around vehicles alone. Maison Mercedes will also feature two retail boutiques that offer a curated selection of luxurious gifts from designers in Canada and around the globe. This will include Varsity Headwear which makes its Canadian debut with Maison Mercedes. At the Varsity Headwear Atelier guests of Maison Mercedes can design a custom specialty cap choosing from a range of premium and sustainable fabrics rich colours and unique fits. They’ll even be able to add a final touch of personalization at the diamond engraving station. Canadian brands in the space include LUXTON Sully & Son Co. Alan Anderson Hestia Jewels SENTALER and Mas.

Regardless of whether you’re a luxury car aficionado a resident fashionista or simply passing through Yorkville with hopes of completing your holiday shopping Maison Mercedes is a must-visit before its final day on Christmas Eve.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Ljk5LmNvL3NpbmdhcG9yZS9pbnNpZGVyLzEwMDEtcGlubmFjbGUtZHV4dG9uLWZsYXQtczEtMzdtLXMxMzY5LXBzZi1tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS00LXJvb20taGRiLXJlc2FsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1001-sqft Pinnacle@Duxton flat sold for S$1.37m at record S$1369 psf - most expensive 4-room HDB resale in ...,"Correction: In an earlier version we reported that 59 4-rooms and 113 5-rooms at Pinnacle@Duxton have since been sold at or above S$1m. We’ve since corrected this to 82 4-rooms and 126 5-rooms. Also the psf price for the 4-room Pinnacle@Duxton flat has been rounded to S$1369.

A 1001-sqft 4-room (Type S1) flat at the 46-48th floor of Blk 1D of Pinnacle@Duxton has just been sold for S$1.37m (S$1369 psf) in October 2022.

The sale has made it the most expensive 4-room HDB resale flat in Singapore (the 6th most expensive HDB resale flat overall) and the 2nd-highest price ever paid for a flat at Pinnacle@Duxton.

The current highest was for a 1152-sqft 5-room (Type S2) at Blk 1F which sold for S$1.389m (S$1205 psf) in March 2022.

According to Ms Bernice Kang from ERA the agent who brokered both the record-breaking 4-room and previous 5-room sales at Pinnacle@Duxton the buyers of the 4-room were a couple in their 30s to 40s.

“They love the high floor and view and mentioned that the unit felt comfortable and welcoming” Kang shared.

Not to be outdone another slightly larger 4-room flat (1012 sqft) was sold for S$1.3m (S$1284 psf) in the same month at Pinnacle@Duxton making it the 2nd most expensive 4-room flat in Singapore.

Outside of Pinnacle@Duxton the most expensive 4-room HDB resale flat would be at City View @ 9 Boon Keng Road – a 1023-sqft DBSS 4-roomer which sold for S$1.18m (S$1153.47 psf) in November 2021.

What’s particularly astounding about the Pinnacle@Duxton sale is that its S$1369 per square foot price is the highest recorded for HDB resale flats nationwide.

In per square foot terms this places it just ahead of the S$1364.3 psf price recorded for a 689-sqft 3-room (Simplified) flat at 498 Jurong West Street 41 (sold in November 2009).

Here’s a quick chart to get you up to speed:

The sale was captured on 22 October 2022 three weeks after the 30 September 2022 cooling measures were announced. It is also probable that the option-to-purchase for the 4-room flat was signed before the announcement.

When asked about this ERA’s Kang confirmed that the buyers weren’t affected by the recent cooling measures and that the option-to-purchase (OTP) was signed before the announcement.

Located at Cantonment Road in Tanjong Pagar the Pinnacle@Duxton HDB project was completed in 2011 and entered the resale market in 2015. It has seven 50-storey blocks making them the world’s tallest public residential buildings.

There are 1848 units in total – 1232 4-room (Type S1) units and 616 5-room (Type S2) units.

In terms of million-dollar flats sold 82 4-room flats at the Pinnacle@Duxton have been sold at or above a million dollars so far (6.66% of all 4-rooms or 4.44% of all units).

For 5-room flats 126 have been sold at this range (20.45% of all 5-rooms or 6.82% of all units).

It is anybody’s guess if the record-setting per-square-foot price of S$1369 would remain unbeatable for long (lettuce game anyone?). We’re still surprised it came from the sale of a 1001-sqft 4-room flat.

The beachfront hotel has rebranded as an upscale resort and its reopening under a global hotel brand is just in time for the Guam tourism industry’s recovery efforts after being nearly upended by the pandemic.

Guests started staying at the 321-room hotel Wednesday.

“I think this is one of the most beautiful properties in Tumon. The proximity to the beach you can’t get any better than that” George Chiu executive director of Asia Pacific Hotels under Tan Holdings owner of the hotel said in an interview Friday while touring the facilities.

The hotel’s grand opening may be around April 2023 he said.

Tan Holdings Chiu said takes pride in its partnership with globally renowned hotel management firm InterContinental Hotels Group or IHG which now manages and operates the rebranded Crowne Plaza Resort Guam.

“We’re very excited to be partnering with Intercontinental Hotel Group. We think the renovation speaks for itself” Chiu said adding that Tan Holdings is heavily invested in Guam.

This is Tan Holdings’ 50th year of doing business in Guam he said.

“We’re not going anywhere. We hope to be here at least another 50 more years” Chu said. “The next generation of leaders will be coming over to take over and run the business.”

The rebranding and refurbishing included new bar and restaurant concepts in line with IHG’s food and beverage standards. One of the restaurants at the hotel brought in a chef from Italy.

The former Fiesta Resort hotel used to have two small swimming pools. Now the adult pool has been transformed into an oasis just steps away from the ocean. Chiu said the hotel will soon open its new children’s pool with a water slide.

“That’s gonna be the highlight feature because we have lots of families coming here to enjoy Guam” he said.

The hotel has about 140 employeesand that number will expand as tourism recovers.

Crowne Plaza Resort Guam’s sister hotel in the Northern Marianas the rebranded Crowne Plaza Resort Saipan recently held its grand opening after a $43 million refurbishment."

Petroleum Division apprised the meeting held in Finance Division that a circular debt management plan for OGDCL PPL and GHPL has been developed; Government of Pakistan (GoP) holds 85 percent 74.86 percent and 100 percent shares in these companies respectively and a significant portion of natural gas produced by these companies is procured by SNGPL SSGS and power sector.

Outstanding receivables of these three entities have reached an alarming level of Rs 1.6 trillion comprising principle of Rs 1.124 trillion and interest/LPS amounting to Rs 448 billion as of June 30 2022 approximately.

The meeting was briefed that under the scheme GoP being a major shareholder in the three State Owned Enterprises (SoEs) may use prospective dividends to settle a sizeable portion of receivables. The meeting was informed that out of total receivables of OGDCL from GHPL amounting to Rs 142 billion an amount of Rs 82 billion constitutes as principal and the remaining as interest.

Power sector: Circular debt touching Rs2.6trn mark

According to the proposed settlement scheme in a first GoP/Finance Division to swap Sukuk worth Rs 142 billion issued by PHPL to OGDCL back in 2013 as part of the power sector circular debt with Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) in phases to enable the SOEs to consider announcement of appropriate amount of dividend to be announced by the respective entity.

The sources said the dividend so declared by OGDCL minus dividend paid to non-controlling shares will be ploughed back as supplementary grants for SNGPL SSGCL and CPPA-G to settle their payables towards OGDCL PPL and GHPL. All these settlements will be on a non-cash basis.

The sources maintained that both Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and London Stock Exchange (where applicable) will be taken on board by the respective SOEs. Appropriate steps will be taken by the listed companies in this regard to prevent insider trading.

Additional Secretary (budget) Finance Division Tanveer Butt observed that certain aspects of the proposed plan are ambiguous and detailed discussions are needed for developing a clear way forward. Moreover revenues have to be booked and accounted for instead of non-cash therefore a separate meeting of Petroleum Division with Budget Wing Finance Division is required.

After detailed deliberations the meeting decided that further deliberations will be held at the level of Finance Secretary once following steps are taken by the Petroleum Division: (i) Petroleum Division will hold separate meetings with Budget Wing Finance Division; and (ii) legal aspect may be examined by the Petroleum Division on the proposed mechanism to settle the issue of circular debt in gas and power sector.

The Norfolk Virginia-based investment firm and Image Capital bought the 464-unit complex at 3150 Wilshire Boulevard the firm announced this week declining to provide a purchase price. However a source familiar with the deal pegged the sale at just north of $230 million.

Harbor Group used a $125 million loan from a consortium of Signature Bank and New York Community Bank to finance the purchase the source added.

Principal Financial Group which sold the property lost on the deal. The insurance firm based in Iowa bought the property in 2014 for $283 million according to property records filed with L.A. County.

To purchase the property Principal used a $168 million loan with Freddie Mac. In June the firm came to an agreement to extend the maturity on the debt through Oct. 1. Just before that deadline Principal extended the loan again with a new deadline of Dec. 1.

Rents at the complex range from $2350 a month for a studio to $3504 for a two-bedroom unit according to online listings for the property. Those figures are slightly higher than the $2355 monthly rent average across Koreatown Zumper data shows.

Though it was built in 2014 Harbor Group said the property needs renovations. The firm plans to spend $22.3 million to renovate common areas some apartments and other interiors.

A team led by Marc Renard at Cushman & Wakefield brokered the deal between Harbor and Principal.

Multifamily was considered the darling of real estate investment during the pandemic as rents soared and interest rates hit historic lows. But as interest rates have risen multifamily sales — along with other commercial sales — have slowed.

The National Multifamily Housing Council found that apartment building sales came to a “virtual standstill” across the country in October.

At many banks and financial services companies data usage is growing faster than the internal audit function can respond. Before internal auditors can build a strategy to incorporate data into the internal audit plan data-based processes have taken deep root in diverse areas of the business.

Many organizations develop a level of comfort with this disconnect – but they shouldn’t. In a financial services industry that is becoming more interconnected technology-driven and data-reliant every day no organization can afford to leave data out of its internal audit universe in 2023.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

The 5th District Court of Appeals based in Daytona Beach this week decided with no comment that the county court in Orange County was justified in dismissing the lawsuits. All of the suits were filed by well-known Orlando plaintiffs’ attorney Earl Higgs on behalf of six automobile glass-replacement companies.

In several cases including At Home Auto Glass vs. Progressive American Insurance Co. the glass shop sued because Progressive did not pay the full amount of the submitted bill for replacing a windshield. Driver Mary Cargle had assigned benefits to At Home. But Orange County Judge Amy Carter tossed the suit noting that the auto policy mandates that differences of opinion on the claim amount go to a third-party appraiser and that “the policy states that the defendant cannot be sued unless there is full compliance with all the terms of the policy.”

Higgs and the defense attorney for Progressive Lissette Gonzalez of the prominent insurance defense firm Cole Scott & Kissane could not be reached for comment. But other judicial experts in Florida said the rulings underscore that insurance policies can in fact require that insureds comply with policy terms.

“I think a party to a contract always can waive their right to sue or make it contingent on their meeting defined prerequisites” said Robert Jarvis professor of law at Nova Southeastern University law school in Fort Lauderdale.

Such clauses make sense he said because they force policyholders to try to work things with the carrier “rather than simply running off to court and filing a lawsuit.”

Michael Packer with the Marshall Dennehey firm said that courts have allowed some insureds a little leeway or “substantial compliance” with the policy. But for assignees of benefits such as the auto glass companies courts often hold them to a stricter standard.

“The courts have grown exhausted by the AOB lawsuits and are less forgiving when they fail to comply with one or more post-loss conditions” Packer said in an email.

A number of insurance company officials have said that AOBs lie at heart of the proliferation of litigation that has cost Florida insurers millions of dollars in recent years and has helped drive several into insolvency. Data from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation shows that from 2017 to 2020 the severity of homeowner AOB claims were almost double that of claims without AOBs.

Some in the industry have said that the Florida Legislature due to convene in another special session next month may take further steps to curtail AOB litigation.

At a previous special session in May lawmakers banned the awarding of attorney fees for plaintiffs in most AOB cases. That came after 2019’s reform measure which put a number of other restrictions on assignments of benefits and litigation.

As much as homeowner AOB claims auto glass claims have long been a thorn in the industry’s side and industry advocates have blamed installers for an explosion of claims with inflated prices and for filing suit too quickly. In recent years the insurance industry backed legislation that that would have prohibited repair shops from offering anything of value to customers in exchange for making insurance claims for glass replacement and repair but the measures did not survive.

In some of the recent Progressive cases the assignee auto shops sent the bill for more than $1000 to the insurer which paid only part of it. Progressive argued that the policy requires that an appraisal process be utilized to decide the payable amount.

“We recognize that a dispute exists with respect to the amount that is necessary to repair or replace the windshield and the purpose of this letter is to explain that the insurance policy provides that an appraisal is the method to be used to resolve the disagreement” Progressive wrote to Apex Auto Glass in one dispute. “Although you may have provided a purported assignment of benefits this correspondence does not waive any of the defenses we may have regarding the same. Specifically we are hereby treating the assignment of benefits as a direction to pay and have issued the payment due pursuant to the policy language. Should you file suit naming our customer as the assignor we reserve the right to assert defenses pertaining to the purported assignment of benefits.”

Progressive’s motion to dismiss the suit was based in part on its contention that Apex did not participate in the appraisal process. The glass shops argued that among other issues the insured was unable to locate the policy at the time the claim was failed so could not know of its requirements that an appraisal was cost-prohibitive and that appraisal was not appropriate because the dispute was over coverage not price.

The county court sided with Progressive on all counts.

But we cannot be happy about the newest offering in the meager smorgasbord of U.S. employee benefits: company-supported abortion.

At least 64 major U.S. corporations including most recently Walmart are now expanding their benefits to include either more abortion coverage or travel benefits to access abortion.

At least 64 major U.S. corporations including most recently Walmart are now expanding their benefits to include either more abortion coverage or travel benefits to access abortion.

Dick’s Sporting Goods for example is offering up to $4000 to help cover airplane fares hotel expenses bus tickets and other travel costs associated with procuring an abortion.

Generous right? These days one can easily find a $300 round-trip flight from Texas to New York leaving you ample cash to spend on accommodation and food. Dick’s really really wants you to exercise your right to an abortion.

Sadly Dick’s is not so generous if you want to exercise your right to be a parent. If you choose to give birth the company which made a profit of $2.4 billion last year offers paid maternity leave that is only eight weeks—less than half of the 18 weeks recommended by the International Labour Organization.

It is not too hard to do the math here. A first-trimester out-of-state abortion typically costs $560 plus the cost of travel and several nights in a hotel. On the other hand 18 weeks of paid maternity leave would cost Dick’s at least $6840 for a worker on their minimum wage. Add to this the costs of lactation breaks federally mandated accommodations such as secure bathroom stalls and the long-term productivity costs of raising a child. Companies will never admit it but the truth is that abortion is a good business decision. Providing parental benefits in line with the international standard for developed nations is not.

Companies will never admit it but the truth is that abortion is a good business decision. Providing parental benefits in line with the international standard for developed nations is not.

In fact we researched 20 companies chosen at random from the list of those offering expanded abortion coverage or travel benefits; only eight of them paid maternity leave in line with the I.L.O.’s international recommendation of 18 weeks.

Granted the I.L.O.’s standard seems like a generous one but only because we are conditioned to think in the United States that profit comes before people. The way we see it companies that can afford to shell out thousands of dollars in abortion travel benefits can also afford to provide meaningful benefits to parents at least in the absence of government-funded paid leave. While some companies such as Walmart do also offer to cover fertility treatments the overall package of support for working parents is lacking compared with international norms.

We acknowledge it can be difficult to get employee benefits right but we must also note that proud announcements about benefits in one area sometimes seem to occur at the same time as less publicized actions that undermine workers’ rights. In May Amazon announced a new abortion travel benefit; the following month the company held 25 mandatory anti-union meetings in the lead-up to the vote by warehouse workers on Staten Island that resulted in their joining the Amazon Labor Union. That company’s anti-union bias is accompanied by a general lack of regard for the needs of parents. Amazon’s executive chairman Jeff Bezos was memorably confronted in 2019 by an angry group of self-styled “Momazonians” disappointed at the company’s poor culture of support for working parents and lack of day care support.

Other companies have recently cut back on benefits for new parents even as they fund support for abortion. Disney-owned Hulu for example recently slashed its paid parental leave from 20 weeks to eight weeks even as Disney has expanded travel benefits for “family planning” in the wake of the Dobbs decision.

As progressive anti-abortionists we believe that labor justice is preborn justice. We work to build a world where major corporations will feel the same pressure to protect unborn children from mass violence as they do today to support Black Lives Matter and the right of L.G.B.T.Q. people to simply be visible.

For now though companies should at the minimum adhere to a less exacting standard: Either pay for abortions and support your parenting employees or stop paying for abortions at all.

Companies that can’t bring themselves to do both should be named and shamed. Women people who can become pregnant and their children deserve better.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vY2hpY2Fnby5zdW50aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNy8yMzQ2NTE3Ny9kYXZpZC1nb2xpYXRoLWJhdHRsZS1jbG91dGVkLWNvbXBhbnktYmlkLXdlZWQtc2hvcC1pbnNpZGUtb2xkLXJhaW5mb3Jlc3QtY2FmZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David and Goliath battle brewing over clouted company's bid to set up a weed shop inside old Rainforest Cafe,"Three days after weed’s high holiday of April 20 Robert Brown spotted a sign posted outside the shuttered Rainforest Cafe steps from his River North home.

The advisory stated only that a pair of companies were looking to set up shop in the space still adorned with the massive frog and mushrooms left behind by the last tenant.

Curious about the posting Brown asked a passerby.

“We’re going to have another pot dispensary” Brown recalled the person saying clearly referring to the growing number of marijuana shops in the area.

“Not if I have anything to say about it” Brown vowed.

Palatine-based PTS has teamed with a social equity firm in a bid to open a cannabis dispensary at the site of the old Rainforest Cafe 605 N. Clark St. Brian Rich/Sun-Times

He has since become a squeaky wheel raising questions about the legality of the plan and organizing neighbors who feel another dispensary could tank property values and further drive up crime in the affluent neighborhood close to the Loop. “The neighborhood has just gone to pot” he said.

A decisive zoning hearing is set for Friday setting up a David and Goliath fight with Brown going against a clouted pot firm hoping to open a dispensary at 605 N. Clark St.

Brown said he will argue that the plan is fraught with issues and would set a dangerous precedent for future marijuana businesses.

The company behind the proposal Progressive Treatment Solutions ran into problems even before Brown got involved.

They had to scuttle an earlier plan to move an existing dispensary into the building conceding it was illegal shortly after the Sun-Times reported on the issue last April.

Under state law a dispensary can’t open within 1500 feet of an existing pot shop unless it’s owned by a so-called social equity applicant a designation created to bolster minority ownership.

At least four weed stores have already opened in that area and PTS didn’t fit the bill as a social equity firm.

So the Palatine-based company went back to the drawing board teaming with a social equity firm called Bio-Pharm that scored a conditional license in a state-run lottery.

But Brown successfully won a delay to the plans in August when the companies sought a special use permit from the zoning board. An economic disclosure form for the building owner included information about PTS not the owner.

Another paperwork issue delayed the next scheduled hearing on Oct. 21: Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy had listed PTS as the sole applicant in recommending approval of the site.

Brown maintains that the joint venture flies in the face of the law establishing the social equity program because PTS doesn’t hold the dispensary license.

Under a management agreement PTS will operate a Consume brand dispensary at the site using the license held by Bio-Pharm. Such agreements were only allowed by state rules that were revised in August — four months after the joint application to the zoning board.

“I think it’s a classic case of trying to not follow the rules and trying to be as sneaky as you can” he said.

The companies have pushed back hard on some of Brown’s key claims even objecting to the admittance of a lengthy PowerPoint presentation he plans to use during his testimony.

“It contains misstatements outright falsehoods outdated information and forms and irrelevant and hearsay statements many of which don’t even pertain to this matter” attorney Mara Georges former Mayor Richard M. Daley’s longtime corporation counsel wrote to city officials on Nov. 14.

During a contentious community meeting Bio-Pharm’s chief operating officer Kevin Munroe explained how the company qualified: His father Michael F. Munroe Jr. had been arrested for weed in the 1970s.

The elder Munroe is Bio-Pharm’s majority owner and the chief executive of Pickens-Kane which touts itself as “the largest commercial relocation company.” Both he and his son are white.

PTS’ newly installed CEO Terry Peterson is Black and has emerged as the face of the company which has 11 dispensaries spread across three states and a cultivation center in Illinois.

Peterson also served in the Daley administration and was the 17th Ward alderperson.

The company is also led by David Flood whose politically connected family owns Flood Brothers Disposal a trash-hauling company that has held lucrative contracts with city agencies.

Spokesman Rob Nash said the companies have engaged stakeholders and altered their the plan to provide free parking an “unprecedented security presence” and “significant design improvements to ensure our retail location will be a benefit to the community.”

“We understand some individual residents are concerned with the establishment of retail cannabis outlets” he said. “But our track record and the collective experience of the industry in Illinois has demonstrated cannabis dispensaries are a net benefit to the communities in which they are located provided additional security and ‘eyes on the street’ creating meaningful jobs and career opportunities and producing millions of dollars in tax revenue.

“PTS-BioPharm will be a great neighbor to River North residents.”

Prudential has a long-standing commitment to the military community which includes veterans as well as active military members and their families and caregivers.

This is what that commitment looks like.

Improving financial health and well-being

These efforts align with the company’s vision to expand access to investing insurance and retirement security and focus on building wealth for the military community.

Over the past 12 years Prudential has provided more than $25 million in grants sponsorships and financial wellness support to organizations. These groups include:

Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) which provides care for those grieving the death of a military or veteran family member.

The Elizabeth Dole Foundation which supports financial wellness for military and veteran caregivers.

The GI Go Fund a Newark New Jersey-based nonprofit that Prudential helped to establish a small-business incubator for Veterans. It also operates a national database to link employers with Veterans for quality employment.

Beyond that since 2019 more than 7100 members of the military community have attended 300-plus financial wellness seminars. Last year in a first-of-its-kind partnership Prudential joined forces with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to lead 26 free financial wellness seminars. To date these have been attended by more than 4000 veterans transitioning service members and their families.

Prioritizing career growth

Prudential also offers fellowships to employment for veterans transitioning military caregivers and spouses through the Hiring Our Heroes program. So far in 2022 the company has hired four veterans and eight military spouses through this partnership.

In addition the company partners with Hiring Our Heroes to award an organization for their efforts to help post-9/11 veterans and transitioning service members find meaningful employment. Earlier this month Prudential presented Indeed a popular job search platform with the Steve Robinson Post-9/11 Veteran Employment Award named after a Prudential employee who was an Army veteran and vice president of external veterans affairs until his death in 2014.

Offering much-needed emotional support

In light of the mental health challenges faced by the military community — including a suicide rate that jumped more than 40% from 2015 to 2021 according to the U.S. Department of Defense — Prudential’s VETNET business resource group is prioritizing emotional support for its members. It leads Table Talks which are candid unrecorded discussions focused on promoting intersectionality with the other business resource groups raising awareness and focusing on mental wellness. A recent Table Talk addressed suicide and post-traumatic stress disorder among other crucial topics.

Eddie Daniel Premier Accounts executive Group Insurance and VETNET member brought this topic to light when he shared his experience as a veteran who is actively helping to support his fellow service members facing serious mental health challenges.

Focusing on military spouses

Knowing the challenges they face in finding employment because they’re frequently moving due to deployments Prudential has made a concentrated effort to not only hire military spouses but to connect them to meaningful careers. As an example the company funds the Military Spouse Corporate Career Network’s Arm-Me Up Army Military Spouse Career Campaign which provides job placement and career services to military spouses as well as family members and caregivers.

Prudential has been recognized for its long-standing body of work. Just last year the company received the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award the highest recognition given by the U.S. government to employers for their support of their employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve. In recent years Prudential has also received The Military Friendly® Employer Award (for four years running) and has been on the Best for Vets: Employers – Military Times list. The company was recently named a Top 10 Military Spouse Friendly Employer for the second year in a row.

Peaches a service dog ceremoniously dropped the puck at the New Jersey Devils – Arizona Coyotes game last weekend. Prudential and the New Jersey Devils recognized current and former military service members at the 12th annual Military Appreciation Night presented by Prudential. More than 200 active-duty service members were in attendance and the event helped raise funds for the GI Go Fund which aids service members transitioning back to civilian life and Paws of War which provides veterinary care for service animals for veterans and first responders living with disabilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VuY2UuY29tL25ld3MvbW9uZXktY2FyZWVyL3JvYmVydC1mLXNtaXRoLXBydWRlbnRpYWwtaGJjdS1zdHVkZW50LWludmVzdG1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's Richest Black Man Robert F.

BERWYN Pa. Nov. 17 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Fiduciary Exchange LLC (FIDx) an integrated technology platform that connects financial professionals to leading insurance companies today announced that it has secured a new round of growth capital. Prudential Financial Inc. (Prudential) and Global Atlantic Financial Group (Global Atlantic) two of the nation's leading insurance companies led the round. Existing investors including Envestnet also participated. Financial terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.

FIDx enables financial professionals to seamlessly include annuities as essential building blocks they can easily incorporate into client portfolios. Its core capabilities include tools and services to comprehensively research and illustrate annuities propose and open accounts and ultimately actively manage annuity holdings as part of their household. FIDx has deep relationships with 17 of the most well-known insurance companies with a wide array of commission-based and fee-based annuity products available. The firm currently has $24 billion in assets on its platform.

""This growth capital will allow FIDx to bring our platform and services to new markets and distribution channels as we help simplify the sale and management of annuities for industry participants"" said Rich Romano CEO of FIDx. ""It will enable us to meet the needs of larger distribution firms with billions of dollars in annual annuity sales looking to make FIDx the operating engine of their annuity businesses.""

According to LIMRA Annuity Research the industry is on pace to achieve record sales numbers with almost $300 billion in annuity sales in 2022; however many financial professionals continue to believe that adding annuities to their clients' portfolios is overly complicated. FIDx's technology platform simplifies the process by removing barriers caused by antiquated technology and disconnected systems.

Prudential and Global Atlantic recognized the importance of streamlining annuity sales and FIDx's integrated platform as a pioneering solution.

""To expand access to retirement security the industry must continue to evolve finding new ways to bring protected investment and income strategies to more wealth managers and customers"" said Dylan Tyson president of Retirement Strategies at Prudential. ""The FIDx platform addresses a major piece in this puzzle and represents the spirit of innovation that the industry needs.""

Paula Nelson Head of Strategic Growth Individual Markets at Global Atlantic said the annuity industry's existing model does not allow financial professionals to seamlessly access and manage annuities holistically on modern wealth management platforms within the context of their overall client portfolios.

""Client purchasing expectations today are very different than they were 20 or even 10 years ago and our industry has ground to make up"" said Nelson. ""FIDx is helping to bridge that gap by creating an experience where all carriers can place products on a platform that connects directly to financial professionals both where and how they prefer to do business.""

An early investor in FIDx Envestnet also believes that the FIDx platform gives financial advisors and their clients powerful benefits. FIDx technology powers Envestnet's Insurance Exchange which is integrated with Envestnet's leading wealth management platform and solutions including MoneyGuide and Tamarac.

""We've continued to dedicate resources to expanding our financial wellness ecosystem and income and protection are an essential part of the future of financial advice"" said Bill Crager CEO of Envestnet. ""Allowing the comparison of annuities side by side with managed accounts and other investments gives financial professionals the tools they need to help their clients achieve a connected intelligent financial life.""

It's no secret that hosting your own wedding requires its own financial planning but just attending a nuptial ceremony — not to mention pre-ceremony festivities — is cutting into personal budgets. In fact 46% of millennials and 48% of Gen Z say spending on friends' and family members' weddings baby showers or other celebrations is getting in the way of their personal goals according to a recent survey from Prudential. The younger generations were far more likely than Gen X and baby boomers to say weddings or other events are affecting their personal money goals which include owning a home or having kids. A few factors outside of their control may be making it harder for young people to keep their finances on track but many of these consumers could be doing more to avoid stressing about money.

Age isn't necessarily helping

The current millennial age range — 26 to 41 — might be one of the reasons wedding spending is such a burden. Much of the generation is in their late 20s and 30s right around the time many people get married. Event frequency can certainly impact millennials but younger people may also be behind on saving because they haven't been working — and therefore saving — for as long as the older generations. The economic downturn caused by the pandemic also hurt millennials more than other generations. Even young people who have been able to build up some savings report using that money more frequently than other generations. A quarter of millennials are tapping into their emergency funds at least once a month and 23% say they've done so to pay for a gift or attend an event celebrating a friend or family member's milestone Prudential's survey found. ""I think it's a combination of everything coming at us with Covid especially the last couple of years that might be why you're seeing a higher number [of millennials] dipping into savings because of these events versus other generations"" says Brandon Goldstein a financial planner at Prudential who is a millennial himself and says he's been to 10 weddings so far this year. The survey also found 39% of millennials report having no emergency savings and half say they regularly run out of money and have to rely on credit cards or family for financial support.

The Dayton’s Project debuts its second annual Winter Maker’s Market today with twice as many independent vendors as last year and some bigger Minnesota brands like Red Wing Shoes Faribault Mill and Sota Clothing. The windows of the historic Nicollet Mall building will once again be dressed up for the holidays and to really amp up the department store nostalgia: Dayton’s Project is bringing back Santa Bear a Christmas collectible from the glory days.

Last year the holiday maker’s market was intended to create some buzz around the $350 million redevelopment of iconic Dayton’s building and bring people downtown to see it for the first time since Macy’s closed to shoppers in 2017. The market provided a high-profile sales floor for small local brands including many owned by women and minority entrepreneurs. But the bigger hope on the part of 601W developers of the 1 million square foot project was that a popup market occupying the gleaming first floor space would help potential permanent tenants see the possibilities.

Another year has passed and still there are no permanent retail tenants in the building. The long-promised food hall has yet to materialize. The former J.B. Hudson jewelry store space designated to become a restaurant stands empty. Throughout the entire 12-floor building just about 77000 square feet of office space has been leased to four tenants leaving 773000 square feet vacant.

“No one wanted to make any decisions in 2021” said Cailin Rogers spokesperson for the Dayton’s Project. “It’s moving faster now. I’m excited about some of the names in the pipeline.”

But the Dayton’s Project hasn’t announced a name since Prudential Financial leased 28000 square feet in September. And Rogers isn’t naming any other names yet.

She did say in a recent interview with TCB that the Andrew Zimmern-curated food hall—one of the first buzz-worthy amenities announced way back in 2017 and stalled due to the pandemic—is tip toeing forward. Construction is about 80% complete and despite rumors to the contrary Rogers said developers are not planning to wait for more office tenants to be signed before opening the food hall. Still they have yet to set a date and continue to carefully monitor downtown traffic patterns.

“If it opened today we don’t think it would be successful” Rogers said. “We can’t go faster than folks are coming downtown.”

Zimmern’s food hall team is in touch with food vendors—some of whom have gone out of business since the project was first announced; others that are on standby waiting for a green light. Rogers said there’s a “qualitative aspect” to setting an open date for a Dayton’s Project food hall. “Is there excitement? Do we see people asking about it on social media? Are people feeling safe about downtown Minneapolis? We’re not quite there but we feel a big civic responsibility to bring downtown back.”

There’s also the financial responsibility: according to loan terms building owner 601W has until Nov. 1 of 2023 to lease 400000 square feet of the Dayton’s Project. Rogers said she expects several new tenants to be announced in the coming months and that could include skyway level retail.

“The bottom line” said Rogers “601W are creative dealmakers. We have very smart very capable dedicated people thinking about these things every day. We don’t have it solved but we’re getting there.”"

As COP27 comes to an end I am encouraged by the unity I witnessed as nations joined together to honestly discuss our climate change progress and the long road we still must travel to net-zero. While a daunting task I find myself hopeful that the pledges made and the ideas exchanged at this gathering lead to real-world solutions. I am also honored that so many were encouraged and challenged by the work we are doing at TerraPower.

Last weekend I joined U.S. Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry and other dignitaries as they announced Project Phoenix which will promote the coal-to-nuclear transition across Europe. While there is widespread acknowledgment in scientific communities about the necessity of making the coal-to-nuclear transition TerraPower is the first and only developer in the world to have a coal-to-nuclear project underway with our Natrium demonstration plant.

I also had the privilege of participating in a fireside chat with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. We discussed the role of nuclear in reaching our climate goals as well as the leadership position our country is taking in policy incentives energy justice and large-scale demonstrations as we commercialize new nuclear technologies domestically and internationally. The benefit and necessity of advanced nuclear energy is at the forefront of global conversations about reaching net-zero. Studies continue to show that we will not make our climate goals without nuclear energy in the mix.

Consistent with conversations across COP27 events our discussion ended with Secretary Granholm offering a call to action to forge ahead on deployment of advanced nuclear and to count on the U.S. government and DOE’s full support.

Making the Transition

With the massive wave of planned fossil fuel plant retirements across the globe and the increasing demand for energy there is an opportunity for innovative nuclear designs to ease the global clean energy transition.

Making the transition from fossil fuel-reliant grids to carbon-free energy is a challenge that continues to warrant our full attention—and nuclear energy was front of mind at COP. The International Atomic Energy Agency had a large presence for the first time in event history with its #Atoms4Climate pavilion. And during the event the Nuclear Energy Institute announced the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact a global coalition with the goal of building a just and affordable energy transition which TerraPower is proud to participate in.

Many studies including one from the Department of Energy continue to point out the many benefits for advanced nuclear deployment in historic energy-producing communities with retiring fossil-fuel infrastructure.

TerraPower’s Natrium reactor and integrated energy system is well-suited for co-location near retiring coal plants. Our technology utilizes existing coal plant infrastructure including access to cooling water and electrical transmission which allows TerraPower to reduce both construction costs and impact on communities. Additionally operating in communities that understand energy production are comfortable with large generation projects and have a highly skilled workforce are substantial benefits to developers.

Our Natrium demonstration plant will serve as the first major step toward the global availability of innovative nuclear technology ushering in a new era of carbon-free dispatchable power. Upon completion it will be a full-scale operating commercial plant sending power to the grid this decade.

There is increased excitement in the deployment of Gen-IV reactors. A recently released Bank of America COP27 report talks about the potential for nuclear energy to not only meet climate targets but also to aid economies through this transition. TerraPower has experienced this enthusiasm firsthand; We closed a $830 million fundraise round this year with extensive interest from companies in joining our investor base and we signed on to study the potential deployment of up to five additional Natrium reactors in the PacifiCorp territory our utility partner on our Natrium demonstration.

Now Is the Time for Action

The challenges of energy poverty energy security and climate change three of the biggest problems facing humanity today require us to find responsible ways to deploy advanced nuclear technologies. Study after study shows that the optimum way to complete a carbon-free grid is with 20 to 30 percent nuclear energy with the other 70 to 80 percent coming from renewables.

To accelerate the energy transition developers regulators and politicians must work in tandem to support the global deployment of Gen-IV nuclear technologies. We need governments to invest and collaborate in large-scale deployment which will promote private-sector investment in scalable clean energy innovation and adoption. Public-private partnerships like the U.S. ARDP and France 2030 are essential for helping free world companies overcome first-of-a-kind costs and demonstrate new technologies. These partnerships invigorate labor markets supply chains and technology innovators all of which are vital to bringing new reactors to market.

The continual theme at COP has been that it is time to move beyond pledges and into implementation. It is evident that we can’t make substantial progress toward our clean energy goals without global effort to advance scalable new technologies. At this point in time given the finite and narrowing window we have to address climate change there is no time like the present.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlzc25hdGlvbmFsbGFiLm9yZy9zcGFjZXgtY3JzLTI2LXN0ZW0tcmVzZWFyY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpaceX CRS-26 to Launch with Student Research,"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER (FL) November 17 2022 – When SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket launches on its next mission to the International Space Station (ISS) the Dragon spacecraft will be loaded with dozens of investigations to be conducted in space many of which are designed by students. These experiments sponsored by the ISS National Laboratory are part of an effort to excite and engage the next generation of scientists by enabling students to go beyond the classroom and conduct experiments in space.

SpaceX’s upcoming 26th Commercial Resupply Services mission (SpaceX CRS-26) will carry student-designed experiments developed through ISS National Lab educational partner programs such as the STARWard STEM program and Student Spaceflight Experiments Program. These student-led investigations span a variety of research topics from studying microgravity’s effects on the germination of seeds to examining how spaceflight affects turmeric plants (a common herb that has medicinal properties) and evaluating microbial solutions for food waste in space.

Students from Moreno Valley California are sending carrot seeds to the ISS to study how microgravity affects the germination process. To date astronauts on the ISS have successfully harvested a variety of leafy plants such as lettuce and bok choy along with chili peppers. Results from this student investigation will provide valuable data on whether carrots could be a good crop to grow in space.

Another student-led project aims to examine how microgravity affects the medicinal properties of the turmeric plant. Terrestrially turmeric has been found to improve brain function and reduce the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. An experiment designed by a group of hearing-impaired students from Mary McArthur Elementary School in North Carolina will evaluate whether microgravity enhances or reduces the medicinal properties of turmeric. Results could prove beneficial not only for astronauts on long-duration missions but also for people on Earth.

To find ways to more efficiently decompose food matter and reduce waste on Earth a group of students from Michigan proposed an experiment that analyzes how blueberries decompose in microgravity. Results could help researchers better understand gravity’s role in the decomposition process which could have implications for future space agriculture programs as well as agricultural processes on Earth.

Additionally three payloads supported by the Girl Scouts of America and Space Kids Global will look at how brine shrimp (more commonly known as sea monkeys) move and behave in space the effects of microgravity on ant behaviors and plant growth in low Earth orbit.

These projects and many more will fly on SpaceX CRS-26 which is targeted to launch from Kennedy Space Center no earlier than November 21 at 4:19 p.m. EST. This mission will include more than 20 ISS National Lab-sponsored payloads. To learn more about all ISS National Lab-sponsored research on SpaceX CRS-26 please visit our launch page.

As part of a rejiggering of the Liberty universe it is also creating a new tracking stock called Liberty Live to house its stake in Live Nation.

Liberty Live would join reconfigured Liberty Sirius XM and Liberty Formula One tracking stocks. These are specialized equities that highlight a specific division or segment of a business but where outside investors have little or no control. They became big in the 1990s and have been a hallmark of Malone a former telco and cable titan and highly regarded investor and financial engineer. Liberty’s holdings over the years have touched much of media including a big stake in Warner Bros. Discovery.

The Braves’ assets are also currently held in a tracking stock which would go away.

Liberty CEO Greg Maffei said the operations “will provide greater investor choice and enable targeted investment and capital-raising through more focused currencies while maintaining an optimal capital structure for Liberty Media.” It will also preserve “optionality” with respect to subsidiary SiriusXM and Liberty’s stake in Live Nation.

The split calls for the redemption of Liberty Media’s existing Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for common stock of a newly formed company to be called Atlanta Braves Holdings. That would house all the businesses assets and liabilities currently attributed to the Braves Group including Braves Holdings owner-operator of the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club some assets and liabilities of the Atlanta Braves’ stadium and mixed-use development project The Battery Atlanta and corporate cash.

Terms: In connection with the split Liberty Media would redeem each outstanding share of its Series A Series B and Series C Liberty Braves common stock for one share of the corresponding series of common stock of Atlanta Braves Holdings so Liberty Media and Atlanta Braves Holdings would be separate publicly traded companies.

The “intergroup interests” in the Braves Group held by Liberty Media’s existing Liberty SiriusXM Group and Formula One Group would be “settled and extinguished” in the split but how hasn’t yet been determined.

Liberty Media would then create a new tracking stock group the Liberty Live Group.

Liberty Media expects its reclassified Liberty SiriusXM common stock new Liberty Formula One common stock and new Liberty Live common stock to trade on the Nasdaq or OTC Markets. The stock symbols for the first two won’t change. Liberty Live’s A B and C common stock will trade under LLYVA LLYVB and LLYVK respectively.

Liberty Media stockholders must the transactions which is also subject to tax counsel a signoff by Major League Baseball and a ruling by the IRS.

The split-off of the Braves can go forward even without the eventual reclassification of the tracking stocks.

PTC has announced a plan to acquire ServiceMax for $1.46 billion to extend its closed-loop PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) strategy into downstream Enterprise Asset Management and Field Service Management.

The purchase from SilverLake Partners will be funded in two stages - $808 million paid on close of deal and $650 million to be paid in October 2023. The deal is subject to regulatory approval but is intended to close in January 2023.

Breaking down the reasons for the acquisition the second major gambit that PTC has made this year CEO Jim Heppelmann argues:

The ServiceMax acquisition will fit nicely into our ongoing program of performing while transforming. As a sizeable pure SaaS business ServiceMax is completely aligned with our SaaS initiative. And as a key service system of record it will add depth to the already successful service dimension of our PLM strategy. With ServiceMax on board we'll be in a position to lean in harder on what we call Service Lifecycle Management or SLM.

PTC has gained category leadership in the PLM space he adds but ServiceMax will bolster that position and help to move into the next phase of expansion:

The PLM market is growing double digits which might be higher than you expect. This is because certain sub-segments of the PLM big picture like ALM SLM and IoT are growing substantially faster than mainstream PLM. PTC has strong positions in each of these sub-segments. ServiceMax is expected to add about $148 million on a trailing 12 month basis to our PLM software revenue. Therefore the addition of ServiceMax will increase our PLM category leadership while helping us maintain our growth rate…The CAD and PLM markets we serve are large and have healthy growth rates.

Digital transformation

Having ServiceMax in the fold will materially increase PTC's TAM (Total Addressable Market) Heppelmann explains at a time when the macro-environment demands change:

Digital transformation has been the key driver of the market's accelerating growth rate. The investment in digital transformation is massive and about a third of it more than $500 billion per year is being deployed by manufacturing companies. Manufacturers are investing a lot because they're under pressure. The hybrid workforce doesn't work with paper processes and digital product data has to be both accessible and managed. Public companies of all types are being pressured to address climate change and industrial companies are generally significant offenders. They have a lot of room for improvement but they can't move the needle much without analyzing their products and the manufacturing and service processes those products employ. Meanwhile software is eating the world and whether it's embedded controls digital user experience or IoT-enabled conductivity more and more product engineering is done in software every year. On top of all that due to COVID semiconductor shortages we've seen the pressures that supply chain issues are putting on product development and manufacturing.

All of this drives a need for the type of offerings that PTC has in its portfolio he goes on:

PLM in particular has changed from a ‘nice to have’ to a ‘must have’ for manufacturing companies of all types. PTC’s strategy is perfectly aligned to the digital transformation needs of industrial companies. Our logo tells the story - the black part is a P representing the physical world; the green part is a D representing the digital world; the shape is a ying yang symbol which means that physical and digital counterbalance and complement each other in a special way. At PTC we've reduced this complex interrelationship to three simple words - digital transforms physical.

Long game

As to where ServiceMax will fit in Heppelmann reveals that this acquisition has been a long time coming from PTC’s point of view:

Our interest in ServiceMax stems from the fact that connected service is one of the killer vertical solutions for Industrial IoT. We launched our original partnership with ServiceMax in 2015 even buying an equity stake in the company. Unfortunately an interloper stepped in and derailed our plans. General Electric [GE] surprised everybody by purchasing ServiceMax in 2017 for a very high price. At first we thought our partnership would survive but GE soon made it clear that ServiceMax would serve their Predix strategy and not PTC and they cancelled the partnership unilaterally. The only good that came of it was a nice return on our equity investment.

There’s clearly no love lost here still as he comments:

Being part of GE Digital was very unhealthy for ServiceMax.Two years later after GE Digital had imploded a damaged ServiceMax was carved back out of GE by Silver Lake Partners. It took Silver Lake several years to re-build a business including bringing on a new leadership team. But by 2021 ServiceMax was very healthy again and was just days from launching an IPO where PTC was again planning to invest as a strategic partner. After the IPO market collapsed Silver Lake agreed to sell PTC the business at terms that we all like.

But the way events rolled out had an impact on PTC’s plans he notes:

We originally got into this partnership with ServiceMax to drive cross sell. We had integrated our products together we were starting to make joint sales calls we were building a nice pipeline and were really pretty excited about it. And then that was interrupted as I described and kind of we lost a lot of momentum there. We went back to the drawing board. At that point we still had the IoT business and the AR business so it was just a question of priorities. We had a strategy for SLM that was supposed to have ServiceMax in the middle of it and suddenly that strategy didn't exist.

So this has been a long game to date but one that’s worth the wait says Heppelmann:

The reason we've been pursuing ServiceMax for so long is that it fits perfectly into the service or SLM part of our PLM strategy. ServiceMax will be the anchor system of record for products in the field which knits together our whole SLM story across the many different service-related assets PTC has acquired over time...ServiceMax is doing well because they offer a wide range of capabilities all running on the Salesforce platform that work together to address the entire range of service needs a customer has from contract management to install base management to the scheduling and utilizations of parts crews and contractors in the service process. ServiceMax is the missing ingredient in our SLM story. ServiceMax is designed for companies who need to deliver asset-centric service. That means companies who can't service a given product without knowing a lot about that specific product's serial number. Contrast that to the Verizon truck that can come to your home and fix your cable problem without knowing anything about you or your home or the hardware you have because it's all disposable commodity stuff anyway. They only need to know your address and have somebody let them in.

That Salesforce angle

And there’s a useful Salesforce angle here in play he attests with ServiceMax built on the Force.com platform:

We really like the Salesforce angle and believe we can drive cross sell in both directions here. Obviously Salesforce has a proven SaaS platform with a massive installed base. Salesforce CRM manages the 360 degree view of the customer; PTC manages the 360 degree view of the product or asset; ServiceMax bridges these worlds because it knows which products are at which customers what their service needs are how to perform that service and what parts the technician will need to bring along. I think that choosing PTC for PLM will make incrementally more sense for Salesforce customers and choosing Salesforce CRM will make incrementally more sense for B2C customers. I expect that PTC will be able to help take the ServiceMax partnership with Salesforce to an elevated level.

He adds:

We have zero - zero! - interest in re-platforming this thing off Salesforce. We actually think the Salesforce platform's just fine. The cost structure of using that platform is pretty fair. And we think it's frankly a nice bridge to that massive customer base. One of the things that got GE into trouble is they started to talk about re-platforming ServiceMax onto Predix and that didn't go over well. First of all Salesforce didn't like it. And the second thing is that customers of ServiceMax are typically customers of Salesforce. They didn't want it to be re-platformed. So we have zero interest in doing that. We're not even going to have that conversation internally.

As to how PTC intends to integrate Salesforce’s platform and its own Atlas platform he explains:

When software runs in the cloud whether it runs on one cloud two clouds three clouds you don't really know. So it's very easy for us to deliver an experience to a customer that appears 100% integrated even if part of it is running on Salesforce and part of it is running on Atlas. And so that's how we will proceed. By the way the user interface of ServiceMax looks like the user interface of Salesforce because normally you're running it inside Salesforce. So we won't try to even change that. There's a look and feel there that makes sense. We'll integrate these products together in the best way possible. We need to do a lot of design work. For all these 'gun-jumping' [regulatory] rules and so forth we're not actually allowed to do all that work prior to closing the deal. The good news is we did it all five years ago. We actually built all these integrations five years ago. We just need to dust them off update them and talk about what else can we do going forward?

My take

All good things come to those who wait…

This latest stage in the ServiceMax story came somewhat out of the blue but the pitch from PTC’s Heppelmann is a compelling one. That Salesforce angle is going to be one to watch. That said overall assuming this gets the regulatory approval it needs this acquisition and its aftermath will be one to keep an eye on in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx3LmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTEvbGF0aGFtLXdhdGtpbnMtYWR2aXNlcy1wdGMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tc2VydmljZW1heC1zaWx2ZXItbGFrZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latham & Watkins Advises on PTC's Acquisition of ServiceMax From Silver Lake,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx3LmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTEvbGF0aGFtLXdhdGtpbnMtYWR2aXNlcy1wdGMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tc2VydmljZW1heC1zaWx2ZXItbGFrZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60EC29AB0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx3LmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTEvbGF0aGFtLXdhdGtpbnMtYWR2aXNlcy1wdGMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tc2VydmljZW1heC1zaWx2ZXItbGFrZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcnJpY2suY29tL2VuL0luc2lnaHRzLzIwMjIvMTEvU2VjdGlvbi00NVgtb2YtdGhlLUluZmxhdGlvbi1SZWR1Y3Rpb24tQWN0LU5ldy1UYXgtQ3JlZGl0cy1BdmFpbGFibGUtdG8tQmF0dGVyeS1NYW51ZmFjdHVyZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act: New Tax Credits Available to Battery Manufacturers,"The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA” or the ""Act”) introduces several provisions which may well be of interest to battery manufacturers. Most of these are contained in the new “Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit” (“PTC”) provisions of the Act. This is IRC Section 45X.

The climate-related incentive provisions of the IRA fall into two broad categories: those that are related to investment in property and those that are related to production of a product. Unlike the Act’s Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit under IRC Section 48C which provides tax relief on investments in qualifying advanced energy projects the PTC is based on the quantity of eligible components produced and sold by a taxpayer to an unrelated person in the taxable year. It covers a number of important areas including the domestic production and sale of qualifying solar wind inverter and battery components. It also provides for a credit equal to 10% of the cost of “critical minerals.” The Congressional Research Service estimates that the tax relief available under the PTC will cost the United States upwards of $31 billion.

Tax Credit for Production of Battery Components and Critical Minerals

The PTC applies to the production of cathode and anode materials used in lithium-ion batteries as well as to critical battery minerals.

Provided production of the battery components occurs in the United States and that the components are sold after December 31 2022 and prior to January 1 2030 a 10% credit (measured as a percentage of total cost of production) is available for the production of electrode active materials. The credit begins phasing down in 2030 in increments of 25 percent per year and is not available for components sold after 2032. To qualify for the credit the sale must be made to an unrelated person.

In the case of integrated components a person is treated as having sold an eligible component to an unrelated person if the component is integrated incorporated or assembled into another eligible component which is sold to an unrelated person. A 10% credit is likewise available for the production of critical minerals. The credit is also measured as a percentage of total cost of production.

What are Critical Minerals?

The following 50 minerals when converted or purified to the specified purity levels are considered “applicable critical minerals” for purposes of the new Section 45X tax credits:

aluminum

antimony

arsenic

barite

beryllium

bismuth

cerium

cesium

chromium

cobalt

dysprosium

erbium

europium

fluorspar

gadolinium

gallium

germanium graphite

hafnium

holmium

indium

iridium

lanthanum

lithium

lutetium

magnesium

manganese

neodymium

nickel

niobium

palladium

platinum

praseodymium

rhodium rubidium

ruthenium

samarium

scandium

tantalum

tellurium

Terbium

thulium

tin

titanium

tungsten

vanadium

ytterbium

yttrium

zinc

zirconium

Tax Credit for Production of Battery Cells and Battery Modules

A tax credit is also included for the production of battery cells and battery modules in the United States based on the capacity in kilowatt hours of the battery cell or module. The credit in the case of a battery cell is based on the capacity of the cell up to $35 per kWh and in the case of a module is based on the capacity of the module up to $10 per kWh (or in the case of a battery module that does not use battery cells $45 per kWh). For a 75kWh battery pack this means that there could be a tax credit of up to $2625 ($35 per kWh) for the maker of the battery cells and up to $750 for the maker of the modules ($10 per kWh). The credit is eligible for direct payment from Treasury and the right to the credit can be sold for cash to third parties (in both cases subject to certain limitations).

Impacts of Credits in the EV Market

The market for electric vehicles (""EVs”) is expected to be greatly expanded under the new clean vehicle tax credits established by the IRA. This expansion reflected in changes to IRC Section 30D is expected to positively impact battery manufacturers. Under the IRA tax credits for EVs are now available but there are restrictions based on where the batteries are built and where the critical materials in the batteries are mined recycled or processed. There is an important exclusion discussed below where “foreign entities of concern” are involved in the extraction of materials used in the manufacture of the battery or where the components contained in the battery are manufactured or assembled by a foreign entity of concern. We expect that automobile manufacturers and the Internal Revenue Service will develop certification requirements to ensure compliance with these requirements.

1. To receive the $3750 critical minerals tax credit the vehicle’s battery must contain a threshold percentage (in value) of critical minerals that were extracted or processed in the United States or in a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement or which were recycled in North America.

The threshold percentage is 40% through the end of 2023 then increasing to 50% in 2024 60% in 2025 70% in 2026 and 80% after 2026.

2. To receive the $3750 battery components portion of the credit the percentage of the battery’s components manufactured or assembled in North America would have to meet threshold amounts. For vehicles placed in service through the end of 2023 the threshold percentage is 50%. The percentage increases to 60% for 2024 and 2025 70% for 2026 80% for 2027 90% for 2028 and 100% after 2028.

Neither credit is indexed for inflation.

In recognition of supply chain vulnerabilities under the IRA a clean vehicle placed in service after December 31 2024 will not qualify for the EV tax credit if it contains critical minerals that were extracted processed or recycled by a “foreign entity of concern.” In addition the IRA prohibits taking the EV tax credit on any vehicle placed in service after December 31 2023 with respect to which any of the components contained in such battery were manufactured or assembled by a “foreign entity of concern.” While legislation has been introduced to delay the effect of these provisions passage of such legislation is not yet assured.

On balance the Act provides several exciting opportunities for battery manufacturers. The Internal Revenue Service has recently issued a Notice seeking comment on several issues.

Additional guidance from the Internal Revenue Service is likely to be forthcoming.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ib3N0b24vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzExLzE3L3B0Yy1hY3F1aXJlcy1zZXJ2aWNlbWF4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PTC buys Calif. software maker for $1.46B - Boston Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2022/11/17/ptc-acquires-servicemax.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ib3N0b24vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzExLzE3L3B0Yy1hY3F1aXJlcy1zZXJ2aWNlbWF4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

These cores will be arranged in clusters and marketed under a new brand: Oryon. Thus future Qualcomm Snapdragon processors will use these Oryon cores or so Qualcomm hopes. These chips will be aimed at Windows-on-Arm laptops as well as mobile devices and other types of systems.

The US chip designer had hoped to have samples of Oryon-powered silicon in the hands of PC makers by now but wasn't able to. We're told these components are now due to ship in products by the end of 2023 or early 2024. That's a bit of a delay for those looking forward to Qualcomm's next generation of microprocessors for laptops and PCs.

Today's Qualcomm Snapdragon system-on-chips use Kryo CPU units which are made up of cores designed by and licensed from Arm. Qualcomm in the past designed its own custom Arm-compatible cores and lately has relied on off-the-shelf Arm cores. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 launched just yesterday uses standard Arm Cortex cores.

Qualcomm is likely hoping its custom cores tailored and architectured just the way it wants them will allow it to better compete against processors used in other portable systems such as Macs with Apple's custom silicon. The move to custom cores cuts out Arm to a large extent and gives Qualcomm greater control over its hardware and software stack. No further details were given about Oryon which was teased at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii today.

Oryon was we're told designed by Nuvia the Silicon Valley startup Qualcomm bought for $1.4 billion in 2021. Nuvia was creating custom Arm-compatible CPU cores for servers but its designs can be adapted for other markets such as personal computing. The engineers working on those blueprints and the designs themselves were absorbed into Qualcomm which made it clear it wanted to use Nuvia's technology and know-how to drive its future chips.

Indeed Oryon was teased on stage in the past hour by Nuvia cofounder and semiconductor world veteran Gerard Williams.

As we've previously covered Arm isn't happy with this situation. In a lawsuit against Qualcomm filed earlier this year Arm claimed Qualcomm needed to obtain Arm's permission to transfer in and use Nuvia's designs as per the fine print in Nuvia's license with Arm to use its architecture.

Qualcomm didn't obtain this consent according to Arm and so Arm terminated Nuvia's licence and demanded all the Nuvia designs be destroyed and not used in new products.

The Snapdragon goliath said it complied with this demand but Arm is concerned that Nuvia's Arm-derived blueprints and technologies are still in use at Qualcomm. If that's so says Arm Qualcomm would be in breach of its own licenses with Arm which means Arm may cancel all of Qualcomm's rights to use its technologies which would be a major problem: Qualcomm still relies on Arm-licensed cores and architecture for its chips.

Qualcomm has in response argued that Arm wanted to exploit this situation – the requirement for permission – to extract extra fees and higher royalties from Qualcomm and that this consent wasn't needed anyway. Arm says consent is needed and so the pair are at an impasse.

Softbank-owned Arm is suing Qualcomm for breach of contract and is demanding all of Nuvia's Arm-derived designs are binned and not used in things like say Oryon.

Arm has cited Qualcomm's claims in the media that it intends to use Nuvia's technologies as the basis of its complaint that Qualcomm is breaking its agreements with Arm.

Now Qualcomm executives have gone on stage in a livestreamed keynote and bragged how its Nuvia team has produced for the Snapdragon line ""world-class"" CPU cores that will take on the competition. Qualcomm didn't out and out say it was using the contested Nuvia blueprints.

The stakes in this legal fight continue to grow. ®

Full disclosure: Qualcomm paid for this correspondent's flights and accommodation to cover the Snapdragon Summit in Maui Hawaii today though as should be abundantly clear from our past current and future coverage this will have no effect on our independent reporting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9xdWFsY29tbS1kZWJ1dHMtbGF0ZXN0LWZsYWdzaGlwLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tY2hpcC1hbmQtYS1uZXctYWktcGxhdGZvcm0v0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE3L3F1YWxjb21tLWRlYnV0cy1sYXRlc3QtZmxhZ3NoaXAtc25hcGRyYWdvbi1jaGlwLWFuZC1hLW5ldy1haS1wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm debuts latest flagship Snapdragon chip and a new AI platform,"It’s that time of year again. It can drop 20 degrees on any given day and we’re stuck indoors watching people watch Qualcomm announce new chips and reference designs in sunny Hawaii. The Snapdragon Summit is the component-maker’s annual opportunity to map out its big plans for the next year ahead of the holiday scrum and product deluge of CES and MWC.

It’s an ideal time to pepper the industry with some timeline news items. Many of the major manufacturers are effectively finished announcing hardware for the year and things won’t really ramp up for another couple of months.

The big news is naturally Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. That’s the chip that’s going to power a majority of your flagship Android handsets next year — at least until the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 2 presumably starts rolling out at some point mid-2023.

It’s likely not surprising for those who have been following the space for the last several years that Qualcomm is positioning AI/ML as the centerpiece of its latest system on a chip. With the new Hexagon Processor (that’s a Qualcomm trademark mind) at its center the new system on a chip promises up to 4.35x gains for things like natural language processing.

“This is thanks to the industry’s only Micro Tile Inferencing technique so we can power features like real-time multi-language translation” the company writes. “In other words you can speak into a language translator and have it translated into multiple languages running these complex networks.”

Computational photography is the other big piece there. The system is able to recognize and segment different aspects of an image before the photo is taken. It uses a portrait as an example — breaking up hair clothes the background and a face into different segments. It’s a feature that will no doubt be present in imaging products like Portrait mode in which depth sensing is important.

The first devices with Gen 2 are set to arrive before the end of the year. The list of phone makers signed up for the SoC includes ASUS HONOR iQOO Motorola nubia OnePlus OPPO REDMAGIC Redmi SHARP Sony Corporation vivo Xiaomi XINGJI/MEIZU and ZTE.

Also of note this week is the arrival of Qualcomm’s new augmented reality chip the Snapdragon AR2 Gen 1. The component is designed to power a new generation of slim AR wearables. It’s a low-power solution that sits across different parts of the glasses in order to better distribute its weight.

“We built Snapdragon AR2 to address the unique challenges of headworn AR and provide industry-leading processing AI and connectivity that can fit inside a stylish form factor” Qualcomm’s Hugo Swart said in a release. “With the technical and physical requirements for VR/MR and AR diverging Snapdragon AR2 represents another metaverse-defining platform in our XR portfolio to help our OEM partners revolutionize AR glasses.”

The list of manufacturers developing hardware with the platform includes Lenovo LG Nreal OPPO Pico QONOQ Rokid Sharp TCL Vuzix and Xiaomi.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdy1xdWFsY29tbXMtYWx3YXlzLW9uLWNhbWVyYS1iZWNhbWUtaXRzLWFsd2F5cy1zZW5zaW5nLWNhbWVyYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Qualcomm's 'Always-On Camera' Became Its 'Always-Sensing Camera',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-qualcomms-always-on-camera-became-its-always-sensing-camera on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdy1xdWFsY29tbXMtYWx3YXlzLW9uLWNhbWVyYS1iZWNhbWUtaXRzLWFsd2F5cy1zZW5zaW5nLWNhbWVyYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Find out about screening and how to know whether treatment with Tzield may be right for you.

Finding a cure for type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been a priority in diabetes research for decades. Today’s FDA approval of Tzield brings us potentially one step closer to that cure by providing a way to delay the onset of T1D and marks an impressive milestone in diabetes research.

Tzield developed by Provention Bio is the first and only treatment to delay onset of stage 3 T1D in adults and children aged 8 and older with stage 2 T1D. It is an injectable drug taken once daily for 14 days that binds to and modifies cells in the immune system called T-cells. In people with T1D T-cells destroy the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. With the help of Tzield this self-destructive process is interrupted effectively delaying the onset of T1D by an average of about 2 years.

""This is a historic occasion for the T1D community and a paradigm-shifting breakthrough for individuals aged 8 years and older with stage 2 T1D who now have a therapy approved by the FDA to delay the onset of stage 3 disease” said Ashleigh Palmer co-founder and CEO of Provention Bio in a statement.

“It cannot be emphasized enough how precious a delay in the onset of stage 3 T1D can be from a patient and family perspective; more time to live without and when necessary prepare for the burdens complications and risks associated with stage 3 disease” he said.

Who is eligible to receive Tzield?

Tzield is approved for people who are at high risk for T1D and have abnormal blood sugar levels determined by an oral glucose tolerance test. To meet the criteria for “high risk” a person must have a family history of T1D and a screening test that confirms the presence of at least two specific autoantibodies that indicate that the body is already attacking the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.

There are three stages of type 1 diabetes:

Stage 1. Blood sugar levels are normal and the person experiences no symptoms of T1D but the person has two or more autoantibodies associated with T1D. People who test positive for at least two autoantibodies are almost certain to develop T1D at some point in their lives.

Stage 2. There are no symptoms of T1D but blood sugar levels are not normal and the autoantibodies for T1D persist.

Stage 3. Blood sugar levels are high and the person typically experiences symptoms of T1D (frequent urination dry mouth fatigue and/or diabetic ketoacidosis). T1D is not usually diagnosed until stage 3.

Tzield is indicated for people with a family history of T1D who have stage 2 of T1D. Prior research has revealed that Tzield is not as effective in stage 3 T1D once beta cells have already been destroyed.

Moreover the drug is only approved for people ages 8 and older. This is a significant limitation since many people are diagnosed with T1D before age 8.

How to get tested for type 1 diabetes autoantibodies

Screening for T1D autoantibodies is extremely important for early detection and treatment of the condition. Although people had been reluctant to get screened in the past because there was not much that could be done this new intervention might address the reason for this hesitation.

Here are three ways to get screened:

At-home testing. This is a simple test that can be completed at home and mailed back. If the results are positive a confirmatory test should be taken at a doctor’s office. This test is associated with JDRF’s T1Detect program. The cost of this test is $55 with reduced-cost options for anyone in financial need. TrialNet. This is a clinical trial program that provides free testing to those who have a family connection to T1D. Doctor’s office or lab. A doctor can order a blood test that may be done in the clinic or a lab such as LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics.

People who test positive for two or more autoantibodies will be called to discuss results and develop a plan moving forward.

Provention Bio the manufacturer of Tzield has developed a resource guide about how to get screened for health care professionals and families with type 1 diabetes.

Potential risks

There are potential benefits to delaying T1D with Tzield but there are also risks to taking it or any drug. The most common side effects included decreased levels of certain white blood cells rash and headache. The use of Tzield comes with warnings and precautions including premedicating and monitoring for symptoms of cytokine release syndrome (when the immune system responds too aggressively to an infection or immunotherapy drugs); risk of serious infections; decreased levels of white blood cells; risk of hypersensitivity reactions; the need to administer all age-appropriate vaccinations before starting Tzield; as well as avoiding certain vaccines while using Tzield.

“We will be committed to setting up a registry to monitor Tzield’s long-term safety as well as conducting a pediatric…safety study in stage 2 patients below 8 years of age” said Palmer.

Most people in clinical trials who experienced side effects had mild symptoms that resolved within a few weeks.

How to access Tzield

Once a health care provider confirms eligibility for Tzield and decides with the patient that it is right for that person they will fill out an enrollment form and send it to Provention Bio.

One of the company’s patient navigators from their COMPASS program will then reach out. The patient navigator will be the person’s guide and main point of contact through the rest of the process.

“COMPASS is our in-house patient support program with a staff of dedicated navigators available to answer questions and remove barriers for patients to access Tzield by helping them navigate coverage and reimbursement. This includes administration of our copay assistance program for eligible commercially insured patients to address financial barriers to treatment including costs for both Tzield and its administration” said Jason Hoitt chief commercial officer at Provention Bio.

Tzield cost

The wholesale cost per vial of Tzield is $13850 which translates to $193900 for a 14-vial continuous regimen. Some people may require additional drugs beyond the 14 vials depending on body surface area and weight.

Provention Bio offers patient assistance programs for those without insurance or who are unable to pay for Tzield. Once being prescribed Tzield you and your healthcare provider can enroll in the COMPASS program. The program's patient navigators can help handle any insurance questions and financial assistance. Patients or health care providers can call COMPASS at 844-778-2246 or visit the Tzield website.

What’s next?

Tzield is currently being investigated in a phase 3 clinical trial of children and adolescents ages 8 through 17 within 6 weeks of stage 3 T1D diagnosis to determine if the drug may have benefit in that group.

“We will continue to explore and develop Tzield’s potential in younger patients [and] newly diagnosed patients and investigate whether Tzield could be either re-dosed or combined with other treatments for even greater benefits” said Hoitt.

The HSE will continue outsourcing laboratory services for the processing of cervical cancer tests following the opening of the National Cervical Screening Laboratory (NCSL).

A spokesperson for the HSE told IMT that the Lab — which is located on the campus of the Coombe Woman and Infants’ University Hospital and cost an estimated €20 million to build — will not have capacity to process all cervical cancer tests taken by patients in Ireland; though it will aim to become the ‘main provider’ of laboratory services for cervical testing in the coming years once a sufficient workforce is in place.

“Recruitment of skilled staff will be a top priority for several years as the NCSL increases the number of CervicalCheck samples it receives” said the spokesperson.

“A workforce plan is in place and essential roles in cytopathology virology and medical scientists have been identified. As these key roles are filled the NCSL will work towards becoming the main provider of laboratory services for CervicalCheck over the coming years.”

A secondary laboratory contractor will always remain necessary to ensure resilience in the system and guard against issues which can result from dependence on a single supplier the spokesperson said.

Quality assurance requirements and standards for the Cervical Screening Programme are based on European guidance as set out in the European guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening as well as the HSE’s Standards for Quality Assurance in Cervical Screening the spokesperson added.

The company to conduct the outsourced processing is US-based Quest Diagnostics which provides HPV primary testing with reflex cytology.

The outsourcing of laboratory services has continued since 2018 when it emerged that the health service had provided 206 women with incorrect cervical cancer test results 162 of whom were never informed of any error.

The HSE has outsourced all laboratory services for cervical testing this year the Irish Times reported last month. In the first half of 2022 the health service sent 159206 samples to Quest Diagnostics the same report said.

The HSE and Department of Health project that the NCSL will be open by the end of next month.",,,

The selection is available exclusively at Alaïa’s Petite Boutique on Rue de Moussy and on Resee.com. It will be updated periodically and clients can bring their pre-owned Alaïa pieces to the store to be included in the vintage assortment being offered there and online.

“Through this partnership Alaïa and Resee will deepen their joint commitment to circularity in luxury fashion and their shared essential mission: to offer pieces that have a unique story while contributing positively to the environment” the brands said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

Among the items on sale are a “Tati” dress from spring 1991; a range of leopard and butterfly print pieces from fall 1991 and a leather zip dress from 1986.

“Since our inception nearly 10 years ago archival Alaïa has been a top performer for us on Resee and also a passion for us to source” said Sofia Bernardin cofounder of Resee.

“We could not be more thrilled to be official partners of the brand to be able to provide our customers rich experiences and a direct line to the house. We are honored to celebrate the distinguished legacy of Mr. Alaïa alongside the vision of Mr. Mulier” she added.

Myriam Serrano chief executive officer of Alaïa said the long-term initiative reflected the house’s commitment to circularity and fashion that stands the test time thanks to high levels of craftmanship and couture know-how.

“Alaïa’s creations have always been conceived and regarded as timeless pieces — more than just clothes they are designs that one can keep for a lifetime and pass on for generations” the executive said.

Since founder Azzedine Alaïa passed away in 2017 the house has dabbled with vintage re-editions often prototypes from his vast archives that were never commercialized. In 2020 it launched a wardrobe of Alaïa’s most emblematic designs spanning from 1981 to 2017 called The Editions.

The partnership with Resee comes as the specialist site gears up for expansion. Buoyed by strong global demand for vintage and secondhand high-end goods in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic Resee expects sales to double this year versus 2021 Bernardin told WWD in September. — Joelle Diderich

STARRY COURSE: Gucci has secured one more win in the fashion hospitality game that is increasingly heating up.

Antonio Iacoviello and Massimo Bottura Courtesy of Gucci

After Florence Italy and Beverly Hills California the Gucci Osteria in Tokyo Japan has also turned into a one-Michelin-star culinary destination. The restaurant which opened last year on the fourth level of the Gucci Namiki building in Ginza has been acknowledged in the 2023 edition of the renowned Michelin Guide Tokyo.

Under the leadership of head chef Antonio Iacoviello Gucci Osteria Tokyo explores a contemporary cuisine bringing together Italian gastronomic traditions with local Japanese ingredients and techniques. A traveler and explorer himself Iacoviello inventively reimagined dishes combining both cultures as seen for example in the evocative “The Parmigiana that wants to become a Ramen” and “Babà in Okinawa” delicacies.

The menu also includes signature Gucci Osteria dishes such as the Emilia burger and the tortellini with Parmigiano Reggiano cream.

Iacoviello’s approach is his unique interpretation of the philosophy of Gucci Osteria a format conceived and curated by star chef Massimo Bottura who is also a childhood friend of Gucci president and chief executive officer Marco Bizzarri.

“Since I arrived in Japan I have never missed an opportunity to travel explore and taste trying to combine new experiences and new products with my Italian memory” said Iacoviello who defined the acknowledgement “a dream come true.” He additionally thanked Bottura for entrusting him with the project and credited his team for the “courage patience and sacrifice.”

The fine-dining experience offered by Iacoviello is enhanced by the sophisticated interiors of the restaurant which evoke the design of the seminal Gucci Osteria in Florence. Key elements marking the space include its hand-painted wood flooring vibrant green wood paneling and plush peacock blue velvet chairs.

Gucci Osteria da Massimo Bottura launched at the Gucci Garden in Florence in 2018 followed by the outposts in Beverly Hills and Tokyo in 2020 and 2021 respectively. Earlier this year the format also debuted in Seoul South Korea on the top floor of the Gucci Gaok flagship located in the typically bustling — though it recently faced tragedy with a deadly stampede — Itaewon district. — Sandra Salibian

In stainless steel and ringed with big threatening spikes the dish is part of a new Balenciaga Objects line dropping on Nov. 21 just in time for holiday gifting.

You can feel creative director Demna’s wry humor in the airplane neck pillow with a black hood attached and the Balenciaga coasters branded to resemble a famous Belgian pilsner-style lager.

The Paris-based house is to showcase dozens of products most of them for the home in a campaign called Balenciaga Gift Shop. These range from a kooky bench composed of dozens of printed towels strapped together like a bundle of newspapers to wine and Champagne glasses bearing beer-like Balenciaga logos.

Several of the objects including doormats bathmats a teapot and tableware carry Balenciaga Hotel & Resorts artwork. The dishes are made by Ginori 1735 which like Balenciaga is owned by French fashion group Kering.

Scores of luxury brands have entered the booming pet accessories business recently with Balenciaga offering a harness collar and a yellow leash resembling a tailor’s measuring tape. A plush pink dog bed with a matching blanket brings to mind Bruiser Woods from the “Legally Blonde” films.

Soap lunch boxes vases pillows sippie cups and a gold-plated Triple S sneaker sculpture round out the eclectic range.

According to the house select Balenciaga stores will offer a custom gift-wrapping service for these gifting items featuring silver ribbons and pearlescent packaging. — Miles Socha

Christine’s Campaign: MCM has tapped Christine Quinn as the new face of its holiday campaign. The campaign features a larger-than-life advent calendar that features the brand’s luxury lineup of products.

The campaign was brought to life by director Maya Margolina and showcases MCM’s products including a small Berlin crossbody in a range of colors an MCM fragrance-shaped novelty crossbody bag a holiday-edition MCM eau de parfum and an après-ski capsule including an allover cubic monogram jacquard-knit shimmer top and matching leggings.

Htat LIn Htut was director of photography and the campaign was styled by Billy Lobos.

The campaign has a digital and out-of-home component including the Mr. C. Beverly Hills Hotel bus shelters in targeted neighborhoods in New York City and large impact screens at the terminals at JFK and LAX airports. The advent calendar drops digitally and each day on MCM’s e-commerce site a new product/category will drop. This will be amplified across brand channels. MCM has also assembled a global group of digital creators to bring the product to life across their feeds as well and the campaign will be part of the in-store experience.

“We are thrilled to have Christine as our muse for this festive campaign where our goal of presenting an over-the-top advent calendar that displays our iconic MCM offerings were met by Christine’s playful attitude and energy” said Dirk Schönberg MCM global brand officer.

“It is a dream come true to be the face of the MCM holiday campaign” added Quinn. “As a longtime fan of their iconic logo totes luggage and clothing MCM has always been a staple in my wardrobe. I am so honored to work with such an incredible creative and professional fashion house — from start to finish — and can’t wait for the campaign to come out.”

Quinn a fashion and beauty executive and author starred in Netflix’s hit reality series “Selling Sunset” is the author of “How to Be a Boss Bitch” and appears in the new Marc Jacobs campaign. She hosted the red carpet at the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards in Partnership with Amazon Fashion last week. — Lisa Lockwood

Ghost Flower: To perfumer Beckielou Brown founder of clean scent brand Altra the smell of poetry starts with a single white lily.

Brown has collaborated with photographer and poet Suzannah Pettigrew on the launch of her new fragrance Ghost Flower with accompanying imagery and poetry.

The pair met 20 years ago working at a nightclub called Kabaret’s Prophecy in London.

“I have seen her creative practice develop from her early work to what she is creating today and have loved her work since the beginning. When Altra was in its early stages I knew we wanted to work with different creatives and artists to bring a multi sensory aspect and collaborative energy to what we were creating” Brown said. “Her work for the collaboration came as her response to the scent itself and the conversations around the inspiration I had when creating it. We wanted it to come from her own experience with Ghost Flower rather than a fixed brief.”

Altra has been a work in progress for seven years beginning in Los Angeles California where Brown lived for seven years.

“Initially it was a personal exploration a creative outlet — a way for me to recreate memories and experiment with translating emotions and feelings into this fascinating intangible medium. At that time I wasn’t planning to create a perfume brand but increasingly all I wanted to do was channel my creativity into this area. Initially I was working with a mixed medium pallet of naturals as well as synthetic molecules” Brown added.

Toying with the complexity of natural scents she soon realized there were so few scents with solely natural materials.

To capture the essence of Ghost Flower Brown enlisted Pettigrew who has been writing poetry as a world building practice. She’s just released her debut poetry and photography book “A Sphinx Looking for a Poet.”

“I wanted to draw focus on sensuality both the thrill and the fallout. Often it’s how I remember through erotic markers of the past” Pettigrew explained about the process of producing a special piece of work for the scent she took ideas from the white lily’s burnt orange pollen.

Brown who is both spiritual and superstitious unveiled her brand on Feb. 22 at 11:11 a.m. with the help of her business partner and best friend Bridget Plant.

They had initially planned to launch in 2020 right before the pandemic hit. The pause in time gave them new areas to approach such as digital scent scapes by working with artist George Jasper Stone just as brands were getting increasingly into digital outputs and entering the metaverse.

“We wanted to create a scent and brand experience that was conceptual and exciting but made with meticulously sourced natural ingredients and produced and packaged with minimal impact on our environment” said Brown who has avoided greenwashing language and empty promises within the brand.

She’s fixated on breaking down what sustainable means and has instead drummed up “Profuture” a commitment to mindful production at every stage.

Altra houses four other fragrances: “Altra Skin” “Stone Cold Heart” “Dualist” and “Jasmin XXX.” The liquid contour bottles are refillable with black packaging inspired by Brutalist houses. Prices start from 138 pounds.

The perfume is direct to consumer with a solo stockist in Los Angeles boutique Just One Eye.

Brown said she wants to continue collaborating with different creatives as she readies a new scent for next year. — Hikmat Mohammed

The flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi will bring over 200 luxury and designer brands under one roof.

The 90000 square feet flagship store in Mumbai is expected to be operational by 2024 ABFRL said in a statement on Thursday.

Meanwhile the 65000 square feet store in Delhi expected to be operational in 2025 will be at DLF Emporio one of India’s largest luxury malls. Galeries Lafayette Delhi will complement the current offering at the mall with a set of designer brands across multiple categories.

Ashish Dikshit managing director Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Limited called the partnership a “coming-of-age"" moment for Indian luxury.

“India is now home to a generation of young and affluent consumers with global exposure who are willing to spend on the finer things in life. This is visible in the boom and dynamism of the luxury market. The partnership with Galeries Lafayette is a ringing endorsement of India’s significance as a global luxury market and a future engine of growth for luxury brands"" Dikshit said.

The Mumbai store will be housed across two historic buildings that recently heralded their century at the heritage precinct of Fort. The building is currently being designed by the architectural firm Virgile & Partners who have worked extensively on storied department stores globally. Pike Preston is the advisor on-record for this collaboration.

The move displays both growing aspiration among Indian shoppers as well as attempts by large homegrown conglomerates such as ABFRL and rival Reliance Retail to participate in the luxury retail market. Reliance Retail--through its subsidiaries-- already operates a clutch of high-end and premium brands in India.

The move is part of Galeries Lafayette’s plans to reach more well-heeled shoppers in markets overseas. The store is present in Shanghai Nice and Luxembourg among other key cities.

“We are proud to expand our international footprint in such a prestigious and refined market as India where we believe our brand can benefit from a strong potential.

Global-e reported strong 3Q22 financial results as cross-border e-commerce spending remained well within expectations.

The foreign exchange created a headwind in the quarter costing the Company several points of growth and was responsible for the shortfall in 4Q22 revenue guidance.

GLBE shares could be moderately weak today as the market digests the FX impact and a large customer starts pushing into 1Q23 which was the balance of the 4Q22 revenue guidance shortfall. However net new bookings remain elevated which highlights the secular demand in cross-border e-commerce.

Also on the positive side profitability is improving faster than expected as acquisition synergies occur. Berg reduced his FY23 revenue estimate assuming recession-related weakness in consumer spending.

Keybanc analyst Josh Beck maintained Global E Online with an Overweight and cut the price target from $40 to $30. Global-E beat revenue by an MSD amount comparable to the prior quarter while lowering revenue guidance factoring in worsening FX headwinds and a go-live time shift from 4Q to 1Q.

Beck was encouraged by wins like a Mattel Inc (NASDAQ: MAT) toy brand luxury segment wins and encouraging Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP) partnership progress across both the direct and white-label side.

Beck reduced Street-low revenue estimates factoring in additional FX and macro headwinds which prompts a lower price target.

The Company has demonstrated a clear lean growth mindset and through new logos and execution across both direct and white-label elements of a Shopify partnership is poised to gain further global x-border D2D e-Com market share via a unique open-SaaS platform.

Raymond James analyst Brian Peterson reiterated Global E Online with an Outperform and reduced the price target from $40 to $35. The re-rating followed the 3Q results that exceeded consensus expectations with a below consensus 4Q22 outlook pushing shares lower after hours.

While the challenging macro (including FX) and difficult pandemic comps should persist he continues to see multiple avenues for an above-market growth rate for the foreseeable future (logo growth SHOP partnership geographic expansion and shift towards D2C).

Despite a more measured outlook heading into YE22 he believes GLBE will grow much faster than overall e-commerce over the next several years with several catalysts still in their infancy.

Price Action: GLBE shares traded lower by 13.90% at $21.13 on the last check Thursday.

So much heat that it could damage the cable connections. The issue appears to stem from connectors not fully plugged into the card Nvidia said Friday in an update on its support page.

There are about 50 cases of this happening according to the company. ""We are actively investigating the reports"" Nvidia said in the update. It advises card owners to ensure the cable is firmly secured before plugging the card into the motherboard.

A few owners of the GeForce RTX 4090 cards began sharing pictures of burned cable connections on the Nvidia subreddit just weeks after the card came out. The 12VHPWR adapter is the cable that goes from the computer's power supply to the card and because of the power required to run RTX 4090 a lot of heat builds up especially if the cable bends at a right angle in order to fit the giant card into a PC case.

Nvidia said it's working with its partners to replace the cards affected.

The GeForce RTX 4090 came out last month at a whopping price of $1600. It's one of the best video cards available for PC gaming rigs especially for those gamers who want to play games in 4K.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjd29ybGQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTM4NjA4NC9udmlkaWEtZmluYWxseS1yZXNwb25kcy10by1tZWx0aW5nLXJ0eC00MDkwLWNhYmxlLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnN5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia finally responds to melting RTX 4090 cable controversy,"Nvidia finally broke its silence and says improperly seated 12VHPWR connectors are largely to blame for those GeForce RTX 4090 power cable meltdowns.

The company which thus far has been mum other than to confirm it was investigating the problem issued a statement to Gamers Nexus that also confirmed how many cases it knows of.

“We are actively investigating the reports. We are aware of about 50 cases globally” a company spokesperson told Gamers Nexus editor-in-chief Stephen Burke according to a video Gamers Nexus posted to its YouTube channel Friday morning.

“Our findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card” Nvidia told Burke. “To help ensure the connector is secure we recommend plugging the power dongle into the graphics card first to ensure it’s firmly and evenly plugged in before plugging the graphics card into the motherboard.”

Nvidia officials also told Burke that returned cable adapters all appeared to show wear damage indicating they weren’t fully seated. The company also posted its statement on its customer help page where it shows what a properly inserted cable looks like.

Nvidia’s statement largely seems to back up what Burke and his team discovered yesterday: An excessively loose 12VHPWR connector in the GPU can lead to high temperatures which melts the connector.

In the Gamers Nexus investigation the failed connectors Burke obtained often had physical damage indicating the plug had largely backed out of the GPU. Gamers Nexus also largely concluded that debris from manufacturing as well as debris caused by consumers possibly inserting and removing the connector could possibly cause the RTX 4090 cables to melt but the most likely cause was a loose connector.

Others including Techlab.net.br’s Ronaldo Buassali and Jon Gerow Director of Research at Corsair had done their own testing previously and concluded the connector is well able to handle the current being pushed through it—so long as it is fully connected.

Of course the lingering question is whether the improper insertions stem from an underlying connector design issue or not. With evidence now clear that the cable is capable supporting the power behind it many are wondering if the latch could be improved or not.

Nvidia officials did tell Burke that “We are investigating additional ways to ensure that the connector is secure before powering on the graphics card.”

Other ideas have been floated such as having the cards refuse to post if the sense pins on the plugs are not fully seated. The PCI-SIG group in fact has been said to be considering design changes to the new plug.

Nvidia also responded to concerns by consumers that it would not honor warranties if a consumer uses a “third-party adapter” 12VHPWR connector such as the custom and modded right-angle cables people are buying in hopes of avoiding a melted connector. That raised concerns Nvidia and board partners would then not honor a warranty if the native 12VHPWR connector on a new PSU was used.

In a statement released to PCWorld a company spokesman said the concern was unwarranted. “NVIDIA and our partners are committed to supporting our customers regardless of the cable or power supply used” an Nvidia spokesman said.

Perhaps more importantly Nvidia also told Gamers Nexus that it and partners would honor RMAs from cards damaged by improper insertion. “Anybody who has an issue [relating to this] will be taken care of” the company told Burke. “We’ll expedite an RMA.”

Brad Chacos/IDG Brad Chacos/IDG Brad Chacos/IDG

So how many GeForce RTX 4090 cards suffered from melting connectors? Gamers Nexus reports that board partners have told it 125000 GeForce RTX 4090 cards have been sold which would put the known failure rate at 0.04 percent Burke said.

The statement comes a day after a GeForce RTX 4090 owner apparently filed a class-action suit against Nvidia over the melting connectors according to a report in Tom’s Hardware.

Lucas Genova filed his suit on Nov. 11 and alleges that Nvidia “marketed and sold the RTX 4090 with a defective and dangerous power cable plug and socket which has rendered consumers’ cards inoperable and poses a serious electrical and fire hazard for each and every purchaser.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4LzIzNDY2OTc0L252aWRpYS1ydHgtNDA5MC1wb3dlci1jYWJsZS0xMnZocHdyLW1lbHQtYnVybi1wbHVnZ2VkLWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia thinks RTX 4090 cables melted because they weren't fully plugged in,"Weeks after Nvidia announced that it was investigating reports that the power cables for its RTX 4090 graphics card were melting and burning the company says it may know why: they just weren’t plugged in all the way.

In a post to its customer support forum on Friday Nvidia says that it’s still investigating the reports but that its findings “suggest” an insecure connector has been a common issue. It also says that it’s gotten around 50 reports of the issue.

Nvidia’s flagship card uses what’s known as a 12VHPWR power connector a new standard that isn’t natively supported by most of the power supplies that people already have in their PCs. Because of that it ships an adapter — or “power dongle” as Friday’s post calls it — in the box. Users’ initial reports blamed the adapter with some saying that the melting cable had damaged their $1599 GPU as well.

It could be easy to read the company’s findings as shoving blame onto the users. Sure Nvidia doesn’t come right out and say that it’s user error but it’s heavily implied in the post. It also seems like a very convenient explanation since people have been speculating for almost a month that the issue is caused by something more complex like bad soldering or wires too small to reliably handle the massive amounts of power pumped through.

That’s a significant amount of connector that would be out of the socket. Image: GamersNexus

However GamersNexus an outlet that’s respected in the PC-building community for its rigorous testing basically came to the same conclusion earlier this week. A video posted on Wednesday by the outlet which inspected damaged adapters sent in by viewers and done extensive testing and reporting on the issue showed that the connectors had wear lines implying that they hadn’t been completely inserted into the slot. GamersNexus even says that some people seem to have missed a full connection by several millimeters. Its video shows that a loose connection could cause the plug to heat up dramatically if it were plugged in poorly and tilted at an angle.

Nvidia’s post includes a picture of what the connector looks like when it’s not fully plugged in and it seems much easier to miss than something that’s out by a full 2mm and being held at an angle (potentially because of the cables being pulled back too tightly during installation). It’d be even easier to miss with a third-party RTX 4090 card instead of the Nvidia version shown in the images below.

If you’ve got one of these cards in your computer you should probably double-check yours looks like the bottom one.

Nvidia says you should make sure the cable is fully plugged in before booting your computer. Image: Nvidia

It’s worth noting though that Nvidia may not be completely blameless here. Another thing that jumps out about the picture it posted is that the connector has a locking key. In theory that’s a feature that would prevent this sort of thing from happening as long as it gives good feedback when you plug it in. According to GamersNexus however the adapters don’t really audibly click into place even when fully inserted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk2NzA5LW52aWRpYS1kZWxpdmVycy1vZmZpY2lhbC1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtbWVsdGluZy00MDkwLXBvd2VyLWNhYmxlcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia delivers official statement on melting RTX 4090 power cables,"A hot potato: Power supply-related controversy has surrounded Nvidia's monstrous new flagship graphics card since before it launched. Users recently criticized the company after reports of melting power cables but Nvidia claims only a handful of incidents occurred and that it was user error to blame.

Nvidia issued an official statement today regarding instances of melting power cords for the GeForce RTX 4090. The company is aware of about 50 cases worldwide claiming they result from users improperly plugging in the cables.

The trouble started in late October when Reddit users reported power connectors for the 4090 melting on the end of the cable and the GPU's connection port. Suspicion quickly shifted toward the power adaptors Nvidia shipped with the cards to make them compatible with older power supplies.

The RTX 4090's 16-pin 12VHPWR cables are meant for ATX 3.0 PSUs but Nvidia knew many customers wouldn't want to spend more money upgrading from their ATX 2.0 models. Multiple outlets have criticized the company's adapter solution.

In September the Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG) raised a potential over-current issue with the adaptors that Nvidia claims it fixed. An investigation by Igor's Lab found that the adaptors are so fragile that plugging or unplugging them can damage the connections. Cable supplier CableMod warned that bending the cables at a short distance is unsafe.

However a Gamers Nexus investigation arrived closer to Nvidia's conclusion. It said problems only occur when the connector is pulled at an angle or partially disconnected. The issue could also involve foreign object debris. Like Nvidia Gamers Nexus estimates the 4090 has an extremely low failure rate.

The controversy escalated further when user [name redacted] filed a class-action lawsuit against Nvidia accusing the company of committing fraud by distributing dangerous defective adaptors. Despite findings blaming user error he claims his experience with GPU installation ensured best practices.

It seems that Nvidia's adaptors are safe for most people if appropriately connected. Users who aren't sure about the pack-in adaptors can find third-party options or upgrade to an ATX 3.0 PSU which doesn't need an adapter for the RTX 4090. After spending over $1600 for the graphics card dropping less than $200 on a PSU is a small extra step.

While AMD tacitly admitted that none of its new RDNA 3 GPUs can directly compete with the 4090 it can claim that they don't need adapters for use with ATX 2.0 power supplies. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT launch on December 13 for $999 and $899 respectively.",,,

AmLaw selected Latham as the best among seven leading law firm finalists. The awards honor “those lawyers business professionals law firms and organizations that are elevating the profession to new heights” and “shine a light on the best of the best—those firms that clients should call with their critical corporate work.”

In a feature article AmLaw said: “Latham & Watkins’ evolution into a corporate leviathan was a deliberate drawn-out path built on scope and scale strong talent acquisition and the ability to work on matters for clients small and large in a variety of capacities. That investment culminated over the second half of 2020 and through 2021 in perhaps one of the greatest runs a Big Law corporate department has ever seen.”

Latham was a finalist in four of AmLaw’s corporate practice categories the most of any law firm including:

General/Overall achievement across a firm’s transactional work

Energy and Technology/Telecommunications sector categories

Corporate Attorney of the Year which featured Bay Area Office Managing Partner Tad Freese as a finalist

“We are so proud of our global team and the tremendous work that went into the achievements recognized by this award” said Charles Ruck Global Chair of Latham’s Corporate Department. “We share this award with our visionary clients who inspire our work. Helping them achieve their goals is our greatest privilege and honor.”

Latham advised on many market-defining transactions to earn the award including: multi-billion technology M&A deals such as AMD’s US$35 billion acquisition of Xilinx and Slack’s US$27.7 billion acquisition by Salesforce; landmark capital markets deals such as Rivian Automotive’s US$11.9 billion IPO the largest IPO of 2021 and Warby Parker’s direct listing; and transformative transactions across industries such as Siemens Healthineers’ US$16.4 billion acquisition of Varian Medical in life sciences Realty Income’s US$50 billion merger with VEREIT in real estate and the US$2.3 billion Vineyard Wind project financing in alternative energy.

In addition Latham was a finalist in two categories that reflect the firm’s values of building an inclusive and supportive culture and giving back to the communities in which we live and work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbC1yb2tlci1yZXZlYWxzLWhlcy1ob3NwaXRhbC0xNTE5MDgwMjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Al Roker reveals he's in the hospital TODAY anchors send love,"For those who've wondered why they haven't seen Al Roker's smiling face on TODAY recently the weatherman-and-more has just revealed the reason for his absence.

On Friday Nov. 18 he shared on Instagram that he's currently in the hospital.

""So many of you have been thoughtfully asking where I’ve been"" he wrote. ""Last week I was admitted to the hospital with a blood clot in my leg which sent some clots into my lungs. After some medical whack-a-mole I am so fortunate to be getting terrific medical care and on the way to recovery.""

He added a note of thanks ""for all the well wishes and prayers"" he's received and said that he hoped to see everyone again soon.

That's just what his TODAY family hopes for too. Shortly after he shared the news with his followers on social media his fellow anchors chimed in about the man they miss.

“He’s in good spirits” Savannah Guthrie said on TODAY.

Dylan Dreyer offered some proof of that.

""Not that you need us to tell you how incredible Al is the first time I called him he immediately said 'Hey Dilly-Dill! How are the boys?'"" she recalled. ""That's classic Al.""

And Carson Daly said ""We need him back"" as he raved about what an inspiration Al is to him every morning.

Savannah summed it up saying ""We love you Al. We miss you!""

Get well soon Al!

One of those protesting was Derek Grigsby.

“Is it too much to ask to have decent housing? Come on now. I mean capitalism has gone too far” said Grigsby.

Grigsby is with the group Moratorium Now! Coalition to Stop Foreclosures Evictions and Utility Shutoffs. He said he knows people who have been evicted and reacted to the news evictions overall are on the rise in the city.

“I think it’s horrible. I think any kind of country that can allow this to happen to people regarding housing it’s just ridiculous” Grigsby said.

7 Action News reached out to the owner of Munoz Reality. His attorney offered an interview at a later date saying they were unable to talk Friday due to illness.

Tonya Myers Phillips is an attorney. She’s the director of community partnerships and development at the Sugar Law Center in Detroit and the project leader with the Detroit Right to Counsel Coalition fighting for low-income tenants to have a right to legal representation in eviction proceedings. She explained why this is so important.

“It’s a legal proceeding. You have to know the law. You have to know the jargon. You have to know what to do and do it quickly when you go into court. So as a practical matter you need an attorney” explained Myers Phillips.

She said landlords in Detroit have traditionally had the upper hand because they have representation in over 90% of cases compared to tenants who before the pandemic only had representation 4% of the time.

However that number has improved. Detroit passed a right-to-representation ordinance in May.

“Now that we in Detroit are taking a pioneering step in passing such a law we need our administration to fund it and get it going to protect Detroiters especially now” said Myers Phillips.

Ted Phillips is the executive director of the nonprofit Community Housing Coalition. Among the many services they provide for tenants they have become one of the primary providers of legal services. Phillips knows how inadequately funded the program is.

“They did a study of Detroit and they concluded it would cost $17 million dollars a year. The city is funding it at two” Phillips explained.

Additionally the Detroit Eviction Defense office which was scheduled to open in October has yet to open. Advocates are calling on Mayor Duggan to fully fund the ordinance with American Rescue Plan Act dollars.

Phillips provided some advice for tenants having maintenance or landlord issues. He said tenants need to make sure they document as much as they can and report issues to the city.

“Call building and safety. Make a report to the city. Withhold your rent. Doing those kinds of things does trigger the retaliation law as protection. If you’ve complained to the city as in this example and within 90 days of that complaint the landlord gives you a notice to evict you well you’re protected” said Phillips.

Myers Phillips said show up. 25% of cases are defaults because no one shows up.

“Go to court. You know don’t count yourself out of the fight. Go to court. And when you go to court say you’d like to have legal representation. Some judges may present that option up front. But if it’s not presented to you then you ask. You have a right to at least ask for legal representation. And in the city of Detroit as we said you now have a right to receive legal representation without charge” said Myers Phillips.

Players from around the NFL especially from the New York Giants and New York Jets as well the NFLPA itself have requested that MetLife Stadium switch to a grass surface from the current artificial Field Turf due to the massive number of injuries incurred over the years.

Regardless of the pleas MetLife Stadium has no plans of doing that.

“We evaluate our field each season and historically have replaced our playing surface every 3-4 years” MetLife Stadium said in a statement to ESPN. “We have made the decision to replace the field in 2023 and are currently reviewing proposals from multiple vendors for a new synthetic surface.”

That will not go over well with those who have to risk their careers playing for the Giants and the Jets going forward. The NFLPA who released the following statement earlier this week won’t be pleased either.

“The players have been vocal and clear about this issue and it is a good step to hear them that change needs to be made. The change will not come soon enough though for players who will be at greater risk the rest of the season. We expect that whatever surface gets installed next year will meet the highest safety and performance standards possible.”

Giants safeties Julian Love and Landon Collins voiced their concerns recently when a study was revealed last week that the version of Field Turf used at MetLife and four other NFL stadiums was the root cause of a rash of leg-related injuries to players.

The type of turf that gets installed could impact the quality of free agents that want to come to New Jersey to play. The Giants and Jets are certainly hearing the rumblings from their own players and players around the league.

The issue is that MetLife is used almost every week during the season between the two teams and also is a popular concert and event venue. Natural grass may not flourish under the excessive use not to mention the Northeast weather.

Keep in mind natural grass was installed at Giants Stadium in the late 1990s and it was a disaster. By season’s end in 2000 the field was literally “painted mud” which is the term used Giants owner Wellington Mara in his speech when he accepted the George Halas Trophy after the NFC Championship Game.

Giant fills a space vacated by Shoppers which closed in May.

The new Giant has a full-service meat and seafood department; a large produce department; house-smoked rotisserie chicken brisket and pulled pork; prepared foods such sushi flatbread pizzas paninis quesadilla and fried chicken; a deli with Boars Head meats; a cheese shop; a bakery with breads and sweets; a floral department; a local vendors aisle; and a large selection of dry and perishable foods.

Giant does sell medicine and toiletries but does not have a dedicated pharmacy.

Giant offers regular checkout self-checkout and curbside pickup.

Giant Director of Strategic Planning and Execution Gary Budd told SouthBMore.com this store has the “newest of the new” and he’s especially excited about products such as Roseda Beef and Smith Island Cakes from Smith Island. As customers enter the store to the left there is the “power aisle” according to Budd with the deli prepared foods produce and bakery. He said it gives the store the “wow effect.”

Budd told SouthBMore.com they were unable to open a pharmacy due to exclusive rights held by Walgreens with shopping center owner Regency Centers. Budd said they were surprised by Walgreens closing this week and had they known they would’ve put in a pharmacy. He said they will still look at the possibility of adding one in the future.

He also noted most Giants have a Starbucks but there’s already one at Southside Marketplace.

Shoppers announced it would sell this location in March 2019. Budd said Giant was approached immediately by Regency Centers and then took some time to make a decision and go through its normal corporate research and protocols.

Giant began construction in June.

Giant has hired more than 300 employees at Southside Marketplace. Budd said many of the employees are from South Baltimore.

Giant is open Monday to Saturday from 6am to 12am and Sunday from 6am to 11pm.

Published 11-18-22 Submitted by Regions Bank

BIRMINGHAM Ala. November 18 2022 /CSRwire/– Regions Bank announced a collaborative agreement with seven Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) to enable people who bank with those organizations to use Regions’ ATM network without paying the industry-standard out-of-network fee.

The result is greater financial inclusion. By working together Regions CDFIs and MDIs are expanding no-cost access to financial services through the Regions ATM network. Specifically the agreement covers customers of the following institutions:

“Regions Bank is committed to creating more inclusive prosperity and this collaboration is a key component of our broader long-term work with CDFIs and MDIs to expand access to essential financial services” said John Turner President and CEO of Regions Financial Corp. “This new collaboration will benefit individual consumers in several states. Regions Bank and the Regions Community Development Corporation have also worked closely with CDFIs and MDIs in the past to support business activity in underserved communities including a series of equity investments. These initiatives illustrate Regions’ dedication to not only providing financial services but also uplifting communities across our footprint.”

Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) are private financial institutions that are 100% dedicated to delivering responsible affordable lending to help low-income low-wealth and other disadvantaged people and communities join the economic mainstream.

Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) may be a federally insured depository institution of which 51% or more of the voting stock is owned by minority individuals – or a financial institution that primarily serves minority communities and whose board of directors is primarily composed of individuals from minority backgrounds.

CDFIs and MDIs are often based in small towns rural areas or urban communities and provide services in areas considered to be ‘bank deserts’ – where the nearest physical bank branch may be several miles away.

“Equitable access to banking is one of the most impactful ways we can eliminate financial barriers and reduce the wealth gap in America” said Darrin Williams CEO of Southern Bancorp. “Our institution serves communities in the Mid-South that may not have convenient ways to make withdrawals or even check their balances. This partnership with Regions not only makes banking more accessible for our customers but it will also help support our communities and ultimately our local economies.”

The ATM arrangement follows a gathering hosted in June by Regions’ head of Community Affairs Leroy Abrahams and Wendi Boyen community advocacy and financial wellness manager for the bank. Abrahams and Boyen met with executives from CDFIs and MDIs for an information-sharing session and to brainstorm ways the organizations can collaborate to better support local communities especially underserved populations.

Earlier this year the Regions Community Development Corporation announced three equity-focused deals with CDFIs and MDIs including two CDFIs that are included in the current ATM arrangement Southern Bancorp and Carver Financial.

“CDFIs and MDIs serve a vital role in ensuring equitable access to the financial system” Abrahams said. “Regions shares many common objectives with these mission-based organizations and by working more closely together we are better able to provide banking access which creates more equitable opportunities for people businesses and communities.”

Editor's Note:China and Thailand are close friendly neighbors with a popular belief in both countries that the two people are as close as family. As China's comprehensive strategic cooperative partner Thailand is located in the center of Southeast Asia and is connected to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members by sea and land holding an important strategic position in promoting the framework cooperation of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The high-quality joint construction of the ""Belt and Road"" between the two countries has achieved fruitful results and major cooperation projects such as the China-Thailand railway the landmark project which represents the high-quality construction of the BRI have made solid progress. The project will also be Thailand's first standard-gauge railway which marks a new era for the two sides jointly building a community of a shared future not only between China and Thailand but for the entire region.This is the fourth in a series of articles scoping the developing of the BRI in ASEAN members.Ayutthaya located about 80 kilometers north of Bangkok is one of the transportation hubs which forms part of the Thai government's infrastructure agenda. It is also one of the locations of the China-Thailand railway that has attracted much attention from around the world. Part of the civil engineering for the China-Thailand railway project undertaken by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) is already under construction in full swing.The China-Thailand railway project which was signed and launched in 2021 is a high-quality joint construction and a ""Belt and Road"" flagship project between China and Thailand. The railway is Thailand's first high-speed railway and it is one of the first high-speed railway projects outside China that uses Chinese high-speed rail design standards and is funded by the host country itself the company said in a statement to the Global Times.In the light of the construction plan the railway project is divided into two phases. The first phase of the project connects Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima a gateway to northeastern Thailand with a total length of about 252.3 kilometers the people.cn reported.The second phase with a total length of about 356 kilometers will extend to Nong Khai an important border trade town in northeast Thailand just across the river from Vientiane the capital of Laos to realize the connection with the China-Laos Railway news site cankaoxiaoxi.com reported.The State Railway of Thailand recently told media that the first phase of the China-Thailand railway project is progressing rapidly and about 12 percent of the progress has been completed so far and it is expected to complete 20 percent of the progress this year per the report from the people.cn.Thai Ministry of Transport attaches great importance to the railway project because the project can bring various benefits such as tourism and economic development the report said.After the launch of the joint project the country's transportation will be significantly upgraded according to industry insiders and a report from gmw.cn. As of 2021 the total mileage of railway operations in Thailand was only more than 5000 kilometers most of which are single-track meter-gauge and the equipment of the railway transportation system was relatively outdated according to media reports.After the opening of the new railway it will only take 90 minutes from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima compared with the current 4.5 hours the report from people.cn noted.There is an expectation among Thai people over the future development of Thailand's railway construction capacity Xinhua News Agency reported that the Thai people hoped that the construction of the China-Thailand railway will be completed as soon as possible and the status quo of Thailand's railway infrastructure will be changed.While the railway project is highly anticipated like any other big infrastructure projects there are challenges.The railway construction contracts may require renegotiation the Bangkok Post reported citing a source within the Thai transport ministry as construction of the project's first phase between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima is behind schedule.The reported delay was largely attributed to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions significant hold-ups in the land expropriation process and the relocation of public utility lines from around the construction site the report said citing sources.An insider also told the Global Times on Wednesday on condition of anonymity that ""at present the progress of the China-Thailand railway is not as good as expected.""Despite certain difficulties experts believe that the issues are controllable and the project will be completed as widely expected.""Any large-scale infrastructure project will require continuous refinement when it is attempted overseas not to mention that the construction of the railway is the first of its kind in the local area...I believe that the issues are controllable and with the joint efforts of both parties the overall project will be successfully completed"" Zhao Gancheng a research fellow from the Shanghai Institute for International Studies told the Global Times on Wednesday.The railway has also drawn the attention of some in the Western media who look at the project with bias claiming that the rail line could pose ""some form of concern from certain governments in the region but also the QUAD from security perspectives"" VOA News reported.Experts said that the claim is a stereotype rhetoric for political driven purpose that failed to understand the importance the transportation upgrade can bring for the benefits of the region.Regarding the so-called ""debt trap"" theory often raised by some Western politicians and media Gu Xiaosong dean of the ASEAN Research Institute of Hainan Tropical Ocean University told the Global Times that the overall role of high-speed rail as strategic infrastructure should be viewed correctly.""As a large-scale investment project the cost of the railway cannot be recovered in the short term and it should be considered that it plays a supporting role in areas such as industry trade and employment along the line...in fact infrastructure project cooperation between China and ASEAN members will not lead to a so-called ""debt trap"" but can actually promote the development of local economies and society"" Gu said.Despite all the challenges and doubts the project is underway as is making meaningful progress toward completion and eventual operation.The civil works currently underway include bridges roadbeds tunnels and station buildings and the first phase of the China-Thailand railway project is expected to be completed in 2027 Ma Shengshuang general manager of China Railway Design Group Co's Thailand Branch told the people.cn.At the same time having already passed an environmental impact assessment the second phase is expected to be completed about 3-4 years after the first phase or between 2029 and 2030 according to another report published by the Bangkok Post.The China-Thailand railway will provide connectivity between Southeast Asian countries and China and bring tangible benefits to the entire region and at the same time inject new momentum into regional development experts and business representatives have claimed.Yunnan Easy Trans International Freight Forwarder Co the logistic and trading company with business related to China-Laos Railway is excited about the future launch of the railway connection upgrade in the region.Yang Yuepeng general manager of the company told the Global Times on Thursday that after the China-Thailand railway is completed the transportation will be more convenient and the transportation cost will be greatly reduced.""By then more companies and enterprises will expand their projects in Thailand and more Thai people will believe in 'Made in China'"" Yang said.Since the opening of the China-Laos Railway the integration of transportation and commerce has greatly accelerated the growth of border trade with more and more exchange projects and trade categories Yang said.In the 11 months since the opening of the China-Laos Railway the financial data of Yang's company for 2022 has increased by 15.8 percent year-on-year compared with the financial data for 2021.""Although the China-Thailand railway is still under construction Thailand China and Laos are connected by railway which reflects the concept of the Trans-Asian Railway under the BRI"" Zhao said.After the completion of the railway it can greatly enhance the construction of Thailand's modern railway system and if it can be effectively connected with the China-Laos Railway in the future it will definitely help the economic development of the entire region Zhao said.""Our ultimate goal is to build the Trans-Asian Railway a railway that runs through the Indochina Peninsula and connects Laos Thailand Malaysia and Singapore...When this railway is completed it will closely connect the inland areas of ASEAN and China and will be beneficial to the entire land region under the community of a shared future"" the expert said."

The upshot: Merriam and Shawnee residents say they’ve gone weeks without trash or recycling services from their private hauler Republic Services.

These residents say the Phoenix-based company cites staffing issues as the cause of the delay and say they’ll pick up waste in the coming days.

Shawnee city officials confirmed for the Post that dozens of residents have reported missed or delayed trash pickups by Republic — and some are starting to switch haulers.

What customers are saying: Shawnee resident Lee Eslick-Huff told the Post via email they missed eight out of 10 weeks of picking up their trash — and is going on 32 days as of Tuesday without recycling services.

Eslick-Huff said Republic consistently cited its driver shortage and that “we will get there when we get there.” It’s been 14 days since Eslick-Huff canceled Republic Services they said and the cans have yet to be picked up.

Others like Janel Bowers a Republic customer since 2016 — and prior to that Superior which Republic purchased that year — said her first missed pickup occurred in early October. Republic told her the trash would be picked up in two days but her trash stacked up for two weeks she said. Bowers said she has been unable to get in contact with local management and has yet to see Republic address the ongoing issue. She has switched haulers as of Nov. 16 — with three weeks’ worth of recycling sitting in her garage.



Key quote: “Usually you can roll with things but six weeks of little to no trash service or recycling service?” Bowers said. “You have to stop rolling with it at some point.”

Other cities: Overland Park city officials say they’re aware of the issue but can only advise residents to resolve it with Republic or switch to one of the several other haulers licensed in the city.

Republic also operates in Leawood but city staff told the Post they have received no resident reports about missed pickups.

Merriam city officials confirmed for the Post via email that Republic is a licensed hauler despite the absence of Merriam on the company’s online list of cities where it provides services. Jenna Gant Merriam’s communications and public engagement manager said Republic declined to be listed on the city website. Gant said she believes this was because Republic was not accepting new customers at the time but she does not recall how long ago that was.

Bre'Ana Powell's family is seek $1 million in a wrongful death lawsuit against Republic Waste Services of Texas after one of its trucks hit the woman on Oct. 8 2022.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- The family of a woman hit and killed by a trash truck while riding her bicycle has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Republic Waste Services of Texas and the driver.

On Oct. 8 Bre'Ana Powell was crossing Broadway Street in southeast Houston on her bicycle when Houston police say the driver of the 50000-pound truck made a right turn on to Morley. The 27-year-old was struck and taken to the hospital where she was pronounced dead.

""I knew it was going to be bad but it never entered my mind that I would never see my child again"" her mother Diane Henderson Francis said.

Powell's family said she worked at Hobby Airport and lived nearby. She rode her tricycle she was gifted by her mother to and from her job while she worked toward getting her driver's license.

""Everybody is in such a rush to do this or to do that but when something happens like this there's no taking it back"" Francis said. ""It's not a video game. You can't restart it. It's with you forever. She was on the sidewalk. She had on reflective gear because she used it for her job. She still had it on. She was wearing it when I went to the hospital to see her.'""

The 27-year-old's family is heartbroken. They said they could always count on Powell for a laugh or to send the first text in their family group message every day.

""It's just a tragic loss because she had plans for her life"" her mother said.

Powell's family hopes that Republic Waste Services of Texas will install safety equipment on their trucks that allows drivers to see their surroundings.

""We were told he said he didn't see her or didn't feel it but I'm like 'How?'"" Francis asked. ""This wasn't a small bike. She wasn't a small person.""

Powell's family is seeking damages over $1 million their attorneys said.

Republic Waste Services of Texas has declined to comment because of pending litigation.

Originally from Jacmel Haiti Jean moved to the Dominican Republic as a young man for the same reason that many Haitians emigrate there: in search of work. Over the better part of a decade he had worked as a sugarcane cutter a farmhand and doing odd construction jobs in various towns along the border. But in all this time spent in the Dominican Republic Jean never fully learned to speak the national language Spanish.

Jean’s native language is Haitian Kreyòl. Although there is a common perception that Haiti is a French-speaking country only about five percent of Haiti’s population actually speaks French. It is the co-official language of Haiti alongside Kreyòl but the few Haitians who do speak French mostly learn it as a second language.

When I asked Jean why he had never been able to learn much Spanish despite having lived in the Dominican Republic for so long his response was simple: “There was no one to teach me.” The Dominican Republic does not offer any Spanish as a second language instruction for migrants including school-aged children who study in the public school system. On top of this as a manual laborer nearly everyone that Jean interacts with is Haitian.

A report released last year by the Dominican Ministry of the Interior revealed that more than 90 percent of agricultural workers in the Dominican Republic are foreigners mostly from Haiti. For Jean this means that he can effectively complete all his work on a day-to-day basis entirely in Kreyòl.

While it is nearly impossible to know the exact number of Haitian migrants who reside in the Dominican Republic—since much of the migration is undocumented—estimates in recent years have ranged from 500000 to nearly 2 million. If you consider this latter figure it would mean that Haitians and their descendants make up nearly 20 percent of the Dominican Republic’s current population of 11 million people a staggering figure. With this in mind it becomes easier to understand how someone like Jean could go through their entire life almost entirely surrounded by other Kreyòl speakers.

Despite this massive amount of migration—and the fact that the two countries share an island—efforts to learn the language of the neighboring country have been mostly nonexistent on both sides.

In Haiti many people that I’ve spoken with express little desire to learn Spanish. My friend Pierre a young college student explained to me that lots of students in Haiti have a “complex” about learning Spanish.

“There is this idea that if you learn Spanish it’s because you’re going to go to the Dominican Republic to cut sugarcane. It’s almost like you’re signing yourself up for that life. So you see a lot of students in Haiti who prefer to study English or French rather than Spanish” he said.

Similarly in the Dominican Republic there have not been any large-scale efforts by the population to learn Kreyòl. While this is partially the result of a long-standing prejudice against Haitians it is also due to the lack of educational opportunities to do so. Simply put if you wanted to study Kreyòl in the Dominican Republic it is extremely difficult to find a place that can teach you. Unless you are enrolled in a university there are no classes to take and until very recently there were no learning materials or textbooks specifically for Spanish speakers. If you live outside the capital city of Santo Domingo the options to enroll in a course essentially drop to zero. The Dominican public school system offers French and English as subjects but not Kreyòl.

More troublingly despite the large numbers of Kreyòl speakers who reside in the Dominican Republic both legally and illegally Dominican law does not require Kreyòl language accommodations in any public arena. This includes schools hospitals and military checkpoints. The legal code stipulates that an interpreter is required for a person once they are already in the custody of authorities but this requirement doesn’t extend to police or military run-ins in the street. In these cases once the interpreter has been solicited it is often too late and can lead to devastating consequences for Haitian migrants like Jean.

Haitians are routinely detained and deported during migration raids or at military checkpoints increasingly common occurrences in the Dominican Republic and even Haitians who are in the country legally frequently report severe harassment by authorities. In these situations many migrants are left unable to adequately defend themselves to authorities.

Pierre soberly told me “Once I was on the street watching a Haitian get arrested. I don’t know what he was being accused of but he wanted to defend himself and he didn’t speak Spanish. And the police didn’t speak Kreyòl. But I saw in his face that he was innocent and couldn’t defend himself. So you’re going to put someone in jail just because you can’t understand him?”

Migration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic has rapidly accelerated in recent months as thousands of Haitians have been forced to flee Haiti due to political and economic instability. Those who cross the border into neighboring Dominican Republic have encountered a precarious environment. In 2021 alone Dominican migration authorities arrested and deported over 31000 Haitians. This year authorities reported that they are on track to deport 1000 Haitians per day.

Last year the Director General of Migration Enrique García laid out a new deportation policy specifically targeting pregnant Haitian women calling them an “economic burden” on the Dominican state. There is an idea in some segments of Dominican society that pregnant Haitian women come to the Dominican Republic to exploit the public hospital system. According to Pierre this can be another underlying fear about Kreyòl education: “There are a lot of Dominicans who don’t like that Haitian women give birth here. I think there’s a fear that if doctors learn Kreyòl they’re going to be helping all of these women to give birth here more. That it’s somehow going to encourage it.”

Though most Dominican doctors have some training in English none are required to have any Kreyòl fluency even when they are sent to work in primarily Haitian communities. The lack of language training combined with the absence of Kreyòl accommodations in public hospitals can be life-threatening for some Haitian patients.

Laura a recently graduated Dominican physician has worked for the last year in a primarily Haitian community near Santo Domingo to complete her internship. She doesn’t speak any Kreyòl though most of the patients she sees every day are Haitian and many of them speak little Spanish. When I asked her how she navigates this dilemma she replied “Usually I have to walk out to the street and yell: ‘Is there anyone who speaks Kreyòl?’ and then I just take the first person who raises their hand back into the clinic with me.” She explained that sometimes this is a child. The precariousness of a child interpreting for a private medical consultation between doctor and patient cannot be overstated but for some clinics this is the reality that doctors and patients are left with.

Myrlène a Haitian-Dominican teacher told me that on more than one occasion when she has arrived at a clinic for her own appointment an unknown Haitian patient has frantically approached her in Kreyòl asking if she speaks Spanish. Since she can speak both languages she has agreed to interpret for them to their doctor.

In other hospitals Haitian patients report prejudice from medical staff when they speak Kreyòl. Sometimes Myrlène explained doctors and medical staff lose their patience with individuals seeking treatment who cannot speak Spanish: “They’ll be looking and looking for someone to interpret and if they can’t find anyone they’ll lose their patience and that’s where the mistreatment starts. It’s as if they’re saying ‘I don’t understand you so I don’t care I’m just going to leave it.’”

Last year the Dominican government announced that Dominican hospitals will no longer treat undocumented migrants. The explanation for the policy which stipulates that hospitals will only be required to treat undocumented patients in cases of “emergency” was that the Dominican Republic “can no longer keep carrying the burdens of Haiti’s problems.”

However the criteria that constitutes an emergency seems to be up to the discretion of the intake personnel at each hospital. So what happens if you’re Jean and you show up to the hospital desperately seeking emergency services but can’t articulate your concerns to your medical team because you don’t speak the language? What if you are trying to explain your condition to a medical team and the only interpreter that you can find is a child pulled off the street? Who then decides what constitutes an “emergency?”

For some Haitians like Pierre the solution is simple: Dominicans in certain jobs need to learn Kreyòl. He and Myrlène agree that doctors police and migration officials should at least have a basic understanding of the language. Other people that I have spoken with have placed the responsibility more resolutely on the governmental level arguing that it is the government’s responsibility to provide trained interpreters in public areas. However the prospects for both outcomes are bleak.

The Dominican public school system has never taught Kreyòl though some groups in the Dominican Republic have made public calls for the Ministry of Education to include it in Dominican schools as a subject. However one of the most vocal opponents of this proposal has been the national teacher’s union the Asociación Dominicana de Profesores (Dominican Teacher’s Association ADP). Each time this call has been made the ADP has forcefully rejected it saying that the teaching of Kreyòl in Dominican schools would add “nothing” to the educational system or to the professional advancement of Dominicans. The former president of the ADP Eduardo Hidalgo went so far as to say that it would be a mistake to offer Kreyòl in Dominican schools because it might make Dominicans start “acting and thinking” like Haitians.

Myrlène articulated how frustrating this situation is for her. “They [public schools] teach English and there are no North Americans that live here. They teach French and there are no French people here. But there are thousands of Haitians and they won’t teach Kreyòl. So what are we doing here? We need to get to the root of the problem. The Dominican Republic doesn’t want to accept it but this is the reality.”

Pierre echoed this sentiment but offered more sympathy to Dominicans who may resist: “I understand the historic conflict between Haitians and Dominicans and I understand the importance of patriotism and loving your own country. But a country that has as many Haitian migrants as the Dominican Republic should be able to speak the language of Haitians for better or for worse. Sooner or later Dominicans are going to need to learn Kreyòl.”

The new 270000-square-foot facility doubles the respiratory care company’s presence in Singapore to serve its key manufacturing hub in Asia Pacific. The facility will employ nearly 1000 people and has smart dashboards that integrate real-time data to monitor the performance of production lines.

ResMed’s new facility also has the manufacturing capacity and footprint to scale production for connected devices and mask systems. The company plans to use the new facility to produce its latest positive airway pressure (PAP) system which allows users to monitor their own sleep apnea treatment.

“Singapore’s strategic location and support for business investment coupled with ResMed’s world-leading devices and digital health offerings provides the perfect opportunity to expand our manufacturing capabilities while supporting local jobs and the region’s economy” CEO Mick Farrell said in a news release. “The opening of this facility supports the continued growth of ResMed’s product portfolio to meet the needs of millions of people across Singapore Asia-Pacific and the world.”

The newest Singapore-based manufacturing center is just one of a few new medtech facilities opening in the region. Earlier this month Smith+Nephew opened a major medical education and digital innovation center to cover the Asia-Pacific region. Olympus’ Evident also opened its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore in October.

“This facility marks a major milestone for ResMed both in your growth as a world-leading medical device company and in the expansion of your footprint in Singapore.

Ole Miss also ran into a physical Skyhawk defense that stifled the Rebels to 36.4 percent in the first half and just 5-of-19 from three all game but Ole Miss used its defense to create offense in the second half en route to a game-changing 24-4 run across a wide swath of the period. This season the Rebels are outscoring opponents by 41 points in the second half.""Give UT Martin a ton of credit"" said Ole Miss head coach. ""(UT Martin head coach) Ryan (Ridder) did a great job preparing his team. We got out-coached we got out-physicaled for a long period of time. They looked like the SEC team around the goal and we didn't. Finishing balls going back and chasing 50-50 balls. With that being said I'm proud of our team and the way we find ways to win games. We've got a lot of character a lot of good guys on our team.""The game featured nine total lead changes and four ties and the back-and-forth nature of the game was apparent right from the opening tip with eight of those lead changes and three of those ties coming in the first half alone. No team was able to separate to larger than a five-point lead until an 11-4 run by the Skyhawks to close the half put UT Martin up by seven at the break 39-32.The three-ball proved crucial for the Skyhawks in the opening minutes particularly from Desmond Williams off the bench who drained three of UT Martin's six first-half threes.UT Martin stretched its lead to 12 coming out of the break following a 6-0 run but a jumper by seniorsparked what would become a monstrous 24-4 from the 17:27 mark all the way until a 7:10 three-pointer by UT Martin's KJ Simon. Included in that stretch were three separate 7-0 runs a 14-1 run and a 17-2 advantage before the final 24-4 run that lasted 10:17 of game time.Leading that charge were leading scorer(16 points five rebounds two assists one steal) and Burns (13 points eight rebounds five steals one block) who recorded nine and eight points each during the run respectively.That run was particularly beneficial due to Burns' fierce presence in the Rebels' zone defense as he recorded three of his five steals and his one block during that stretch.was elite"" Davis said. ""I've had some great ones at the top of that zone but at an early start he's about as great as I've ever seen getting hands on balls and being able to create offense from that.""The Skyhawks would not go quietly though immediately cutting the Rebel lead back down to three multiple times over their next two possessions. Another 7-0 Ole Miss run put the Rebels up 10 with 4:24 to play at 66-56 but even that could not put UT Martin down and out as the Skyhawks mounted a 9-2 run to make it a three-point game yet again with just 1:20 to play at 68-65.From here on free throws became crucial for the Rebels as its final four buckets came from the charity stripe via(nine points seven rebounds) and(four points four assists two rebounds). All four ended up being the difference in the game putting the Rebels ahead for good at 72-68.Ole Miss now leaves Oxford for the first time this season heading to ESPN's Wide World of Sports at Disney World for the ESPN Events Invitational. Action in Orlando runs from Nov. 24-27 with Ole Miss slated to open against Stanford on Thanksgiving Day (Nov. 24) at 12:30 p.m. CT on ESPNU.""Really proud of our win"" Davis said. ""Told our team there's not a lot of teams in basketball that's 4-0 and to be proud of that.

Bobby was born October 15 1956 in Harvey Illinois to Nancy Oberlin Veleta and Robert Marnell Veleta Sr. He graduated from Apopka Memorial High School (June 1974) and attended Florida Community College at Jacksonville (Associate in Arts May 1986) as well as the University of North Florida where he obtained his bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering Technology (December 1989).

Bobby served active duty in the United States Navy for six and a half years (1974-1981) and retired from the US Naval Reserve in 1996 after 22 years of service. During this time he was awarded three distinct Navy Achievement Medals and named “Sailor of the Year” twice. After active duty he was employed for two years by LTV as an electrician working to build A7 aircrafts. In 1983 Bobby began working for the Fleet Readiness Center Southeast at NAS Jacksonville as an aircraft electrician (WG-8) and “climbed the corporate ladder” for 39 years ending his career at the time of his passing as an Industrial Engineering Technician Supervisor (GS-12). His commitment to service was a value he carried beyond work through all facets of his life including his volunteerism.

When “his girls” attended John N.C. Stockton Elementary Bobby volunteered as treasurer of the Friends of Stockton. He served on the Board of Directors for both the Cedar River Club and the Ortega River Club. Bobby was an ordained elder and served on Session at the Lakeshore Presbyterian Church. He sang in numerous choirs over the years including most recently at the Green Cove Springs Presbyterian Church where he was a member and lector.

One of his life’s greatest passions was Little League Baseball. Bobby volunteered as an umpire at NOL (Navy Ortega Lakeshore) Little League for 27 years where he served on the Board of Directors. From 2003-2018 Bobby served on the District 11 Staff as Chief Umpire for all of Northeast Florida. He was selected to umpire numerous baseball and softball tournaments at the state level and a total of 5 regional tournaments. Twice he was selected to umpire the EMEA (Europe Mediterranean African) regional tournament in Kutno Poland. Winners of this tournament go on to compete in the Little League World Series in Williamsport PA- a tournament Bobby dreamed of one day umpiring.

In addition to his love of baseball Bobby was a diehard Florida Gators fan who supported his team win or lose. He always enjoyed watching his team play and was a football season ticket holder for over 30 years. Bobby was also an avid golfer and inherited his love of the game from his father. He enjoyed spending time with his friends on the golf course including at his home course at Magnolia Point in Green Cove Springs.

Bobby is survived by his wife Sharon 3 stepchildren and 5 grandchildren; his siblings Kim Gale and Bruce; and his beloved daughters Emily and Katie as well as their mother Christi. He will be missed dearly by all who knew him.

A celebration of life service will be held at 11:00 a.m. on December 3 2022 at Lakeshore Presbyterian Church (2270 Blanding Blvd Jacksonville FL 32210). All are welcome to attend carpooling is encouraged. A reception will follow the service with food music and a chance for friends and family to tell their favorite stories about Bobby. On April 3rd 2023 at 11:00 a.m. Bobby’s ashes will be interred at the Jacksonville National Cemetery with full military honors.

Arrangements are under the care of Russell Haven of Rest Cemetery Funeral Home and Cremation Center 2335 Sandridge Road Green Cove Springs FL 32043. Family and friends may share their condolences at: www.RHRFH.com 904-284-7720"

A tall order of topics; this panel was eager to engage.

“So how are we doing with modernization in these environments?” asked O’Sullivan. Farach replied that while many in the chemical space are embracing programs to modernize and digitalize their operations there are still those who don’t even want to consider artificial intelligence or advanced data analytics or any of this IIoT stuff. “They think it’s hocus pocus” he said blaming these laggards for the chemical industry trailing oil & gas and pharma in pursuing digital transformation. “And some of these systems in chemical factories are from the 1960s. There are elements of these plants that are not talking to each other. And since digitalization requires having access to data we’ve got to start with modernizing these systems first. We’ve got to have a modern control system in place.”

A company can be very interested in evolving to Industry 4.0 Dotson added but if they are trying to perform data analytics on systems that are 40 years old and don’t have the required horsepower it ain’t gonna happen. “The underlying infrastructure is essential to modernization” she concurred.

Heads on the dais nodded in agreement. Abril added that the chemical industry is booming particularly in North America and leaders are having a hard time accepting the idea of taking their plants (no matter how antiquated) offline for a few weeks to make modernization upgrades. “Lack of labor is also really hitting these decision-makers” she added. “They just don’t have the bandwidth to consider these changes.”

But they should the panelists agreed. At some point dated control systems dusty machines and running lean with just-in-time/just-in-case approaches will prove untenable for many in the chemical space. Dotson warned that modernization programs can take many years to develop. Digitalization campaigns don’t provide immediate returns. And current challenges will only worsen over time. “We’re now at the point with the workforce-shortage problem that we have to get more efficient” stressed Farach. “We don’t have the people to run the plants. We need to automate.”

With the motivations clearly established the panelists explored solutions. Rivera advised creating teams of what he calls “bilingual” workers within chemical facilities who can communicate with seasoned workers about existing processes but also spearhead adoption efforts with modern digital tools and systems. Rodenfels added that highlighting the value components with these enterprise-wide updates is critical for buy-in. For example—connecting different digitalization efforts while improving say the cybersecurity or ESG postures. “If planned properly” he said “modernization can be a means to drive additional value. It can be profitable.”

The moderator inquired how to prove that profitability to doubtful purse-string holders. Panelists suggested using existing customer-success stories as proof or referencing consulting-firm studies that prove the benefits of digitalization—think increased throughput reduced downtime less maintenance. “Those stories are out there” Farach insisted.

Abril dove deeper on this front listing three hot-button areas that will prompt chemical-company CEOs to sit up listen and truly consider modernization programs. The first is any safety concerns related to dated workplaces. The second is if quality is being compromised by current systems. And lastly batch integrity. “If batches are spoiled that costs money. CEOs will be eager to find ways to get ahead of that.”

The good news? The biggest wins are among the most simple. Installing variable-speed drives on pumps for example or monitoring the electricity demands of each asset (rather than the entire facility) to pinpoint areas for optimization. “As you modernize it’s like you can put some of your processes on autopilot” explained Rodenfels. “Your operators are still there but they can be doing other more important things.”

Or they can be doing other less important things like browsing eBay for Christmas presents rather than industrial assets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL21hbGF5YS5jb20ucGgvbmV3c19zcGVjaWFsX2ZlYXR1cmUvcm9ja3dlbGwtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLWNoaWNhZ28tZm9yLWF1dG9tYXRpb24tZmFpci1sYXVuY2hlcy1wcm9kdWN0cy10by1haWQtc21hcnQtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy_SAZMBaHR0cHM6Ly9tYWxheWEuY29tLnBoL25ld3Nfc3BlY2lhbF9mZWF0dXJlL3JvY2t3ZWxsLWF1dG9tYXRpb24tcmV0dXJucy10by1jaGljYWdvLWZvci1hdXRvbWF0aW9uLWZhaXItbGF1bmNoZXMtcHJvZHVjdHMtdG8tYWlkLXNtYXJ0LW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmcv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rockwell Automation returns to Chicago for Automation Fair launches products to aid smart manufacturing,"New products and innovations a main focus

What is Automation?

Automation is the process by which machines perform tasks without human involvement. This is achieved through robots and other automated devices or computer software. Companies automate processes to increase efficiency and productivity as well as reduce errors.

The four most common types of automation include:

Fixed automation

This type of automation provides a predetermined response to predetermined input values. For example an assembly line might be set up so that every time one product part is inserted at one end it travels down the assembly line automatically until it comes out the other side with all of its pieces assembled.

Programmable automation

This automation allows users to set rules for decisions based on input values. So instead of having a single preset response to input values programmable automation lets you set different responses depending on other inputs.

Flexible automation

This type of automation combines the best features of both fixed and programmable automation. It allows you to use preset options and enable changes to them like with programmable automation.

Integrated automation

Integrated automation is when software and hardware are seamlessly integrated to produce an automated system that can perform various tasks. These systems rely on predefined data rules and procedures to complete functions without human intervention or time delay.

Automation is a vital part of business development in the current day and age. Automation has become ubiquitous with many industries adopting it for various purposes. For example:

The finance industry often uses automation to reduce human error when calculating complex mathematical formulas.

Retailers use it to manage inventory and perform data analysis for future marketing campaigns.

The healthcare sector employs automation to keep up with demand from aging populations and new technologies that require constant monitoring.

Manufacturing companies had used automation since the 1980s when robot arms started replacing assembly line workers on their production lines.

AI has also become an essential component of automation especially in customer service jobs. Chatbots can answer common questions more efficiently than humans freeing time for customer service representatives to focus on more complicated problems.

Automation companies come in all shapes and sizes but they share two things in common: They make life easier for people through reduced labor needs and improved efficiency and they offer a wide range of services related to specific industries.

A good automation company will know what its customers want how to give it to them efficiently and how it can provide more benefits than competitors. It also should have excellent technical capabilities so customers can rely on them for maintenance and support over the long term.

How to Choose the Best Automation Provider

When it comes to automation various considerations come into play. From the specific tasks that need to be automated to the level of investment you’re willing to make many factors exist to consider when choosing an automation company.

Industry experience

When determining which automation company is right for you you must ensure they have experience with your industry. The best way to do this is by asking for references from people in your industry or looking at the portfolio of their completed projects. If they don’t have any testimonials or past work in your field you may want to move on and find another company with more relevant experience.

Range of services and pricing

Before deciding which automation company to hire take some time to explore what they offer and how much they each cost. Some companies provide one service while others offer many solutions. Make sure you research each type of service they provide before deciding on a particular company so you can efficiently compare prices and offerings.

Dedicated team

Working with an automation company with dedicated teams ensures every project gets the attention it deserves. Dedicated teams also allow for faster turnarounds so if speed is vital then this factor could be essential to consider.

Customer satisfaction rate

You should always look at customer satisfaction rates when researching different automation companies. Reviews are usually available online and give valuable insight into how well a company performs. Another way to assess the quality of a company is by looking at the number of times they’ve been awarded contracts and accolades. Doing your due diligence upfront can help you avoid future problems and costly mistakes.

Company certification

Look for certifications such as ISO 9001 (Quality Management) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management). These certifications speak to a company’s commitment to providing high-quality products and sustainable practices. Choosing a company with these certifications is wise because they demonstrate good intentions in providing green solutions with little to no environmental impact.

History of Automation

Automation has been developing for a surprisingly long time. In the late 1800s factories used primitive automation to replace human labor and make production more efficient. Automation has come a long way from steam to internal combustion engines.

The invention of automated flour mills in 1785 by Oliver Evans helped push this movement even further as they could produce continuously without any human intervention. Then in the 1950s Joseph F. Engelberger co-founded Unimation an American company that developed and manufactured robotic machines.

The first machine it built was the Unimate which could automatically perform tasks like picking up and moving parts on a production line. George Devol invented the first-ever industrial robot arm with six degrees of freedom. His company Unimation would license its technology to major U.S. industries including General Motors.

After that automation grew into new industries like manufacturing retailing transportation and communication. Today robots are everywhere from automobile manufacturing plants to hospitals performing procedures such as brain surgery or installing computer chips into electronic devices. Automation has advanced from solely mechanical and electrical systems to incorporating robotics and artificial intelligence."

(NASDAQ: ROST) today reported earnings per share for the third quarter ended October 29 2022 of $1.00 on net income of $342 million. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.09 on net income of $385 million for the 13 weeks ended October 30 2021. Sales for the 2022 third quarter were $4.6 billion in line with the prior year with comparable store sales down 3% on top of a robust 14% gain for the same period in 2021.

For the nine months ended October 29 2022 earnings per share were $3.08 on net earnings of $1.1 billion versus $3.82 per share on net income of $1.4 billion for the same year-to-date period in 2021. Sales for the first nine months of 2022 were $13.5 billion with comparable store sales down 5% on top of a strong 14% increase last year.

Barbara Rentler Chief Executive Officer commented “ Third quarter results were above our expectations as we delivered stronger values throughout our stores. Operating margin for the period was 9.8% versus 11.4% last year reflecting the deleveraging effect from the comparable sales decline as well as pressure from higher markdowns and unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs.”

Ms. Rentler added “ During the third quarter we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $244 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in common stock during fiscal 2022 under our two-year $1.9 billion repurchase program that extends through fiscal 2023.”

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2022 Guidance

Looking ahead Ms. Rentler said “ We continue to expect a very promotional holiday selling season and ongoing inflationary headwinds to pressure our low-to-moderate income customers. That said we face our easiest sales and earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter and are raising our guidance given our third quarter sales momentum and improved holiday assortments.”

Ms. Rentler continued “ We now expect fourth quarter same store sales to be flat to down 2% on top of a 9% gain in the prior year with earnings per share forecasted to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.26. Based on our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter forecast earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are now projected to be in the range of $4.21 to $4.34 versus $4.87 last year.”

Ms. Rentler concluded “ There remains a high level of uncertainty in today’s macroeconomic and geopolitical environment that continues to negatively impact consumer sentiment and demand. However we remain confident in the off-price business model which offers both value and convenience. Given consumers’ heightened focus on both of these attributes it should bode well for our ability to expand our market share and profitability in the future.”

With bargain hunting and budget sensitivity at record highs amid ongoing inflation and economic gloom discount chains are ruling the roost right now thanks to aggressive price wars among their normally full-priced competitors. Add in a glut of unsold inventory that is keeping wholesale apparel prices under pressure alongside the belt-tightening buying environment and the stage is set for brands that stand for value and savings.

“Our top priority is and always will be delivering fresh and exciting named brand merchandise at compelling discounts every day in our growing store base of over 2000 locations” Ross Stores CEO Barbara Rentler told investors Thursday afternoon (Nov. 17) during the company’s third-quarter earnings call. “With consumers’ heightened focus on value and convenience this bodes well for our ability to expand our market share and profitability in the future.”

Investors have bid up the retailer’s stock price by 50% since July 1 compared to a 3% gain for the S&P 500.

While she acknowledged that ongoing inflationary pressures are having a larger impact on lower-income customers at its dd’s brand Rentler said the discounter was not slowing the chain’s plans for location growth for both of its brand banners.

TJX Embraced by ‘Treasure Hunters’

In a similar sentiment from off-price segment leader TJX whose portfolio includes the T.J. Maxx Marshalls and HomeGoods chains CEO Ernie Herrman credited the retailer’s better-than-expected United States comp sales growth with “excellent performance” within its two apparel-focused businesses during its Q3 earnings call.

“As I’ve been saying all year long the marketplace is absolutely loaded with quality branded merchandise across good better and best brands” Herrman said adding that through the holidays TJX plans to “flow fresh product to our stores and online multiple times a week” which he called a key differentiator versus many other retailers.

“We see many opportunities to drive sales and traffic as we attract a wide range of customers across many income demographics which we believe is a key advantage of our business” Herrman said. “In a retail environment where overall pricing has been reset higher we believe our value proposition will be even more compelling and visible to consumers and that our treasure hunt shopping experience will hold tremendous appeal.”

Shares of TJX were up on the news and are up 35% since July 1.

Sign of the Times

To be sure the gains being seen by discounters are not being felt industrywide. Big brands like Target and Kohl’s are being extra aggressive in their markdowns but their efforts have not triggered the same consumer response.

However the performance of discounters aligns with PYMNTS research on the value of discounting in the current environment.

Per the study “Consumer Inflation Sentiment: Consumers Buckle Down on Belt-Tightening” “Cutting back on ‘nice to haves’ is the most common way consumers are seeking to save money but it is not the only way. More consumers are also seeking cheaper merchants and buying lower-quality products to cut costs on grocery and retail purchases.”

Royal Caribbean is leading the charge with the announcement of the opening of its new state-of-the-art $125 million cruise terminal in Galveston Texas which welcomed that state’s largest cruise ship the Allure of the Seas. The terminal is expected to welcome as many as 630000 travelers every year. This also marked the Texas debut of the Oasis Class of ships the largest cruise ships in the world.

The terminal boasts over 161300 sq. ft. and is the first LEED Zero Energy facility in the world meaning it gets 100 percent of its power from onsite solar panels very much in keeping with Royal Caribbean Group’s environmentally-friendly goals.

The Allure of the Seas will offer 7-night Western Caribbean cruises from its homeport of Galveston during the winter 2022-2023 season an itinerary that includes stops in Costa Maya and Cozumel Mexico as well as Roatan Honduras. The family-friendly ship has an extraordinary selection of onboard fun to choose from including rock-climbing walls a nine-story high zip-line and two FlowRider surf simulators—just for starters—and over 30 bars restaurants and lounges.

Expansion is high on the list for Carnival Cruise Line—for 2023 the line has doubled the number of cruises from Norfolk Virginia and extended the season to a consecutive 6-month period from May through October. The idea is to eventually lead into a year-round cruise program from the destination starting in 2025.

The sailings for 2023 are already on sale and include 4- to 10-day cruises on Carnival Magic with stops in the Eastern Caribbean The Bahamas and Bermuda as well as Canada and New England. The ship accommodates up to 4724 guests and will keep your clients plenty entertained with tons of dining options activities a spa and a choice of staterooms and the Serenity adults-only retreat among so many other treats.

This is the iceberg tip of a larger expansion plan for the line in its mid-Atlantic operations. The second big piece of news from Carnival: Reservations are already open for the 2023 sailings of the new Carnival Venezia round-trip from NYC starting in June replacing the Carnival Magic that moved to Norfolk. The ship is ready to honor its name by hosting “Carnival Fun Italian Style” on its 22 itineraries that visit 25 ports across 14 countries with 10 different durations.

The inaugural 15-day transatlantic journey for the Carnival Venezia departs on May 29 2023. It will then spend the summer on 4- 5- 6- and 8-day sailings with stops in the Caribbean Bermuda and ports in Canada and New England. Come fall the Carnival Venezia will head out to the Eastern Caribbean Southern Caribbean and The Bahamas on 8- to 12-day cruises starting on Sept. 29 2023. Ports of call will include four of Carnival’s private destinations and the 9-day cruises will include a stop in the glittering port of Miami.

Cruise New P.S.

Of note: The Carnival Venezia is undergoing a ton of enhancements in its transformation from a Costa vessel so your clients will find many of the Carnival Cruise Line venues they know and love; think Carnival Waterworks Piano Bar 88 Cloud 9 Salon & Spa the Serenity Adult-Only Retreat and many more attractions. And in even more good cruise news they’ll also have a second “Carnival Fun Italian Style” ship to look forward to in 2024 with the addition of the Carnival Firenze set to sail year-round from Long Beach California.

Executives at several of the world's biggest cruise companies in recent weeks have said nearly all their ships should be running full again by the middle of next year for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

For instance Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings president and CEO Frank Del Rio told Wall Street analysts last week that average occupancy on the company's 29 vessels should ramp up steadily over the next six months and reach 100% by the summer.

For more cruise news guides and tips sign up for TPG's cruise newsletter.

In fact he suggested occupancy across the fleet could be more than 100% by the summer — something that is possible when more than two people stay in a cabin.

Occupancy on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' ships was about 82% during the three months that ended Oct. 31 — up from 65% in the three months before that. In both cases that was far below normal levels.

The company owns three cruise brands: Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

""We expect load factors to continue improving sequentially to the mid-to-high 80% range in the [current quarter] ... and the steady occupancy ramp-up is expected to continue until we reach historical 100%-plus levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023"" Del Rio said during a conference call to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings.

Del Rio's comments came just days after Royal Caribbean Group chief financial officer Naftali Holtz told Wall Street analysts that the company expected occupancy levels to return to historical occupancy levels at the company's cruise brands by the spring of 2023.

Royal Caribbean Group is the parent company of Royal Caribbean Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises and it's also a part owner in German lines TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises.

Holtz said Royal Caribbean Group ships finished the third quarter at a 96% occupancy level which was up significantly from an 82% occupancy level in the second quarter but still below normal.

Royal Caribbean Group ships normally sail at more than 100% occupancies.

The world's biggest cruise company Carnival Corporation also is forecasting a return to 100% occupancies on ships by summer 2023. The company reported 84% occupancy for the summer months of July August and September — up from 69% occupancy for the three months before that.

Carnival Corporation owns nine cruise brands including Carnival Cruise Line Princess Cruises Holland America and Seabourn.

In normal years most major cruise lines typically report occupancies of 100% or more for their ships. The business model followed by most major lines involves setting prices and investing in marketing at levels that will ensure such a high occupancy as the economics of cruise ships work best when they run full.

However occupancy levels on cruise ships fell sharply after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. At first cruise ships didn't operate at all and when they started to resume operations they sometimes sailed with fewer than half of the cabins filled; cruisers were slow to return and cruise lines struggled to lure people back — even with unusually low prices.

Occupancy levels at some lines as recently as the start of 2022 were less than 50%.

While this was a terrible situation for cruise lines which reported massive financial losses in 2021 and through much of this year it was a boon for cruisers who wanted to experience vessels with far smaller crowds than normal.

In 2021 some cruise ships sailed with less than 30% of the normal number of passengers while still operating with a normal crew contingent; this resulted in extraordinary service levels in some cases.

Occupancy on cruise ships has been rising throughout 2022 and already is back to normal in some regions for some lines.

Royal Caribbean Group for instance reported earlier this month that its occupancy levels on Caribbean sailings were close to 105% which is in the normal range. Occupancy for sailings in Alaska during the last quarter was about 96% which is below normal the company said.

Royal Caribbean Group reported occupancy levels on Europe cruises of just under 90% for the third quarter.

I have friends and family that have felt this way for years out of concern that ships are overcrowded isolated in the ocean or otherwise bored. Regardless of the reason they haven't tried a cruise yet because they believe it would not be a fun vacation.

Royal Caribbean (and the entire cruise industry) has worked for years to undo those beliefs and one of the best ways has been to design and build new cruise ships that defy the notion of what you can do on a ship.

When I hear from new cruisers many are astounded by how much there was to do onboard. Any fear of not having enough to do or feeling ""trapped"" are almost always brushed aside after they get home.

If I had to pick a cruise ship for a non-cruiser to try Wonder of the Seas is that ship because I think it has so many amenities onboard that they never expected. If your idea of a great vacation is heading to a sandy beach laying out by the pool enjoying high-class entertainment and plenty of food and drink options then I think Wonder of the Seas may be the perfect first cruise ship for you.

The best suite experience in the fleet

If you elect to book a suite you can look forward to the best end-to-end suite program on any Royal Caribbean ship.

When you book a Royal Caribbean suite you're not just getting a large cruise ship cabin. You're also getting access to a number of services that other passengers do not have.

Suite guests have access to their own complimentary restaurant suite lounge and entire suite sun deck.

Known as the Suite Neighborhood this area is at the top of Wonder of the Seas and is where you'll find the suite lounge Coastal Kitchen restaurant and pool area.

I think the sun deck is particularly compelling because it is a sprawling space with loungers bar plunge pool and sweeping views.

Someone that hasn't cruised before may be drawn to booking a suite because they tend to stay in suites in hotels for bonuses that come with those rooms. Similarly a cruise ship suite is about rewarding guests with added service that make the entire experience easier to enjoy.

Dining and food galore

Regardless if you're on a cruise ship or your hometown everyone can enjoy a great meal.

Someone that has never cruised probably imagines a dining hall and buffet as what the cruise dining experience is like similar in some regards to an all-inclusive hotel. While there is a buffet and main dining room on cruise ships there is so much more than just that.

Royal Caribbean designed Wonder of the Seas so that there was a wide assortment of dining choices. First and foremost they cannot have everyone onboard the ship eating at just a couple of restaurants. Moreover Royal Caribbean knows they are competing against land resorts that have a variety of food.

On Wonder of the Seas you have over 40 restaurants bars and lounges to choose from which means you can can visit six different places each day of the week.

There's Japanese hibachi custom-made salads New England style seafood and a new Southern American restaurant that has barbecue pulled pork fried chicken and crab beignets.

This isn't microwaved and/or pre-prepared food. Rather chefs prepare all the food each day.

Fears that you will be stuck eating just at the buffet will quickly disappear once you discover all the choices on a ship like Wonder of the Seas.

If you enjoy a cocktail or two Royal Caribbean offers over 400 different cocktails wines beers and zero-proof cocktails available. Of course the bar staff can create almost any drink you like that isn't on the menu so you just have to ask.

Teens will love the fact there are zero-proof cocktails available in their own teen club area of the ship.

Known as Social100's Patio teens can check out the bar there that includes jumbo-size games a private whirlpool loungers and nooks.

The places you'll visit

Another fear new cruisers have is that they will feel trapped. Friends usually say ""I'd hate to be stuck at sea"" and the reality is a cruise on Wonder of the Seas will take you to some gorgeous places.

On a 7-night cruise you can expect to visit at least three ports of call if not more. That means on most days of your cruise you'll have to opportunity to disembark for the day and explore ports of call in the Caribbean.

When I first started cruising I loved days we were in port because you would wake up and be somewhere new each day.

You could enjoy the sandy beaches of Cozumel Mexico or walk the streets of Old San Juan. You might be able to drive an ATV snorkel with marine life all around you or learn about the history and culture of the people that call the port you are visiting home.

In short there are a lot of amazing things you can do during your cruise while in port. Having more than half the days of your cruise include a port visit substantially helps reduce the feeling that you're relegated to the ship only.

No cruise aboard Wonder of the Seas is complete without a visit to Royal Caribbean's private island of Perfect Day at CocoCay. Other cruise lines have private islands but none compare to the amazing upgrades Royal Caribbean has invested at CocoCay.

Perfect Day at CocoCay is not just a beach reserved for cruise ship guests. There's a water park upgraded beach club giant freshwater pool and island food you actually want to eat.

And after a day of fun ashore you get to come back to the cruise ship (just like a hotel) and enjoy evening dining and entertainment.

All this fun onboard and on shore means the time will pass quickly and you'll find the week-long cruise flying by.

The best selection of activities on any cruise ship

I'm going to make the bold statement that Wonder of the Seas has the best variety of entertainment and things to do of any cruise ship right now.

Royal Caribbean has a reputation for being the cruise line that packs their ships with the most ""I can't believe you do that on a cruise ship"" sort of activities.

Families can choose between water slides an open-air play area for younger children 10-story dry slide that has lights and sound effects and aqua park.

At night there's three different venues performing various shows that are included with your cruise fare.

Studio B has professional ice skaters that perform 365: The Seasons on Ice. Using projection technology the cast tells the story of Earth’s changing seasons.

Moving to the AquaTheater on the back of the ship you'll be able to see an all-female cast perform inTENse that includes acrobatics slacklining high diving tumbling and synchronized swimming.

The Royal Theater has two shows that have Broadway-style performances to enjoy.

If that isn't enough there are comedy shows a piano bar live musical performances around the ship and even movies by the pool to watch.

The takeaway here is that there is so much to do onboard and it's up to you how much (or little) you do. If you're worried a cruise ship means you'll be bored because the expectation is you alternate between sitting by the pool and eating you'll be pleasantly surprised how much more there is to do.

Kids? No problem: Lots for adults

Royal Caribbean is the best cruise line for families and whether you have kids or not there is lots to enjoy for adults on Wonder of the Seas.

If you do have kids there is supervised kids programming in Adventure Ocean that is available for children as young as six months old all the way up to 17 years old.

The nursery is available for kids between 6 and 36 months old for an addition cost. As a parent that has used the nursery extensively it's worth every penny.

Kids between 3 and 17 have their own supervised space where they can play dance draw and have fun with other kids their age. It's not just an enclave for children it's an opportunity for them to do what they want while you enjoy time alone to do what you want.

Besides the amazing restaurants you can choose from for date night there's lots more you can do without any children on Wonder of the Seas.

First and foremost there is an entire area of the pool deck reserved just for adults. The Solarium is an enclosed pool area with upgraded loungers. Because it's climate controlled it's always the perfect temperature!

You'll also find arguably the best wine bar across any Royal Caribbean cruise ship with Giovanni's Wine Bar. Located in Central Park Royal Caribbean revamped its wine bar experience with a new motif and the added bonus of being able to enjoy many of the same foods you'd find in nearby Giovanni's Italian Kitchen without getting up from your seat.

You can visit the casino throughout the day or night where you'll find plenty of slot machines poker tables blackjack roulette craps and more table games. For a lot of people the casino fun is another way Royal Caribbean caters to parents while the kids are away.

If you prefer to pamper yourself why not take a visit to the Vitality Spa where you there are some truly amazing treatments to choose from along with a full salon.

While not adults only if you're cruising without kids you might consider buying a pass to the Coco Beach Club at Perfect Day at CocoCay.

The Coco Beach Club is an upgraded beach day experience complete with its own restaurant and infinity pool. Kids are allowed here but most families end up elsewhere for the variety of things to do around the island. This means a great spot to spend your day and splurge a bit.

If an adults-only beach area sounds like heaven don't worry because Royal Caribbean has your back.

Scheduled to open in late 2023 Hideaway Beach will be a new expansion area that will only allow adults in and offer yet-to-be-announced things to do.

Convinced yet?

If you gravitate towards booking a beach vacation or prefer to stay in a new hotel and have not tried a cruise yet Wonder of the Seas might be the perfect cruise ship for you.

Wonder of the Seas has the latest and greatest innovations and things to do which rival much of what you can find on a land vacation. Better yet a cruise includes much more in your base cost than a land vacation.

You're going to find plenty for everyone in your family to do. Other lines tend to cater to either mostly kids or mostly adults but Royal Caribbean is far more even keeled at a price families can afford.

If you are one of those people that never considered a cruise vacation Wonder of the Seas is the ship that could change your mind.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F.

Laturnus Obituary 2024,"Peter S. (Pete) Laturnus

December 30 1934 – May 09 2024

Peter S. Laturnus 89 of Munich ND passed away on May 09 2024 at CHI St Alexius Health Devils Lake Hospital.

Mass of Christian Burial for Pete will be held on Tuesday May 14 2024 at 10:30 a.m. at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich ND with Father Brian Moen celebrating the Mass. Burial will be at the St Boniface Catholic Cemetery. Visitation will be at the church one hour prior to the funeral Mass.

Visitation will be at the Gilbertson Funeral Home Devils Lake on Monday May 13th from 4:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. with a Rosary and Prayer Service at 6:00 p.m.

Peter Sebastian was born on December 30 1934 in Wilkin Saskatchewan Canada one of 13 children of Sylvester and Gunda (Steffan) Laturnus. He was the third youngest of the family. In 1945 the family moved to a farm near Starkweather North Dakota and later to Cando North Dakota where Pete attended Metcalf County school through the 8th grade. Several years later the family moved to a farm near Clyde North Dakota. Pete obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1960.

Pete worked with his brother-in-law Elmer Mueller for many years doing plumbing and heating work. When Elmer retired Pete started his own plumbing and heating business along with farming for many years at Calio N.D. He so loved the farm and could build and fix almost anything. He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas. In later years they loved listening to the Sayler’s Polka Place music every Sunday afternoon and looked forward to occasional trips to the casino.

Pete was an active member of St. Boniface and St. Mary’s Catholic Church and was a life member of the Knights of Columbus.

Pete is survived by his beloved wife of 67 years Donna their children and spouses Dean (Kim) Laturnus Munich Daryl (Sandy Hendrickson) Laturnus Munich Dennis (Lori) Laturnus Grand Forks Steve (Donna) Laturnus Grand Forks and Bonnie (Alvin) Wald Bismarck along with 11 grandchildren; Deanna (Jeff) Heidi (Troy) Kayla (Brant); Amanda (Tyler); Justin (Jessica) Rebecca (Justin) Matthew (special friend Emily); Mitchel Conner Emma Dominic and 14 great grandchildren sister-in-law Helen Laturnus and many nieces and nephews.

By Jared Wiener Solutions Architect – AWS

Communication with end users is an important part of managing a customer relationship. For organizations leveraging both Salesforce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) the new Salesforce Event Relay using Amazon EventBridge enables developers to trigger AWS actions like sending an SMS message using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) in response to an event within Salesforce.

Salesforce is an AWS Partner and customer relationship management (CRM) platform giving organizations a single shared view of activity across their marketing sales commerce and service departments. Salesforce functionality can be extended to take advantage of the infrastructure and managed services offered by AWS.

Salesforce Event Relays enable bidirectional event flows between Salesforce and AWS through Amazon EventBridge. This opens up opportunities to build event-driven near real-time applications responding to feedback and outside triggers as they happen.

From sending appointment reminders to customers to providing the latest update on a support case this pattern creates new opportunities to engage with customers in their preferred mode of communication. Developers building off of this integration can focus on the user experience without the overhead of having to manage connectivity across platforms.

In this post we will use the bidirectional integration to pass events from Salesforce to AWS to send SMS messages and notify you when a user responds to your message.

Solution Overview

This is an event-driven architecture leveraging Custom Platform Events in Salesforce. Using Event Relay as an interface to Amazon EventBridge the event is passed to an AWS Step Functions state machine which triggers Amazon SNS to send the SMS message.

When the user responds to the SMS message Amazon Pinpoint forwards it to an AWS Lambda function through an SNS topic. The Lambda function triggers an EventBridge event rule that uses an API destination endpoint to relay the message to a Salesforce inbound Platform Event.

Figure 1 – Solution overview.

Prerequisites

Salesforce account with Event Relays enabled.

Postman REST API Tool and the Salesforce Postman API Collection.

AWS account with a role that has sufficient access to provision the required infrastructure.

Credentials that enable you to interact with your AWS account.

10DLC to send SMS messages.

Set Up Salesforce Event Relay Configuration and Connected App

Use this guide as a reference if you need additional help configuring Event Relay or need information necessary to set up your API client.

Create a Platform Event in Salesforce; this will be the event that will be sent to AWS. From Salesforce Setup navigate to Platform Events and choose New Platform Event.

Figure 2 – Salesforce New Platform Event form.

Enter a label and plural label and choose Save ; we will call this “GenericSMS.”



Figure 3 – Salesforce New Custom Field form.

Under Custom Fields & Relationships  select New for each required field and configure based on the expected payload from EventBridge.



Figure 4 – Salesforce New Custom Field form.

We will create two fields Message and PhoneNumber . Be sure your PhoneNumber field length allows for your full internationally formatted phone number; for example in the U.S. it would be +12125551212 so a length of 12.



Figure 5 – Salesforce Platform Event after creation.

In Postman log in to your Salesforce account following the directions in the Postman Collection. To create a channel for a custom Platform Event send a POST request to {{_endpoint}}/services/data/v{{version}}/sobjects/PlatformEventChannel with a JSON body:

{ ""FullName"": ""SMSChannel__chn"" ""Metadata"": { ""channelType"": ""event"" ""label"": ""Custom Channel for Relaying SMS Platform Events"" } } 3. You should receive a response similar to the following—save the id field value. { ""id"" : ""0YL9A000000000kWAA"" ""success"" : true ""errors"" : [ ] ""warnings"" : [ ] ""infos"" : [ ] }

To create a Channel Member to associate the custom platform event send a POST request to https://<SFDomain>/services/data/v54.0/tooling/sobjects/PlatformEventChannelMember with JSON body:

{ ""FullName"": ""SMSChannel_chn_GenericSMS_e"" ""Metadata"": { ""eventChannel"": ""SMSChannel__chn"" ""selectedEntity"": ""GenericSMS__e"" } }

You should receive a response similar to this—once again save the id field value:

{ ""id"" : ""0v89A000000083KQAQ"" ""success"" : true ""errors"" : [ ] ""warnings"" : [ ] ""infos"" : [ ] }

Create a Named Credential by sending a POST request to https://<SFDomain>/services/data/v54.0/tooling/sobjects/NamedCredential/ with the following JSON body. Replace <aws_region> and <aws_account_number> and match the AWS account which will host EventBridge. (AWS Region must be ALL CAPS.)

{ ""FullName"" : ""MyRelayNamedCredential"" ""Metadata"" : { ""endpoint"" : ""arn:aws:<aws_region>:<aws_account_number>"" ""generateAuthorizationHeader"" : true ""label"" : ""MyRelayNamedCredential"" ""principalType"" : ""NamedUser"" ""protocol"" : ""NoAuthentication"" } }

Create an Event Relay Configuration by sending a POST request to https://<SFDomain>/services/data/v54.0/tooling/sobjects/EventRelayConfig/ with the following JSON body. The Event Channel is the ID returned from Step 3 and the MyRelayNamedCredential referenced in the DestinationResourceName is the credential from Step 6.

{ ""DeveloperName"": ""MyEventRelay"" ""MasterLabel"" : ""MyEventRelay"" ""EventChannel"" : ""0YLXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"" ""DestinationResourceName"" : ""callout:MyRelayNamedCredential"" }

You will receive a response similar to the following:

{ ""id"" : ""7k2RM000000000VYAQ"" ""success"" : true ""errors"" : [ ] ""warnings"" : [ ] ""infos"" : [ ] }

In the AWS Management Console under EventBridge > Partner event sources choose the pending source and associate it with an event bus.

Figure 6 – An example of a pending partner event source.

You can now create rules on the bus to send to a state machine. Create a new Step Functions state machine; sample code below:

{ ""Comment"": ""A state machine to send SMS"" ""StartAt"": ""SNS Publish"" ""States"": { ""SNS Publish"": { ""Type"": ""Task"" ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sns:publish"" ""Parameters"": { ""Message.$"": ""$.Message__c"" ""PhoneNumber.$"": ""$.PhoneNumber__c"" } ""InputPath"": ""$.detail.payload"" ""End"": true } } }

By default the Event Relay will be created in a stopped state. To start sending events to AWS send a PATCH request to https://<SFDomain>/services/data/v54.0/tooling/sobjects/EventRelayConfig/[EventRelayConfigId]  using the Event Relay Configuration ID from Step 8 and a JSON body:

{ ""State"": ""RUN"" }

A successful response will return HTTP status 204 / No Content.

Set Up AWS Resources

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eventbridge-salesforce-sms.git

Deploy the resources using AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM). The deploy command processes the AWS SAM template file to create the necessary resources in AWS. Choose Salesforce-AWS-SMS-Stack as the stack name and the AWS region you want to deploy your solution to.

cd amazon-eventbridge-salesforce-sms sam build sam deploy --guided --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM

Use the default parameters or replace with different values if necessary. For example to get counts of a different filler phrase replace the FillerPhrase parameter.

Column 1 Column 2 Stack Name Provide stack name (example: Salesforce-AWS-SMS-Stack) AWS Region Provide a region to deploy the resources (should be the same region you requested the phone number from) SalesforceEventSource The parameter will need to match the event bus created using the above API calls. In general it should match this format: the <Event_Channel_ID> matches the ID returned in the previous section Step 3.

PTC has announced a plan to acquire ServiceMax for $1.46 billion to extend its closed-loop PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) strategy into downstream Enterprise Asset Management and Field Service Management.

The purchase from SilverLake Partners will be funded in two stages - $808 million paid on close of deal and $650 million to be paid in October 2023. The deal is subject to regulatory approval but is intended to close in January 2023.

Breaking down the reasons for the acquisition the second major gambit that PTC has made this year CEO Jim Heppelmann argues:

The ServiceMax acquisition will fit nicely into our ongoing program of performing while transforming. As a sizeable pure SaaS business ServiceMax is completely aligned with our SaaS initiative. And as a key service system of record it will add depth to the already successful service dimension of our PLM strategy. With ServiceMax on board we'll be in a position to lean in harder on what we call Service Lifecycle Management or SLM.

PTC has gained category leadership in the PLM space he adds but ServiceMax will bolster that position and help to move into the next phase of expansion:

The PLM market is growing double digits which might be higher than you expect. This is because certain sub-segments of the PLM big picture like ALM SLM and IoT are growing substantially faster than mainstream PLM. PTC has strong positions in each of these sub-segments. ServiceMax is expected to add about $148 million on a trailing 12 month basis to our PLM software revenue. Therefore the addition of ServiceMax will increase our PLM category leadership while helping us maintain our growth rate…The CAD and PLM markets we serve are large and have healthy growth rates.

Digital transformation

Having ServiceMax in the fold will materially increase PTC's TAM (Total Addressable Market) Heppelmann explains at a time when the macro-environment demands change:

Digital transformation has been the key driver of the market's accelerating growth rate. The investment in digital transformation is massive and about a third of it more than $500 billion per year is being deployed by manufacturing companies. Manufacturers are investing a lot because they're under pressure. The hybrid workforce doesn't work with paper processes and digital product data has to be both accessible and managed. Public companies of all types are being pressured to address climate change and industrial companies are generally significant offenders. They have a lot of room for improvement but they can't move the needle much without analyzing their products and the manufacturing and service processes those products employ. Meanwhile software is eating the world and whether it's embedded controls digital user experience or IoT-enabled conductivity more and more product engineering is done in software every year. On top of all that due to COVID semiconductor shortages we've seen the pressures that supply chain issues are putting on product development and manufacturing.

All of this drives a need for the type of offerings that PTC has in its portfolio he goes on:

PLM in particular has changed from a ‘nice to have’ to a ‘must have’ for manufacturing companies of all types. PTC’s strategy is perfectly aligned to the digital transformation needs of industrial companies. Our logo tells the story - the black part is a P representing the physical world; the green part is a D representing the digital world; the shape is a ying yang symbol which means that physical and digital counterbalance and complement each other in a special way. At PTC we've reduced this complex interrelationship to three simple words - digital transforms physical.

Long game

As to where ServiceMax will fit in Heppelmann reveals that this acquisition has been a long time coming from PTC’s point of view:

Our interest in ServiceMax stems from the fact that connected service is one of the killer vertical solutions for Industrial IoT. We launched our original partnership with ServiceMax in 2015 even buying an equity stake in the company. Unfortunately an interloper stepped in and derailed our plans. General Electric [GE] surprised everybody by purchasing ServiceMax in 2017 for a very high price. At first we thought our partnership would survive but GE soon made it clear that ServiceMax would serve their Predix strategy and not PTC and they cancelled the partnership unilaterally. The only good that came of it was a nice return on our equity investment.

There’s clearly no love lost here still as he comments:

Being part of GE Digital was very unhealthy for ServiceMax.Two years later after GE Digital had imploded a damaged ServiceMax was carved back out of GE by Silver Lake Partners. It took Silver Lake several years to re-build a business including bringing on a new leadership team. But by 2021 ServiceMax was very healthy again and was just days from launching an IPO where PTC was again planning to invest as a strategic partner. After the IPO market collapsed Silver Lake agreed to sell PTC the business at terms that we all like.

But the way events rolled out had an impact on PTC’s plans he notes:

We originally got into this partnership with ServiceMax to drive cross sell. We had integrated our products together we were starting to make joint sales calls we were building a nice pipeline and were really pretty excited about it. And then that was interrupted as I described and kind of we lost a lot of momentum there. We went back to the drawing board. At that point we still had the IoT business and the AR business so it was just a question of priorities. We had a strategy for SLM that was supposed to have ServiceMax in the middle of it and suddenly that strategy didn't exist.

So this has been a long game to date but one that’s worth the wait says Heppelmann:

The reason we've been pursuing ServiceMax for so long is that it fits perfectly into the service or SLM part of our PLM strategy. ServiceMax will be the anchor system of record for products in the field which knits together our whole SLM story across the many different service-related assets PTC has acquired over time...ServiceMax is doing well because they offer a wide range of capabilities all running on the Salesforce platform that work together to address the entire range of service needs a customer has from contract management to install base management to the scheduling and utilizations of parts crews and contractors in the service process. ServiceMax is the missing ingredient in our SLM story. ServiceMax is designed for companies who need to deliver asset-centric service. That means companies who can't service a given product without knowing a lot about that specific product's serial number. Contrast that to the Verizon truck that can come to your home and fix your cable problem without knowing anything about you or your home or the hardware you have because it's all disposable commodity stuff anyway. They only need to know your address and have somebody let them in.

That Salesforce angle

And there’s a useful Salesforce angle here in play he attests with ServiceMax built on the Force.com platform:

We really like the Salesforce angle and believe we can drive cross sell in both directions here. Obviously Salesforce has a proven SaaS platform with a massive installed base. Salesforce CRM manages the 360 degree view of the customer; PTC manages the 360 degree view of the product or asset; ServiceMax bridges these worlds because it knows which products are at which customers what their service needs are how to perform that service and what parts the technician will need to bring along. I think that choosing PTC for PLM will make incrementally more sense for Salesforce customers and choosing Salesforce CRM will make incrementally more sense for B2C customers. I expect that PTC will be able to help take the ServiceMax partnership with Salesforce to an elevated level.

He adds:

We have zero - zero! - interest in re-platforming this thing off Salesforce. We actually think the Salesforce platform's just fine. The cost structure of using that platform is pretty fair. And we think it's frankly a nice bridge to that massive customer base. One of the things that got GE into trouble is they started to talk about re-platforming ServiceMax onto Predix and that didn't go over well. First of all Salesforce didn't like it. And the second thing is that customers of ServiceMax are typically customers of Salesforce. They didn't want it to be re-platformed. So we have zero interest in doing that. We're not even going to have that conversation internally.

As to how PTC intends to integrate Salesforce’s platform and its own Atlas platform he explains:

When software runs in the cloud whether it runs on one cloud two clouds three clouds you don't really know. So it's very easy for us to deliver an experience to a customer that appears 100% integrated even if part of it is running on Salesforce and part of it is running on Atlas. And so that's how we will proceed. By the way the user interface of ServiceMax looks like the user interface of Salesforce because normally you're running it inside Salesforce. So we won't try to even change that. There's a look and feel there that makes sense. We'll integrate these products together in the best way possible. We need to do a lot of design work. For all these 'gun-jumping' [regulatory] rules and so forth we're not actually allowed to do all that work prior to closing the deal. The good news is we did it all five years ago. We actually built all these integrations five years ago. We just need to dust them off update them and talk about what else can we do going forward?

My take

All good things come to those who wait…

This latest stage in the ServiceMax story came somewhat out of the blue but the pitch from PTC’s Heppelmann is a compelling one. That Salesforce angle is going to be one to watch. That said overall assuming this gets the regulatory approval it needs this acquisition and its aftermath will be one to keep an eye on in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc2FsZXNmb3JjZS1vZmZlcnMtNjAtZGF5cy1zZXZlcmFuY2Utbm90LXNpeC1tb250aHMtMjAyMi0xMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salesforce Offers Laid-Off Workers 60 Days Severance Not Six Months,"Salesforce laid off hundreds of employees this month insiders say.

An internal policy document viewed by Insider shows Salesforce offering up to six months severance.

Employees laid off this month were told to expect 60 days.

An internal Salesforce document viewed by Insider outlines a severance policy where laid-off employees could qualify for up to six months of pay depending on their years of tenure. And yet employees terminated in Salesforce's November round of layoffs were told to expect 60 days according to two sources regardless of tenure.

It isn't entirely clear if Salesforce changed its policy prior to this most recent layoff despite the document seen by Insider that spells out the six-month policy. (Salesforce declined to comment.) But in August 2020 when the company laid off 1000 employees it confirmed that it was giving those employees two months to land a new job at the company and failing that they would each get six months of pay and benefits CNBC reported at the time.

Subsea Integration Alliance is a non-incorporated strategic global alliance between Subsea 7 and OneSubsea the subsea technologies production and processing business of SLB (ex-Schlumberger).

Announcing the Cypre contract news on Friday Subsea 7 said that the scope of the awarded Subsea Integration Alliance contract was substantial. This means its share of revenue is between $150 million and $300 million

Subsea 7’s scope covers the concept and design engineering procurement construction and installation of a two-phase liquid natural gas tieback to the Juniper platform through dual flexible flowlines and a manifold gathering system along with topside upgrades.

Design engineering and project management will begin right away at Subsea 7's offices in the United States. Installation offshore is scheduled for 2024.

OneSubsea will deliver the subsea production systems which will include seven horizontal subsea tree systems subsea controls and connection systems distribution and control systems and aftermarket services.

Craig Broussard Vice President for Subsea 7 US said: “We have been working closely with BP and our suppliers at the earliest possible stage to help develop and deliver an integrated SPS and SURF solution that optimises cost and efficiency to accelerate first gas.”

Olivier Blaringhem CEO for Subsea Integration Alliance said: ”BP's Cypre project is a prime example of our ability to harness the key strengths of Subsea Integration Alliance; Subsea 7 with its expertise in executing complex EPCI projects and OneSubsea’s fast-track distribution of subsea production systems. Combined we are delivering a refined solution which enables early first gas.”

On September 24 BP said it was proceeding with Cypre development its third subsea gas development in Trinidad and Tobago which is expected to start drilling next year with first gas expected in 2025. The project is planned to have seven wells and subsea trees and be tied back into BP’s Juniper platform via two new 14-kilometer flexible flowlines.

The Cypre gas field is located 78 kilometers off the southeast coast of Trinidad within the East Mayaro Block in water depth of approximately 80 meters. At peak the development is expected to deliver average gas production of 250–300 million standard cubic feet a day (mmscfd). Production from Cypre will go towards satisfying BP's existing gas supply commitments.

The Cypre development will access power from Juniper eliminating the need for additional power generation which allows production to be added without increasing BP's operating emissions.

Seagate Exos 2X Mach.2 a multi-actuator HDD has been out in a 14 TB capacity but this week the company also began advertising 16 TB and 18 TB models aimed at hyperscalers.

Most of the advancements in HDD technology center on increasing capacity according to Thomas Coughlin president of Coughlin Associates a digital storage analysis and consulting firm. In the case of Seagate's multi-actuator HDDs the dual-arm technology enables data transfers twice as fast as a single-arm drive. Mach.2's two new drive options allow Seagate to work out any bugs in practical applications on a smaller scale before moving multi-actuator technology to its upcoming high-capacity versions he said.

Coughlin said Seagate is likely doing one more thing with the release of these higher-capacity HDDs: testing the waters.

""Is there a market here [for multi-actuator technology] will it grow and are enterprise data centers and hyperscalers going to take advantage of this type of drive?"" he said.

Addressing future issues The progression from 14 TB to these two new HDD options is about laying the groundwork for what's to come rather than addressing current needs according to Ed Burns analyst at IDC. Seagate's Exos 2X 16 TB and 18 TB drive options likely won't draw in new customers outside of large cloud companies he said. Seagate increases the capacity of its Exos 2X line to 18 TB. ""It is more of a future use case. ... Once drives get to be 40 TB and above there would be stranded capacity or capacity that cannot be quickly accessed with a single actuator"" Burns said. Multiple actuators increase throughput but don't improve latency so specific latency service-level agreements could still be an issue when only using multi-actuator HDDs he said. Latency remains at 4.12 milliseconds in line with the rest of the Exos line according to the vendor. Coughlin added that performance increases on each drive with more than one actuator but customers using an array of multi-actuator drives will see even more of an uptick due to aggregating throughput. He also pointed out that as density goes up rebuilding HDDs becomes more of a challenge due to complexity and time consumption. RAID rebuild is a matter of capacity and performance; capacity has been increasing but performance has been roughly the same he said. ""A dual actuator increases the data rate in and out of the drive which will help in the instance of a drive rebuild at a high capacity"" Coughlin said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4dHJlbWV0ZWNoLmNvbS9jb21wdXRpbmcvMzQwOTUxLXNlYWdhdGVzLXNlY29uZC1nZW4tbWFjaC0yLWRyaXZlcy1hcmUtYXMtZmFzdC1hcy1zYXRhLXNzZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seagate's Second Gen Mach.2 Drives Are as Fast as SATA SSDs,"These days most people don't pay much attention to spinning rust. Everyone is using SSDs now so you don't see many headlines about hard drives anymore. However Seagate has just announced what amounts to the fastest hard drives ever made. They're so fast they're equivalent in throughput to a SATA SSD. Though that's still ""slow"" compared with an NVME drive anyone who has ever used a SATA SSD knows they don't feel slow to your eyes and fingers. A hard drive can't match an SSD's instantaneous search speeds but for data transfers it's still pretty fast.

The drives in question are Seagate's new Exos 2X18. They're the company's second-generation Mach.2 drives which are helium-sealed and feature dual actuators. They're being offered in 16TB and 18TB capacities using either SATA 6Gbps or SAS 12Gbps interfaces according(Opens in a new window) to HotHardware. According to the drives' spec sheet the SATA version offers 545MB/s and the SAS drives deliver 554MB/s sustained transfer rates. That is exactly on par with a SATA SSD which is quite fast for a spinning drive. They don't achieve this breakthrough via super-fast spindle speeds either. These are 7200rpm drives but the dual actuators allow for increased transfer rates.

Each drive is essentially two drives in one with dual actuators which can work in parallel. That allows them to be configured with 9TB and 8TB of capacity per actuator. It's reminiscent of a RAID 0 setup internally. Both actuators serve I/O requests concurrently via dedicated data channels. The new 2x18 drives are slightly faster than the previous gen dubbed 2x14. Those offer maximum sustained rates of 524MB/s. With this latest capacity increase the drives are now on par with SSDs.

At least that's true of their sequential transfer rates. One area where mechanical drives will never match solid-state is in seek times. On a solid-state drive it's practically instantaneous measuring in the sub-20 microseconds. Seagate's spec sheet lists the latency for the 2x18 drives as 4.16ms. That's a lifetime to an end user but since these are enterprise drives it's a different ballgame. They're designed to go into racks not your gaming PC.

Still compared to Seagate's single actuator drives you can see the benefits of the dual actuator design. A drive like the 20TB Exos X20 has the same SATA 6Gb/s interface and 72000rpm spindle speed. However its maximum transfer rate is a mere 270MB/s. Therefore it's exactly half what the 2x18 offers. Seagate hasn't said when the drives will be available or what they will cost. They will include(Opens in a new window) a five-year warranty and are rated for 2.5 million hours of mean time between failure (MTBF).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2F3cy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2Jsb2dzL3F1YW50dW0tY29tcHV0aW5nL3VzaW5nLWQtd2F2ZS1sZWFwLWZyb20tdGhlLWF3cy1tYXJrZXRwbGFjZS13aXRoLWFtYXpvbi1icmFrZXQtbm90ZWJvb2tzLWFuZC1icmFrZXQtc2RrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using D-Wave Leap from the AWS Marketplace with Amazon Braket Notebooks and Braket SDK | Amazon Web Services,"Starting today access to D-Wave products and services has fully transitioned to the AWS Marketplace and customers can no longer access the D-Wave 2000Q and Advantage systems via Amazon Braket the cloud computing service of AWS. In this blog we will show how you can continue to use the Amazon Braket SDK to describe quantum annealing problems and how you can use Braket managed Jupyter Notebooks to submit these problems to D-Wave quantum processors.

D-Wave’s Leap quantum cloud service offering provides on-demand access to the D-Wave 2000Q the latest Advantage systems and the hybrid solver service. Follow this link to read more details about the Leap quantum cloud service and to purchase access to the service for your needs. Since you will be accessing D-Wave devices via the Leap service there will be no additional Braket-related charges besides your managed Jupyter notebook instance.

Setup

If you want to use the Leap quantum cloud service from a Braket Jupyter notebook you will need to use an existing notebook or create a new one by following the step-by-step instructions in the developer guide here.

With the Braket notebook instance running first install or update the latest version of D-Wave’s software libraries. The D-Wave Ocean SDK is no longer included in the latest Braket notebooks. These libraries will make it easier to interact with Leap. In a notebook run a cell with the following command to install the software.

!pip install -U dwave-ocean-sdk

Now configure your environment to use the credentials you obtained from D-Wave to authenticate with their service. The service will look for the credentials in the default config directory of the current user so you can copy the details to a file and then authenticate to D-Wave Leap directly from an Amazon Braket notebook. To experiment with other available options you can open a terminal in your notebook instance and run the dwave config command but for now you only need the authentication token. To create this file in your notebook modify the following block with your token. You only need to complete these steps once.

import os os.makedirs('/home/ec2-user/.config/dwave/') with open('/home/ec2-user/.config/dwave/dwave.conf' ""w"") as f: print(""[defaults]"" ""token = ABC-123456789123456789123456789"" # <- Edit with your authentication token from D-Wave sep='

' file=f)</p>

At this point you have installed D-Wave’s software for interacting with their service and configured your environment to use the credentials. For every new project you can simply create a new notebook in this instance and continue to use the environment. Let’s start a new notebook now to show how to use the Leap offering to solve an annealing problem specified using the Amazon Braket Python SDK.

First import the Python packages you are going to use for solving your annealing problem.

import dwave.cloud from braket.annealing import Problem ProblemType from braket.tasks import AnnealingQuantumTaskResult import numpy

Next define an annealing problem formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) using the Braket SDK as shown with an example input here.

p = Problem(ProblemType('QUBO') linear={0: 1 4: 1} quadratic={(0 4): -2})

This is a simple two variable problem. This problem can be thought of as the minimization of x+y−2xy where x and y must be either 0 or 1. By inspecting the problem it is clear that the value of this function is minimized when x=y=0 or when x=y=1. In either case the cost function has value 0.

Submit your workload to the D-Wave Leap service

Next select a D-Wave annealing system to use for this example. You can constrain your choice of solvers to use devices with minimum qubit counts or with certain connectivity or to use D-Wave’s hybrid systems. The following example uses the default system. To connect to this system and prepare to submit tasks run the following in your notebook.

client = dwave.cloud.Client.from_config() solver = client.get_solver()

The D-Wave Ocean client handles QUBO problems differently from the Braket SDK so before you submit the problem you must reformulate the problem by packing all of the linear and quadratic terms into one statement. Use the following wrapper function to translate problems to a form that the Ocean client can interpret:

def sample_problem(solver: dwave.cloud.Solver p: Problem **solver_params) -> dwave.cloud.Future: if p.problem_type == 'QUBO': return solver.sample_qubo({**p.quadratic **{(u u): x for ux in p.linear.items()}} **solver_params) elif p.problem_type == 'ISING': return solver.sample_ising(p.linear p.quadratic **solver_params) else: raise ValueError(f""Unknown problem type '{p.problem_type}'"")

You are now ready to run your annealing problem on a quantum annealer. Run the following to submit the task.

computation = sample_problem(solver p)

Because the quantum devices are shared you may not obtain your results immediately. Instead D-Wave provides a Future object that describes how to fetch the results at a later time. Let’s define another function which uses this feature to obtain results for you as soon as they are ready.

def braket_result(computation: dwave.cloud.Future) -> AnnealingQuantumTaskResult: solution = computation.samples value = computation.energies solution_count = computation.num_occurrences num_solutions variable_count = solutions.shape datatypes = [ (""solution"" solutions.dtype (variable_count)) (""value"" values.dtype) (""solution_count"" solution_counts.dtype) ] record = numpy.rec.array(numpy.zeros(num_solutions dtype=datatypes)) record[""solution""] = solutions record[""value""] = values record[""solution_count""] = solution_counts return AnnealingQuantumTaskResult(record variable_count computation.problem_type None None)

Putting these together you can receive results for your annealing problem by running

result = braket_result(sample_problem(solver p))

The result object returned here is an AnnealingQuantumTaskResult from the Braket SDK so any workflow expecting these results as input will work with Leap from AWS Marketplace by making these minor modifications. To manually inspect the results obtained from running this problem print the record of measurements:

print(result.record_array)

You should see a list of measurements where for each measurement the first entry is the state of the qubits the second entry is the energy level and the last entry is the number of times that state was observed. For example for this problem you may see output like

[([0 0] 0. 488) ([1 1] 0. 512)]

This represents 488 and 512 measurements of the two qubits in the two separate ground states of the system. The exact numbers will vary due to the probabilistic nature of the computational process but as we expect the quantum annealer finds the ground state of this simple system every time with ease.

IBM updates its Turbonomic Application Resource Management and Instana Observability software to help organizations manage application performance and energy and costs to accelerate sustainability initiative progress

In a constantly evolving business environment many organizations are struggling to deliver on elevated customer expectations while navigating the challenges of skilled labor gaps digital disruption and increasingly complex IT environments.

With more people leaving the workforce companies lack the staffing required to manage these environments and scale them by traditional means. To bridge this gap organizations are turning to new digital solutions like automation technology to better leverage their existing talent.

Indeed the IBM Global AI Adoption Index 2022 which was commissioned by IBM in partnership with Morning Consult found that 30% of global IT professionals surveyed stated they have already implemented AI and automation software helping their employees save time. For example organizations including BBC Studios and ExaVault are leveraging solutions like AIOps and observability to more deeply understand the data around their IT operations.

To further help organizations proactively manage their IT resources in a cost-effective manner we are announcing important updates to two of our key offerings: IBM Turbonomic Application Resource Management and IBM Instana Observability. These software offerings are part of IBM's end-to-end portfolio of intelligent automation solutions for business and IT with many of the solutions developed by IBM Research.

IBM Turbonomic Increases Visibility into Sustainability of IT Resources

As COP27 comes to a close this week organizations are looking with renewed focus at using technology to align sustainability goals with business objectives – an area where IBM has been investing across our broader portfolio. As part of this focus IBM is announcing new capabilities to help CIOs and IT teams take a more active role in helping their organizations operationalize sustainability.

The new updates to IBM Turbonomic software provide organizations with near real-time visibility of the direct energy and emissions impact of data center resources to help them manage energy consumption. IBM Turbonomic takes a top-down approach to “stitch” together resources such as memory CPU and storage so that applications only consume the resources needed.

The newly released IBM Turbonomic sustainable IT dashboard provides organizations with visibility into both energy consumption and the estimated emissions of data center operations. It also provides actionable insights on how IT decisions could potentially impact these factors so different options can be benchmarked and prioritized through an environmental sustainability lens. With this operational-level data at their fingertips IT professionals can make meaningful contributions to the organization’s sustainability targets supporting environmentally sustainable business growth.

The new Turbonomic capabilities can further facilitate a companys sustainability initiatives by connecting and feeding data to the IBM Envizi ESG Suitegiving them insight as to how their IT decisions intersect with their sustainability goals and reporting. Envizi automates the collection and consolidation of more than 500 data types and supports major sustainability reporting frameworks. These technologies are part of IBM’s broader sustainability portfolio which is designed to help organizations take a data-driven approach to operationalize sustainability efforts across their business.

In a Forrester Total Economic Impact Study  Forrester illustrates how IBM Turbonomic can help cut cloud spend by 33% reduce data center refresh costs by 75% and provide the ability to get back 30% of engineering time with smarter resource management.*

Help Applications Run Optimally with IBM Instana Observability

Application errors can often cause more than headaches for IT; software problems can easily impact customer experience and ultimately the business. Teams need a way to find the root cause of problems and quickly resolve them. That’s where observability can help and it goes beyond just simply monitoring applications. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong while observability can tell you what’s happening why it’s happening and how to fix it.

IBM Instana is a robust observability solution that helps organizations track IT performance and resolve incidents quickly. In the Forrester Total Economic Impact Study commissioned by IBM Forrester illustrates how IBM Instana can help an organization reduce mean time to resolution by 50% and can reduce time spent debugging applications by 75%.** IBM also is adding new capabilities around OpenTelemetry a vendor-neutral standard of tools and APIs for collecting accessing and transferring telemetry data including outputs from logs metrics and traces (ie: the “three pillars of observability”) to more deeply understand how applications are performing. With OpenTelemetry DevOps professionals can make informed coding decisions and adjust as their organization continues to change and grow.

We are also extending IBM Instana’s capabilities around synthetic monitoring which is essentially the ability to measure your users’ perceived application performance. Synthetic monitoring will help in indicating when there are network problems between the end user and backend services.

Organizations can now also use IBM Instana to monitor applications on SAP Red Hat OpenShift IBM System z IBM Power IBM MQ IBM Db2 and more.

Organizations Globally Turn to IBM Software to Support Application Performance

Companies of all sizes across industries around the world are turning to IBM Instana and IBM Turbonomic to drive growth and cost savings in their digital transformations. Some prominent examples include BBC Studios Carhartt ExaVault J.B. Hunt Rabobank and Roma Capitale .

Major broadcaster BBC Studios is using IBM Turbonomic to simultaneously minimize cost and assure application performance of their on-premises environment of 1000 virtual machines (VMs). The team began by manually running Turbonomic’s resizing recommendations significantly reducing the number of end-user complaints and eliminating downtime in the process. Once they saw the results of manual resizing the team automated scheduled resizing on a select set of mission-critical applications proactively and holistically assuring application performance.

""Because we are able to rely on IBM Turbonomic’s intelligent automation to assure application performance 24x7 our team can now focus their efforts on pursuing strategic initiatives rather than fighting fires"" said Porsche Waddell Server and Storage Manager BBC Studios.

ExaVault an organization whose solutions facilitate two billion file transfers per year is using IBM Instana to monitor API performance and for error tracking debugging and alerting. The most important metric ExaVault looks at on a day-to-day basis is latency. “We need to make sure that every customer is having a good experience” said Tom Fite Senior Backend Engineer at ExaVault. “If a customer is waiting more than a couple seconds they might leave.”

Since ExaVault started using Instana the mean time to resolution (MTTR) for customer-impacting bugs has dropped by 56.6%. In addition the platform’s slowdowns and downtime have decreased substantially. It was at 99.51% uptime before and it’s now at 99.99%. “We’re accomplishing the goal that we set out to do” said Fite. “The reason we were able to do that is we had better visibility into our problems.”

At IBM we believe that organizations will increasingly turn to intelligent automation to address the industry-wide gaps in skilled labor supply chain disruptions increasing customer expectations and complex operating environments that are pressing on today’s ever-expanding IT and business landscapes.

Staff were told that the company was “temporarily closing our office buildings” and would reopen them on Monday. The latest news follows reports that hundreds of employees rejected an ultimatum from their new owner that they sign up for “long hours at high intensity” or quit.

The hashtags #RIPTwitter and #GoodbyeTwitter are currently trending on the platform with many long-term users bidding farewell to the 16-year-old social network.

Twitter is just one of several tech companies headquartered in California’s Silicon Valley that have made staff redundancies at an unprecedented rate over the last few weeks. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (formerly Facebook) has also slashed its headcount in the run-up to Christmas as the global financial outlook continues to cause alarm in the sector.

What has happened?

Around 45000 tech employees have been laid off as of October this year reported Firstpost. “While some tech giants are going all out laying off their employees many have frozen or confirmed a slowdown in hiring to cut budget spending in anticipation of a recession.”

“Meta Platforms the parent company of Facebook… announced it would eliminate 13% of its workforce amounting to more than 11000 jobs” said Rob Garver at VoA.

But despite the bad news for employees “Meta’s share price which had plunged from more than $345 last November to below $89 last week got a boost from the news.” Shares in Meta jumped back up above $100.

After cutting thousands of jobs Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company was “keeping email addresses active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell”. His gesture “did little to ease the pain” said Katie Prescott in The Times with words like “brutal” “heartbreaking” and “devastating” echoing “across the social media posts of fired staff”.

Elon Musk meanwhile cut 3750 jobs from Twitter following his takeover on 28 October. While this represents fewer redundancies it is a comparatively larger proportion of the company’s workforce at 50%.

The widespread job cuts at two of America’s largest tech companies follow a trend established earlier this year. In 2022 “other tech firms including Seagate Snap Intel Netflix Shopify Lyft and others have either cut jobs or restricted hiring” said Garver.

Why did it happen?

The pandemic is largely to blame for the sudden jobs cuts across the technology sector said Prescott. “As they overhired during the boom time of the pandemic when the industry expanded rapidly now they are overcompensating the other way.”

During the two-year period that saw lockdowns across the world the tech sector grew and companies hired more staff to accommodate that growth. Meta for example hired 27000 people during the first two years of the pandemic and a further 15000 this year.

According to Prescott “technology businesses have… experienced a sharp reversal in fortunes from being pandemic winners to facing the reality of a gloomy economic outlook soaring inflation rapidly falling consumer confidence and rising interest rates”.

What happens next?

The dramatic change in the employment landscape of Silicon Valley led to technology reporter Kari Paul asking in The Observer: “Is Silicon Valley’s golden era coming to an end?”

“Nervousness is palpable among the bright young things in the technology industry” said Prescott “as the rising number of job cuts shatters any lingering perception that the sector was bulletproof.”

Those “seeking other employment in the tech sector will enter a challenging environment” as a result of the “sudden layoffs of thousands of their fellow workers across the sector” said Garver. There is no guarantee these former employees will easily find work elsewhere.

Meanwhile job cuts are expected to continue across the sector. Mark Sweney reported in The Guardian that the billionaire hedge-fund manager Christopher Hohn had called for Alphabet the company which owns Google and YouTube to cut costs. Hohn is a major investor in Alphabet and the billionaire believes the company’s employees are “paid too much and its workforce should be drastically cut back”."

But have you ever wondered about the heaviest hitters in America’s Finest City?

Consider this San Diego Business 101 — your guide to our region’s 7 key industries and 10 major employers.

Note: When we say San Diego metro area that refers to all areas in the county’s five districts.

🔑 The key industries

There are seven key industries — all with 100000+ employees — that represent ~67.5% of the San Diego metro area’s economy based on data from the US Census Bureau . We’ve listed them in order of employment numbers.

Health care + social assistance | 13.6% or 208979 employees

As a county with millions of people locals look to our healthcare system for support. Many services are provided outside clinical settings to improve community wellbeing and help residents lead healthy lives.

Professional scientific + technical services | 12% or 183757 employees

This sector encompasses many of the jobs that help San Diego get recognized for advancing our body of knowledge and improving productivity. Many companies fall into this category — from the engineers at Sempra Energy to the developers at Qualcomm .

Retail trade | 10.3% or 158582 employees

Ka-ching — every time you make a purchase you’re helping the local retail industry. Any position required to put products on shelves falls into this category from the person bagging groceries to the individual monitoring inventory across a chain of stores.

Manufacturing | 9.7% or 149802 employees

We already talked about buying items but what about making them? The people responsible for assembling goods fall into this category like the people who make glucose monitors at DexCom Inc. or the employees making electronics at Sony .

Education | 8.6% or 131690 employees

San Diego County has 42 school districts — that’s a lot of teachers + staff. Beyond that we have many universities with UC San Diego and San Diego State University being the largest.

Construction | 6.8% or 105112 employees

San Diego wasn’t built in a day. In fact there’s always construction and companies in this industry work to improve our buildings and keep this city America’s Finest.

Accommodation + food services | 6.5% or 100374 employees

Tourism and hospitality play important roles in our economy and help many locals earn a living. Some of our most luxurious — and delicious — attractions fall into this category including visits to the Hotel del Coronado and our craft beer scene .

Note: The US Census Bureau collects data for civilian employees. There are approximately 110000 active-duty service members in San Diego County and over 35000 civilian jobs in defense-related fields.

💼 The major players

Now that we’ve established the major industries we bet you’re curious for specific names. Whether you’re job hunting (or just “casually prospecting”) here are 10 major employers — all that employ more than 8.40% of workers.

Common ones in the case of Bayer AG a multinational life sciences company based in Leverkusen Germany include vetting partners for conflicts of interest data privacy services fair market value approvals required for interactions with healthcare professionals gift approvals and charitable donations.

Bayer took on that task using the low-code ServiceNow App Engine as its governance automation platform. We discussed this ongoing project that started in 2019 -- and continues as Bayer discovers more processes to automate -- with Thomas Pfennig Bayer global head of compliance and data privacy. He oversees LPC Express what Bayer calls its program to digitize its manual law patents and compliance workflows.

Describe the biggest compliance use cases you're solving with this project.

Pfennig: Overall we currently have 24 use cases on the platform which we call 'standardizeable transactional recurring services.'

For example in pharma if you engage with healthcare professionals such as key opinion leaders you are subject to certain laws that dictate you pay a certain amount of money for the services that you receive -- but within clearly defined parameters. In the past this was a manual activity at Bayer. People looked at lists people defined categories people assessed what actual services were rendered and then applied a number. Now we have fair market value assessments on the platform and it's 86% automated. So essentially there are not many human interactions in this space anymore.

We also have automated conflict-of-interest checks. If we engage with external partners are they passing muster in accordance with our compliance criteria?

There's a lot of stuff that we did in the past with dedicated personnel and oftentimes highly qualified lawyers who felt that the activities didn't always match their qualifications. So we have been moving these transactional activities onto the platform en masse.

So these are all internal processes.

Pfennig: Exactly. This is all built into the approval workflows on the platform. People type in their respective scenario fill in their expected answers to our questions and receive an answer. It has helped us gain speed predictability data and make sure that we apply qualifications of our people according to the needs and demands that the services require.

How complicated is it to navigate the variance of law between 80-plus countries?

Pfennig: Compliance -- let's just take that as an example -- can sometimes be a bit exception-driven. It's not always black and white. I did the fair market value approvals when I was in the United States for half a year and it drove me nuts. These repetitive activities did not add to my job satisfaction.

You have some flexibilities here and there when you digitize. Our use cases [so far] it's zero or one go or no go. So you're really helping your clients to have a much more predictable outcome. You have a much more consistent service rendering because you're essentially getting rid of these exceptions and you're gaining speed.

Where are you in the rollout of the App Engine?

We started in 2019. Some people may severely underestimate the challenges and complexity of shifting a traditional function like compliance into a digital environment like our LPC Express. We are still in the final stages. It is a project where we are continuously learning.

We also achieved a different mindset in terms of user satisfaction. You run user acceptance tests before you release a new use case on your portal. The minimum viable app process requires us to do it and this is an iterative process. It also is a continuous improvement mindset. We measured the service satisfaction levels of our clients we measure the speed how quickly we are offering services and we know how many manual activities are still in the processes. So it gives us a whole range of new data but also a mindset that is novel to our function -- and it was novel to me I have to confess -- but it's fun because you're really not operating in the dark. You're shedding a lot of light onto your activities.

When you talk about streamlining and harmonizing processes it requires a lot of effort. Thomas PfennigGlobal head of compliance and data privacy Bayer

Compliance officers are understandably wary of technology to automate compliance because it introduces potential for errors. How did you get them on board?

Pfennig: I talk to a lot of [industry peers] and I think generally the sentiment is 'Let's try it maybe not at the scope of [Bayer] but there is potential.' When you talk about streamlining and harmonizing processes it requires a lot of effort.

For example we collect the thresholds for gift-giving. We have to blend all the different codes into fair market value approval. So you have country deviations built into the system where the algorithm sees there's a request coming from a place and it applies the respective standard.

There is a lot of collaboration with our local country's colleagues to feed the system with the data to build your use case and your approval processes around it. But once you're done you're done. And of course when the code changes you adjust accordingly. But the upfront investment while certainly quite significant is a one-time effort.

How much training do frontline workers need to use this?

Pfennig: The aspiration is for end users to log in to this Boolean search environment and hammer in a question. The algorithm finds out what category you are inquiring about. Maybe you're lucky and your question has already been answered.

This is the beauty of having released the system. Your keywords will be matched with what's already on the platform and you will be offered answers that were given in similar circumstances which may be sufficient.

If there is more complexity you have access to an agent a trained data privacy expert for example where you can communicate and be a bit more refined in your respective question. It's quick it's fast. We do not need to offer training to use the platform.

Thomas Pfennig shown here with an augmented reality headset has led Bayer's compliance automation efforts.

How do you maintain data access controls and privacy as employees dive into the data lake and all this content?

Pfennig: This platform is embedded into the Bayer enterprise IT infrastructure so it is governed by those systems. We have single sign-on user technology so we see who is on the platform. We see what requests are placed how often how repetitive how detailed et cetera they may be. We also maintain our compliance investigation data on the platform which is obviously proprietary sensitive data. We have guardrails around the security of the data on the platform as well so it stays within the company's control.

You looked at two other cloud vendors for this project. Talk about that buying decision process.

Pfennig: I can't reveal those names; we have NDAs. But I would say one is a well-known company. The other was more in its infancy -- very enthusiastic and passionate but too immature at that point. So we wanted to have somebody with a proven track record when it comes to ticketing systems and [we liked ServiceNow's] editability configuration options and also the collaboration options. We have a fantastic opportunity in the back office; most agents who are running the system can learn from each other to work together not repeat the same thing over and over and to morph and mature jointly.

What advice would you have for your peers now who are also evaluating large compliance automation projects?

Pfennig: The first question you ask yourself is 'Is it worth it?'

Then 'Do I have the critical mass [to complete the project]?' because I want to be fair.

We have a well-structured cross-functional project team. We have a dedicated budget. We have an infrastructure with 35 regions and hundreds of legal and compliance professionals rendering thousands of services every day where automation really makes sense. Since the inception of the LPC Express platform we are approaching about 100000 requests solved on the platform. These would be 100000 person-to-person interactions in the past. So you have to have this critical mass you have to have a budget.

You have to have an organization -- and this is a big hurdle -- where this type of entrepreneurship and change is actually supported. I would most likely run against a wall digitalizing compliance data privacy in a more traditional environment because it is a huge change. You're not having this 'white glove kind of travel agency' type of service. You're dealing with machine logic you're dealing with technology to a large degree. You cannot exercise the 25-year personal relationship with your compliance colleague to get the expected outcome. It is most likely on the surface uncomfortable.

If you overcome these hurdles and say 'I still want to make my system more efficient more effective and save money' I recommend you start small. I might take fair market value I might pick one data privacy use case I might take one gift approval or donation use case ... and then go slowly to the next one and see how the organization is adapting and adjusting to this.

We have gone at a high speed and a large scope. That is something that worked at Bayer but it was an enterprise-wide structural change where everybody kind of contributed to this new chapter -- I didn't have to convince people. This is most likely a big uphill battle at other companies that are not as aspirational and dedicated as we were.

That was the revelation that really grabbed my attention from among the slew of announcements at SAP TechEd this week in Las Vegas as SAP CTO Juergen Mueller said that Apple is now able to deliver new apps to its employees in less than six weeks.

And Mueller wasn’t talking about internally focused apps for scheduling conference rooms or checking out the lunch specials in the cafeteria — rather these new rapid-release apps are designed to optimize essential processes for Apple’s retail teams such as inventory management and store pickup and delivery.

Making these initiatives with Apple the cornerstone of his TechEd keynote Mueller described how the strategic relationship between the two companies has evolved from one wherein each purchases and uses the other’s products to a deep and intricate co-creation engagement.

For SAP the core piece in that co-creation engagement is its Business Technology Platform whose development and commercial success serve as the centerpiece of Mueller’s four-year tenure as the company’s CTO. (Before becoming CTO he was SAP’s chief innovation officer for two-and-a-half years.)

BTP is the missing link that’s allowed SAP to race aggressively and successfully into the cloud over the past three years (for more detail on that please see The New SAP: Helping Business Users Become Low-Code Builders).

And in his TechEd keynote Mueller laid out how SAP’s platform has enabled it to build a broader and deeper business relationship with Apple that simply wasn’t possible before BTP was completed.

“BTP includes best-in-class iOS toolsets to take advantage of Apple’s hardware and software innovations to build powerful and compelling business apps that users love” Mueller said during the portion of his keynote posted to his LinkedIn page.

“Our long-standing relationship with Apple goes well beyond the apps we build together and the devices we use at SAP and how we enable our joint customers to delight their users.

“I’m proud about what the teams have done with apps for our own employees for years and with apps we build for customers. And today we are excited to hear how Apple is using BTP to power iOS apps across their business.

“It’s remarkable to hear about the incredible apps Apple is building for their employees using BTP and iOS at such incredible scale and speed. And we are learning every day from Apple: They are not only using BTP but also working closely with my team in shaping how we move BTP forward” Mueller said.

That to me was the money shot: “working closely with my team in shaping how we move BTP forward.” Because that isn’t just some arcane concept limited to a tiny number of giant tech companies — no quite the opposite.

As more businesses enhance their digital capabilities that co-creation imperative will become essential for every company that wants to build truly strategic relationships with its best customers. And that will be the case regardless of what industry’s involved: From healthcare to insurance to construction to logistics to retail and everywhere in between deep and high-impact co-creation build around digital capabilities is the future of business.

For SAP this new level of engagement with Apple represents another piece of evidence to my recent contention that while SAP might be 50 years old it has never been more innovative more fast-paced and more opportunistic than it is right now as it enters its second half-century.

From there Zoom will soon launch its CCaaS solution in many other countries across Europe the Middle East and Africa.

The expansion follows the Zoom Contact Center’s success in North America where it has achieved sales results Zoom’s executives had not expected “for another 18 to 24 months.”

Noting this Ben Neo Head of Enterprise Sales EMEA at Zoom Phone told CX Today:

It has been a huge success over in America and we (Zoom’s EMEA team) have been chomping at the bit to be part of that.

Neo delved deeper into the news in a video interview with CX Today ahead of the announcement. Check out what he had to say below.

EMEA Users Will Access All Zoom’s Latest CCaaS Features

EMEA users of the Zoom Contact Center will gain access to all its newly announced features in 2023 including those showcased at the recent Zoomtopia event.

Perhaps most notable is its new no-code virtual agent solution which aims to make conversational AI much more accessible to mid-market businesses.

Unfortunately deployment complexity and a disjointed vendor landscape have deterred the application of bots. Yet Zoom hopes to increase the technology’s accessibility making it a core part of its CCaaS platform.

As Neo stated in the above interview:

The virtual agent solution is no-code easy to deploy with super rich analytics (wrapped) around it.

Many of the other exciting announcements stemmed from Zoom’s partnership with ServiceNow.

Consider the new Ticket Collaboration with Zoom Team Chat solution which ties its CCaaS and UCaaS solutions closer together. Through Zoom Team Chat it allows agents to collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs) across the enterprise to solve problems.

In doing so the solution captures details of the customer’s query in a ServiceNow ticket which the agent can share with the SME.

Another exciting feature is the ServiceNow Employee Center for Zoom which pulls ServiceNow’s agent engagement solution into Zoom’s desktop client.

Elsewhere the new Zoom Kiosk will also connect to the CCaaS platform.

However alongside these additions many will consider the Zoom Contact Center as it enables businesses to converge their UCaaS and CCaaS solutions and simplify the technology stack.

Moreover those looking to leverage video to further the human element in CX may consider the CCaaS platform as that is Zoom’s bread and butter.

Yet the platform will most likely attract existing Zoom enterprise users across EMEA with Zoom fast establishing high brand loyalty in the hybrid working world.

The Roadmap for Zoom in CCaaS

Further global expansion with support for more languages is top of mind for the Zoom Contact Center team.

Yet it also teased investments in additional channels supplementary CRM and WFM integrations alongside new agent-assist features.

By adding agent-assist capabilities and further AI innovation Zoom can – over time – grow its average seat price and raise revenues in a way that UC does not allow.

Indeed AI is front of mind for Zoom as it is for many other CCaaS vendors.

Now the vendor is further strengthening its natural language processing and machine learning capabilities which will allow it to attack the broader contact center stack.

In addition these AI enhancements will enable Zoom to enhance its current offerings including its virtual agent.

Yet Neo highlights that much of its future innovation will stem from customer input. He stated:

We will ask customers: what do you want? We are keen to be driven and guided in that way because this is an industry led by customer experience. That is what Zoom is really good at.

Such internal R&D will likely fuel the development of its core capabilities as Zoom strives to close the gap with stalwart CCaaS players.

Yet customers can perhaps expect Zoom to make acquisitions and add to its differentiated CCaaS features – as it did by acquiring Solvvy in May 2022.

Such an approach seems to be paying off with the CCaaS solution playing a part in the 27 percent growth (YoY) of Zoom’s enterprise business as noted in its latest earnings call.

Now as the Zoom Contact Center becomes available in EMEA Zoom will hope to push this percentage even higher in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yODEyMzkwL3Z1bG5lcmFiaWxpdHktbWFuYWdlbWVudC1hcy1hLXNlcnZpY2UtbWFya2V0LXNpemUtc2hhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vulnerability Management as a Service Market Size Share Growth Report 2022-2028| ServiceNow Ivanti VMaaS ...,"Vulnerability Management as a Service Market Size Share Growth Report 2022-2028| ServiceNow Ivanti VMaaS Asimily Insight

Big plans in the works,"ROCKFORD MI — If you’re looking for a bite to eat or some shopping just off US-131 near Rockford you’ll soon have new options.

A multi-tenant retail construction project in Algoma Township just north of 10 Mile Road near the Rockford Meijer has begun soon to host at least one restaurant.

The construction site at 2887 10 Mile Road is 1.7 acres and will have 69 parking spaces. All three spaces will be housed in the same retail building split among the three tenants.

In total the building will be just under 9000 square feet with the smallest of the restaurants at 2673 square feet and the largest at 3602 square feet.

The new building is tucked in between a Sherwin Williams paint store and a Taco Bell at the intersection of 10 Mile Road and Meadow Creek Drive.

According to Mike Schuchman a partner at developer Alrig USA Commercial Real Estate the building isn’t set to be finished until some time in 2023.

Faith Fruciano a sales associate at Mid-America Real Estate said the largest of the three spaces has a tenant in the works.

“Overall we’re very excited for the project” Fruciano said. “At this time we can’t disclose who that lease is for but we should be able to in the next 30 or 60 days.”

Fruciano said there is a proposed restaurant in one of the three retail spaces but the lease for that largest space is not food related.

Planning documents show none of the three spaces will have a drive-thru.

Located just outside of the city of Rockford the Algoma Township planning commission approved the site plans for the project earlier this year in May. The plan includes landscaping along 10 Mile Road and lighting in the parking lot.

Prior to the retail project the lot was vacant.

In Renovator’s Notebook homeowners open up about the nitty-gritty of their remodels: How long it really took; how much it actually cost; what went horribly wrong; and what went wonderfully serendipitously it’s-all-worth-it-in-the-end right. For more tips to nail your next project follow @reno_notebook.

Square footage: 156

Year built: 1880

Budget: $8250

Top priority: Bringing some warmth to a well-loved kitchen without completely starting from scratch.

Jen Levy’s paint-buying experience was your typical tumultuous tale. After weighing six different whites she bought five gallons of Decorator’s White began covering the walls in her Baltimore kitchen and abruptly stopped. “It was looking too gray” she recalls. That’s when the interior and retail designer asked her good interior designer friend Joy Strom to come over and assess the color conundrum.

The kitchen before.

In an hour Strom had helped Levy pick out a fresh crisp option for the walls (Chantilly Lace by Benjamin Moore) and a beigey off-white for the cabinets (Divine White by Sherwin-Williams). “To just have a conversation with another design-oriented person who has done this before really catapulted a lot of smart ideas” shares Levy.

Fortunately for Levy the kitchen wasn’t in need of a gut renovation. “The previous owners had great taste but I was eager to make it my own” she says. Knowing her friend didn’t want to spend a small fortune on the reno Strom talked Levy into sticking with the room’s existing 156-square-foot layout and focusing on cosmetic updates. Levy learned to love her quirky cupboard doors that yes sometimes don’t close all the way and on occasion require tightening with a screwdriver. “I leaned into those imperfections. If I wanted a new house I would have bought a new house” says Levy. Ahead in her own words the first-time homeowner takes us behind the scenes of her roughly $8000 transformation.

The Cohesive Quartz

I was desperate to swap out the dark green granite counters in the kitchen and Joy suggested white quartz to match the existing peninsula in the space. I was surprised at how affordable it was: By sourcing directly through the manufacturer I was able to get 24 square feet of quartz for $1800. That swap also led to me to purchase a new sink and faucet (the old one was the size of a bar sink) which rang in at $350.

The Statement Accessory

Not only was the ceiling fan a bit dated and prone to grease I felt like the black blades made the ceiling appear lower than it really was which isn’t what you want in a small space. I removed it and covered it with a simple plate from Home Depot then replaced the distracting can lights with seamless LED ones ($22 per piece). On a trip to Brooklyn I bought two vintage pendant lamps from Holler & Squall that act almost like jewelry for the room like when you’re getting ready to go out and you complete a simple outfit with strong earrings.

The Monochromatic Knobs

As I was browsing brass hardware for the cabinets thinking that would make the space feel a little more upscale I realized it would add up to around $1000. Joy chimed in again: “Why don’t you just get wood handles and knobs and paint them?” she told me. It would have never crossed my mind. It was a simple and affordable idea at about $3 apiece and it looks so appealing.

The Appliances With a Payment Plan

The painting and countertops were costs I had to pay up front so when I eventually moved onto appliances I wanted to pay them off over time. After spending months doing online research and getting nowhere I went in person to a Best Buy and within an hour I selected the refrigerator range and dishwasher. The total ended up being $4800 (including delivery haul-away and installation) but with a store credit card I was able to spread out the payments over 12 months with no interest. That was the key to making this whole renovation affordable.

While my main priority with a fridge was that it kept my food cold I was pickier with the dishwasher. I wanted a panel-ready option so that it would blend in with the cabinets. After sourcing a matching front from the Cabinet Door Store for $100 I had a friend make a custom handle for it.

The Bespoke Island With a Nostalgic Twist

The new butcher block island was a $250 Craigslist score. The seller told me it’s from the 1970s but who really knows. I loved the modern lines of it just not the big wheels it came on. For the sake of sturdiness I took them off and replaced them with 3-by-3-inch wood blocks I found on Amazon. Because the tones were different I decided to paint the cubes in a black-and-white checkered pattern. It’s a scheme that runs throughout the rest of the house and it also reminded me of the MacKenzie-Childs pieces in my mom’s kitchen growing up. I always come back to what’s easy what’s affordable and what I can do by myself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5uYncuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9ub3YvMTgvcGVvcGxlLWFsZXgtaGlsZ2VuYmVyZy1qb2lucy1jdXNobWFuLXdha2VmaWVsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,People: Alex Hilgenberg joins Cushman & Wakefield | Serving Northern Nevada,"

The second day of the gathering Nov. 16 featured messages from Maaco’s senior leadership team a message from keynote speaker Mike Anderson of Collision Advice and several breakout sessions for attendees. The recipient of the Tony Martino Hall of Fame and Vendor Partner of the Year awards were also announced.

The convention ran through the evening of Nov. 18 featuring a charity golf tournament vendor trade show fall festival and a gala.

“Let me be clear---we are proud to be celebrating the achievements of the past but it is equally important to stay hungry ensuring many more achievements for the future” said Chris Dawson president of paint and collision for Driven Brands.

Tony Martino Hall of Fame Award

The award was presented by Maaco founder Tony Martino’s son Mark Martino who shared memories of how his dad got the franchise started opening the pilot location in Wilmington DE in 1972.

“I remember saying to Dad ‘Are you sure anyone would want to do this for a living?’” Martino said. “He hesitated for a minute and then said emphatically ‘Yes I’m sure someday we are going to have hundreds of these Maaco centers all over the country.’

“His prophecy proved true and here we sit 50 years later celebrating his foresight and dedication” Martino said.

Martino said his dad loved franchising because he loved being a part of helping small business owners become successful knowing what it was like to start with little or no capital or experience. He loved seeing franchisees become successful able to take care of their families.

The Hall of Fame award named for Tony Martino is given to an owner who personifies Maaco’s founding values of providing quality service at a fair price.

This year it was presented to Jay Patel who owns 11 Maaco stores in four states and over his 30+ years with the franchise has gotten much of his extended family involved in the business.

“I am so grateful for this honor and I give all the credit to Tony Martino” said Patel. “He taught me so much that I have applied to my business to be successful. The most important thing was taking care of the customer. His saying was ‘paint a car make a friend’ and my goal and my team’s philosophy is to treat them like family and the goal is always to make a customer for life whatever it takes.

“I believe in the Maaco system” added Patel. “Maaco has the successful formula and all I have done is applied it. I don’t try to reinvent the wheel---they already invented it and it works.”

Keynote Message

Anderson spoke about how franchisees should grow their teams to grow their business.

“Everybody on the collision side in the U.S. has a five- to eight-week backlog of work” Anderson said. “What everyone does not have is people.”

Mike Anderson of Collision Advice delivered the keynote message.

To grow a team owners have to either help existing staff get better at what they do or bring on new hires. And to do that owners must create an environment where people don’t love their jobs---they love the organization.

“You want them to love working for YOU” he said. “Culture is your commodity the goose that lays the golden egg every single day.”

Anderson said the industry has a whole does not have a staffing shortage---it has a “we don’t pay enough” problem.

“We have got to offer better compensation” he said.

Another key is to lay out a career path for employees so they see how they can advance.

The lines between collision work and what Maaco does are becoming more blurred Anderson said thanks to increased ADAS features on cars that make recalibration necessary to complete what was once a simple paint job on a front bumper. Improper recalibrations can cause accidents leading to liability issues.

“This is not a message of doom and gloom; it’s an area of opportunity” Anderson said noting Maaco owners might be able to expand their services to include ADAS calibrations for other area shops.

Anderson said Maaco owners also need to make sure their customer service is modern not antiquated offering conveniences like concierge service email receipts and a 24/7 digital presence so customers feel like they can start the repair process even outside of normal business hours.

Maaco’s Online Estimating Tool launched pre-pandemic in 2019 and now on its fourth version is a great way to do that Anderson said.

“It’s difficult if not impossible to write an estimate based on a photo but look at it as a marketing strategy to capture a hot lead outside of business hours” when most crashes occur he said.

Shops like Maaco also have to dominate online reviews as voice-activated searches for things like “best auto paint repair shop near me” only return the top result.

To do that shops need “social proof” like online reviews to vouch for their ability to fix a car.

Shops like Maaco also need to regularly communicate with vehicle owners during the repair process even if it’s a “no update” update.

“Keeping them informed drives the customer experience” he said. “Let them know you’re still working on it you haven’t forgotten them.”

Vendor Partner of the Year

Sherwin-Williams was a co-winner of the Vendor of the Year Award.

Senior Vice President of Strategy and Franchise Administration Chris Porcelli presented the Vendor Partner of the Year award to co-winners Sherwin-Williams and 3M who have both partners for more than a decade.

Media Roundtable

Executives including Dawson Maaco COO Daryl Hurst Porcelli and Driven Brands Senior Vice President of Marketing Hannah Whitesides participated in a media roundtable.

Dawson opened the roundtable by saying 2021 was a stellar year as Maaco assembled an incredible leadership team listened to franchisees and leveraged data for the first time to look at what was happening and what needed attention within the franchise.

“Most importantly we listened to consumers started using research to find out what they were asking from us and putting together a plan and the results are beginning to show” Dawson said.

Porcelli said Maaco as part of Driven Brands is using scale to support its partners.

Whitesides talked about some of the ways Maaco has acknowledged its 50th year including celebrating a shop-level employee every week and partnerships with other companies like one with Ray Ban to give away 50 pairs of golden sunglasses.

3M was a co-winner of the Vendor of the Year Award.

Going forward Hurst said Maaco will “stay true to our core look at the evolution of vehicles and what the consumers need and leverage data to help franchisees to do business in the future.”

In 2023 Porcelli said Maaco will be focused on growth specifically strengthening fleet partnerships.

“We just went through one of the most trying times as a nation” Dawson said. “We didn’t just thrive but Maaco was there for franchisees every step of the way. We came out in a better place. Existing franchisees want to open more stores and we couldn’t be more excited for that growth.”

Later Whitesides expounded Maaco’s marketing strategy going forward: a mix of “retro” branding and embracing new technology to reach bigger audiences.

The resurrection of the “Uh Oh Better Get Maaco” slogan for the brand’s 50th anniversary---first launched in 1981---was a “fortunate coincidence of timing” Whitesides said as other brands brought back past slogans and logos too.

But Maaco’s Online Estimating Tool is a big part of marketing the brand as a repair shop that can always be reached something younger customers expect.

“In the early days of the pandemic it was tremendous to have a way for customers to be able to contact us” Whitesides said.

She said in 2022 the tool has generated $20 million in sales for Maaco stores nationwide.

Maaco is investing in new technology to make franchisees’ jobs easier including tools to organize leads and using data to find out at the individual shop level where customers are coming from to tailor marketing.

“We are balancing traditional media and also biting off bigger pieces of the digital pie to reach bigger and more diverse audiences” Whitesides said.

Whitesides also touched on some of Maaco’s and her personal philanthropic efforts.

Whitesides is a board member for the Women’s Industry Network (WIN) using that platform to not only learn more about the industry but also to help encourage more women to look at careers within it.

Driven Brands also works with the Collision Repair Education Foundation (CREF) sponsoring Benchmark Grants to fund collision repair education programs across the country.

“That’s interwoven with helping franchisees with recruitment” Whitesides said.

The Maaco Heart Fund raises money to help shop employees who goes through hardship Whitesides said. Recently two employees in a Fort Myers FL shop lost everything when Hurricane Ian hit the area and the fund was able to support them.

Driven Brands’ collision and paint group supports the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for cystic fibrosis research and awareness especially in Driven Brands’ hometown of Charlotte NC."
SPG,Simon Property Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzExLzE3L3doeS1zaW1vbi1wcm9wZXJ0eS1ncm91cC1rZWVwLXJhaXNpbmctZGl2aWRlbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Simon Property Group Can Keep Raising Its Dividend,"Simon's mall business is still in recovery mode which management expects to be the case through at least 2023.

The word ""brutal"" probably best describes how 2020 was for mall real estate investment trust (REIT) Simon Property Group (SPG 0.84%). Although it survived the downturn better than most of its peers (some of which ended up in bankruptcy court) the company still ended up cutting its dividend by a painful 40%. Things are looking much brighter for the REIT these days and the recovery looks like it has at least another year to run.

Culling out the weakest players

Leading up to the pandemic mall REITs like Simon were contending with the so-called ""retail apocalypse."" In a broad sense consumers were increasingly buying from online stores. But the problem was deeper than that because the retailers getting hit the hardest were those that didn't or couldn't adjust to changing consumer habits. Often that was because of heavy debt loads and bloated store counts.

Throughout the industry weaker companies were shutting down stores or simply going out of business. Compounding that issue were the stronger stores which were also closing their weaker locations in an effort to focus on the stores with the best prospects. Malls in regions with lower population density and smaller average household incomes were struggling and in some cases being closed down. But this was all a slow-moving train wreck.

The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 sped up the process dramatically. Without the ability to sell in physical locations for nameplates that were deemed nonessential and thus shut down businesses with too much leverage and a weak online presence went bankrupt. And the retailers that remained moved more quickly to shutter weak locations. Malls got hammered noting that Simon which has one of the best-located mall portfolios in the industry had to cut its dividend.

But the swiftness of the hit proved to be good for the mall industry since it weeded out the weakest retailers and malls. That in turn has set up a strong upturn for Simon's well-positioned malls as strong retailers including previously online-only names look to expand.

The good news keeps going

For a REIT one of the best measurements of the business's success is the dividend. A growing dividend is only possible if the company is doing well. Simon has increased its dividend six times since the cut in 2020 raising the payout by nearly 40%. While it is still below where it was prior to the cut the swift dividend turnaround is a clear indication that things are looking up.

That has shown up in the business in a number of ways including rising occupancy rates increasing sales per square foot and strong leasing trends. The last one is perhaps the most important as investors look to the future.

During Simon's third-quarter 2022 conference call management noted that the REIT signed over 3100 leases during the first nine months of the year. Currently the company has about 2 percentage points' worth of signed-not-opened (SNO) leases which basically means the company has a tenant but it has to get the space ready before it can be occupied. It simply takes time to redevelop a retail space for a new customer so there's no quick way to get all of those tenants into their spaces.

That's bad in one way but good in another if you are a dividend investor. Simon believes it will take all of 2023 and perhaps into 2024 before it gets its SNO leases down to more historical levels. As those spaces get filled up they will start to generate cash flow for Simon over the next year or two. Increasing cash flow means the ability to pay more in dividends. So payout increases are highly likely to keep going unless there's another massive dislocation like the one seen in 2020.

History doesn't repeat but it often rhymes

Not long after the 2007-09 Great Recession Simon Property Group cut its dividend and then very quickly started to increase it again. In short order the dividend was far above its pre-cut level.

While it is too soon to suggest an exact repeat of that pattern what is clear is that the REIT is looking to grow the dividend today after a big dividend cut just like it did the last time. And the fundamentals of the business suggest that's a sustainable trend. With a generous 6% or so dividend yield income-focused investors should find Simon's story very attractive today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2Jlc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvc2ltb24tcHJvcGVydHktZ3JvdXAtbGVhcC1wYXJ0bmVyLXRvLWJyaW5nLWRpZ2l0YWwtYnJhbmRzLXRvLW1hbGxzL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2Jlc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvc2ltb24tcHJvcGVydHktZ3JvdXAtbGVhcC1wYXJ0bmVyLXRvLWJyaW5nLWRpZ2l0YWwtYnJhbmRzLXRvLW1hbGxzLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simon Property Group Leap Partner to Bring Digital Brands to Malls,"Guide

Scroll down to use Glossy+ Comments giving the Glossy+ community the opportunity to join discussions around industry topics.

On Wednesday Kim Kardashian’s buzzy minimalist SKKN By Kim beauty brand entered physical retail for the first time. At a mall.

Set in Westfield Century City in Los Angeles the pop-up is meant to “show people a glimpse” of what the 5-month-old brand’s permanent stores will eventually look like. Opening multiple SKKN By Kim stores is a future step Kardashian told Glossy.

Westfield Century City’s 8600-square-foot Atrium space houses the store. Designed to host interactive brand activations and product launches as well as awards shows concerts and fashion shows it’s just one of five spaces the center offers companies looking to make a short-term splash. For malls’ part such retail “drops” offer excitement and foot traffic not to mention a revenue stream beyond long-term leases.

With the retail landscape recently reiterating that it’s less than stable plus relevance-chasing malls remaining in a state of flux such pop-ups are catching on as shopping centers’ secret weapon. Of course they also work to the advantage of brands that are sold on the value of physical retail yet gun-shy about making business commitments. “Nimble” and 10-year contracts don’t exactly mix well.

WS Development was early to the concept opening the retail incubator The Current in Boston Seaport in 2018. The same year retail landlord Macerich introduced its take dubbed BrandBox at Tysons Corner Center in Washington D.C. In step Columbus-based Easton Town Center launched Shop/LAB.

More recently mall developers have been transparent about leveraging pop-ups to fill vacancies. When New Jersey-based mega-mall American Dream finally opened in 2019 its chief creative officer at the time Ken Downing said that 20 of the mall’s 100 first stores in operation would be “Dream Drops” the company’s term for pop-up shops with leases starting at one month. In November 2021 the company opened the first Dream Drop in its luxury wing The Avenue. Still open the store features a selection of fashion and home decor curated by style icon Iris Apfel.

But according to mall owners amid the return to physical retail such Band-Aids are needed less often; retail space of any kind is getting harder to come by.

On its November 1 third-quarter earnings call Simon Property Group head of investor relations Tom Ward noted the company’s “leasing momentum” stating that it had signed more than 3100 leases since the start of Q1 with average lease rates increasing 10% year-over-year. CEO David Simon said the average term across the company’s leases is now seven years. On November 10 while reporting third-quarter earnings Brookfield Asset Management Inc. CEO Bruce Flatt pointed to a stat that retail sales are up 30% in shopping centers compared to pre-Covid levels. Considering their “high-quality” positioning Brookfield’s centers are poised to see an even greater boost he said.

Still developers seeing the value of pop-ups are keeping the concept in swing despite the heavier lift of managing consecutive short-term leases.

To date WS Development’s pop-ups have largely been driven by the need to activate vacant space said Carina Donoso the company’s head of retail experience and incubation. Pop-up-focused The Current has been the exception though it’s about to become a bigger portion of the company’s pop-up play: WS Development now has fewer vacancies that need filling particularly in its outdoor malls plus it’s working to expand The Current concept to more properties within its portfolio. A second location will soon open in Palm Beach’s Royal Poinciana Plaza.

Melissa Gonzalez principal at MG2 and founder of The Lionesque Group which specializes in designing pop-ups called pop-ups within malls a win-win: As with any pop-up they allow brands to test a market or concept with lower risk compared to opening a permanent store. Meanwhile for leasing teams along with biding time between leases the activations provide an opportunity to “date” potential long-term tenants she said.

“Particularly when it comes to digitally native brands entering physical retail for the first time there are minimal metrics [up front] to determine whether the store’s going to be successful” she said.

At the same time shopping centers nationwide are attempting to pinpoint “the next experiential something” that will serve as the anchor driving people to their property she said. Pop-ups provide valuable insight.

According to Gonzales leasing teams and developers that have set up “turnkey pop-up infrastructures” featuring multiple brands like WS Development with The Current are doing brands a service. The space becomes a brand and a draw in itself eliminating some of the risk around pop-ups and incongruent store adjacencies.

Described by Donoso as an “outside village” the original Current is home to nine pop-up spaces of 180 or 300 square feet each. With tenants leasing the pop-up “houses” for 3-6 months at a time the complex averages 27 tenants per year. It attracts national and local brands including many digital native companies looking to learn more about their businesses and customers. Donoso said she stresses to such brands the importance of offering a disruptive in-store experience to mimic their “enhanced” digital presence.

The Current’s tenants that have done this well include Brave Daughters which provided in-store welding services for its “permanent” jewelry. Another standout was hat company Project Paulie which donates a portion of its proceeds to charities. Taking cues from an Italian bodega its store featured Italian music candles in the shape of baguettes and “pizza boxes” as hat boxes.

For brands The Current’s take on “turnkey” retail includes hiring and training store associates leveraging its experienced team of visual merchandisers for the store buildout and providing a robust marketing plan. In total onboarding brands is an eight-week process. Executives from just 5% of the 100 brands that have popped up at the Current have actually visited the site instead entrusting Donoso and her team of five to fully manage their presence she said.

Brands typically spend $2500-$8500 on store signage fixturing and other bells and whistles said Donoso. The bigger investment is in the marketing required to make the store successful.

“Every time a brand emails me to say ‘I want to do your project’ I say ‘Are you ready to market the shit out of your business?’ Because you can’t just pop up and do well especially if you’re testing a new market” she said.

That marketing includes hosting a minimum of three events in-store for the duration of the pop-up. Recently a Current retailer that was underperforming drove $4500 in sales during its first on-site event.

While Donoso said she still Instagram-DMs exciting brands to introduce them to The Current the property now largely “sells itself.” Since its opening Boston Seaport has become home to large tech companies as well as gyms restaurants and the permanent stores of several DNVB brands. Plus word of mouth is working wonders to attract The Current tenants.

For many brands the pop-up concept serves as a valuable growth lever. And taking a more hands-on approach can have its perks.

In January 2022 beauty industry veteran Lynn Power launched the Conscious Beauty Collective with a focus on bringing indie beauty and wellness brands together for co-funded and -operated pop-ups for 3-4 months at a time. Brookfield malls in San Francisco and Boston have hosted both iterations thus far.

“I had this idea and [interested] brands and Brookfield had space so it’s been a great fit” Power said. “I don’t want to stay somewhere too long; we want to go and get awareness new customers new influencer [partners] and new media in every market — just go somewhere and make a splash. And Brookfield has over 300 malls in premium locations in the U.S.”

Conscious Beauty Collective’s San Francisco store at Stonestown Galleria was formerly an Aveda storefront. However the latter and current store at Boston’s Natick Mall required more “beautifying” to match the featured products’ premium price points. Power said It was worth the extra effort considering its location across from a Louis Vuitton store and a Nordstrom.

That multiple brands across beauty categories are featured in Conscious Beauty Collective stores encourages discovery Power said. Meanwhile the store facilitates education around clean beauty which is “not yet mainstream.” In addition to serving customers in-store associates distribute informative postcards and product samples to mall passersby. Also to promote the store the Collective leverages geo-targeted Facebook and Google ads and direct mailers all targeting people within a 15-mile radius of the mall.

Power called the pop-up a “survival tactic” for her own brand — a hair-care brand dubbed Masami — as well as the companies of her collaborator brand founders. “These are brands you can’t yet get at Sephora or Ulta or Credo because we’re small” she said. “But it’s the chicken or the egg: We want to be at these retailers to grow our brands but they want our brands to grow them. [The hope is that] this will allow us to reach the ‘sweet spot’ size that retailers are looking for while preparing us for the demands that a big retail partnership entails.”

She added “Brookfield would love for us to stay [long-term] but they know the deal and they’re supportive.”

Like Brookfield WS Development hopes its pop-up tenants will become long-term tenants. Donoso’s projects have a 15% conversion rate she said.

The US outfit partnered with IoT chip and module maker Sequans Communications on the product numbered SKY66431 to combine the France-based firm’s Monarch 2 modem with its own radio-frequency (RF) front-end solution.

Skyworks has also released a new portfolio of ‘jitter attenuators’ for high-speed networking and data centre equipment notably as new 5G networks are rolled out and data traffic spirals upwards on wider internet infrastructure. The new Si536x family goes with the firm’s current Si539x jitter attenuating clocks to cater to a range of network timing needs for designers and vendors.

The SKY66431 solution featuring the Sequans LTE-M and NB-IoT modem is pitched for utility meters asset trackers security systems medical equipment telematics accessories and sundry battery-powered IoT devices. Skyworks and Sequans made the case for LTE-M and NB-IoT – as the LTE-native twin-tech supposed to kickstart the ‘massive IoT’ surge defined as massive machine-type comms (mMTC) in the holy trinity of new 5G capabilities – to meet stringent IoT demands for durability longevity and reliability.

A statement described it as a “multi-band multi-chip” SiP for “high performance connectivity with ultra-low power consumption”. Its native 23 dBm front-end module leverages Skyworks’ RF and packaging design to optimise reliability in demanding environments and minimise its physical footprint – to “miniaturise and encapsulate silver-free conformal shielding”. In other words the platform provides flexible design and long battery life without scrimping on low-power wide-area (LPWA) IoT performance. General availability is expected in the first quarter of 2023.

Stefan Fulga senior director of marketing for IoT and emerging products at Skyworks said: “As modern connected devices evolve Skyworks’ extensive expertise within this market and advanced packaging technologies allow us to drive improvements in power consumption size and advanced connectivity features to meet the rigorous performance requirements of our customers. The SKY66431 SiP enables simplified yet high performance designs that operate reliably worldwide accelerating time-to-market for our customers.”

Georges Karam chief executive at Sequans said: “The new SKY66431 SiP is a compelling IoT connectivity solution. It is a comprehensive all-in-one platform combining the technologies of two industry leaders who have included all of the critical components needed in one powerful tiny SiP that is ideal for a wide range of IoT applications from wearables including medical devices and trackers to sophisticated smart utility meters requiring advanced packaging and capabilities.”

Separately the new Si536x family of attenuators from Skyworks provides “frequency flexibility and clock tree on-a-chip integration in a compact clock IC solution” the company said. It features “up to 18 clock outputs featuring <55 fs RMS jitter enabling optimal transceiver performance” it said.

The increased jitter margin also helps de-risk product development and accelerate time to market for networking equipment vendors. The point is increasing demand for data bandwidth notably with 5G networks is driving a need for 400 600 and 800 gigabit Ethernet links with 800 gigabit expected as the standard fibre throughput rate in data centres by 2025 according to Dell’Oro Group. This is in turn driving demand for high-speed serializer/deserializer blocks (as high as 224 gigabit) and “coherent” optical technologies besides.

Skyworks stated: “These high-speed systems require multiple clocks at different frequencies signaling formats and voltage levels with ultra-low jitter… [Our Si536x] products address the next generation of high-speed communications’ designs allowing our customers to take advantage of the highest performance lowest jitter clocks available.” Designers can configure clock tree designs with the company’s ClockBuilder Pro software which includes design-rule checks power consumption estimates and a crosstalk wizard.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2020 investor-owned electric utilities spent $25 billion on transmission up from $23.7 billion in 2019 figures that the Edison Electric Institute which represents investor-owned electric companies expected to only grow going forward.

Ohio-based American Electric Power which is one of the nation’s largest electric companies and which operates the largest transmission system in the country (serving 5.5 million customers in 11 states) said last year that it plans to spend $23.3 billion between 2022 and 2026 on transmission and distribution.

But much of that spending is happening on local projects in states with widely differing regulatory regimes. And there’s been growing concern at the state and federal levels that too much of it is occurring without enough transparency and oversight to ensure transmission owners are appropriately planning for new technology considering more cost-effective regional approaches or alternate solutions and not ripping off their ratepayers.

“There’s going to be a significant amount of transmission built” Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Richard Glick said during a Nov. 15 meeting of a joint federal and state task force on electric transmission. “We need to make sure consumers get the best bang for their buck.”

The meeting came more than a month after a FERC technical conference during which electric utility regulators and consumer counsel from a wide variety of states said to varying degrees that they often lacked authority information and expertise to properly vet and oversee the rising number of transmission projects in their states.

That’s led to growing support for the idea of an independent monitor to examine the need costs and planning behind the wave of new projects to protect customers and ensure utilities — for whom transmission spending and the return on equity it comes with is a major profit stream — are looking beyond their own narrow financial interests.

“It is inexplicable other than perhaps explained by utility influence that massive expenditures for these utility local transmission projects are being charged to consumers without the government regulatory oversight that has been developed over a century for consumer protection” Mike Haugh director of the analytical department at the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel wrote in comments to FERC in support of independent transmission monitors.

“The ITM would allow for another level of protection for consumers that are paying for the transmission system.”

Not everyone of course is on board.

Electric companies and transmission owners see it as an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and even some utility regulators say it’s a job best left to states.

‘Screams out for more oversight’

At the task force meeting Nov. 15 Andrew French a commissioner at the Kansas Corporation Commission which regulates electric utilities said transmission costs in his state have gone from $4 a month on the average customer’s bill 10 or 15 years ago to $20 today.

“We are seeing a flood of capital investment in that area and that screams out for more oversight” he said.

Jennifer Easler the Iowa state consumer advocate which is responsible for reviewing and investigating regulated services provided by gas and electric utilities said during the October conference that regulators need more information in advance to perform a holistic assessment of local transmission projects that aren’t being properly vetted at the federal or regional transmission operator level.

“By the time it arrives at the state regulator when a utility wants to replace a new line because of age and condition the regulator is hard pressed to say no to that” she said.

Dan O’Hagan associate general counsel for the Florida Municipal Power Agency a nonprofit wholesale power agency owned by municipal electric utilities told the FERC conference in October that a lack of information makes it hard to determine why transmission providers select one solution over another.

“When they see a reliability concern on their system there is not just a single solution to that concern. Usually there’s multiple options they can take” O’Hagan said. “We don’t know why they chose project A over the B C D et cetera. . … And that really not only handcuffs our ability in the local process to effectively be a participant in that process and ensure that costs are being prudently spent and that they’re choosing the right projects but it also then handcuffs the regional process.”

But some state regulators do have processes in place to properly vet transmission projects and utility building plans which are called integrated resource plans.

“In Nevada we have one vertical [investor-owned utility] that’s regulated and it handles just about all the transmission in the state which means that any time new transmission is being proposed in an interstate context at least there’s a lot of robust and review and analysis of that transmission” said Cameron Dyer assistant general counsel for the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada at the October FERC conference.

And not all utility regulators see the need for an independent monitor.

Tricia Pridemore chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission touted Georgia’s pro-business rankings economic development wins below average electric rates growth in solar energy lack of outages or brown-outs and a collaborative process between regulators and utilities that “has been perfected over decades” at the Nov. 15 FERC task force meeting. (According to the federal Energy Information Administration however Georgia is hardly an electric rate utopia ranking 15th most expensive in average residential retail electric price.)

She admonished other state utility regulators to secure the budget and staffing to properly oversee projects rather than rely on a federally-imposed monitor.

“It lessens your authority to do the hard things that simply must be done“ she said.

During the FERC proceedings several large transmission owners dismissed the concept of an independent monitor as an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy that could gum up the works at a crucial juncture for the electric grid.

“We are currently living at a time when the need for transmission infrastructure investment has likely never been greater since the dawn of the industry. However there remain a few who continue to throw sticks in the spokes with a desire to divert the focus from progress to regress” wrote Charles Marshall vice president of transmission planning for ITC Holdings which describes itself as the largest independent electricity transmission company in the United States. ITC owns and operates high voltage transmission in Michigan Iowa Minnesota Illinois Missouri Kansas and Oklahoma.

“This has led to a push for additional layers of bureaucracy that could introduce new uncertainty and jeopardize needed investments in reliability and resilience” Marshall wrote.

Jeff Burleson a senior vice president of environmental and system planning at Atlanta-based Southern Company which operates electric companies in Georgia Alabama and Mississippi said the company posts transmission plans twice a year on the Southeastern Regional Transmission Planning website and gets “a significant amount of oversight at our state regulatory agencies.”

“I also don’t feel that there is value for us from thinking about some sort of independent monitor because we already have so much scrutiny that comes through all of our processes” he said.

But Easler the Iowa consumer advocate said in her comments filed with FERC that growing transmission costs are hitting many Iowa ratepayers hard and there’s often little state regulators can do.

“I would disagree with the notion that this is creating additional bureaucracy. It’s addressing a major oversight gap that exists” Easler said at the October conference.

The scope of the problem

The Federal Power Act which dates to 1920 grants FERC oversight over electric transmission in interstate commerce and charges it with ensuring that costs billed to customers are “just and reasonable.”

“Yet over the past few decades the commission has used its expansive ratemaking authority to institute several shortcuts that reduce its direct oversight” according to comments filed with FERC by Ari Peskoe director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University Law School. “The commission’s policies do not protect consumers.”

Peskoe singled out FERC “formula rates” which instead of relying on a contested rate case to establish the utility’s cost of service for transmission allows the companies to file information with FERC in various categories — including rate of return operations and maintenance depreciation taxes and other factors — that is used to calculate the formula rate they’re able to charge customers for local projects.

“Formula rates are a vehicle for avoiding burdens of proof and limiting protests. The commission’s default presumption that all transmission expenditures are prudent allows utility costs to flow through to consumers’ bills without scrutiny” Peskoe wrote adding that FERC policies for transmission asset replacement and end-of-life projects amount to “a blank check that may be worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few decades.”

While there’s some opportunity to challenge utilities’ formula rates “it’s not practical to do so on the piecemeal basis that these other projects are progressing” Easler said.

“The absence of customer-initiated challenges to local transmission upgrades in formula rate reviews is not an indication that all is well” she wrote in her comments to FERC. “Rather in the face of relentless transmission rate increase it is an indication that this regulatory process is inadequate to protect customers from unjust and unreasonable charges resulting from inefficient siloed transmission planning processes.”

FERC Commissioner Mark Christie a former member of the Virginia State Corporation Commission has said the amount of transmission spending utilities are packing into their rate bases (the total value of a regulated utility’s assets and upon which its electric rates and profits are calculated) nearly tripled between 2012 and 2020.

“What goes into rate base goes into consumer bills” Christie said at the Nov. 15 task force meeting. “This is a hugely important issue. This is a ton of money.” Christie questioned task force members on whether FERC should deny formula rate treatment to utilities in states that can’t certify that they have a “credible process” for evaluating need and prudence of projects.

Transmission projects that span different utilities’ service territories in areas managed by regional transmission organizations go through a vetting process involving multiple parties but utilities have almost total control over local projects a major incentive to avoid regional projects in which they may have to share control and profits with another utility.

“They like the status quo which is them building their own transmission wholly within their own territory and not having to share” said Nick Guidi an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center who works on electric regulation issues at FERC and is pushing for market reform in the Southeast.

Guidi quibbled in particular with the characterization by Burleson the Southern Company executive that the company’s state regulators conduct a thorough review of transmission projects.

Even where certificate of public need procedures (a permit to build and operate a utility facility) exist in the Southeast it’s generally only for new lines not lines that are being rebuilt upgraded or replaced.

“So we don’t always have this fulsome review of a comprehensive plan” he said. “An [independent transmission monitor] would be a tremendous resource for states who don’t often have the resources to monitor the process.”

Local limitations

Many states limit what their public utility commissions can approve based on size of transmission line leading to utilities often picking solutions that fall under that threshold in order to avoid scrutiny.

That means that while the project might not be the most efficient or cost effective it’s the easiest one for the utility to get built with the least amount of oversight.

Lauren Azar a former commissioner at the Wisconsin Public Service Commission said Wisconsin has no certificate requirement for smaller transmission lines.

In Ohio only lines above 100 kilovolts require a certificate of public need.

In North Carolina a public need certificate is only required for new construction of a transmission line that’s 161 kilovolts or larger said James McLawhorn director of the energy division at the North Carolina Utilities Commission’s Public Staff which is the state’s consumer advocate.

“So we have a lot of 115 and we find out about it when as we said this morning when it shows up in rates” McLawhorn said in October at the FERC conference.

In Florida the Transmission Line Siting Act requires a review process only for lines that are 230 kilovolts or larger that are at least 15 miles long and cross at least one county line O’Hagan said.

O’Hagan said Florida Power and Light proposed a 176-mile 161 kilovolt transmission line called the North Florida Resiliency Connection spanning from Jackson County to Columbia County.

“161 kv might sound strange and it is strange. It’s the only line of its size in Florida and it’s the largest line you can build without having to go through the Transmission Line Siting Act” he said. “The timing gave the stakeholders very little time to consider and develop possible alternatives or better proposals that would serve a better regional purpose.”

The role of a monitor

In October Kentucky Public Service Commission Chairman Kent Chandler said the monitor could serve a similar function to the independent market monitor in PJM the nation’s largest regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia. The market monitor is tasked with helping maintain “competitive and nondiscriminatory” power markets.

“I can understand people saying that it might be an extra layer of bureaucracy but for many of these projects it may be the only real set of eyes that’s looking at the need and the planning and you can say it’s an extra layer but it may be the only one really parsing through the numbers” Chandler said.

There seemed to be little appetite among consumer advocates or utility regulators for giving the monitor authority to issue orders rejecting or requiring any particular projects to be built.

“Certainly they’re not going to issue an order requiring something to be built but they can provide information to the states to whatever agency has jurisdiction to consider a transmission expansion whether it’s in their own state or three or four states over” said Henry Tilghman an energy lawyer representing the Northwest and Intermountain Power Producers Coalition a regional organization for independent power producers and other companies. “Just some good information that gives them confidence that they have the information they need to make an informed decision for their ratepayers.”

A final FERC decision on independent monitors however isn’t imminent. Though the discussion on independent transmission monitoring is occurring as the commission is weighing a proposed rule aimed at encouraging more effective long-term regional transmission planning and changing how benefits and costs of new transmission are allocated an order on independent monitoring would most likely come in a future rulemaking proceeding experts said.

“It would require another NOPR [notice of proposed rulemaking]” Guidi said.

Adrienne Mouton-Henderson director of market and policy innovation at the Clean Energy Buyers Alliance an association for commercial industrial nonprofit and other organizations looking to purchase clean energy said the same objections to transition monitors were raised about electric market monitors.

“Everyone complained when it was first raised. … It’s going to stop the system we’re just going to be stalled out. And that’s simply not been the case” she said. “Band-Aiding the system right now and putting the same assets in place is not helping us get renewables there it’s not helping corporate sustainability goals it’s not helping us get to clean energy. Transmission lines need to be rebuilt they need to be upgraded regionally and we need to make sure that we do it in a cost-effective manner for all ratepayers. … and we simply aren’t doing it right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb3VsdHJpZW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvY2Nocy1zdHVkZW50cy1hdHRlbmQtc2VuaW9yLWRheS1hdC1zb3V0aGVybi1yZWdpb25hbC10ZWNobmljYWwtY29sbGVnZS9hcnRpY2xlX2RjYmMzNDcwLTY2YjItMTFlZC1hMjdkLTU3NTYxYjdmM2VkOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CCHS students attend Senior Day at Southern Regional Technical College,"Moultrie GA (31768)

CIM Group purchased the buildings in 2020. Relations between tenants and owners were already fraught after the pandemic left many residents in Southern Towers — one of the last bastions of market-rate affordable housing in Alexandria — without work. Since then community activists have raced to try and support residents facing eviction after pandemic-related protections expired.

A dozen residents of Southern Towers were in attendance along with several community organizers from the organization African Communities Together (ACT). Bert Bayou chapter director for ACT’s DC office said ACT has been working to support local residents who feel they’re being pushed out by continual rent increases at the property.

“We are here supporting the tenants” said Bayou. “For a few months we’ve been trying to engage with CIM about conditions in the building and rent increases.”

Rent

Bayou said CIM Group has told residents that rent went up 3-4%. Bayou said ACT surveyed residents and found some 9% increases though CIM group cited figures on real estate website CoStar that show lower average rent renewals.

“CIM says they want to keep the building as workforce housing but everything they do is making it unaffordable” Bayou said. “All we see is CIM trying to get rid of African immigrants.”

Added into the mix is that utilities are no longer included with rent meaning residents face additional costs on top of increasing rent.

Sosseh Prom state policy manager for African Communities Together rent shouldn’t increase any more than 2% annually.

“If you a multi-billion dollar company are having these issues: how do you think blue-collar workers feel?” Prom said.

Sami Bourma a resident at Southern Towers said beyond just issues with having utilities separated from rent there are no clear answers on where the figures on the bills are coming from given that there aren’t individual meters in the units.

“We see a $200 electric bill for a one-bedroom unit or $600 for a three-bedroom but it doesn’t make any sense” Bourma said. “CIM says ‘oh that’s what the market is.'”

CIM Group was not available for interviews but said in a document sent to ALXnow that because Southern Towers aren’t affiliated with any social service support network the property owners are keeping rent increases in line with the financial obligations of building ownership:

The vast majority 91.5 percent of Southern Towers residents are current in meeting their rent obligations. Our empathy for residents must be balanced by our fiduciary responsibility. We empathize with those residents that face personal struggles. However Southern Towers is a standard workforce housing community and is not affiliated with any social service support networks. As property owners we must meet our financial obligations and fiduciary responsibilities in order to keep the lights on and the doors open providing homes for thousands of residents at Southern Towers.

The real estate company said rents are 20% below average rental rates in Alexandria and rent increases have been below the average rate as well noting that the average rates cited on real estate website CoStar showed a 2.7% increase for residents renewing their leases and a 5.1% increase for new leases.

Currently rents at Southern Towers are approximately 20 percent below the average rental rates for all apartment properties in the Alexandria area according to CoStar. This equates to on average approximately $600 a month. Overall rents in the Alexandria market increased 12.8 percent in the past year. Rental rates for new leases at Southern Towers increased 5.1 percent over the same period while existing residents executing renewals saw increases of 2.7 percent during this time according to CoStar. Effective October 1 2022 Southern Towers will hold rent increases to $200 per month for residents in good standing who execute a lease renewal through the end of 2022. There were instances where residents agreed to renewal terms before the commitment to a $200 cap was implemented. There is no obligation to renew residents may select from the many residential options in the area.

Eviction Notices

Another sore spot for residents protesting against CIM group were eviction notices that Prom said were misleading for residents. Prom said CIM is required to give 30-day eviction by federal law but only gives a five-day “pay or quit” notice required by Virginia.

“We saw notices for October 9 and court cases filed 13 days later” Prom said. “In more recent notices the five-day ‘pay or quit’ notices say in small print that tenants could be eligible under the Cares Act for a 30-day notice but there’s nothing that tells the tenant if they have that right [in their unit].”

CIM group said it is in compliance with federal law which requires the landlord to wait 30 days to remove resident after the notice to vacate is received.

“Southern Towers is fully compliant with the CARES Act which states that a landlord must wait 30 days to remove a resident after the notice to vacate is received” the document said.

According to CIM:

The attorney representing Southern Towers uses the state of Virginia approved NOTICE OF MATERIAL NONCOMPLIANCE FOR NONPAYMENT OF RENT also known as the five notice… Southern Towers provides this notice to a resident at the appropriate time and then 30 days following the issuance of the notice to the tenant we send the information to the Southern Towers attorney to proceed with an unlawful detainer filing with the court. What follows is entirely up to the court and no longer involves the property owner. The court process is outlined in the attached Virginia Eviction Flow Chart. The process may take months so should a resident be removed it is well beyond 30 days.

Health Issues

Residents at the rally said they’ve seen rodent and insect infestations continue or worsen in recent years along with ongoing mold issues.

“My child got sick and I took him to the doctor” Bourma said. “The doctor said it could be mold. So we looked at the air conditioning unit: it was full of mold. We started visiting other units and found that 60% of them had mold inside their AC units.”

CIM Group said repairs to the building are ongoing but take time.

“CIM Group acquired Southern Towers in August 2020 after a close review of the condition of these 1960s-era buildings which unearthed years of deferred maintenance and a long-list of needed improvements” the property owner said. “Prior to its purchase CIM Group created an extensive plan to tackle these issues over time. Today CIM Group’s multi-million-dollar improvement program is underway which for a property of this size will require several years to complete the substantial work required.”

CIM Group said since taking over they have doubled the investment in repair and maintenance and doubled the contract for pest removal. The document said a community-wide comprehensive pest identification and removal program will be carried out before the end of the year.

The document said issues in the air conditioning units are “most likely mildew and not mold” but a program ongoing to replace leaky windows and roofing should help mitigate that issue:"
LUV,Southwest Airlines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1yZWRleWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Doesn't Southwest Airlines Fly Redeyes?,"There are a lot of things that make Southwest Airlines unique among US airlines and I’d consider most of those to be competitive advantages. There is one strange quirk that makes Southwest unique though — the airline doesn’t operate redeye flights. I thought it would be interesting to take a closer look at why and if that could change.

Southwest doesn’t operate redeye flights

Domestic redeye flights (where you fly overnight) can be polarizing — people love them for the efficiency of not “wasting” a day but hate them for having to miss a night of sleep and how tough they can be on your body.

Major US airlines operate domestic redeye flights for a variety of reasons:

There’s the old saying that planes only make money when they’re in the air so parking a plane on the ground overnight isn’t great for aircraft utilization

Many customers prefer redeyes to save time so an airline not operating redeyes could lose some business to the competition

For many markets redeyes allow airlines to offer practical connecting itineraries; for example if you’re flying from Hawaii to the East Coast of the mainland and are connecting on the West Coast one of your two flights will almost always have to be a redeye

There’s one exception when it comes to redeyes. In its 50+ year history Southwest Airlines has never scheduled a redeye flight. What’s the logic — does the airline just not think these flights would make money or…?

All other major US airlines operate redeyes

Why doesn’t Southwest operate redeyes?

Up until 2017 there was a technical limitation that prevented Southwest Airlines from scheduling redeyes. The airline used to have an antiquated reservations system:

This system didn’t allow Southwest to schedule connecting itineraries involving redeyes

This system didn’t allow the airline to even fluctuate its schedule on different days of the week

All Southwest flights had be scheduled to land by 11PM PT (2AM ET) so that the system could be switched over to the following day

In 2017 Southwest finally transitioned to Amadeus which is much more capable and allows the airline to schedule redeyes among other things.

So over five years after making the switch why has Southwest still not introduced redeyes? In early 2020 while the Boeing 737 MAX was grounded and before the pandemic shut down travel Southwest’s VP of Network Planning was asked about Southwest’s lack of redeyes. Below is an excerpt.

Southwest doesn’t fly red eyes. How much easier would your life be if it did? I don’t know if easier is the right word but it’s different. I’d like to be able to fly red eyes just because it would give you some more opportunities to serve the customer need. I believe there’s a customer need for people that are going from west to east that want to fly after the business day. If it never comes to pass for Southwest it’s something we’ve lived with for 48 years. It’s not like “Oh my gosh we have to fly red eyes.” At some point it would be a nice extension from what we’re doing now. But it’s not a make or break thing. When it’s right and the operation is feeling comfortable that they can do it and they can maintain it for our employees then we’ll go ahead and turn that on.

For what it’s worth while Southwest flight attendants seem to be able to operate redeyes without issue according to their contract I’ve heard rumors that the contract for pilots would make redeyes more costly to operate. I haven’t been able to see the contract myself to figure out if that’s actually the case but if anyone has any insights I’d love to hear them.

Southwest Airlines doesn’t operate redeyes

Southwest is such a quirky airline

Southwest is a funny airline and that’s also why I’m a bit conflicted on this.

When I started writing this post I thought to myself “is no one at Southwest thinking or why wouldn’t the airline add redeyes?” Southwest has the planes sitting around and presumably there are at least some markets where these flights could be operated profitably and where repositioning planes overnight would allow the airline to otherwise run more smoothly.

So it’s only natural that my thought is that Southwest just seems to be stuck in its ways and refuses to change. That brings me to my other thought on this which is that part of what sets Southwest apart from the competition is that the airline is set in its ways.

Some other US airlines seem to think that the path to profitability includes a complete reinvention every few years with seemingly little success. “Hey let’s add TVs to planes and be premium” quickly turns into “nope never mind let’s rip those out.” Meanwhile little has changed about Southwest from friendly service to efficient aircraft turns to two free checked bags to no assigned seats.

Southwest is the only airline that truly marches to the beat of its own drum and doesn’t seem to care what the competition does. And it has worked really well for the airline over the years.

So while I might not get Southwest’s logic here I do think the folks at Southwest know exactly what they’re doing and that the decision to not operate redeyes is intentional… for now.

Redeyes would make Southwest’s Hawaii service easier

Bottom line

Southwest Airlines is the only major US airline to not operate redeye flights. Up until 2017 this was due to a limitation with the carrier’s reservations system which (amazingly) didn’t allow redeyes to be scheduled. However it has been over five years since that change was made and the airline still doesn’t operate redeyes.

This seems to be something that’s on Southwest’s radar though it obviously hasn’t been enough of a priority to actually happen. I’m curious to see if this changes eventually or if the airline will just stick with its current strategy.

Anyone want to take a stab at explaining Southwest’s lack of redeyes?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmMuY29tL2phc29uLWF0ZW4vNS15ZWFycy1hZ28tc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLW1hZGUtYS1kZWNpc2lvbi10aGF0LWp1c3QtcGFpZC1vZmYtaW4tYS1iaWctd2F5LWl0LWFsbC1jb21lcy1kb3duLXRvLTEtd29yZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Years Ago Southwest Airlines Made a Decision That Just Paid Off in a Big Way.

In a viral video tweeted by the Dallas-based airline a pilot is seen hanging from the plane's cockpit window to retrieve a phone that one of his passengers accidentally left behind. The plane had already left the gate at Long Beach Airport in California when the incident occurred.

""When our employees at @LGBairport noticed a customer's phone left behind in a gate area after a flight that was already boarded and pushed back from the gate they didn't hesitate"" the airline wrote alongside the clip. They added the hashtag #WorldKindnessDay.

Southwest Airlines

The eight-second video shows the pilot dangling his arm and upper body outside the cockpit window as a crew member tries to pass him the phone. After the first failed attempt a different crew member takes on the task and jumps even higher to hand over the device. Cheers can be heard in the background of the clip as the pilot successfully retrieves the phone.

Twitter users were quick to comment on the airline's act of kindness with one writing ""Teamwork makes the dream work.""

Southwest Airlines

Another user was baffled by the window's ability to even open. ""I had no idea those windows could open. How does the breeze feel at 35000ft?"" they joked.

This is not the first time Twitter poked fun at one of Southwest's acts of kindness. In September the airline surprised passengers aboard a Hawaii-bound flight with free ukuleles and a mid-air lesson on how to play the instrument.

Twitter users were quick to turn the gesture into a meme after the airline posted photos of the passengers posing with their new gifts. Author Ted Gioia retweeted one of the posts and included the caption ""First they take away your leg room and now this.""

Tom Nichols a journalist at The Atlantic wrote ""I am a big fan of Southwest but this might have made me homicidal.""

While the action may have received some flack Southwest stood by their good deed.

Brandy King Senior Director of Public Relations at Southwest Airlines wrote in a press release ""Our Customers anticipate warm Southwest Hospitality throughout their journeys with us.

The walkouts coincide with Starbucks’ annual Red Cup Day when the company gives free reusable cups to customers who order a holiday drink. Workers say it’s often one of the busiest days of the year. Starbucks declined to say how many red cups it plans to distribute.

Workers say they’re seeking better pay more consistent schedules and higher staffing levels in busy stores. Stores in 25 states planned to take part in the labor action according to Starbucks Workers United the group organizing the effort. Strikers are handing out their own red cups with union logos.

Starbucks which opposes the unionization effort said it is aware of the walkouts and respects its employees’ right to lawfully protest. The Seattle company noted that the protests are happening at a small number of its 9000 company-run U.S. locations.

“We remain committed to all partners and will continue to work together side-by-side to make Starbucks a company that works for everyone” the company said Thursday in a statement.

Some workers planned to picket all day while others will do shorter walkouts. The union said the goal is to shut stores down during the strikes and noted that the company usually has difficulty staffing during Red Cup Day because it’s so busy.

Silvia Baldwin 26 and Tzvi Ortiz 31 said they love being baristas at the 34th Street and Chestnut Street Starbucks in Philadelphia. But the work has gotten harder with the understaffed store trying to fill delivery orders and in-person orders simultaneously.

“It’s just not viable. It’s very stressful” Ortiz said. “And a lot of people don’t really notice like the humans behind this assembly.”

Baldwin who is on the store’s bargaining committee is also frustrated that the union hasn’t been able to bargain with Starbucks. Striking on Starbucks’ busiest day felt inspiring and it will “be impossible to ignore” she said.

Others including Michelle Eisen a union organizer at one of the first stores to organize in Buffalo New York said workers are angry that Starbucks promised higher pay and benefits to non-union stores. Starbucks says it is following the law and can’t give union stores pay hikes without bargaining.

At a store in Seattle less than three miles from Starbucks’ headquarters workers said managers were making drinks while baristas picketed outside.

“It’s been almost a year since we told Starbucks that we are unionizing this location and we still have not been able to get them to agree to a time for contract negotiations” Seattle barista Micah Lakes said. “We’re not going to work the day that is the most important for you if you’re not going to be willing to meet up with us and talk with us about what we need from the company.”

At least 257 Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late last year according to the National Labor Relations Board. Fifty-seven stores have held votes where workers opted not to unionize.

Starbucks and the union have begun contract talks at 53 stores with 13 additional sessions scheduled Starbucks Workers United said. No agreements have been reached so far.

The process has been contentious. Earlier this week a regional director with the NLRB filed a request for an injunction against Starbucks in federal court saying the company violated labor law when it fired a union organizer in Ann Arbor Michigan. The regional director asked the court to direct Starbucks to reinstate the employee and stop interfering in the unionization campaign nationwide.

It was the fourth time the NLRB has asked a federal court to intervene. In August a federal judge ruled that Starbucks had to reinstate seven union organizers who were fired in Memphis Tennessee. A similar case in Buffalo has yet to be decided while a federal judge ruled against the NLRB in a case in Phoenix.

Meanwhile Starbucks has asked the NLRB to temporarily suspend all union elections at its U.S. stores citing allegations from a board employee that regional officials improperly coordinated with union organizers. A decision in that case is pending.

The American Restroom Association is marking World Toilet Day on 19 November an awareness-raising day started by the United Nations to celebrate toilets and advocate for proper sanitation systems by calling on Starbucks to keep its restrooms open to the public.

In June the Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz specifically mentioned the Starbucks bathroom situation while speaking at a conference.

“We serve 100m at Starbucks and there is an issue of just safety in our stores in terms of people coming in and using our stores as a public bathroom” he said. While Schultz did not specify what problems the business has been having with its open-restroom policy Schultz said the company has to “harden our stores and provide safety for our people”.

“I don’t think we can keep our bathrooms open” he said.

The stance is different from the one the chain has had since 2018 when it told employees that all patrons paying customers or not would be allowed to use the restroom in stores.

The announcement came after two Black men were arrested at a Starbucks in Philadelphia – an encounter that was filmed and went viral. One man asked to use the restroom and an employee informed him that he needed to purchase something to stay at the store and use the facilities. Moments later police arrived and arrested them seemingly without any clear reason.

In a memo to employees in 2018 Starbucks said that the open-restroom policy “is intended to help maintain the third-place environment in alignment with our mission” referring to the sociological concept of a “third place” – a place of community that is neither the home nor a workplace.

In a statement to the Guardian a Starbucks spokesperson said: “No changes to our bathroom policy have been made. Our local leaders have a number of options at their disposal to support our Third Place Policy which includes the ability to modify store operations and restroom access following local jurisdiction laws where applicable.”

While Starbucks has not officially changed its bathroom policy after Schultz’s comments the American Restroom Association (ARA) which advocates for safe and well-designed public restrooms notes that some Starbucks locations have closed their restrooms to the public.

Steve Soifer the group’s president pointed out that international plumbing codes require business establishments to keep their toilet facilities open to both visitors and customers – essentially anyone walking into their business. Such plumbing codes exist around the country but enforcement can be non-existent.

Still Soifer argues that Americans have few other options.

“The problem is there aren’t any other choices” Soifer said. “You go to New York City for example and you’re walking around. The only places you can go are public libraries or museums. They have to keep the bathrooms open for the public. Everything else is hit-or-miss.

“Try to find city-built public toilets in New York City they’re virtually non-existent.”

Part of the problem Soifer said is that there is no official count of how many government-operated public restrooms are in the US. One study conducted by the British bathroom supply company QS Supplies estimates that there are eight public toilets for every 100000 Americans ranking below the UK France and Canada. In comparison Iceland which has the highest number has 56 public toilets for 100000 people. Soifer said the ARA was trying to get funding to create a “national toilet map” for the US which will show all public restrooms in the country.

Pay-to-use toilets more commonly seen across Europe were once prolific in the US. People protested that Americans should not have to pay to use public facilities but instead of building free-to-use restrooms the restrooms shut down entirely in the 70s with nothing to fill the gaps.

“We thought by eliminating pay toilets cities and counties would invest in building public toilets and that just never happened. Now we have no options” Soifer said. “There’s such a dearth of public toilets in the US for people to use.”

Some progressive local governments have made efforts to construct public toilets. Soifer pointed to Portland’s “Portland Loo” initiative where the city constructed free-standing restrooms around the city. Other cities have started to take on the concept including San Diego and Sacramento.

But building more restrooms can be costly and politically difficult for local governments. The California governor Gavin Newsom criticized plans to build public restrooms in San Francisco’s Noe Valley neighborhood. The toilets would cost $1.7m and take up to three years to build. The ensuing anger over the plan was nicknamed “Toiletgate”.

Because businesses like Starbucks already have functioning facilities the immediate solution is allowing access to the public with broader hopes that people can push governments to build clean and accessible municipally funded restrooms.

“This is such a widely felt issue” Soifer said. “I mean everyone I talk to has a public toilet horror story.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9idXNpbmVzcy9zdGFyYnVja3Mtc3RyaWtlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSATxodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzExLzE3L2J1c2luZXNzL3N0YXJidWNrcy1zdHJpa2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,About 2000 Starbucks workers stage one-day strike at more than 100 stores,"New York CNN Business —

More than 2000 employees at 112 Starbucks locations are set to go on a one-day strike Thursday according to the union which has been organizing stores for the last year.

The union says it is striking to protest the retaliation taken against union supporters nationwide. It is also protesting what it characterizes as the company’s refusal to bargain with the union on a first labor deal. There are 264 stores that have voted in favor of union representation. But no contracts have yet been negotiated even at stores which voted nearly a year ago.

“This is to show them we’re not playing around” said Tyler Keeling a 26-year old union supporter who has worked at a Starbucks in Lakewood California — near Los Angeles — for the last six years. “We’re done with the their anti-union retaliation and them walking away from bargaining.”

Keeling and other union supporters say that it was up to each individual store as to whether or not to participate in the nationwide strike. Many stores have staged brief strikes already over specific issues. But this is the first nationwide action.

“There’s a lot of fear before a store decides to go on strike” said Michelle Eisen an organizer of the first Starbucks store to vote in favor of the union last December. “Starbucks has been retaliating against union leaders across the country. But despite that fear over 2000 workers across the country are striking today and standing up for one another.”

When Keeling’s store staged a one-day strike in August Starbucks (SBUX) workers from nearby non-union stores joined the picket line he said and some customers brought food and drinks to the strikers.

It’s not clear how many of the stores affected by Thursday’s action will be able to stay open during the strike.

The protest comes on “Red Cup” day at Starbucks when it gives out reusable holiday cups with certain drink purchases that entitle customers to discounts and extra bonus points on future purchases.

“Culturally Red Cup Day is an important day at Starbucks. People do go crazy over it” said Keeling. He said holding the strike on a day that has such a heavy volume of customers is a great way call attention to anti-union activities.

The union is calling its strike a “Red Cup Rebellion” and is handing out red Starbucks Workers United union cups to customers instead.

At a store across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City workers walked the picket line even though their store isn’t having a union vote until Dec. 8. The store was open with the help of managers brought in from other stores according to the strikers. Staff on the job in the store wouldn’t comment on the strike.

Aaron Cirillo a 23-year old working at the store since August said he’s not discouraged by the fact that the store was able to stay open or that many customers crossed the picket line.

“We’re not trying to intimidate them. We just want them to hear our story about the need for a fair contract” he said. Asked what he would tell customers if he could he responded “I would urge them to think about showing support by not getting a coffee this one day or to go to any other store in the city for a coffee.”

The strikers chants were enough to prompt some customers to turn away but there was a good flow of customers in the store.

The company was not immediately available for comment on the strike early Thursday. In the past it has denied it has retaliated against any employee for their support of the union and it has blamed the union for lack of progress at the negotiating table. Starbucks has defended the firings of union supporters that have taken place as proper enforcement of rules that apply to all of its employees who it refers to as “partners.”

“Interest in a union does not exempt partners from following policies and procedures that apply to all partners” Starbucks said in an earlier statement.

But this week the National Labor Relations Board — which oversees union representation votes — filed in federal court for a national cease and desist order to prevent Starbucks from retaliating against union supporters.

The NLRB filing said that there had been a “number and pattern of Starbucks’ unfair labor practices … particularly discharges” against union supporters at it stores.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS9zdGFyYnVja3MtdW5pb24tc3RyaWtlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Workers Strike at Dozens of Stores Nationally (Published 2022),"Starbucks employees went on strike on Thursday at dozens of unionized locations nationwide citing what they say is the company’s refusal to bargain in good faith and anti-union tactics like firings and store closings.

The work stoppage which organizers have called “the Red Cup Rebellion” after the reusable holiday-themed cups that Starbucks is distributing with certain purchases was expected to last for the day. Striking workers said they would distribute union-branded cups to customers.

“Starbucks has left behind the very values that drew many of us to the company in the first place” Michelle Eisen a worker who helped organize the first of more than 250 locations that have unionized over the past year said in a statement. “You cannot be pro-L.G.T.B.Q. pro-B.L.M. pro-sustainability and anti-union. This Red Cup Day we’re organizing for a voice on the job and a true seat at the table.”

In a statement Starbucks said it was aware that “union demonstrations are scheduled at a small number of our more than 9000 U.S. company-owned stores.” The company added that it respected the right of its employees whom it calls partners to engage in lawful protests but that its focus was “uplifting the Starbucks experience for our partners and customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGlja29uZGV0cm9pdC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIyLzExLzE4L2RldHJvaXQtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWZvcmNlZC10by1jbG9zZS1hZnRlci1wZXRhLXByb3Rlc3RlcnMtZW5jYXNlZC1mZWV0LWluLWNvbmNyZXRlLWJsb2NrZWQtZW50cmFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Detroit Starbucks forced to close after PETA protesters encased feet in concrete blocked entrance,"DETROIT – A Starbucks in Detroit was forced to close on Friday after four protesters blocked the entrance by encasing their feet in concrete.

Four PETA supporters protested Starbucks’ upcharge of non-dairy milk by encasing their feet in concrete and blocking the store’s entrance for four hours with signs and chants.

PETA Starbucks protest (PETA)

“Starbucks’ punitive price hike on vegan milks harms cows the planet and customers who are lactose-intolerant—many of whom are people of color” says PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman. “PETA has appealed to Starbucks to stop profiting from the plant-based milk upcharge but so far greed continues to define the company’s position.”

This comes as the latest Starbucks protest from PETA supporters. The previous “cement-in” took place outside of a Nashville Starbucks which resulted in the arrest of four protesters.

Other supporters have superglued themselves to counters in Chicago New York City and at the company’s headquarters in Seattle.

The Detroit protest comes on the last day of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference."

2022 to date has proved to be a noteworthy year for ESG investments due in part to greater international momentum around climate change in the wake of COP26 and the continued impact from COVID-19 which drove ESG to the forefront for many industries.

Investors responded accordingly demonstrating a growing desire to deploy capital with a sustainable purpose. Against this backdrop the role of the financial sector catalyzed change and was a conduit for addressing ESG concerns worldwide.

Investors are demanding that companies act in ways that help maximize the probability of attractive returns over an extended time horizon. Increasingly the next generation of stakeholders expects to see ESG considerations reflected in where they work how they spend and in which companies they choose to invest.

As Ronal O’ Hanley CEO and Chairman of State Street notes in the company’s annual ESG report “ESG has largely moved from a question of “what” to “how” and “when.” Looking ahead we believe that accelerating sustainable growth will be tantamount to the promotion and protection of long-term value. That shift in sentiment will be to the benefit of our stakeholders our industry our communities and the planet we all share.”

Leading by example

As an asset servicer State Street enables asset owners and asset managers to become more effective in their understanding and usage of ESG as an investment and business lever.

As a global corporation with nearly 40000 employees the company has an ESG strategy against which they execute a range of operational initiatives to achieve our own ESG goals. These activities range from carefully managing the company’s environmental impact to bolstering inclusion diversity and equity across its workforce and suppliers.

Consistent with prior reporting State Street measures and disclose its ESG activities according to frameworks created by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). They also fulfil obligations as a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and support progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

In 2022 State Street is dedicated more than ever to its ESG responsibilities and says that sustainable growth is vital to overcome the challenges ahead. State Street’s annual ESG report somberly notes “A world that is warming beyond what science tells us is a critical tipping point poses a risk to long-term investors.”

The way through this says O’Hanley is accelerating sustainable growth “Accelerating sustainable growth will be tantamount to the promotion and protection of long-term value. It’s for the benefit of our stakeholders our industry our communities and the planet we all share.”

Accelerating sustainable growth

Every two years State Street conducts a materiality review to identify and address the ESG factors the company faces. These results help inform how they report on performance according to certain ESG metrics. Material ESG issues are those that are most relevant to an organization’s ESG impacts and ultimately its ability to create long-term value.

The latest assessment revealed the following eight topics as State Street’s key focus: board governance and ESG management climate change data privacy employee experience ESG integration inclusion diversity and equity; operational and cyber resilience; and risk ethics and compliance.

For each of the eight material ESG issues listed State Street has a robust procedure and insights in place to better improve ESG integration across the company. State Street stakeholders believe it is tangible guidelines and procedures for constructing investment portfolios and managing financing needs that will generate long-term value for clients while strengthening the company’s operational resiliency. They hope to lead by example.

As one of the world’s largest asset managers and custodians State Street has been deeply engaged around ESG issues for some time engaging on ESG issues that drive long-term value through their asset stewardship practices.

G Cafe will take over the Orange Street storefront.

After shuttering its three remaining cafes in New England Blue State Coffee has retired from the coffee scene entirely.

The East Rock location on Orange Street will be taken over by G Cafe which currently operates four other locations in the state. The chain will also take over Blue State’s Hartford location. A location in Providence Rhode Island near the campus of Brown University has also now closed.

“After 18 years this is bittersweet because even though this is the right time for us to make this transition we will miss being part of our communities and serving our customers” Blue State CEO Carolyn Greenspan told the News.

Greenspan says that she has introduced Common Grounds and G Cafe owners to managers and employees at Blue State’s stores. Both Common Grounds and G Cafe have expressed intent to hire former Blue State employees although Greenspan said she is not privy to their hiring plans.

Owner and founder of G Cafe Andrea Corazzini said that the expansion comes after about six weeks of negotiations with Blue State and laying plans for the new space. The Orange St. location will be G Cafe’s fifth location joining existing bakery cafes in New Haven and Branford and a kiosk in Tweed Airport.

As New Haven has grown and new apartments have sprung up Corazzini said he has seen his cafes become much more crowded. He hopes that by opening another cafe and bakery they will be able to meet the demand that has grown for G Cafe’s coffee and baked goods.

Corazzini who was born in Italy and has lived in the New Haven area for 12 years says he is also excited about the Orange St. location because it comes with an existing customer base the one that Blue State has developed. To cater to that customer base Corazzini plans to maintain hours similar to those Blue State did.

Last month some employees from the first three closed Blue States were unsure about whether they would have jobs with Common Grounds.

The News spoke to two employees at the recently opened Common Grounds on Wall St. who said they had just moved to New Haven and did not previously work at Blue State. Common Grounds management was unable to comment.

At the Orange St. location employees were optimistic about G Cafe and their new owner.

“[G Cafe] gave us applications so it seems like they will take the whole team” one employee said.

Corazzini echoed these sentiments saying that they are very interested in hiring the former employees of the Orange St. cafe and former employees of other Blue States around New Haven.

“We have a lot of opening positions” Corazzini said. “If any other baristas from any other Blue States feel that Common Grounds is not making time and feel that they might catch this train they are more than welcome to stop by.”

Many students found Blue State’s permanent and total closure unexpected.

“I think it’s really surprising that a local chain with such a strong community presence is shutting down completely” said Katelyn DeKeersgieter ’25. “I’m a little disappointed but I had already made my peace with the absence of $8 Blue State lattes in my life when the locations closest to campus closed.”

Corazzini said that he foresees a challenge in transforming the feel of a “study hall” into that of a cafe.

“A coffee shop bakery is a place where you go and talk with friends” Corazzini said. “And you share moments and stories and enjoy coffee and food.”

But with a brand new flag and certification to process steel for the automotive industry the Mississippi Steel Processing plant at 400 N. Steel Road plans to change that.

MSP Vice President and General Manager Mark Reynolds told The Dispatch the company received a new certification from the International Automotive Task Force an international organization designed to test and approve processing facilities for automotive steel. To celebrate the new certification Reynolds and a group of more than 60 employees gathered to raise the navy blue flag — donning a car and the IATF logo — Wednesday afternoon.

“It is a new opportunity for MSP to add to its portfolio of customers and business and products that we supply here” Reynolds said. “We just had the opportunity to grow and add to what we currently have in-house.”

With the new certification MSP will begin looking for automotive customers for whom it will process steel. Once those are found the company will take 70-to-80-inch steel coils from Steel Dynamics Inc. and split them into smaller cylinders per the customer’s specification.

Reynolds said that those new coils will be shipped to stampers who turn the coiled steel into stronger lighter vehicle parts.

“Any time you change your opportunity it brings opportunity” Reynolds said. “Any time you change your focus and your direction of what you’re processing and what you’re supplying it gives an opportunity to improve.”

MSP came to its location in Lowndes County in 2010. Four years later it underwent its first of two expansions to add a rail spur to receive steel coils from SDI and completed a second expansion in 2019 with a new building that increased its steel processing capabilities.

MSP currently processes 18000 to 22000 tons of steel a month into slits and smaller coils for SDI roofing HVAC and dock plate leveler companies operating at 65 percent of its total capacity.

With room for growth Reynolds said the company is also working to process for other steel-based entities like Altex Tube Inc. which broke ground on the SDI campus in July.

Altex President and CEO Zach Smith said MSP was one of the key factors in deciding where to build the company’s steel tubing facility which is poised to begin operations in July 2023 and is satisfied to see MSP expand its capability in steel processing.

“Locating there was the fact that everything is right there within walking distance” Smith said. “The freight savings on inbound freight it will be a huge advantage for us.”

Golden Triangle Development LINK Chief Executive Officer Joe Max Higgins said MSP’s ability to process even more steel from SDI and haul it to automotive companies does more than just increase the bottom line it puts the automotive steel industry right in its backyard which serves to develop further the economic capabilities of the entire campus and its businesses.

“Them going into automotive is a big deal because you’re going to make more money making products in the automotive arena than for somebody else” Higgins said. “Our Mississippi hands make the steel down at the steel mill and our Mississippi hands get to touch it once again and make it into a slit roll. So that’s value added.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9jYXJwcm8uaW4vbmV3cy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3ZhbGVvLXByb2R1Y2VzLWl0cy0xMC1taWxsaW9udGgtZnJvbnQtY2FtZXJhLXN5c3RlbS13aXRoLW1vYmlsZXllLWV5ZXEtdGVjaC0xMTMzNTXSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXV0b2NhcnByby5pbi9uZXdzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvdmFsZW8tcHJvZHVjZXMtaXRzLTEwLW1pbGxpb250aC1mcm9udC1jYW1lcmEtc3lzdGVtLXdpdGgtbW9iaWxleWUtZXllcS10ZWNoLTExMzM1NT9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Valeo produces its 10 millionth front camera system with Mobileye EyeQ tech,"The two companies have helped revolutionise driver assist systems by taking computer vision technology to a next level in the automotive industry.

As a long-time MSMS member former state legislator and practicing physician Doctor George has the kind of unique expertise and experience that will make him an immediate and invaluable asset to the Michigan State Medical Society and its member physicians across the state. Poised to provide leadership and direction from day one of his tenure Doctor George intends to focus a great deal of his efforts on ensuring the association is meeting the needs of its members.

“I’ve been a practicing physician and member of the Michigan State Medical Society for 37 years now” said Doctor George. “And over the years there’s been no question that MSMS has made a significant and positive difference in shaping our state’s health care landscape through its advocacy efforts on behalf of Michigan’s physicians and the patients they serve. I intend to see that this society continues to provide that same kind of value and service to its members. That effort will be rooted in building strong peer-to-peer doctor-to-doctor relationships with current prospective and former MSMS members throughout the state.”

His leadership comes at a fortuitous time for the society. With sweeping changes coming to Lansing’s political landscape Doctor George’s decade of experience serving as an elected member of Michigan’s legislature will prove invaluable as MSMS works to position itself to best advocate for its members and promote the public health of Michigan’s citizens.

“Changing leadership in Lansing presents new challenges but also new opportunities for this society to make a real difference in the ongoing efforts to implement policies that will positively impact Michigan physicians and patients” said Doctor George. “And while the political landscape may be shifting our fundamental goal of working to promote the health of citizens of Michigan remains unchanged.”

In addition to being a practicing physician at Kalamazoo Anesthesiology P.C. Doctor George also serves as Co-Chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at the Western Michigan University Homer Stryker School of Medicine. He has previously served as president of the Kalamazoo County Medical Society the Michigan Society of Anesthesiologists and the Historical Society of Michigan. While serving as Interim CEO of MSMS Doctor George will continue practicing on a limited part-time basis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FuZGVybmV3c3Jvb20uY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvNy1pbXBvcnRhbnQtaW52ZW50aW9ucy10aGF0LXlvdS1kaWRudC1rbm93LWNhbWUtZnJvbS13ZXN0LW1pY2hpZ2FuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Important Inventions That You Didn't Know Came From West Michigan - The Gander,"Necessity may be the mother of invention but these inventions were born right here in Michigan.

MICHIGAN—Curious about the Edisons and Gutenbergs of Michigan? Here are some of the most famous inventions to have come from the west side of the Mitten:

Pop-Tarts (1964)

Inventor: Bill Post

(Evan-Amos via Wikimedia Commons)

Most Michiganders already know that Battle Creek is the Cereal Capital of the world for its ties to Kellogg’s. But many often overlook the fact that Pop-Tarts were also invented by a Michigan man: Bill Post of Grand Rapids. He celebrated his 95th birthday this year.

In the 60s Post—who was then the plant manager for Keebler—got a call from Kellogg’s to help them create a breakfast food that could be made in a toaster. Post reportedly took four weeks to troubleshoot the issue before he cracked the code ultimately figuring out a process for how to put thin sheets of dough and frosting through a 300-foot oven without melting.

The Cleveland market tested Pop-Tarts in shopping malls at first but then shifted marketing to children. They were an instant hit—and today still remain a national breakfast mainstay.

Fun fact: Post is said to enjoy his own invention. He prefers frosted strawberry untoasted.

Snowboard (1965)

Inventor: Sherman Poppen

(Lar via Wikimedia Commons)

Michigan truly is a winter wonderland—so it shouldn’t be shocking that it’s home to one of the most popular winter sports of all time: snowboarding which was born in Muskegon.

Now known as the “grandfather of snowboarding” Sherman Poppen reportedly came up with the initial concept for the snowboard the “Snurfer” on Christmas Day back in 1965.

As the story goes Poppen’s wife was only a few days shy of giving birth to their third daughter—and she desperately needed a break from a house full of energetic girls. So Poppen took his daughters on a trip to the sand dunes behind their Muskegon home.

The snow was too thin for sledding so Poppen bolted together snow skis into a makeshift board. The girls ended up having a blast on the invention which they named the “snurfer” for a combination of snow and surf. And Poppen decided to take the board to market.

Brunswick Corp. bought the patent from Poppen—and sold more than a million boards. Poppen also stayed involved in his newly created sport organizing the first snurfing competition at Blockhouse Hill now a part of Muskegon State Park in 1968. It attracted the attention of people like Jake Burton Carpenter who went on to found Burton Snowboards.

Others improved on Poppen’s snurfing design with bindings and steel edges for traction but Poppen is still regarded as its original inventor—for without snurfing there’s no snowboarding. Poppen died in 2019. His daughter Laurie Poppen still lives in Michigan.

Cat Litter (1947)

Inventor: Edward Lowe

(Courtesy/Edward Lowe Foundation)

Any Michigander who owns a cat owes some gratitude to this next inventor—for without his accidental invention in the winter of 1947 it’s likely your house might not smell too pleasant.

Back then cats were mostly kept outside. And when necessary people used ashes dirt or sand indoors as the absorbent material to soak up their urine. It was a messy business.

Cassopolis resident Edward Lowe was working at his father’s sawmill when his neighbor asked for some sand to use as cat litter. Instead Lowe gave her a bag of kiln-dried granulated clay—used to mop up grease spills—that he happened to have in his trunk.

The neighbor came back a few days later eager for more clay and Lowe decided to take his product to market branding it in five-pound sacks. He even first coined the term “Kitty Litter.”

Throughout the 50s and 60s Lowe toured pet shows across the country to promote his product. Eventually it found its way into supermarkets and quickly became a household staple for all cat owners—perhaps contributing to the popularity of cat ownership nationwide. In 1985 cats officially passed dogs as the most popular American pet for the first time.

Edward Lowe Industries eventually expanded in 1964 to include the Tidy Cat brand—and by the 90s his company was the leading producer of litter box filler nationwide. Lowe ultimately sold his operation to the Ralston Purina Company for $200 million before he died in 1995.

Cast Saw (1947) and Electric Hospital Bed (1958)

Inventor: Homer Stryker

Notable Western Michigan University alumnus Homer Stryker was many things—a teacher an orthopedic surgeon a businessman a US Army veteran and of course an inventor.

Stryker was born and raised in Kalamazoo County where he stayed most of his life. After teaching in the Upper Peninsula serving in the US Army during World War I and graduating from the University of Michigan Medical School he opened his own practice in Kalamazoo.

During his career Stryker noticed that certain orthopedic procedures were simply not working for his patients and he began working on a turning frame for hospital beds to reduce incidences of bedsores as well as a new rubber heel for walking casts. The US Army was interested in Stryker’s inventions and bought several of his turning frames during WWII.

From there Stryker shifted more from practice to invention starting the Orthopedic Frame Company which would eventually be called the Stryker Corp. His next big invention: The Stryker saw which would be used to cut both casts and bones and assist with autopsies.

Stryker passed away in 1980 but the Stryker Corporation and the Stryker family still call the Kalamazoo region home. Today the company is one of the world’s leading medical technology companies reporting $17.1 billion in sales and 46000 employees in 2021.

Stryker Field at the Mayor’s Riverfront Park in Kalamazoo is also named in Stryker’s honor.

Canned Baby Food (1928)

Inventor: Daniel Frank Gerber

(ParentingPatch via Wikimedia Commons)

The Fremont Canning Company formed in 1901 to fill an important niche for Michigan’s Fruit Belt—canning berries beans peas and other produce for local farmers. But it took 26 years before its founders found their most lucrative calling: Making canned food just for babies.

In 1927 Daniel Frank Gerber made the discovery that would change his family’s company forever. At the time his infant daughter had fallen ill and required a specialized diet—which then required more expensive ingredients and laborious cooking and straining methods.

Frustrated with the inconvenience Gerber got to work at his canning company to research ways to create a healthier—and less time intensive—canned diet for his daughter. The company was already making similar products for adults. Gerber shifted the demographic.

The first baby food products included health-focused options like carrots spinach peas prunes and beef vegetable soup. The company also marketed the products nationwide—including popular placements in magazines like Good Housekeeping. And that now ubiquitous sketch of an infant which became known as the Gerber Baby was born.

The Fremont Canning Company officially changed its name to the Gerber Products Company in 1941 and expanded its product line to include baby bottles pacifiers and even life insurance. Gerber moved its operations out of Michigan entirely by the 1990s but Fremont still celebrates the Gerber heritage with a National Baby Food Festival.

Today Gerber still produces about 60% of the prepackaged baby food sold in the US.

Synthetic Penicillin (1957)

Inventor: John Sheehan

John Sheehan was born and raised in Battle Creek with a well-known family in the area.

His father was a writer and editor for The Battle Creek Enquirer and his mother was a popular genealogist in the area. And as a child Sheehan struggled with pneumonia and mastoiditis—infections which were only made worse by a lack of antibiotic treatment.

Sheehan studied chemistry at Battle Creek College and organic chemistry at the University of Michigan. After earning his Ph.D. in 1941 he quickly started working on antibiotics.

At the time natural penicillin took months to produce and the US government wanted to synthesize the drug especially for wounded soldiers on the battlefield in WWII. More than 1000 chemists had been recruited to help and none were successful before Sheehan.

In 1957 Sheehan was the first to discover how to re-assemble penicillin molecules—and his invention led to the manufacture of several tailor-made forms of penicillin like Ampicillin. Sheehan died in 1992 but his monumental contributions to the medical community live on.

Furniture Designs (Late 1800s)

Inventor: David Kendall

(Metropolitan Museum of Art via Wikimedia Commons)

You may be familiar with Ferris State University’s Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids. The school is named after furniture designer extraordinaire David Wolcott Kendall.

Kendall moved to Grand Rapids at the peak of its booming furniture industry in 1877—making stunning designs for multiple popular furniture manufacturers. During his career he was said to have been the most widely copied furniture designer in the US.

Kendall’s inventions—including wood finishes like Antique Oak Jacobean Sixteenth Century Early English and Cremona Malachite—helped to set national standards for the furniture industry. He also developed several important chair designs like the McKinley chair which got its name after President William McKinley had one put in the White House.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saW1lcmlja2xlYWRlci5pZS9uZXdzL3Nwb25zb3JlZC1jb250ZW50Lzk2NzgxMy9zdHJ5a2VyLWFuZC1saW1lcmljay1jZWxlYnJhdGluZy1hLXN0b3J5LW9mLXN1Y2Nlc3MtYW5kLWlubm92YXRpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stryker and Limerick: Celebrating a Story of Success and Innovation,"Stryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies.

IBM updates its Turbonomic Application Resource Management and Instana Observability software to help organizations manage application performance and energy and costs to accelerate sustainability initiative progress

In a constantly evolving business environment many organizations are struggling to deliver on elevated customer expectations while navigating the challenges of skilled labor gaps digital disruption and increasingly complex IT environments.

With more people leaving the workforce companies lack the staffing required to manage these environments and scale them by traditional means. To bridge this gap organizations are turning to new digital solutions like automation technology to better leverage their existing talent.

Indeed the IBM Global AI Adoption Index 2022 which was commissioned by IBM in partnership with Morning Consult found that 30% of global IT professionals surveyed stated they have already implemented AI and automation software helping their employees save time. For example organizations including BBC Studios and ExaVault are leveraging solutions like AIOps and observability to more deeply understand the data around their IT operations.

To further help organizations proactively manage their IT resources in a cost-effective manner we are announcing important updates to two of our key offerings: IBM Turbonomic Application Resource Management and IBM Instana Observability. These software offerings are part of IBM's end-to-end portfolio of intelligent automation solutions for business and IT with many of the solutions developed by IBM Research.

IBM Turbonomic Increases Visibility into Sustainability of IT Resources

As COP27 comes to a close this week organizations are looking with renewed focus at using technology to align sustainability goals with business objectives – an area where IBM has been investing across our broader portfolio. As part of this focus IBM is announcing new capabilities to help CIOs and IT teams take a more active role in helping their organizations operationalize sustainability.

The new updates to IBM Turbonomic software provide organizations with near real-time visibility of the direct energy and emissions impact of data center resources to help them manage energy consumption. IBM Turbonomic takes a top-down approach to “stitch” together resources such as memory CPU and storage so that applications only consume the resources needed.

The newly released IBM Turbonomic sustainable IT dashboard provides organizations with visibility into both energy consumption and the estimated emissions of data center operations. It also provides actionable insights on how IT decisions could potentially impact these factors so different options can be benchmarked and prioritized through an environmental sustainability lens. With this operational-level data at their fingertips IT professionals can make meaningful contributions to the organization’s sustainability targets supporting environmentally sustainable business growth.

The new Turbonomic capabilities can further facilitate a companys sustainability initiatives by connecting and feeding data to the IBM Envizi ESG Suitegiving them insight as to how their IT decisions intersect with their sustainability goals and reporting. Envizi automates the collection and consolidation of more than 500 data types and supports major sustainability reporting frameworks. These technologies are part of IBM’s broader sustainability portfolio which is designed to help organizations take a data-driven approach to operationalize sustainability efforts across their business.

In a Forrester Total Economic Impact Study  Forrester illustrates how IBM Turbonomic can help cut cloud spend by 33% reduce data center refresh costs by 75% and provide the ability to get back 30% of engineering time with smarter resource management.*

Help Applications Run Optimally with IBM Instana Observability

Application errors can often cause more than headaches for IT; software problems can easily impact customer experience and ultimately the business. Teams need a way to find the root cause of problems and quickly resolve them. That’s where observability can help and it goes beyond just simply monitoring applications. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong while observability can tell you what’s happening why it’s happening and how to fix it.

IBM Instana is a robust observability solution that helps organizations track IT performance and resolve incidents quickly. In the Forrester Total Economic Impact Study commissioned by IBM Forrester illustrates how IBM Instana can help an organization reduce mean time to resolution by 50% and can reduce time spent debugging applications by 75%.** IBM also is adding new capabilities around OpenTelemetry a vendor-neutral standard of tools and APIs for collecting accessing and transferring telemetry data including outputs from logs metrics and traces (ie: the “three pillars of observability”) to more deeply understand how applications are performing. With OpenTelemetry DevOps professionals can make informed coding decisions and adjust as their organization continues to change and grow.

We are also extending IBM Instana’s capabilities around synthetic monitoring which is essentially the ability to measure your users’ perceived application performance. Synthetic monitoring will help in indicating when there are network problems between the end user and backend services.

Organizations can now also use IBM Instana to monitor applications on SAP Red Hat OpenShift IBM System z IBM Power IBM MQ IBM Db2 and more.

Organizations Globally Turn to IBM Software to Support Application Performance

Companies of all sizes across industries around the world are turning to IBM Instana and IBM Turbonomic to drive growth and cost savings in their digital transformations. Some prominent examples include BBC Studios Carhartt ExaVault J.B. Hunt Rabobank and Roma Capitale .

Major broadcaster BBC Studios is using IBM Turbonomic to simultaneously minimize cost and assure application performance of their on-premises environment of 1000 virtual machines (VMs). The team began by manually running Turbonomic’s resizing recommendations significantly reducing the number of end-user complaints and eliminating downtime in the process. Once they saw the results of manual resizing the team automated scheduled resizing on a select set of mission-critical applications proactively and holistically assuring application performance.

""Because we are able to rely on IBM Turbonomic’s intelligent automation to assure application performance 24x7 our team can now focus their efforts on pursuing strategic initiatives rather than fighting fires"" said Porsche Waddell Server and Storage Manager BBC Studios.

ExaVault an organization whose solutions facilitate two billion file transfers per year is using IBM Instana to monitor API performance and for error tracking debugging and alerting. The most important metric ExaVault looks at on a day-to-day basis is latency. “We need to make sure that every customer is having a good experience” said Tom Fite Senior Backend Engineer at ExaVault. “If a customer is waiting more than a couple seconds they might leave.”

Since ExaVault started using Instana the mean time to resolution (MTTR) for customer-impacting bugs has dropped by 56.6%. In addition the platform’s slowdowns and downtime have decreased substantially. It was at 99.51% uptime before and it’s now at 99.99%. “We’re accomplishing the goal that we set out to do” said Fite. “The reason we were able to do that is we had better visibility into our problems.”

At IBM we believe that organizations will increasingly turn to intelligent automation to address the industry-wide gaps in skilled labor supply chain disruptions increasing customer expectations and complex operating environments that are pressing on today’s ever-expanding IT and business landscapes.

Secured credit cards might not get as much attention as lucrative rewards credit cards but they play a crucial role in the world of credit cards — offering credit to those with lower credit scores or no credit history. If your credit could use some work you shouldn’t settle for just any secured card. Like any category of credit cards secured credit cards aren’t created equal.

In this battle of secured credit cards we’ll look at some of the best secured credit cards on the market and compare them to find the winner.

Let the battle begin.

Picking contenders for the battle of secured credit cards

Not all secured credit cards have made it to our battle. That doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with them. For instance the Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card is a solid secured card that can help a cardholder create a relationship with one of the top card issuers and the same applies to the Citi® Secured Mastercard®.

However the credit card market is becoming more and more competitive. Today many top secured credit cards offer rewards — and these are the credit cards that we’ll take a look at. After all why solely build credit when you can build credit and earn cash back?

It’s also important to mention that all of the secured credit cards competing in our battle don’t charge annual fees (and we recommend staying away from secured cards that do). Plus our contenders all offer free credit-tracking tools to help you monitor your progress.

Without further ado here are our contenders:

First round: Amazon Prime Secured Card vs. Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards Secured Card

In the first round we’re going to take a look at two secured cards that offer rewards but come with certain requirements or limitations such as membership requirements or limited card acceptance. The Amazon Prime Secured Card and the Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards® Secured Card both offer rewards and require a membership to be eligible to apply.

The Navy Federal Secured card earns 1X points on all purchases and rewards can be redeemed for cash back merchandise or gift cards. The card requires a minimum deposit of at least $200 which then serves as your credit line. The credit union will review your account for a higher credit limit after three months with the card and it’ll consider an upgrade to an unsecured credit card after six months. There’s no annual fee and other common credit card fees are quite low: The card only charges up to $20 in late or returned payment fees.

All of this is great news for credit builders. There’s only one catch: You’ll need a Navy Federal Credit Union membership to apply for this card. Unlike some other credit unions Navy Federal doesn’t offer an option to make a small donation to become a member. To be eligible for a membership you must be a current or retired armed forces member or have one in your immediate family. Membership is also available to Department of Defense civilian employees.

The Amazon Prime Secured Card also requires a membership to earn rewards. This membership however is much more accessible — the card earns 2 percent back on all Amazon purchases if you’re an Amazon Prime member. It’s also a very affordable card. The minimum security deposit must be at least $100. There’s also no annual fee (but you’ll need to pay for a $139 Amazon Prime membership) and the late fee is only $5.

On top of those benefits the regular fixed APR is just 10 percent meaning it doesn’t change based on the prime rate which is a rare feature. As for graduating to an unsecured card you may become eligible for the unsecured Amazon Store Card* or Amazon Prime Store Card* after 12 months of responsible card use and credit building.

The only caveat is that you can only use the Amazon Prime Secured Card at Amazon.com and physical Amazon stores. That’s rather limiting but luckily Amazon sells just about everything. For that reason we’re giving this round to the Amazon Prime Secured Card. Overall the Amazon Prime Secured Card is much more accessible and offers great value but if you’re able to qualify for the Navy Federal Secured card that’s still an excellent option.

First-round winner: Amazon Prime Secured Card

Qualifier: Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards Secured vs. Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards Secured

Bank of America currently offers three secured credit cards but only two have made it to our battle since they offer rewards — the Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards Secured Credit Card* and the Bank of America® Unlimited Cash Rewards Secured credit card*. Now it’s time to set these two contenders against each other to pick one to compete in the second round. Both of these cards are secured versions of unsecured Bank of America credit cards with identical rewards systems.

The Customized Cash Rewards Secured earns 3 percent cash back in the category of your choice (choose from gas online shopping dining travel drugstores or home improvement) and 2 percent cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs. All other purchases earn 1 percent back. Note that 3 percent and 2 percent categories are limited to the first $2500 in combined spending per quarter. The rewards structure on the Unlimited Cash Rewards Secured is much simpler: You’ll earn 1.5 percent cash back on all purchases.

The cards share similar terms however. The minimum security deposit is $300 and Bank of America will periodically review your account to determine whether you may qualify to have it returned. The variable APRs are the same at 23.99 percent and both cards offer similar benefits like access to your FICO score. The difference then lies in the value these cards provide.

Consider this scenario: Say you spend $15900 per year on the Customized Cash Rewards Secured which we consider the average annual credit card spend. You make a point to use the 3 percent category for dining and the 2 percent category for grocery stores. You spend $3600 on dining and $4700 on groceries annually. You’ll then earn $108 back in the 3 percent category $94 in the 2 percent category and $76 in rewards on the rest of your spending ($7600).

All in all you’ll earn $278 in cash back per year — even without working to maximize the 3 percent and 2 percent cash back categories. With the Unlimited Cash Rewards Secured and the same $15900 spend you’d earn $239 in rewards per year. We have a clear winner: the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards Secured.

Qualifier winner: Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards Secured

Second round: Discover it® Secured Credit Card vs. Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards Secured

Now that we have a contender from Bank of America — the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards Secured — we can set it against the Discover it® Secured Credit Card a secured card that’s long been considered the best offer in the secured card space. But will the Discover it® Secured Credit Card hold its top spot? Let’s find out.

The Discover it Secured Credit Card reigns supreme in the secured credit card market. For a while it was the only general secured credit card from a top issuer that offered rewards: It offers 2 percent cash back at gas stations and restaurants (on up to $1000 in combined purchases per quarter then 1 percent back) and 1 percent cash back on everything else. Additionally like other top rewards cards from Discover the Discover it Secured Credit Card matches all the cash back you earn during the first year.

To open the card you’ll need to put down a security deposit of at least $200 (maximum of $2500). Then Discover will review your account after seven months with the card to determine if you qualify for an upgrade to an unsecured card. The Discover it® Secured Credit Card also doesn’t charge an annual fee and it “forgives” cardholders for the first late payment (then up to $41). On top of that the card comes with a low intro APR of 10.99 percent on balance transfers for the first six months (27.49 percent variable after that) which is a great offer if you want to transfer a balance from a higher-interest card.

As far as secured cards go the Discover it® Secured Credit Card has been historically hard to compete with — until Bank of America’s secured cards entered the ring. As you can see the Discover it Secured offers some notable perks that the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards Secured doesn’t. Now let’s get to the important part: their value.

Let’s take the same scenario as before with $15900 in annual spend which includes $3600 on dining and $4700 on groceries annually. As you’ll remember we got $278 in annual cash back with the Bank of America Customized Cash. With the Discover it® Secured Credit Card you’ll easily maximize the 2 percent category due to the low quarterly spend cap ($1000).

Using our previous figures if you spend $3600 on restaurants annually (and no more than $1000 per quarter) you’ll earn $72 in cash back on those purchases. You’ll also earn 1 percent back on groceries or $47 in rewards and $76 on the rest of your spending ($7600) totaling $195 in yearly cash back. That’s not great news for the Discover it® Secured Credit Card. However it still has an ace up its sleeve — the CashBack Match bonus for the first year. Discover’s CashBack Match turns the $195 in rewards to $390 at the end of the first year. That’s $112 more than what we got with the Customized Cash in the first year.

The Customized Cash wouldn’t even catch up in the second year. After two years with either card and keeping the same spend the Customized Cash would earn $556 in rewards ($278 per year) and the Discover it® Secured Credit Card would earn $585 ($390 in the first year and $195 in the second year). After three years the Customized Cash would start offering you more in long-term value.

However remember that three years is a long time in the credit world. Hard inquiries fall off credit reports after one to two years old missed payments begin to carry less weight and credit scores will keep going up (if you’re managing your credit responsibly that is). If things go well after two years you may very well be able to upgrade your secured card to an unsecured rewards card. Considering this as well as the extra benefits that Discover offers the Discover it® Secured Credit Card wins this round.

Second-round winner: Discover it® Secured Credit Card

Final round: Discover it® Secured Credit Card vs. Amazon Prime Secured Card

We have made it to the final round of our battle with our two outstanding contenders: the Discover it® Secured Credit Card and the Amazon Prime Secured Card.

The Amazon Prime Secured Card has plenty to offer to cardholders who have a Prime membership. Amazon is convenient and offers just about any type of product. You can shop for groceries clothing household supplies electronics and much more — and earn unlimited 2 percent cash back.

Still the Amazon Prime Secured is a closed-loop retail card and you won’t be able to use it anywhere outside of Amazon. Staying tied to one merchant is rarely a good idea even a merchant as big as Amazon. You may end up missing out on better deals from other stores or find that a brand you love isn’t available on the site. Plus you’ll miss out on earning rewards on common expenses like gas and dining.

The card also won’t help you create a relationship with any of the top card issuers. The Amazon Prime Secured Card is issued by Synchrony Bank which is known for its co-branded store credits cards. The only way up from the Amazon Prime Secured Card is to the Amazon Prime Store Card which offers a generous 5 percent cash back on Amazon purchases — but it also only works on Amazon.

The Discover it® Secured Credit Card on the other hand can be used at any merchant that accepts Discover. And as your credit improves the issuer may be open to offering you an unsecured card such as the Discover it® Cash Back one of the best 5 percent rotating cash back cards or the Discover it® Miles a convenient flat-rate travel card. Considering all of this it’s clear that victory belongs to the Discover it® Secured Credit Card once again.

Final-round winner: Discover it® Secured Credit Card

The bottom line

All of our competitors are outstanding secured credit cards with excellent rewards systems no annual fees and credit-building tools. You can’t go wrong with adding any of them to your wallet if you’re looking to build credit. However the Discover it® Secured Credit Card still holds first place thanks to its cash back rates CashBack Match bonus intro APR offer (which is rare for this class of cards) and opportunity to create a relationship with one of the top credit card issuers.

Whichever secured credit card you choose make sure to use it as a tool to practice responsible card use and remember to be mindful about credit utilization (which is how much credit you’re using in relation to how much available credit you have). A low deposit may be attractive but if you’re trying to keep your credit utilization ratio under 30 percent to help your credit it may prove challenging. For example if your credit limit is only $200 you’d always have to keep your balance under $60.

However if you want to check out all of your credit card options head over to CardMatch. With this handy tool you can browse credit card offers matched to your credit profile. Checking for offers through CardMatch won’t hurt your credit and you’ll get offers you have a good chance of being approved for.

The basic physics of having too much heat trapped in too small a space is leading to tangible problems like consumer products that are too hot to hold. Far worse however is the loss of power and reliability as overheated DRAM has to continually refresh and chips become even more stressed in high-heat sectors such as automotive.

“In an ideal world you would have your die made of copper and your substrate would be 100% copper” said Nathan Whitchurch senior staff mechanical engineer at Amkor. “But even if you could you wouldn’t get any more performance because of some other limiting factors in the package.”

Thermal issues are becoming an earlier design and packaging decision in 2.5D and 3D packages. “Thermal dissipation is one of the key issues that we have to consider in memory on logic but also in logic on logic stacking said Yin Chang senior vice president of sales and marketing at ASE.

As the industry seeks solutions microfluidics and thermal interface materials (TIMs) are key areas of development. The former is seeing breakthroughs. The latter is making incremental improvements. To remove heat liquid coolers can be direct bonded to chips or channels can be built into the chips themselves. On the TIM side sintered silver epoxy is gaining use.

Microfluidics may soon make the transition to production. “I’m betting that microfluidics is going to start appearing beyond just the hyper exotic places especially if you start stacking high performance logic” said Rob Aitken distinguished architect at Synopsys. “If you don’t do anything about cooling then your stacked logic is limited to the thermal dissipation that a single die had. There’s a massive economic push to solve such problems. Given that and given people’s creativity I would bet that somebody will solve it in some clever way.”

Status of microfluidics

For the last 40 years commercial microfluidics technology has been just around the corner. The idea of embedding liquids in micro/nanoscaled channels to cool semiconductors was first described in a now-classic paper by Tuckerman and Pease in 1981.1 Variations have been tried ever since and now some projects are showing real and practical promise for cooling.

Two years ago a group from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland demonstrated a prototype that brought the cooling liquid as close as possible to the heat source. The design was a working version of an often-discussed microfluidics goal — integrating channels directly within a chip rather than relying on TIMs or bonding the latter of which makes the commercial market skittish due to reliability issues.

The Swiss team overcame the challenges by creating in the language of their paper “a monolithically integrated manifold microchannel cooling structure [in which] heat fluxes exceeding 1.7 kilowatts per square centimetre can be extracted using only 0.57 watts per square centimetre of pumping power.”2

The paper attracted interest from investors and their idea progressed from the lab into a start-up. Its first author Remco van Erp along with his EPFL professor Elison Matioli and COO Sam Harrison have co-founded a company called Corintis3 which has received funding from the Swiss government to create commercial versions of their innovation.

“From the thermal point of view Corintis’ approach is a very interesting cooling solution as the coolant can get as close as possible to the location of the heat sources and several thermal barriers can be eliminated in this configuration” said Herman Oprins principal member of technical staff at imec. But he cautioned that commercial adoption is not a given. “This is a disruptive cooling solution that requires a tight co-design between the fluidic channel structures and the electronic devices in order to achieve the full potential of this cooling method. It is very well suited for challenging applications with very high power densities such as the power bar structures shown in the paper. For CMOS applications with power densities in the range of several hundreds W/cm² separate cooling blocks with more relaxed channel diameters of several hundreds of µm could be used.”

Imec presented its own microfluidics prototype three years ago. Its press release describes the concept as “a Si microchannel heat sink assembled to a high performance chip for cooling the latter one. [It] achieves a low total thermal resistance of 0.34K/W to 0.28K/W at less than 2W pump power.”4

“We have two main types of prototypes” Oprins explained. “One is the silicon microchannel cooler. There the main development is the bonding to the chip with low thermal resistance. The second one is the direct liquid cooling on the chip using 3D printed cooling geometries in complex shapes.”

While the imec efforts have not yet been commercialized companies already are offering similar designs according to Oprins.

Describing the origin of the imec prototype Oprins said “We leveraged our knowledge of wafer-to-wafer bonding to bond the cooler to the chip with a very low thermal resistance of less than 1 mm2-K/W. Thus instead of using a thermal interface material we can use fusion bonding or oxide bonding or metal bonding. The main advantage for semiconductor processing is that there could be strict tolerances with a very thin line.”

Oprins points to several issues. “For the mechanical integrity of your package you need to compensate for the absence of the lid with a stiffener ring” he said. “If you make the channels too small the pressure drop that you need to push your coolant through will be too high. You’re limited how small you can go with the liquids.”

However he noted that while higher pressure is a potential drawback it is not a show-stopper. “The main reasons for slow adoption are reliability concerns (leaks) the need for maintenance and system complexity.”

Oprins classified the current and proposed commercial approaches to liquid cooling into four distinct types:

Bolt-on cooler . This is the current state-of-the-art in data centers. A cold plate sits on top of the lid instead of a heatsink. TIMs are used above and below.

. This is the current state-of-the-art in data centers. A cold plate sits on top of the lid instead of a heatsink. TIMs are used above and below. Directly bonded cooler . This configuration is beginning to be adopted in some places. The cooler is directly bonded to the chip with only one layer of thermal interface material. Imec’s prototype uses this layout with modifications.

. This configuration is beginning to be adopted in some places. The cooler is directly bonded to the chip with only one layer of thermal interface material. Imec’s prototype uses this layout with modifications. Backside cooling. Only presented in research this layout allows the coolant to be closer to the heat source. Instead of bonding it uses a dielectric liquid that makes direct contact to the chip. Because there is a vertical connection between the liquid and the chip it avoids the thermal gradient problems of a lateral design.

Only presented in research this layout allows the coolant to be closer to the heat source. Instead of bonding it uses a dielectric liquid that makes direct contact to the chip. Because there is a vertical connection between the liquid and the chip it avoids the thermal gradient problems of a lateral design. In-chip cooling. This is the idea that Corintis is trying to commercialize. The coolant is contained within channels embedded in the chip. While it can offer optimal cooling one potential challenge is that there may not be enough space for channels at lower pitches.

In addition to this work Sam Sadri senior process engineer at QP Technologies recently showed off a prototype of an internally cooled package. Created with 3D technology it’s made of ceramic alumina that uses thick-film technology for top metallization onto which several SiC FETs will be attached.

“Alumina is already an oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) and copper oxidizes easily so the two oxides bond together and that’s how this interface is made” Sadri explained. “This is by far the cheapest way to build a power module with a ceramic. There are ways to further reduce the cost. An isolated metal substrate (IMS) basically is like any PCB fabrication technology but it uses heavy copper. While most PCB copper contains 0.25 to 0.5 ounces of copper this is closer to 3 or 4 ounces. This is what I’ve seen as far as something that’s more cost effective than alumina with the same footprint.”

The prototype’s dimensions are approximately 4″ x 2 ½” x ¾” deep. While it’s thicker than a typical substrate what makes this rectangular structure special is that it has channels that tunnel all the way through with exit holes on its shorter sides. “This is one of the coolest things I’ve seen in power” said Sadri. “When you power it up to full duty cycle the module puts out a lot of heat. How do you get rid of the heat? You send a coolant such as cold air nitrogen coolant or some other cold substance through the channels. As it is operating it’s also cooling down too.”

Improving TIMs

As shown above both bolt-on coolers and directly bonded coolers use TIMs to optimize heat conduction between the chip and cooler as do many other configurations. TIMs use a wide variety of materials that can include “thermal greases gap fillers insulating hardware materials thermal pads and films graphite pads and films thermal tapes phase change materials and thermal epoxies [as well as] thermally conductive ceramics e.g. aluminum oxide aluminum nitride and beryllium oxide” according to a recent review of cooling systems.5

Yet many TIMs turn out not to be as efficient as their widespread use would suggest. “Thermal interface materials become an important thermal bottleneck as the liquid cooling performance improves” said Oprins. “The system integrators have a lot of questions about how TIMs can be replaced by better performing materials and what the reliability risks are.”

The challenge is to discover a material that has very high thermal conductivity while at the same time being very pliant and soft so it can follow the topology of different components.

“Typically most materials that have good conductivity are also very rigid so not only will they not conform they can add to the stresses” Oprins explained. “You’re looking for a combination that’s difficult to find. So there will be no single material that will have these properties. Researchers will have to engineer one by making composites. For example instead of just using a silicone paste like in the past now there can be thermally conductive particles inside to increase the thermal performance. There can be composites. There even could be carbon nanotubes or graphene sheets. There’s a lot of advancement in that particular area. We started with the silicone based materials and eventually we will end up with metal-based thermal interface materials but there are a lot of reliability issues to be solved first.”

Given the urgent need for novel materials Amkor’s Whitchurch emphasized that all engineers should respect how crucial material science breakthroughs will be to solving thermal problems — and that the industry has a long way to go to find materials that can be flexible reliable and economical.

“We’re exploring many different TIMs which are no longer polymer-based” he said. “Things that used to be exotic are becoming less so like the sintered silver category and you end up with a very hard high thermal conductivity matrix of a silver alloy between lid and die. Another example would be softer metal materials such as ones based on indium. Gallium scares people because it reacts with aluminum so we haven’t seen as much of that kind of environment. A couple years ago we were talking frequently about phase change material but that seems to have died off as people realized the reliability and other advantages just weren’t there. The other things that I’ve seen like graphite pads they also have some engineering challenges that are too difficult to overcome. Graphite in a single direction is highly thermally conductive but actually getting that into a package is a difficult challenge.”

To get rid of the power in a flip chip package Sadri said “Traditionally a back side metallized SiC power FET die is attached to a heatsink using solder (e.g. AuSn). Today sintered silver epoxy has shown better thermals so folks use both pressureless (e.g. Atrox) or pressured sintered epoxy (Argomax). In a flip chip scenario a heatsink is designed with nickel-plated copper which kisses the back of the chip with thermal interface material (TIM) in the interface. Other innovations use a number of wires in the back of the chip and then land the wires on a ground plane in the PCB to improve thermals. Copper-tungsten and copper-moly are other types of heat sinks that folks like for the CTE match to silicon but they are expensive. Copper is still the best thermal interface and very cost effective.”

An alternative approach would eliminate the need for TIMs altogether which is one of the motivations behind imec’s work on microfluidics. “You want to find alternative cooling solutions so you can avoid the interface materials so that’s what we’re doing with the liquid cooling” said Oprins. “We want to bring it closer to the chip so we can eliminate these materials. I would say that’s the bottom line. You either improve the materials or you get rid of them.”

Conclusion

The result of these challenges is that solving thermal problems has increasingly moved up the list of budget priorities. “Customers are often surprised that they have to dedicate so much budget to thermals” Whitchurch said. “But in order for a package to simply work we’re all going to have to pay attention because ultimately a package that works is cheaper than a package that doesn’t work. We’re starting to see a lot of our customers come to those realizations and start to engage our more advanced engineering skill and experience for products that 10 years ago would never have shown up on my radar.”

Still change takes time. “The industry is very conservative” Oprins said. ”It takes a lot of convincing to switch to something they don’t know. Everything you introduce comes with a lot of complexity. I understand the reluctance to adopt something new until it’s proven to have worked and all the liability issues have been tackled. Nevertheless there are many great ideas out there. We know they still need a lot of work and we are looking for new recruits who can help.”

Bosworth pastor of Abundant Life Church at East 82nd Street and Hague Road has a tradition of helping in the kitchen every time Luciana’s opens a new location.

And it’s about to open its sixth—this one near the intersection of 96th and Meridian streets.

Bosworth is the grandfather of 7-year-old Luciana Bravo namesake of the restaurant founded by Alberto Bravo Bosworth’s son-in-law and Sarah Bravo Bosworth’s daughter.

And while Bosworth holds an informal “good luck” role in the company other family members are full-time staff members. Two of Alberto’s brothers David and Daniel manage Luciana’s locations. Debbie Bosworth Peter’s wife and Sarah’s mother works as operations manager for the business that launched in 2015 with a Broad Ripple restaurant.

Debbie Bosworth who previously managed employee scheduling and payroll for Indiana University Health North Hospital became a Luciana’s employee after Alberto and Sarah opened their second restaurant in the Clearwater Crossing shopping center in 2016.

“I believe in my family more than anything” Bosworth said. “When they called me I said ‘OK.’ I have no regrets.”

The newest location is expected to open early next year.

Kelli Ibanez co-owner of Fishers-based Libertad Properties and the broker who works with Alberto Bravo when he seeks new spots for restaurants said she believes in the potential of the 96th and Meridian building where Paradise Bakery & Cafe and Newk’s Eatery once served customers.

“I think that’s a location that needs high-quality Mexican food” Ibanez said. “I think you’re pulling from a lot of different areas. It’s right on the border of Carmel and Indianapolis. I think it’s perfectly centrally located.”

And Bravo 39 is building a reputation for making Luciana’s sites successful after other restaurants didn’t stick around. At each of the six locations more than one dining concept came and went before Luciana’s opened.

A native of Mexico who moved to Indiana as a teenager Bravo said he relies on intuition when deciding where Luciana’s should expand.

“It’s just a feeling that I get” Bravo said. “I could go with one of my managers to a place and they might say ‘Oh this is a great location.’ But if I don’t feel it I say ‘I don’t think this is going to work.’”

Ibanez said Bravo is unlike any of her other clients.

“I have shown him a lot of different properties over the years” she said. “If he doesn’t feel it we just walk away. I’ve grown to trust him.”

Luciana’s employs more than 130 people and another 30 are expected to be hired for the 96th and Meridian location. Husband-and-wife team Alberto and Sarah invested their personal savings to launch the fifth Luciana’s a Traders Point location that opened in February 2020 less than a month before pandemic stay-at-home orders were issued.

Alberto said Luciana’s locations made it through the pandemic because of support from customers and employees.

“I’ve listened to what my instincts tell me and it’s worked out so far” he said.

Take the Luciana’s Clearwater Crossing location which he’d been eyeing before he stepped inside the door six years ago.

Although restaurants Uno Chicago Grill Oobatz! and Amazing Joe’s Steak House had cycled through the building east of the White River on East 86th Street Bravo said the location was ideal for the second Luciana’s.

“I had customers tell me ‘This place is cursed. Nothing makes it here’” he said. “I still did it. I know what we have. I know what we can do. I think wherever we go we’re going to make it happen.”

Luciana’s in Columbus and Greenwood followed in 2017 and 2018 respectively.

A dream realized

Mexican cuisine defined by ingredients such as beans rice tomatoes cheese and avocados is a substantial and growing segment of the restaurant industry—and that growth doesn’t appear to be slowing down.

According to analytics company Brizo FoodMetrics more than 73000 Mexican restaurants operated in the United States at the end of 2020. That number represented 11% of all U.S. restaurants.

In a report this June market research company Technavio projected that the Mexican food market will grow globally by $113 billion from 2021 to 2026. North American countries Mexico Canada and the United States will account for 58% of the market’s growth during that time frame.

Alberto Bravo’s history with Mexican restaurants began when he worked at one in Brownsburg. He then was hired as a server and eventually became manager at a La Hacienda restaurant near the intersection of East 71st Street and Binford Boulevard.

Peter and Debbie Bosworth dined at La Hacienda twice a week and Debbie once used tableside small talk to pose a crucial question to Alberto.

“I asked him ‘What are your goals? What are your dreams for your future?’ He said ‘Someday I would like to have my own restaurant’” Bosworth said.

Sarah who attended Lawrence North High School and has a career as a sign language interpreter met Alberto during one of her family’s visits to La Hacienda.

By 2015 the couple had married and become parents to Luciana who was an infant in a “pack and play” crib tucked behind the counter during the early days of the original restaurant.

Luciana now 7 is the older sister of 4-year-old Natalia and 2-year-old Cecilia.

“In order to be successful in life you need somebody to believe in you” Debbie Bosworth said. “You have to believe in yourself but you need someone to believe in you. Sarah believed in Alberto and his dreams. And then we as a family believed in him.”

Popular cuisine

Patrick Tamm president and CEO of the Indiana Restaurant & Lodging Association said Luciana’s thrives because of connections made with customers and the neighborhoods where the restaurants operate.

“The restaurant industry exemplifies where people with hard work and determination—and a lot of risk—can be successful” Tamm said. “That’s what is best about America.”

Tamm noted that family-owned restaurants faced daunting challenges during the pandemic but he said the businesses also displayed adaptability and perseverance.

“Great success isn’t dumb luck” he said. “It happens because of hard work.”

It also means knowing how to adapt to competition—and there is plenty of competition not just in the restaurant industry but in the Mexican specialty.

Down the street from the first Luciana’s at 1850 Broad Ripple Ave. are no fewer than seven Mexican restaurants:

◗ Caliente Mexican Grill 1035 Broad Ripple Ave.

◗ Chipotle Mexican Grill 1002 Broad Ripple Ave.

◗ Cholita Taqueria 1001 Broad Ripple Ave.

◗ Condado Tacos 838 Broad Ripple Ave.

◗ Crazy Tortas 825 Broad Ripple Ave.

◗ La Piedad 6524 Cornell Ave.

◗ Tequila’s Mexican Restaurant and Bar 801 Broad Ripple Ave.

Bravo said Mexican restaurants are so popular because they offer freshly prepared food affordability generous portions a festive atmosphere and the chance to sample a distinctive culture.

“I think competition is good” Bravo said. “It makes you look at yourself. ‘If I’m doing something that’s working what can I do to make it even better?’”

Staying selective

To be better Luciana’s focuses on quality.

The restaurant is a client of food distribution company Sysco. George Shrontz Sysco’s director of new business development in Indianapolis said Bravo has emphasized the importance of buying superior meat throughout Luciana’s history.

“There’s different levels of quality that customers can choose from and he tends to stick with the higher-quality products that are fresh” Shrontz said. “He’s not buying a bunch of frozen product and thawing it out.”

Bravo said he instructs his employees to love their customers and serve good food.

“We care about [customers] so much that we won’t compromise on food quality” he said.

Although his food costs recently have doubled Bravo said he strives to not pass along increases to customers.

“I understand our customers are paying more for everything” he said.

Still Bravo acknowledged that holding the line might not be sustainable and he expects to review prices in 2023.

“I don’t see things getting better” he said.

But he also knows that challenges lead to opportunities. He recalled a Cinco de Mayo celebration in 2020 when customers at the Greenwood Luciana’s did so much curbside business that police officers showed up to investigate a traffic jam.

Sure there have been some bigger deals in the third quarter for example Meati Foods grabbing $150 million for its mushroom root-based meat (still the best alternative protein food photo I have seen since I started covering this sector two years ago). Planted also took in $72 million for its whole cuts of vegan chicken and Oatside Singapore’s first oat milk product raised $65 million.

However for the most part investment has been down with PitchBook reporting last week that for the third quarter there was $2.7 billion injected into 269 deals. PitchBook considers “food tech” to include everything from plant-based products to grocery tech so it’s a pretty broad definition.

The data and research company noted that both investment values and count were down 63% and 28.5% quarter-over-quarter respectively. And “deal values declined for the fourth straight quarter falling to a 10-quarter low and to levels not seen since Q1 2020.” Ouch.

The Good Food Institute pulled out alternative protein deals and found that $420 million went into those companies during the third quarter. That’s down from $833 million in the second quarter and $911 million in the first quarter according to GFI’s analysis of PitchBook’s data.

While that might scare away some VCs others are sticking with it.

Elly Truesdell founder and managing partner at New Fare Partners said via email that some tech investors in the last decade overlooked some crucial fundamentals like taste brand and consumer trust when betting on food tech companies.

“The next generation of businesses that prioritize this and utilize tech to enable great food brand experiences and access to both have a stronger chance of seeing better outcomes” Truesdell added.

Meanwhile Lisa Feria partner and CEO at Stray Dog Capital said via email that “the same macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that are impacting the public markets and the global venture ecosystem are also driving the decline in foodtech venture funding.”

She noted that contributing to the sector’s decline over the past few years were factors like crossover investors who entered the space and then fled “due to the turbulence in the markets leading to an outflow of available capital.” In addition the food tech industry like so many others initially saw double-digit growth that then cooled off in the past year. There were also reports about major industry players that “led some to question whether innovations in plant-based meat alternatives will be able to deliver on the early promise that they could take a significant market share from traditional meat.”

Still Feria has “a very positive outlook” about this sector despite this investment setback. Part of that is due to what she said was an industry still very much in the “early innings in the development of innovative foods.”

“The alternative protein space has a ton of room to grow and we continue to see new products delivering amazing improvements on taste texture health and price” she added. “Ultimately the sustainability story that drives the need for food innovation is only going to be more important in the world’s fight against climate change as we cannot reach our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals without transitioning the food system away from animal agriculture one of the highest polluting and most destructive industries in the world.”

Weekly news

SAVRpak said it is working with Mexico’s first online supermarket Jüsto Partners for it to be the first to market with SAVRpak’s plant-based thermodynamic pouch designed to remove 50% of condensation which often leads to mold and early spoilage and keep new condensation from forming thus extending the shelf-life of produce like strawberries by up to three times Scott Nelson president of SAVRpak said via email. The company already works with food distributors like Sysco but on the customer retail side. “Jüsto is one of the first retail customers we can discuss publicly but we will be making more announcements soon as we have various pilots/trials ongoing across over 30 farms as well as grocers in the U.S. and Canada” Nelson added. “Consumers will start to see SAVRpak popping up in individual packaging of their favorite berries and greens at select supermarkets starting this spring and in January we’ll be announcing our consumer retail product with one of the largest big box retailers in the U.S.”

Other big news this week came from Upside Foods which announced alongside the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that its conclusions on if its cultivated chicken product was safe to eat warranted “no further questions.” This represents a milestone for the cultivated meat industry and prompted Upside founder and CEO Uma Valeti to say “Cultivated meat has never been closer to the U.S. market than it is today. This historic announcement from the FDA is the foundational step in the regulatory process.”

From Paul Sawers: “Meatable a VC-backed Dutch company that recently debuted its first product lineup in the form of synthetic sausages today announced a partnership with Singaporean food startup Love Handle to create what it touts as ‘the world’s first hybrid meat innovation center.’”

Israeli cultivated meat technology company Future Meat Technologies changed its name to Believer Meats saying that its rebranding represents “a big step in the broader strategic transformation of Future Meat into a technology-rooted food company as Believer prepares for its product launch.” The company’s technology is pending U.S. regulatory approval and expects to break ground on a commercial-scale production facility in the United States by the end of the year.

Plant-based meat brand Juicy Marbles known for making beef products like steak unveiled The Whole-Cut Loin a two-pound piece of 100% plant-based meat in what it is calling “the world’s largest piece of plant muscle.”

GOOD Worldwide acquired This Saves Lives a humanitarian snack brand co-founded by actress Kristen Bell Ryan Devlin Todd Grinnell and Ravi Patel. Financial details were not disclosed.

The FoodTech Challenge organized by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment Tamkeen and ASPIRE chose 12 finalists to participate in a six-week mentorship program. In early 2023 four startups will be selected to win the competition’s pooled prize of up to $2 million.

Eat Just’s cultivated meat division GOOD Meat debuted a new version of its cultivated chicken at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference also known as COP27. This is the first time in two years that the meat made from animal cells was showcased outside of Singapore according to the company.

Born of the necessity to provide affordable cell phone data plans without the shackles of a lengthy contract Mint Mobile went live one summer day about six years ago and has been steadily growing its subscriber base ever since.





Nominated for one of the best values in cellular connectivity Mint is constantly adjusting its pricing strategy to remain competitive no matter what changes the market brings so that its 5G unlimited plan prices stay roughly half of what you'd pay for a single line on the big three even with a contract.





It is very hard to beat Mint Mobile's unlimited 5G plan prices at the moment but the carrier offers even more affordable tiers for those who want to save further. Starting from just $15/month and topping out at $40/month for the unlimited plan barring the current 3-months-free holiday promo Mint beats each and every one of the US carrier's deals even those no-frills sans contract ones that they offer.





Mint Mobile holiday offers:













Mint Mobile makes it easy to get on the best 5G network in the US





Mint prides itself with eschewing the middleman and offering its plans directly to its customers which allows it to keep low overhead and cut costs transferring the savings to them. Its smart online-first strategy starts with probing your signal area as it is utilizing the widest and fastest 5G network coverage in the US that of T-Mobile  at a fraction of the price.









That is in stark contrast with most other MVNOs whose choices boil down to budget devices with entry level displays cameras and MediaTek processors. To top it all off Mint offers discounts on its phones too even though you are not signing up for a two- or even three-year contract like with the big three these days. Speaking of plans...





Mint's 5G unlimited plan prices are very hard to beat just as its 5G coverage





T-Mobile 's unlimited plan prices even Mint Mobile's highest tier is the negligible $40 a month and that's before the new subscriber promos or bulk purchases kick in. Coming in at roughly half of Verizon  AT&T or even's unlimited plan prices even Mint Mobile's highest tier is the negligible $40 a month and that's before the new subscriber promos or bulk purchases kick in.





Instead of stuffing in features you don't need or streaming services you won't use Mint gives you only what you'd really need such as unlimited minutes (to Mexico and Canada too!) texts and data all on America's 5G network with the biggest footprint.





If you expected to only get unlimited data and communication at that price Mint wanted to pleasantly surprise its customer base by also including the second most desired feature that cell phone plans can carry - wireless hotspot for data sharing - and include it in the plan price.





Mint vs T-Mobile unlimited 5G plan prices





Mint isn't afraid of a direct plan price comparison even with its T-Mobile network mothership. The virtual carrier keeps it simple as its direct-to-consumer business model allows it to give for $40/month what T-Mobile can't give for $50 namely unlimited text talk and 5G data speeds plus 5GB of full-speed wireless hotspot usage.





Given that T-Mobile is the more affordable 5G network provider out of the big three price comparison's with Verizon or AT&T's plans are skewed even further in favor of Mint. Even compared to fellow virtual carriers Mint Mobile is only challenged by Verizon 's Visible when it comes to holiday plan pricing for unlimited data but then again Verizon 's 5G network leaves a lot to be desired in comparison with Mint's plus the hotspot allotment there is throttled to 5Mbps from the get-go.







Saving the best for last: Mint Mobile's $15/month unlimited 5G plan price holiday deal





Besides the regular unlimited 5G plan subscription plan of $40/month Mint also offers one for $15 that gives you 4GB a $20 tier with 10GB as well as a $25 plan that offers 15GB that most US customers could be perfectly happy with considering the average data usage per person stats.













These are all somewhat mooted now by Mint's holiday unlimited 5G plan price offer of just $90 total for a bulk of six months basically knocking the value of a subscription to the largest 5G network in the US to the unbelievable $15 a month; then you can keep the same pricing by paying just $360 for a package of 12 more months. That's not even considering the family plan mix-and-match offers or the 6 free months of unlimited 5G service if you get a phone form Mint!









All in all be you a student just out of college or an affluent but value-conscious customer there is little to wonder about before choosing Mint as the easiest and most affordable way to gain access to America's best 5G network.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXh0dHYuY29tL25ld3MvdC1tb2JpbGVzLW5ldmlsbGUtcmF5LW9uLWZ3YXMtZmFsbG93LWNhcGFjaXR5LW1vZGVsLXRoZS1jb3N0LW9mLXNlcnZpbmctdGhvc2UtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWlzLWRlLW1pbmltaXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Knew? T-Mobile's Neville Ray Says Booming FWA Home Internet Biz Is Built on Spare Network Capacity - 'The ...,"T-Mobile has the fastest growing home internet solution in America right now with its 5G fixed wireless service taking on 578000 customers in the third quarter alone and quickly amassing a base of over 2.1 million users in just over a year.

According to T-Mobile CEO Neville Ray the entire enterprise is based on ""fallow capacity"" -- network wherewithal that's not already being tapped by the wireless company's mobile users.

“The incremental cost of serving those customers is de minimis"" Ray said Wednesday speaking at the Morgan Stanley European Technology Media & Telecom Conference. (A transcript provided by Seeking Alpha). ""And why would you sit on your hands on all of that capacity that you have no utilization for or line of sight to use? So we've created a huge business in the space which is just -- it's gone way better than we'd anticipated.”

So the cable industry which has watched its share prices crater as its once-incendiary collective broadband growth has come to a screeching halt is being taken to the woodshed by a wireless industry that's merely utilizing spare network capacity that's lying around?

Damn...

T-Mobile is looking to have as many as 8 million FWA customers by 2025. Ray said that T-Mobile makes ""protecting our mobile"" a priority vs. having to compete for network resources with FWA. But at that larger scale that could become challenging.

With that in mind Ray seemed to confirm recent speculation in wireless technology pubs that T-Mobile is looking to possibly exploit its prior investment into millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum to create an ""overlay"" network in order to serve two masters at once.

“Are there capabilities? Can we almost dumb down the radio environment and leverage for example millimeter wave to stretch the bounds of propagation there work on CPE the customer premise equipment and create a robust link for home broadband services there?” Ray asked.

At that point T-Mobile would find itself making an actual capacity investment into its FWA business. But if it were to keep right on growing the way it has been the opportunity might be worthwhile.

“Are there going to be opportunities for us to expand that business in different ways? We'll see” Ray added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vOXRvNW1hYy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xNy9vcGVuc2lnbmFsLWJyb2FkYmFuZC1pbnRlcm5ldC1jb21wYXJpc29uLXN0dWR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opensignal reveals how fixed broadband compares in real-world use for 25 US metros,"Known for its in-depth independent reports on wireless carriers’ networks that are based on millions of measurements Opensignal is out with its first study on how fixed broadband services compare in the US. Along with traditional providers Opensignal has included Verizon and T-Mobile’s 5G Home Internet services.

Opensignal normally provides a national score for providers in its cellular studies. However that doesn’t work when it comes to broadband.

“No broadband provider offers service to every home. As a result any national experience table will in practice miss the most important details for users comparing the broadband experience in their area. For this reason in this first report we have analyzed the real-world situation across all users’ plans in 25 major markets to assess the fixed broadband experience. We use metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) as definitions of each market — each centers around a large city or population center.”

Opensignal’s detailed US fixed broadband report features nine key overall findings and for each metro market the providers are rated on six metrics:

Broadband Success Rate

Broadband Consistent Quality

Broadband Video Experience

Broadband Download Speed

Broadband Peak Download Speed

Broadband Upload Speed

If they have an unlocked eSIM smartphone they can trial Verizon’s network for free over a 30-day period without any contractual obligations.

Verizon is following in the footsteps of T-Mobile which announced a testing deal via eSIM in late August. And AT&T has made a similar move with its Cricket prepaid service.

Carriers are jumping on the eSIM bandwagon at the same time Apple has made its new iPhone 14 eSIM-only.

Embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM) is already built into many smartphones and it’s the only SIM for the iPhone 14. eSIM makes it unnecessary to switch out physical SIM cards. When customers want to change service providers they can use software to make the switch via eSIM. They no longer have to visit a store or try to do it themselves with the pointy end of a paper clip.

For its part Verizon is calling its offer Verizon Test Drive.

It says potential subscribers can scan a QR code with their mobile phone to download the My Verizon app. Then they just need to follow a few steps to sign up for the program and activate an unlocked eSIM-capable smartphone.

During their 30-day trial there won’t be any disruptions to their existing service so they can go back to that if they want.

During the test with Verizon they’ll receive Unlimited domestic talk and text and up to 100 GB of 4G/5G data.

In a jab to its competitors Verizon said customers must check to make sure their phones are unlocked. “Some carriers make it hard to try other networks for fear you’ll never come back” said Verizon in its announcement today.

AT&T Assistant VP for device architecture Jason Sikes recently told Fierce ""This year was a huge huge step with the iPhone 14 being eSIM only. It is now without question front and center and so that has driven a lot of effort both on the technology side and the business side.""

Analysts will be watching the eSIM trend closely to see if it affects churn among the wireless carriers."

The Securities and Exchange Commission has collected a record $6.44 billion in disgorgement and penalties during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 up from $3.85 billion last year and easily surpassing the former record of $4.68 billion set in fiscal 2020. [Source]

The regulator raked in close to $4.2 billion in civil penalties nearly three times the $1.46 billion collected the previous fiscal year. However disgorgement totals were down for the third straight year to about $2.24 billion from nearly $2.40 billion in fiscal 2021 and $3.59 billion the year before that. In June 2020 the Supreme Court vacated a $26.4 million disgorgement fine levied by the SEC and limited the scope of what the regulator can demand via disgorgement. But the regulator has more than made up for that with increased penalties.

The SEC said it filed 760 enforcement actions in fiscal year 2022 up from 697 the previous year. Among the enforcement actions 462 were new or stand-alone enforcement actions up from 434 in fiscal 2021; 169 were follow-on administrative proceedings seeking to bar or suspend individuals from certain functions in the securities markets up from 143 the previous year; and 129 actions were against issuers allegedly delinquent in making required SEC filings up from 120 last year.

To deter future misconduct and enhance public accountability the SEC said it recalibrated penalties for certain violations included prophylactic remedies. It said for example that the more than $1.2 billion paid in penalties for recordkeeping violations alone “made clear that the fines were not just a cost of doing business.”

Among the higher profile cases for the regulator during the fiscal year it ordered financial services firm Allianz to pay more than $1 billion in penalties disgorgement and prejudgment interest over an alleged fraud that hid the huge risks of a complex options trading strategy. The SEC imposed a $200 million penalty against Barclays for an illegal over-issuance of securities. The $100 million penalty it imposed on Ernst & Young over admitted cheating by their audit professionals was the largest ever against an audit firm.

Fiscal year 2022 also saw the second highest total of SEC whistleblower awards in both the number of whistleblowers awarded and the total dollar amount. The regulator issued approximately $229 million in 103 awards. The Whistleblower Program also received a record of more than 12300 tips alleging wrongdoing during the fiscal year.

The SEC said it remains focused on enforcement in the crypto asset securities market. Earlier this year the regulator said it would nearly double the size of its Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit by adding 20 positions to the team.

It also said its attention is focused on environmental social and governance issues with respect to public companies and investment products and strategies. For example it charged BNY Mellon Investment Management for making materially misleading statements and omitting information about its consideration of ESG principles in investment decision-making for certain mutual funds.

However despite the record number of penalties taken in by the SEC the regulator said its desire is not to take in more money but for companies and investors to stop breaking the law.

“We don’t expect to break these records and set new ones each year because we expect behaviors to change” Gurbir Grewal the director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement said in a statement. “We expect compliance.”

Eisenhower kept a tight grip on his time. He asked his staff to separate requests that reached his desk into two categories — important matters and urgent matters. When asked about his strategy Eisenhower said ""What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.""

But if you tried to apply the Eisenhower matrix to a tall stack of current retirement surveys today you'd quickly find that American workers' important savings goals need urgent deliberate attention. Nearly seven in 10 American workers say they are not saving adequately enough for retirement according to the 2022 Global Benefits Attitudes Survey conducted by Willis Towers Watson.

In a separate survey T. Rowe Price found that the retirement savings gap in the U.S. is close to $4 trillion. For perspective U.S. workers' savings shortfall in terms of real dollars is about the same size as Germany's entire estimated economic output this year and the fourth largest in the world according to data from the International Monetary Fund.



Still the conversation between financial advisors and clients about how to prepare well for retirement extends beyond just savings metrics. It takes a clear understanding of how your clients envision their time in retirement: How are the people your clients care about the experiences they want to have in retirement and their values incorporated into your conversations with them about retirement? What makes your clients tick? And why would they be ticked off if the vision they have for retirement didn't materialize?

Eighty percent of American savers say they want help throughout retirement - in other words far beyond retirement itself according to data from BlackRock. Put another way clients want to know that you get them and can help them get to where they want to go with the people they love the experiences they want to have and supporting the values that make their journey meaningful.

Here are five steps to help clients retire on their schedule both when and how they envision it:

Help clients visualize retirement plans and progress.

Focus on big-picture goals for retirement.

Personalize retirement conversations.

Have clients ""meet"" the retiree version of themselves.

Plan for setbacks in retirement saving.



Help Clients Visualize Retirement Plans and Progress

Emily Balcetis associate professor of psychology at New York University suggests in her book ""Clearer Closer Better"" that there are certain perceptual habits and practices that when adopted can effectively help individuals reach their goals. For example when individuals click through financial apps and integrated software like MoneyGuide Pro and the Fidelity Retirement Score they can visualize and track their progress toward retirement savings goals.

As a consequence individuals are also more likely to stick with concrete savings strategies they can visualize. Visual tools allow you to ""see where you stand and how far you have to go at any moment that you log in rather than relying on your memory of your financial health"" says Balcetis.

While spending needs in retirement can vary based on lifestyle a reasonable goal is for the client to save enough to replace 60% to 80% of his or her pre-retirement work pay. To start the replacement conversation add the client's projected annual Social Security benefit (it's common for Social Security to replace about 40% of pre-retirement income) and pension amounts together. How closely do these benefits replace say 70% of the client's current pay? If there is a shortfall multiply this amount by 25 to arrive at a ballpark savings goal for retirement.

But what if the client is still in the early phase of his or her career and simply wants to get started on the right track? Fidelity suggests setting incremental goals of saving 1 times their current salary by age 30 3x salary by age 40 6x by 50 8x by 60 and 10x by 67.



Focus on Big-Picture Goals for Retirement

Another strategy that Balcetis recommends in her book is to ""widen the bracket"" for any goal in view. It's easy for clients to get distracted by short-term events such as a double-digit drawdown in the market. But what if you could shift your clients' focus to a fully digested financial plan that outlines important milestones such as how they can retire on time and also fund other priorities throughout retirement? These priorities might include travel experiences or long-term-care expenses later in life for example.

It's better to see the forest beyond just the trees. ""A wide bracket leads us to make decisions that better align with our long-term objectives and helps us avoid temptations that seem great now but which we'll regret later on. A wide bracket can also reveal broader patterns that are less apparent when we consider decisions or events in isolation"" Balcetis says.

Personalize Retirement Conversations

Discuss at length what or better still who the money is for in retirement. What do your clients want to do with their time in retirement? Where would they like to live and what are some places they would like to visit?

Also ask to what extent your clients want to support loved ones or charitable causes. Clarity on these issues can help you personalize retirement strategies for your clients. Retirement savers ""are looking for more focused personalization"" says Michael Doshier senior retirement strategist for T. Rowe Price. ""They are also looking for retirement savings to be put into context of broader financial wellness considerations.""

He adds that clients are ""seeking an answer to the specific question 'Where should I place my next dollar across retirement student loan debt emergency savings health care and general expenses?'"" and they are looking for this information to be delivered in a simple and integrated way that is easy to digest.

To enhance the personalization a bit further take inventory of your clients' specific retirement benefits at work and offer tax-smart alternative strategies to them where appropriate. According to a recent study conducted by AARP nearly 57 million American workers or 48% of U.S. private-sector employees ages 18 to 64 work for an employer that does not offer a traditional pension or retirement savings plan.

""The single biggest driver of the savings gap is access to workplace savings plans"" says Doshier.



Have Clients ""Meet"" the Retiree Version of Themselves

Research from UCLA's Anderson School of Management shows that financial choices can improve if savers reboot their vision of what they may look like in retirement. What age comes to your clients' minds when they think about the latter stage of retirement? Can they imagine living to 100?

Consider these figures: According to the U.S. Census Bureau there are over 90000 centenarians in the U.S. today; by 2060 this demographic is expected to reach about 600000 a growth rate of roughly 570%. Longevity is an important variable of a financial plan so any steps you can take to help your clients assemble priorities associated with living longer are helpful. For example taking into consideration out-of-pocket medical expenses or the desire to preserve their dignity as they age will lead to strategies that mitigate longevity as a potential blind spot in retirement.

Plan for Setbacks in Retirement Saving

Did you ever expect to see earnings expectations for global equities in the mid-to-high single digits? Recent capital-market assumptions from firms like Vanguard have lowered the bar for equity returns over the next decade due to a wide range of prevailing factors that transcend business cycles. These include an aging population and broader integration of technology within the workforce.

For example Vanguard's 10-year return projections for non-U.S. equities are in the range of 7.5% to 9.5% and somewhere between 4.7% and 6.7% for U.S. equities. Historically equities across the globe have provided investors with average returns in the 10% to 12% range.

Do lower capital-market assumptions preclude innovation and grit? No of course not. The market eagerly rewards companies that work a little harder – and more efficiently – than their peers. What the forecasts do signal however is that retirement savers need to be prepared for lower-than-average market returns.

According to T. Rowe Price 78% of American workers rely on their workplace for guidance on how to reach their lifetime financial goals. Given the current shortfall in retirement savings more work is required to help individuals prepare effectively for retirement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhyLWJyZXcuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi8xMS8xNy93YWdlLWdyb3d0aC1zdGlsbC1pc24tdC1lbm91Z2gtdG8tZmlnaHQtcGVyc2lzdGVudC1pbmZsYXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wage growth still isn't enough to fight persistent inflation,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.hr-brew.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /stories/2022/11/17/wage-growth-still-isn-t-enough-to-fight-persistent-inflation (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60F352AA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhyLWJyZXcuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi8xMS8xNy93YWdlLWdyb3d0aC1zdGlsbC1pc24tdC1lbm91Z2gtdG8tZmlnaHQtcGVyc2lzdGVudC1pbmZsYXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Popcore is viewed by Zynga as a ""leader in the puzzle genre"" with the Berlin-based studio having worked on chart-topping titles including Parking Jam 3D and Pull the Pin! – both of which were the most downloaded titles on the U.S. Apple App Store for a time.

Zynga said the deal will help establish Rollic as a leading hyper casual publisher while Rollic CEO Burak Vardal said Popcore's ability to experiment rapidly and implement nimble development practices will make the studio a perfect cultural fit.

""Combining allows us to build more gaming experiences that emphasize meaningful lasting engagement"" added Vardal. ""Furthermore our mutual user base with Popcore will represent a great combination of new players and long-term retaining users."""

Target said organized retail crime has led to more than $400 million in profit losses in 2022.

Organized theft has become a major problem for retailers due to the rise of e-commerce.

Target said it's increased anti-theft measures in stores and urged lawmakers to act on the issue.

Organized retail theft could become a $600 million problem for Target by the end of the year.

Executives from the Minneapolis-based retailer said Wednesday that they're seeing hundreds of millions of dollars in profit losses due to inventory shrink which is when stores have less product on their shelves than is recorded in their inventory. There are a number of causes for shrink — items breaking in store employee theft or even administrative errors — but Target blamed the losses on a primary cause: organized crime.

""Along with other retailers we've seen a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business"" Brian Cornell Target's CEO said during the company's third-quarter earnings call.

Missing inventory has reduced Target's gross margin by more than $400 million in 2022 compared with last year and Target expects those profit losses to grow to $600 million by the end of the fiscal year Target CFO Michael Fiddelke said.

Target isn't the only retailer dealing with a surge in organized shoplifting — it's become a nationwide problem. Retailers have begun sounding the alarm that theft is costing them millions every year driven by the ease of buying and selling things online.

Inventory shrink on the whole cost US retailers nearly $100 billion in 2021 and it was driven by theft: retailers surveyed by the National Retail Federation reported a 26.5% increase on average of organized retail crime.

The uptick in crime has led to both retailers and the government cracking down. In March California authorities arrested and charged nine people over allegations that they'd stolen $135000 worth of merchandise from a range of retailers including Macy's Columbia Sportswear Abercrombie & Fitch J.C. Penney and Lululemon.

And retailers across the country have started putting new anti-theft measures in place. At Home Depot certain power tools won't work if they're stolen from store shelves; at drugstores ""hot products"" are getting locked up to deter theft. In some cases stores are implementing controversial facial-recognition technology to scan and store shoppers' faces.

Target chief operating officer John Mulligan said during the call Wednesday that Target is putting measures in place at its stores to remedy the situation.

""It's obviously not something we like to do"" he said. ""It's far less convenient for guests as they shop our stores but we think we can manage that from a service perspective.""

Mulligan said while organized theft likely began in only some geographies ""we see those circles expanding and expanding and the impact continuing to grow.""

A Target spokesperson didn't share specifics on what measures Target is putting in place at its stores to prevent theft but said that the company is partnering with ""law enforcement legislators community partners and retail trade associations to address this growing national problem.""







The industry has long been urging federal legislators to help crack down on the trafficking of stolen goods. Dozens of retailers and industry groups — including Amazon Home Depot Lowe's Target Walmart and Walgreens — recently wrote a letter to congressional leaders urging them to pass legislation that would require online marketplaces to verify the identity of a third-party seller that sells a high volume of goods.

Fiddelke Target's CFO said Wednesday that ""Target strongly supports the passage of legislation to increase accountability and prevent criminals from selling stolen goods through online marketplaces.""

""This is an industrywide problem that is often driven by criminal networks and we are collaborating with multiple stakeholders to find industrywide solutions"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvd2FsbWFydC1hbmQtdGFyZ2V0cy1xdWFydGVybHktcmVzdWx0cy1sYXktYmFyZS1yZXRhaWxlcnMtZGlmZmVyZW5jZXMuaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzExLzE3L3dhbG1hcnQtYW5kLXRhcmdldHMtcXVhcnRlcmx5LXJlc3VsdHMtbGF5LWJhcmUtcmV0YWlsZXJzLWRpZmZlcmVuY2VzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart and Target’s quarterly results lay bare the retailers' stark differences,"Getty Images

Walmart 's stock surged this week. Target 's shares plunged. The rival big-box players are both known for selling an array of products including food clothing home goods and kitchen appliances. Both their CEOs — Walmart's Doug McMillon and Target's Brian Cornell — stepped into their roles in 2014. But the retailers issued starkly divergent outlooks this week that underscored their differences most notably in how much each relies on grocery sales. On Tuesday Walmart raised its financial outlook for the year after U.S. same-store sales in the third quarter rose 8.2% from a year ago when excluding fuel. A day later Target slashed its forecast for the holiday quarter after comparable sales rose just 2.7% with executives noting weakening trends heading into the season. Here's a rundown of four key factors that help explain the split in the earnings results:

Grocery routine vs. Occasional stop

Walmart gets a far bigger share of its sales from groceries than Target which is helping it draw shoppers looking to save money as inflation squeezes budgets. Groceries account for 56% of Walmart's annual revenue compared with just about 20% at Target according to company filings. Walmart is the country's largest grocer by revenue.

Target also sells groceries but it doesn't have the same breadth of offerings. For example stores sell eggs milk fruits and vegetables but do not have full-service bakeries meat and seafood counters or delis where shoppers can get freshly sliced turkey and cheese. More customers turn to Walmart to fill out the bulk of their grocery lists said Neil Saunders managing director of retail advisory firm GlobalData. By contrast shoppers tend to go to Target more for ""top-up shopping"" — grabbing a few food items when making a run for another reason such as picking up diapers. Even as shoppers decide not to buy a TV or a new outfit they have had to keep replenishing the food in their fridges — a factor that is keeping Walmart's sales steadier.

Low prices vs. Fun finds

Walmart is known for its mantra of ""everyday low prices"" and its focus on value has become synonymous with its name. Founder Sam Walton built the company on a no-frills approach aimed at making groceries and other products more affordable. As Americans increasingly watch their budgets the big-box retailer's reputation as a discounter is giving it an edge. And the company has flexed its ability to use its size and scale to keep prices low. Walmart's McMillon speaks often about the company being a price leader — and more recently an inflation fighter. For Thanksgiving the company said it would hold down the price of foods like turkey and ready-to-heat macaroni and cheese to last year's levels. The low prices are attracting new customers including more higher-income households. For the past two quarters the company said about 75% of its market share gains in groceries have come from households with an annual income of more than $100000 a year.

Planned purchases vs. Impulse buys

Target has turned its stores into mini malls offering a range of ""cheap chic"" items. It has launched exclusive private brands like All in Motion a trendy but lower-priced activewear brand and Hearth & Hand a home decor line created with celebrity home renovation duo Chip and Joanna Gaines. It also has shops for popular national brands including Disney Ulta Beauty and Apple. And it has a Starbucks where shoppers can grab a latte to sip as they browse. The assortment has led to jokes about ""Target runs"" where shoppers stop by for toothpaste but end up leaving with a lot more. About 21% of sales at Target come from unplanned purchases according to GlobalData research from before the pandemic. At Walmart the figure is about 12%. In an inflationary environment those shopping sprees – and impulse buys – become a tougher sell. ""People are starting to say 'Do I actually need this?'"" Saunders of GlobalData said. ""When people do that that affects Target more so than Walmart.""

The retailer which posted a 2.7 percent third quarter gain in its comps saw its store traffic increase 1.4 percent on top of a gain of nearly 13 percent in 2021. Target’s average ticket also improved 1.3 percent.

Comps broken out month by month show a 2.8 percent gain in August followed by a four percent increase in September. October proved challenging with same-store sales declining 0.9 percent. This occurred despite the Target Deal Days promotion run between October 6 and 8.

Target CFO Michael Fiddelke speaking yesterday on the company’s earnings call called it “notable” that there was a “dramatic change in the pace” of the chain’s sales in October.

“The month began with an initial round of holiday promotions from Target and some of our competitors. And in that week we saw a high single-digit increase in comp sales compared with last year” he said. “For the remainder of the month we saw a low single-digit decline in comp sales over those last three weeks. Nearly all of the slowdown was driven by our discretionary categories apparel home and hardlines as our guests became increasingly cautious in their spending in those categories at both Target and throughout the industry more broadly.”

Mr. Fiddelke said that Target has begun November with sales “trends consistent” with what the retailer saw at the end of October.

Target reported a 24.7 percent gross margin during the third quarter an improvement of over three points from the second quarter but “far short” of its goal. Mr. Fiddelke put most of the blame on consumers waiting for sales deals before they make a purchase. The retailer saw this trend intensify in the back half of October.

“While we anticipated a highly promotional environment this fall given the excess inventory we’ve been seeing across retail this enhanced focus on promotions reflects an increasing level of stress on consumers as they navigate through multiple headwinds including persistent inflation and rapidly rising interest rates” he said.

A second factor cutting into Target’s profits is shrinkage. The retailer said that it has seen its gross margin reduced by $400 million to date due to “inventory shortage” and expects that number to grow to more than $600 million by the end of its fiscal year."

GOLETA Calif. – Nov. 10 2022 ― Teledyne FLIR part of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated today announced its FLIR ONE® Edge Pro a wireless thermal-visible camera for mobile devices. Unlike previous models the reimagined FLIR ONE Edge Pro doesn’t need to be physically connected to its companion mobile device nor does it have separate models for specific operating systems providing maximum flexibility for thermal inspections.

“The FLIR ONE Edge Pro is the most versatile and advanced thermal-visible mobile camera yet thanks to its detachable form factor designed to fit comfortably in your hand. It offers significantly greater flexibility by eliminating the need for specific connection ports or operating systems” said Chris Bainter vice president of marketing and business development Teledyne FLIR. “In addition to the new hardware design Teledyne FLIR is providing more software tools to empower new and untrained users to conduct thermography inspections process images and create reports. Common uses range from building inspection and auto repair to industrial maintenance applications.”

Flexible Yet Rugged Design

The “RESNET” compliant and IP54-rated FLIR ONE Edge Pro has a spring-loaded clip designed to allow operators to attach the camera to many types of mobile phones and tablets. Thanks to the combined Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connection users can operate the Edge Pro up to 30 meters away from their mobile device providing the flexibility to effectively inspect hard-to-reach places or those scenarios requiring greater standoff distances to maintain operator safety.

Offering effective image quality and processing to deliver results the FLIR ONE Edge Pro features a 160×120 resolution radiometric Lepton® thermal imaging camera paired with a visible camera. Along with VividIR™ which combines multiple image frames to deliver one sharper final image the cameras are brought together via MSX®. The MSX patented image enhancement feature overlays the edge detail of the visible camera onto the thermal image without sacrificing any thermal data within the image providing greater context and clarity to improve decision support.

The FLIR ONE Edge Pro also features an extended battery life compared to previous generations of the FLIR ONE and an easily-recognized battery life indicator making it ideal for more prolonged inspection situations including disaster restoration home inspection energy auditing and industrial equipment diagnostics.

More image processing and reporting For cloud storage imaging processing and reporting the FLIR ONE Edge Pro benefits from a rich set of Teledyne FLIR software including Tools Mobile Ignite cloud and FLIR Thermal Studio desktop software. This allows users to easily share Edge thermal photos with clients and seamlessly integrate them into professional reports.

Additionally app developers have access to the FLIR ONE software development kit (SDK) to create custom applications for exclusive use with the FLIR ONE Edge Pro.

Two T-6Cs arrived at the Royal Thai Air Force or RTAF base Kamphaeng Saen northeast of the Thai capital Bangkok with a welcoming ceremony attended by senior RTAF officials and U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Robert F. Godec according to Thai defence blog thaiarmedforce.com.

Images and videos of the trainers released by the RTAF showed that they carried the U.S. civil aircraft registration N2773B and N2792B for their delivery flight

Thailand ordered 12 T-6Cs under a $162 million contract in 2020. They’ll replace Pilatus PC-9 turboprop trainers that equip one of three squadrons with the RTAF’s flying training school at Kamphaeng Saen.

Defense News asked Textron for comment regarding the delivery. The company had said in 2020 when announcing the order that the T-6C will be used by the RTAF as the platform of an integrated training system.

Thailand also ordered eight AT-6 Wolverine light attack aircraft signing a $143 million contract with Textron in November 2021. The U.S. ally is the first customer for the type.

These aircraft will be delivered starting in 2024 and will replace the Aero L-39 jet trainer president and CEO of Textron Aviation Defense Thomas Hammoor said in 2021 adding that the AT-6s will be used to support border security as well as for anti-smuggling counternarcotics and anti-human trafficking operations.

Flight tracking website Flightaware showed that Textron’s AT-6E demonstrator aircraft is also in Thailand having arrived at Chiang Mai airport on the 15th of November. The aircraft which carries the U.S. civil registration N610AT was then flown to Kamphaeng Saen.

The AT-6 Wolverine is developed from the T-6 airframe and designed for light attack armed reconnaissance and counterinsurgency missions and can employ weapons included laser-guided bombs and rockets.

Textron also says that the AT-6 is fitted with an L3 Wescam MX-15D multi-sensor suite which provides color and IR cameras laser designator laser illuminator and laser rangefinder for weapons targeting and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance tasks.

The plane had flown many times this week.

SNOHOMISH — Two people died in a fiery plane crash around 10:20 a.m. between Snohomish and Monroe on Friday morning.

Public flight data suggested the plane was a Cessna 208B Caravan manufactured by Textron Aviation Inc. in 2021. Usually the planes seat nine passengers plus the pilot but the model can seat up to 14.

The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed a single-engine Textron 208B crashed east of Harvey Field. Fire District 4 Chief Don Waller confirmed the two people on board died in the crash.

Preliminary reports indicated the plane went down near U.S. 2 and 100th Street SE. Authorities located the plane in the middle of a field south of the highway according to Fire District 4. Due to the damage the passenger count was initially unknown fire officials reported just after 11:30 a.m.

U.S. 2 was closed from 88th Street to Westwick Road until about 1:30 p.m.

Flight data for a fixed-wing single-engine plane based in Anchorage Alaska showed a rapid descent while circling east of Snohomish. Flightradar24 shows the plane leaving Renton and hovering around 9500 feet in the air before falling. Authorities have not confirmed if this is the same plane that reportedly crashed.

The plane had flown over half a dozen times this week according to Flightradar24 data. Almost all of those flights left Renton and returned there shortly after. The flights ranged from 20 minutes to over three hours.

The other flights took similar paths into Snohomish County leading Flightradar24’s director of communications Ian Petchenik to guess the plane was used for sightseeing.

When looking at the flight data for Friday morning Petchenik sees a plane out of control in the final moments.

“What I’m seeing is that’s not a controlled descent” he told The Daily Herald. “The tightness of that final turn tells me that that’s not necessarily what they wanted to do with the aircraft.”

Before the flight data ended the plane was diving at over 11000 feet per minute Petchenik said. A safe landing would be between 500 and 1500. In 48 seconds the plane went from 9675 feet in the air to 775 feet the last data received from the plane.

Petchenik figured the plane suffered something “catastrophic.” Given that a wing appeared to be located far away from the rest of the aircraft he said it’s possible the wing detached in midair. If that was the case it would be a mechanical issue rather than a human error that caused the crash said James Anderson an aviation accident attorney with the law firm Krutch Lindell Bingham Jones.

The crash caused a large fire making access to the plane difficult according to Fire District 4.

Weather conditions were chilly — in the 40s — but clear with little wind Friday morning in the Snohomish County lowlands.

Before noon the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board took over the scene from local fire crews. The NTSB which will handle the investigation was gathering information Friday afternoon a spokesperson said.

Usually the NTSB releases a preliminary report a few days after the crash with basic facts said Anderson who lives in Snohomish and interned at the federal agency in college. Then the manufacturers are invited to look at the wreckage and write reports. It could take a year for a final report on the crash.

The Snohomish County Medical Examiner’s Office will publicly identify the deceased by Monday at the earliest.

This is the second recent deadly plane crash in the area. In early September a floatplane en route from Friday Harbor to Renton crashed off Whidbey Island killing all 10 people in the de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter turboprop. In that case a possible cause of the crash was identified: a critical part that moved the plane’s horizontal tail stabilizer came apart.

Figure 1: Typical organizational structure shell when utilizing implementation lead Figure 1: Typical organizational structure shell when utilizing implementation lead

While leveraging a functional service provider (FSP) model can be beneficial for sponsors implementing them can be complex and challenging. Providing customized flexibility and scalability standard or specialized services FSPs can help fulfill various drug development needs to help improve timelines and costs. However common pain points can include a significant investment in time and managing communication and expectations.To help overcome these challenges some contract research organizations (CROs) use an implementation lead (IL) to launch new projects. This role works closely with the operations delivery lead (ODL) but is more involved in the initial onboarding of resources. By adding an IL to support the process responsibilities are divided and efficiencies can be gained in the critical early phase of the partnership. This approach aims to drive better outcomes by providing a more focused level of effort in each key area of the partnership.Lisa Beckel Senior Director FSP Solutions PPD Clinical Research at Thermo Fisher Scientific discusses keys to implement a FSP partnership addressing some of the challenges and how the role of IL can help assure efficient onboarding and resourcing for FSP clinical research projects. –KBWhat is the process for establishing a functional service partnership model and how are responsibilities allocated?The goal is to partner with sponsors to create service models that are flexible and scalable to accommodate their growing pipeline while maintaining the highest quality. The FSP model is fit for purpose – there is no “one size fits all.” Critical to establishing an FSP model that successfully delivers is understanding the sponsor’s vision and goals and applying the best approach to achieve those goals. Sponsors can customize their approach to FSP resourcing by contracting based on a service or task (i.e. unitized or deliverable based) or based on a model where resources are partially or fully dedicated to the client to perform work as the client determines (i.e. full-time equivalent or FTE based) or may implement both in a hybrid approach. It’s a matter of customizing the FSP solution for each sponsor to provide them with the desired balance of direct functional oversight visibility and ownership of their projects and access to a scalable and flexible workforce.The FSP provider brings experience and expertise across all resourcing models to establish the FSP model by:• Providing insights to the sponsor on the benefits and risks of the different models and what may best align to their specific pipeline and resourcing needs (e.g. considerations for geographic placement of resources to reduce cost while maintaining the highest quality).• Thoroughly understanding the sponsor’s organizational structure escalation and communications pathways and key touchpoints and then aligning the FSP partnership team to the sponsor’s organization to enable faster and smoother implementation of the model.• Fully adopting the sponsor’s culture and ways of working and embedding them within the partnership team.These activities ultimately result in a fit-for-purpose FSP model unique to the sponsor with a clear structure that places accountability and responsibilities at the appropriate levels within the FSP partnership team to drive efficient communication and decision-making while securing seamless delivery of the FSP model.What are some of the challenges sponsors and CROs face establishing and implementing an FSP model?Challenges in establishing and implementing an FSP model can vary widely based on the sponsor’s previous FSP experience and organizational structure. There are a few areas where sponsors and FSP providers more commonly struggle which can influence the success of the FSP model:• Sponsors may not be aware of the variety of ways the FSP model can be implemented nor the benefits inherent in the different approaches that make one model better for their organization than another; essentially they don’t know what they don’t know.• Transitioning into an FSP model can require a significant investment of time from the sponsor to establish the infrastructure and governance which can defeat the purpose of and FSP partnership.• Launching into an FSP model requires significant change management within the sponsor organization to ensure internal stakeholders are invested in the model’s success.• FSP providers have a steep learning curve to rapidly understand and align to the sponsor’s organizational structure and ways of working so they can provide the best guidance for setting up the FSP model for success.• Lack of visibility into the sponsor’s pipeline and/or resource needs can hamper the FSP provider’s ability to proactively plan for resource ramp-up or implementation of specialized recruitment strategies reducing the effectiveness of the FSP model.• FSP providers may be held to high expectations for recruiting highly specialized talent or be held to very restrictive requirements for job roles driving longer deployment timelines to sponsors.Fortunately these challenges are very manageable by ensuring:• Selection of an FSP provider with demonstrated experience and success in implementing customized FSP models partnerships and governance and who has established implementations strategies and tools that remove much of this burden from the sponsor so the sponsor team can focus on what is critical for delivering their pipeline.• Engagement from key stakeholders in building the FSP service model foundation.• Incorporation of change management into the implementation planning.• Both sponsor and FSP provider identify a single point of contact to manage communication and expectations within their respective organizations.• Clear communication pathways and awareness of implementation activity timelines.• Clear processes for providing regular three- six- or 12-month projections of the sponsor’s resource requirements to enable proactive talent recruitment to meet the demand.• The FSP provider formulates a targeted recruitment and candidate vetting strategy based on a clear understanding of the sponsor’s job roles target talent experience profile and other key criteria so the talent provided hits the mark.This level of planning has demonstrated success in FSP engagements by delivering efficient and rapid establishment of the FSP model so the required talent stream is recruited and deployed seamlessly. This approach reduces the burden for sponsors so they can continue to focus on clinical trial delivery.What roles do the implementation lead and operations delivery lead play in an FSP model?Meeting the challenge of establishing and maintaining successful FSP models requires focused attention from seasoned experts if the model is to be implemented efficiently and effectively. For large FSP programs two key roles are included within the FSP partnership team to secure the successful implementation and oversight of the model: the implementation lead (IL) and the operations delivery lead (ODL). The roles of the IL and ODL are complementary: the IL equips the partnership for rapid successful implementation of the model while the ODL ensures that success is realized and optimized in the evolution of the partnership.The IL’s remit is to work with key stakeholders to apply the sponsor’s ways of working and build the infrastructure that drives the FSP model and talent recruitment machine thus reducing the burden for the sponsor. The bulk of the IL’s work is completed during the pre-award kickoff and post-award processes. Over time as the FSP model is running smoothly the IL’s work reduces and the model transitions into the maintenance phase and lifecycle management.The ODL serves as the single point of contact for the sponsor and is accountable for aligning the FSP partnership team to the sponsor’s structure culture and ways of working. The ODL ensures the partnership team members work in a coordinated and consistent manner so that delivery and support of the resources is achieved and that those resources perform to the agreed standards and targets. This work begins at kickoff and ramps up as the partnership and model are established and smoothly transition into the maintenance phase. The ODL oversees the ongoing lifecycle management of the model and partnership including financial stewardship proactive risk management and rapid issue escalation and resolution.This following diagram outlines how a typical FSP partnership team can be organized and the relationship of the IL and ODL within the team.How does the IL role improve efficiency onboarding and resourcing for FSP clinical research projects?Thorough planning and forethought are key to successful implementation of an FSP model. The IL develops and coordinates the cross-functional implementation strategy to ensure the process driven by the FSP provider is standardized to drive faster and more efficient onboarding as well as thorough embedding of the sponsor’s ways of working and culture into the partnership team. The IL in partnership with the ODL also assesses the existing partnership governance and oversight structure to determine how best to align with a multiple FSP provider model – should one exist – as well as providing input and guidance into creating a partnership governance if one is not in place. The IL can document decisions processes and standards in a partnership handbook which can be used to define the attributes of the partnership to support ongoing standardization of the agreed FSP model. This approach avoids startup delays while also off-loading much of the implementation workload from the sponsor so they can continue to focus on delivery of their clinical research projects.Utilizing the IL’s expertise ensures the model’s processes are clear for the functional teams that the sponsor’s expectations are incorporated and timeline commitments are achieved. The result is a high-quality output and a positive experience for the sponsor. Additionally an efficient onboarding experience delivers quick integration of the new FSP employee into the sponsor team where they can begin to contribute and take part in meaningful work.

The family of Henrietta Lacks will file an amended complaint this week against a biotech company accused of profiting off her “immortal” cell line putting off a long-awaited decision over the fate of the lawsuit in federal court.

The amended complaint will make changes to the claims against the company Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. in an effort to bolster the family’s legal argument. Lacks’ estate represented by her grandson Ron L. Lacks sued Thermo Fisher last year over its use of the “HeLa” cell line named for Henrietta Lacks.

The original cells were taken from Lacks a Black woman from Baltimore County without her knowledge while she received treatment for cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1951. Lacks’ cells which can reproduce endlessly in a lab have been used widely for medical research in the decades since.

Her family’s lawsuit claims that Thermo Fisher has been unjustly enriched through its use of the cells. But the estate faced an uphill battle as Thermo Fisher sought to have the complaint thrown out citing the statute of limitations. The company also argued that it did not know about the cells’ unethical origin when it bought them.

U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman has for months been weighing the company’s request to dismiss the lawsuit. Instead the Lacks estate said Wednesday that it planned to file an amended complaint which will delay Boardman’s decision.

The new complaint had not yet been filed as of Thursday morning. But at a phone conference Wednesday the lawyer for the estate said the amended complaint would address “two limited issues” related to the unjust enrichment claim.

Boardman denied the motion to dismiss as moot after receiving notice the family would file an amended complaint. Thermo Fisher has 45 days to file a new response. The company consented to the amended complaint being filed.

The company has argued that it is protected from liability because Maryland’s three-year statute of limitations for unjust enrichment has long passed since Lacks’ cells were taken. Thermo Fisher also claims that it is a “bona fide purchaser for value” meaning that it paid to use the cell line without knowledge of how the cells were collected.

“The factual bases for the complaint … have been known to Plaintiff for decades” the company’s lawyers wrote in a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. “Yet Plaintiff failed to take timely action instead waiting until October 4 2021 to file the complaint in this case. As a result Thermo Fisher is left in the untenable position of defending itself for the downstream effects of 70-year-old acts in which Thermo Fisher had no part.”

One of the Lacks family’s lawyers Christopher L. Ayers said Wednesday that the amended complaint will address the unjust enrichment claim and and bona fide purchaser argument.

In court the family’s legal team has argued that the three-year statute of limitations restarts each time Thermo Fisher benefits from the use of the HeLa cell line.

The family is also represented by Ben Crump a Florida-based civil rights attorney best known for representing the families of Black people killed by police including Michael Brown George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

The lawsuit asks for a permanent order that would block Thermo Fisher from using Lacks’ cells without permission from her estate and for a constructive trust to benefit her family.

A lawyer for Thermo Fisher declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Lacks family’s legal team declined to provide additional details about the amended complaint."

Maxx Shoppers Might See Higher Prices Due to Inflation,"T.J. Maxx shoppers might start seeing higher prices in the off pricer’s stores next quarter.

TJX Companies CEO Ernie Herrman said in a call with investors that the company is seeing “very very little resistance” in regards to price changes which it is rolling out across different categories.

Like other companies the off-price retailer which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls had been impacted by general price increases due to inflation. And while the company has strategically implemented these increases it has managed to still maintain its value proposition for consumers looking for a deal.

“In a retail environment where overall pricing has been reset higher we believe our value proposition will be even more compelling and visible to consumers and that our treasure hunt shopping experience will hold tremendous appeal” Herrman said.

The Framingham Mass.-based off-price retailer reported a net profit of $1.062 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 up from $1.023 billion the same time last year. Net sales for the third quarter of 2023 however were $12.2 billion a decrease of 3% from $12.5 billion versus the third quarter of 2022.

Herrman said on the earnings call that the retailer is well positioned for the holidays given a marketplace that is “absolutely loaded with quality branded merchandise across good better and best brands.” Herrman also noted that the company is focusing even more this holiday season on fresh flowing branded goods that are gift-oriented coming in later than normal which he said is going to “bode well” for Q4 sales especially in the last week or two right before Christmas.

Looking ahead TJX is now planning total sales for the full fiscal year in the range of $49.3 billion to $49.5 billion. The change versus its previous guidance is due to its forecast that unfavorable foreign exchange rates will negatively impact Q4 reported sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMi9yb3NzLXRqeC1kaXNjb3VudGVyLWNvbnN1bWVycy1zZWVrLWxvdy1wcmljZWQtY2xvdGhlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ross and TJX Ride the Discounter Wave as Consumers Seek Low-Priced Clothes,"It may be a bad time for consumers and their wallets but it’s proving to be a good time for the discounters and off-price retailers that cater to the growing demand for deals.

With bargain hunting and budget sensitivity at record highs amid ongoing inflation and economic gloom discount chains are ruling the roost right now thanks to aggressive price wars among their normally full-priced competitors. Add in a glut of unsold inventory that is keeping wholesale apparel prices under pressure alongside the belt-tightening buying environment and the stage is set for brands that stand for value and savings.

“Our top priority is and always will be delivering fresh and exciting named brand merchandise at compelling discounts every day in our growing store base of over 2000 locations” Ross Stores CEO Barbara Rentler told investors Thursday afternoon (Nov. 17) during the company’s third-quarter earnings call. “With consumers’ heightened focus on value and convenience this bodes well for our ability to expand our market share and profitability in the future.”

Investors have bid up the retailer’s stock price by 50% since July 1 compared to a 3% gain for the S&P 500.

While she acknowledged that ongoing inflationary pressures are having a larger impact on lower-income customers at its dd’s brand Rentler said the discounter was not slowing the chain’s plans for location growth for both of its brand banners.

TJX Embraced by ‘Treasure Hunters’

In a similar sentiment from off-price segment leader TJX whose portfolio includes the T.J. Maxx Marshalls and HomeGoods chains CEO Ernie Herrman credited the retailer’s better-than-expected United States comp sales growth with “excellent performance” within its two apparel-focused businesses during its Q3 earnings call.

“As I’ve been saying all year long the marketplace is absolutely loaded with quality branded merchandise across good better and best brands” Herrman said adding that through the holidays TJX plans to “flow fresh product to our stores and online multiple times a week” which he called a key differentiator versus many other retailers.

“We see many opportunities to drive sales and traffic as we attract a wide range of customers across many income demographics which we believe is a key advantage of our business” Herrman said. “In a retail environment where overall pricing has been reset higher we believe our value proposition will be even more compelling and visible to consumers and that our treasure hunt shopping experience will hold tremendous appeal.”

Shares of TJX were up on the news and are up 35% since July 1.

To be sure the gains being seen by discounters are not being felt industrywide. Big brands like Target and Kohl’s are being extra aggressive in their markdowns but their efforts have not triggered the same consumer response.

However the performance of discounters aligns with PYMNTS research on the value of discounting in the current environment.

Per the study “Consumer Inflation Sentiment: Consumers Buckle Down on Belt-Tightening” “Cutting back on ‘nice to haves’ is the most common way consumers are seeking to save money but it is not the only way. More consumers are also seeking cheaper merchants and buying lower-quality products to cut costs on grocery and retail purchases.”

Adopting unicorns on the other hand?

That came as a surprise even to her.

Hidden Pasture Unicorn Farm at 245 Little Virginia Road in Fountain Inn is the only “real life” unicorn farm in existence making it one of a kind. Nichols’ property purchased in 2017 serves as the home to plenty of rescued animals including birds cows donkeys — and yes even unicorns.

It all began with a horse named George.

Having always dreamed of owning a white stallion Nichols jumped at the chance when she found a miniature white stallion named George listed for sale. Upon taking George home with her she began training him to be certified with the American Miniature Horse Therapy Association so George could become a therapy horse.

Therapy horses

Horses that have been trained to assist those suffering from a variety of mental and physical challenges promoting activity and serving as a soothing presence.

The training involved in becoming a therapy horse known as desensitizing training is geared toward making the horse comfortable with a variety of tasks locations and individuals so Nichols’ often took George out around town. One day she brought him to the Tractor Supply Store.

On this particular day however Nichols had decided to dress George up for fun with a decorative unicorn horn.

That’s when a woman stopped Nichols to ask how much it would cost for her to bring George wearing his unicorn horn to her daughter’s birthday party.

It wasn’t long before she was getting requests from people about wanting to have a birthday party with George and over time the unicorn farm was born.

Through her nonprofit Me & Younicorn Nichols has since rescued almost 50 horses some of which have been rehabilitated and rehomed while others will live out their days on the farm. It’s not only horses – or unicorns that is – that call the farm home. She has rescued rabbits roosters and a baby dairy cow while also breeding mini-Nubian dairy goats pedigreed Flemish Giant rabbits miniature horses and miniature goats. Different fowl such as turkeys peacocks and a variety of breeds of chickens are included on the farm as well.

But the main attraction is the motley group of unicorns all of whom have their own unique magical backstory as told by Nichols.

The goal is to convince even doubtful children that unicorns and magic are in fact possible in this world.

“It’s fulfilling a life’s dream” Nichols says.

She’s also got some help on her side as the unicorn farm truly is a family affair.

In fact Nichols’ partner Rick DeBerry developed the very first unicorn horn which is attached using a harness. Everything the horses wear is “hand carved hand sewn and hand made.”

With a background as a licensed contractor DeBerry also built the shelters for the animals to stay in after they began rescuing them in 2017. Nichols says the farm wouldn’t be here without him.

“Not only was he OK with it but he was also out here building all this stuff so that I could add more and more” she says.

Her sons are involved as well. Eli DeBerry 16 oversees the farm’s music program and often plays on the stage located on the farm. Logan Nichols 12 and Jace DeBerry 10 also help the guests with tours of the farm or guide children when interacting with the animals.

“I just love living here” Jace Nichols says.

Hidden Pasture Unicorn Farm can bring a unicorn anywhere for birthday parties photoshoots weddings or other events. The farm also offers Christmas festivities like the Yuletide Unicorn Festival that runs every Friday Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. until Dec. 12 and which also features Santa.

As a lifelong admirer of horses — and now unicorns too — Nichols says she loves what she does.

“I like knowing that people come here to get happy” she says."

SEATTLE Nov. 17 2022 – For the first time Expedia Group unveiled a comprehensive view of traveler trends across Expedia ®  Hotels.com and Vrbo and the broader travel industry in 2023. Sourced from the company’s first-party data and from custom research of thousands of travelers and industry professionals across 17 countries these top travel trends prove there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to travel in 2023. 1 Instead these trends point to a year defined by the “no-normal.”

Unexpected Travel Trends in 2023

Expedia: Set-Jetters

Booking a trip after binging a popular new series will become serious business in 2023. Expedia research confirms that streamed movies and TV shows are now the top sources of travel inspiration (40%) outpacing the influence of social media (31%). Furthermore the small screen is now considered on par with recommendations from friends and family when it comes to travel inspiration.

In the US more than two-thirds (68%) of travelers considered visiting a destination after seeing it in a show or movie on a streaming platform and a whopping 61% booked a trip.

The top set-jetter destinations include New Zealand with its landscapes featured in one of this year’s most epic series followed by the UK Paris New York and the stunning beach resorts of Hawaii.

Expedia: Culture Capitals

National parks and rural retreats have had big moments these past two years. Now it’s time for cities to see a comeback. Based on traveler demand most of the destinations seeing the largest increases are culture-rich cities where art and culture festivities are getting back to full swing. Check out the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland plan a trip to WorldPride in Sydney or bask in the cherry blossoms in Tokyo. In the Expedia app culture capitals are calling:2

Edinburgh Scotland

Lisbon Portugal

Tokyo Japan

Dublin Ireland

New York US

Sydney Australia

Dubai UAE

Montreal Canada

Munich Germany

Bangkok Thailand

Hotels.com: Three-star Superstars

Travelers are seeking smarter ways to see the world without compromising on comfort or cool factor. In the US nearly a third (32%) of travelers are more concerned with value for money than ever before. Hotels.com data shows interest is up more than 20% globally in three-star hotels.3

In 2023 40% of US travelers plan to stay in 1–3-star hotels and 34% plan to book a vacation with added value inclusions such as free parking or breakfast. Showing a shift in mindset from the post-pandemic bucket-list mentality and moving towards a more spontaneous approach one-third of travelers would rather go on more trips in three-star properties than splurge on one big luxury getaway. Fewer stars do not mean lower standards however. Many properties such as Una Vida in Mexico or Mama Shelter in Paris offer excellent amenities stylish interiors and unique vibes as a standard.

Hotels.com: New Wave Wellness

According to Hotels.com more than half (53%) of Americans are seeking wellness breaks but cite boredom for traditional retreats and want to experience something more exciting in 2023. Millennials are the top drivers of this as 60% of 25-34-year-olds are seeking out alternative wellness getaways. Most travelers want to explore new offerings in the US. However Gen Z has a different view and would prefer to book an adventure to Norway Turkey Switzerland Iceland and Sri Lanka.

To capture this awakened market hotels such as the Loire Valley Lodge in France and Whitepod in Switzerland are offering advanced rejuvenation programs and hands-on activities that encourage travelers to get up close and personal with nature. The quirkier the activity the better. Sylvotherapy forest bathing and fruit harvesting are more popular than classic activities like cooking courses sport holidays and meditation sessions.

Hotels.com: Hot new hotel openings around the world

New hotels that cater to evolving traveler needs are opening around the world. These properties offer far more than a place to sleep with destination restaurants co-working spaces and beautiful interiors as standard. From an art-filled social hub in London to unbridled luxury in Rome these are the most exciting hotels to have on your radar in the year ahead according to Hotels.com:

Vrbo: Foodie-menities

Kitchen credentials are a must with travelers looking to plate up at their own convenience in a private Vrbo vacation home. Outdoor kitchens pizza ovens and air fryers are the top three foodie-menities travelers crave. Additionally nearly half of US travelers (43%) are using cooking to cut down on costs.

Travelers are looking for preferred amenities in their whole home vacation rentals rather than focusing on location. In fact more than half (57%) of travelers would rather book a unique vacation home to be with their people in a lesser-known destination than a less interesting less equipped vacation home in a popular area.

Vrbo: Cowboy-cations

Rustic getaways are on the rise as travelers crave private vacation homes with abundant space and exhilarating views. Cue the cowboy-cation offering an intimate escape in the rugged wilderness. Demand for Vrbo homes in US western destinations increased by more than 30% from September 2021 to August 2022 as travelers seek to reconnect with nature.4 Plus 42% of US travelers find inspiration in outdoorsy destinations and mind-blowing landscapes. Think log-lined cabins flickering fires and sweeping vistas.

Travelers can live out their western fantasies by booking a luxurious lodge ranch retreat or farmhouse that fits the whole crew. Destinations across Montana Colorado and other western states spring readily to mind but the cowboy-cation is not confined to the US. For a home on the range in Europe travelers are booking converted barns and farmhouses in the countryside of Italy Spain France and the UK. Thrill-seekers can also embrace their inner cowboy in Australia where farmhouses in the outback overlook acres of wineries and wild brush.

Vrbo: Hidden Gems

Travelers are also exploring unassuming locales and new places. Top hidden gems in the US have one thing in common: beautiful lakes where travelers can take in tranquil views. Demand for Vrbo’s private vacation homes in each of these unconventional destinations has increased by 30% or more since September 2021:5

Travel in 2023 will be about saying “no” to normal breaking routines and searching for experiences without compromises. Whether it’s flying to those once-in-a-lifetime events or hosting group celebrations at a holiday home travelers are no longer adapting to the next new normal but creating their own status quo altogether.

An optimistic industry pushes forward

For the first time the 2023 travel trends are being released at the same time as insights from industry professionals from airlines to hotels to vacation rental hosts and more. In a tailored report for travel partners Expedia Group reveals the ways that the pandemic forever changed travel. The research shows the highest levels of optimism since 2020. Most professionals expect leisure (71%) and business (70%) travel to return to pre-2020 levels within two years. While travelers looking for a change of scenery kept the industry afloat during the pandemic all eyes are on the return of international and business travel. In fact more than half (51%) in the industry say business is their organization’s highest priority in 2023.

Another insight from industry professionals shows travelers are choosing options aligned with their personal values such as sustainability inclusivity and accessibility. Most travel businesses (60%) made changes in the last year to ensure their services are inclusive and accessible. In fact sustainability is tied with marketing as the highest area of investment for 2023 with one in five industry professionals saying they plan to invest in sustainability next year.

i Methodology

The No-Normal study was conducted on behalf of Expedia Brands (Expedia Hotels.com Vrbo & Wotif) by OnePoll a global strategic research firm. The survey was conducted online from September 22 – October 14 2022 across North and South America Europe and Asia-Pacific using an amalgamated group of best-in-class panels. The study was conducted among 24000 respondents across 17 countries amongst adults who are planning domestic or international travel in the next 36 months.

The Traveler Value Index (consumer) research was conducted by Wakefield Research among 11000 nationally representative adults ages 18+ in eleven markets (Australia Brazil Canada France Germany Japan Mexico South Africa South Korea the United Kingdom and the United States) in June-July 2022 using an email invitation and an online survey. The data was weighted to ensure reliable and accurate representation. The overall margin of error for this study is +/-.93 at the overall level and +/-3.1 in each market at 95% confidence.

The Traveler Value Index (industry professional) research was conducted by Wakefield Research among 100 travel professionals each in 11 markets (Australia Brazil Canada France Germany Japan Mexico South Africa South Korea the United Kingdom and the United States) in June-July 2022 using an email invitation and an online survey. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary plus or minus by more than 3.0 percentage points for the total 1100 respondents and 9.8 percentage points for the 100 respondents in each country from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2FpcmxpbmUtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzExLzE3L2NhcmJvbi1jcmVkaXRzLWZsaWdodHMtY2xhaW0tb2Zmc2V0LWVtaXNzaW9ucy1kby10aGV5LXdvcmsvMTA3MDc4NDQwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carbon credits for flights claim to offset emissions. Do they work?,"Climate-conscious travelers may be tempted to buy an add-on to their ticket that claims to reduce the environmental impact of their flights.

Climate investor and author Ramez Naam has gotten his flight advice down to this: ""Fly less. If you have to fly buy offsets.""

There are other ways to minimize the carbon your flights produce too.

For people trying to lower their carbon footprint in the world flying is a conundrum.

It's wonderful to visit family and see new places but air travel is also a contributor to the carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming.

Commercial airplanes and large business jets make up about 10% of US transportation emissions accounting for 3% of the nation’s total greenhouse gas production according to the latest numbers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

So climate-conscious travelers may be tempted to buy an add-on to their ticket that claims to reduce the environmental impact of their flights. Several major U.S. airlines offer to let passengers buy these offsets through their websites. And multiple other companies and non-profits also sell carbon offsets.

What's the would-be green traveler to do? Well it's complicated...

How bad is flying for climate change?

Flying takes a lot of energy which means releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Creating the thrust necessary to push a 300000 pound airplane 35000 feet above the Earth keep it there for a couple of hours and then bring it down safely takes a lot of jet fuel. And jet fuel is basically kerosene.

If you want to know just how much greenhouse gas your flight is putting into the atmosphere use this carbon calculator from the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization (be sure to change it from kilograms to pounds). It estimates a flight from Los Angeles to New York uses 623 pounds of carbon dioxide per passenger.

While estimates vary on average Americans individually emit between 16 and 20 tons of CO2 each year. For people who fly a lot air travel can be a significant part of their carbon footprint.

What are carbon offsets and how do they help?

A carbon offset theoretically allows a person to fund an action that would make up for a certain amount of carbon being put into the atmosphere. You can pay to offset your flights your household energy use your commute – anything you do that burns fossil fuels and produces greenhouse gasses.

Typically offsets are credits purchased in a project designed to reduce CO2 emissions somewhere in the world. That might be planting a forest or protecting a wetland or investing in a low-carbon cement production system.

There are multiple companies and non-profits that sell carbon offsets. Typically these cost somewhere between $10 and $20 per ton of CO2.

Do carbon offsets really work?

It depends on the offset. And who you ask.

""It's like with mechanics there are good reliable mechanics and then there are not so reliable ones"" said Peter Miller a clean energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council who has blogged about carbon offsets. ""But a lot of them have a real beneficial impact.""

Still offsets are not a ""get out of jail free"" card. Carbon is being emitted by the plane notes Daniele Rao an expert on the decarbonization of aviation at the non-profit Carbon Market Watch. He's generally skeptical of offsets but is willing to say they're ""probably"" better than nothing.

""It's OK to purchase offsets. But you have to know that you're not reducing your emission you're still having an impact"" he said.

How do I know which offset programs are good?

None of the environmentalists USA TODAY interviewed were willing to give a list of offset programs they endorsed because they hadn't done all the research to thoroughly vet them.

In general said Miller you want to look for programs that have been around for a few years are transparent about what they do provide detailed information about the projects they fund and work with an independent third party to verify that the projects really happened.

What about airline carbon offset programs?

Multiple airlines have their own carbon offset programs including Delta Southwest and American. Sometimes when buying a ticket customers are offered the option of paying a few dollars more to make up for the CO2 pollution their flight will create.

In general these don't offer consumers a lot of transparency about what they're doing said Rao who is unconvinced they're very useful but acknowledges that ""sometimes it's the only thing the customer can do.""

Some airlines such as United don't offer offsets at all instead putting the money into work on what are known as SAFs or sustainable aviation fuels. These are considered the gold standard for what will someday make aviation carbon-neutral. However they're still in the early and very expensive stage of development.

“We are investing in cutting-edge companies creating technology that will decarbonize our airplanes. Those investments include electric aircraft and air taxis hydrogen-powered engines as well as more sustainable aviation fuel"" United said in a statement to USA TODAY.

Each carrier has its own practices for carbon-offsets and not all airlines offer them. USA TODAY reached out to the four largest airlines in the U.S. — American Delta United and Southwest — about their policies.

Statements from multiple airlines indicate that carbon offsets are just one part of their attempts to lower their carbon footprint.

Is there anyone who checks out carbon offset programs?

Several organizations are working to do thorough investigations of these programs but so far no one has published a deeply-researched list. ""I haven't seen anything that's really successful yet. Watch this space maybe in the next six months or so some of those will really emerge and be seen as credible"" said Miller.

So what do climate activists do?

Climate investor and author Ramez Naam has gotten his flight advice down to this: ""Fly less. If you have to fly buy offsets. They're not perfect but something is better than nothing. But try to fly less.""

He was also the one person USA TODAY spoke to who'd name an offset program he likes. ""I use Nori.com they're very transparent.""

What else can I do to help the planet when flying?

First if you only fly a few times a year don't feel too guilty.

""The people going home for Thanksgiving or Christmas flying maybe twice a year they're not really the problem. It's those people who are flying almost every week or using private jets"" said Rao.

If you want to minimize the carbon your flights produce here are a few tips:

Nonstop is best  because it's the most fuel-efficient.

 because it's the most fuel-efficient. Take a train bus or car for trips that are 600 miles or less — especially if multiple people are going.

for trips that are 600 miles or less — especially if multiple people are going. Don't fly business or first class . The amount of energy required to fly a plane is divided among the people flying. Coach is the most energy efficient.

. The amount of energy required to fly a plane is divided among the people flying. Coach is the most energy efficient. Use a program like Google flights to see the actual carbon footprint of a given flight so you can compare. Newer aircraft and more dense seating arrangements mean fewer pounds of carbon dioxide per passenger.

Is flying going to get any better for the planet?

Better solutions should be available in the next few years said Sola Zheng an aviation researcher with the International Council on Clean Transportation.

The availability of sustainable aviation fuels is slowly increasing and eventually passengers will be able to pay extra to use more of them. That will help grow the market for them so they can be produced more cheaply.

Twilio (TWLO 1.50%) shareholders have had a brutal 2022 with the stock falling 81% this year. Several factors caused its tumble but many investors want to know if the stock is worth holding on to.

Twilio's business is still executing at a high level despite what the stock movement indicates. While growth may be slowing in the short term the long-term vision for the company remains intact. Let's find out why there is such a disconnect between the business and the stock.

How Twilio got to its lows

Twilio's stock problems primarily come from sentiment change but there are multiple reasons why the conversation around Twilio's business has turned negative. At the beginning of the year Twilio's stock traded for more than 15 times sales. A company that commands that valuation level often has top-tier margins and blazing fast growth. Twilio's growth was solid with organic revenue rising 34% in the fourth quarter of 2021 but Twilio has never produced a cent of profits as a public company.

Even though Twilio is a higher-margin software company its gross margins are much lower than many of its peers' because it has to pay telephone service providers. This combination made Twilio's stock overvalued and the stock tumbled.

However that still doesn't get us to where Twilio is today. During its Q3 earnings report Twilio management revoked its promise to grow its organic revenue by 30% annually through 2024. This guidance was a large part of the investment thesis and without it Twilio's shareholders ran for the hills with the stock plummeting more than 30% the day after the earnings report.

Twilio's stock is now at the same price as in June 2018 when its trailing-12-month revenue was $440 million. For reference Twilio's current 12-month trailing revenue is $3.6 billion a 718% increase.

Because of its rising sales Twilio's valuation is now at an all-time low.

A price-to-sales ratio of 2.7 is a level rarely seen by tech companies. And I think it's the main reason to buy or hold the stock.

Twilio is undervalued compared to a similar gross-margin software company

Let's be clear: The primary reason for Twilio's absurdly low valuation is sentiment change. The company is still growing with Q4 revenue expected to be about $1 billion representing about 19% growth. Wall Street analysts also expect Twilio to grow its sales by 18% next year. It is also committed to reaching non-GAAP operating profitability in 2023 and will continue making the business more efficient in the coming years.

With the business growing slower but still at a solid rate it begs the question: What's a reasonable valuation for Twilio? It might help to find a lower gross-margin software business like Tyler Technologies (TYL 0.17%).

Its public and government software offerings have a low gross margin -- about 42% compared to Twilio's 47%. It has also historically grown at a mid-teens rate besides a slight bump during the pandemic which is slightly slower than Twilio. However where Tyler Technologies excels is its profitability which has consistently been around the 10% mark over the past decade.

Still Tyler Technologies trades at around 7.4 times sales versus Twilio's 2.7. I wouldn't argue that Twilio should be valued more than Tyler Technologies -- it's a top-tier performer that is profitable. However Twilio shouldn't have a third of the valuation as Tyler Technologies solely because of its profitability.

A reasonable price-to-sales valuation for Twilio is probably around 5 indicating the stock could double based on valuation alone. It's also about where the stock traded before its most recent sell-off. However Twilio's market opportunity is still vast so the growth the company will experience over the coming years will also drive the stock price higher.

The market has a great reason to be disappointed in Twilio but at today's valuation level the stock doesn't have anywhere to go but up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWF0dXJlcy8yMDIyLTExLTE3L2NpdmljLXRlY2gtZ2V0cy1hbi11cGdyYWRlLWFzLWNpdGllcy1lbWVyZ2UtZnJvbS1jb3ZpZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Civic Tech Gets an Upgrade as Cities Emerge From Covid,"Why did this happen?

It’s a job that commands a seven-figure salary-and-bonus package and puts the inexperienced young scion in charge of the meat conglomerate’s finances. And it comes on the heels of a decidedly less-than-stellar track record in his previous job at Tyson.

The promotion of John R. Tyson in October has raised eyebrows among corporate governance experts and the business-friendly Wall Street Journal which pointed out potential conflicts of interest including whether the company’s board—again chaired by a guy he calls “Dad”—will hold him accountable for his performance. John R. Tyson is a great-grandson of the company’s founder and both his father and his aunt sit on the board.

The new title comes with a big pay raise. The Wall Street Journal reports that the younger Tyson will receive an annual base salary of $650000 and an increase in his target annual incentive payment from 90 percent to 110 percent of his annual base salary. The previous CFO’s total compensation package in 2021 exceeded $5.2 million.

So how exactly did John R. Tyson land such a big job? And what is his track record since joining the family business?

If at first you don’t succeed . . . move up!

According to his official bio and his LinkedIn profile John R. Tyson joined Tyson Foods in 2019 as executive vice president for strategy and chief sustainability officer. With an MBA degree and previous work experience in investment banking and as a private equity and venture capital investor it’s not clear he had any particular qualification to head up sustainability. More likely it was just a good place to begin his climb up the corporate ladder.

As chief sustainability officer he inherited a public pledge made a year before he arrived on the scene to shift 2 million acres of cropland to more sustainable practices by 2020. Even though that acreage is just 20 percent of the company’s total farmland footprint Tyson (the company and the person) hasn’t followed through. As of 2021 Tyson Foods had enrolled a mere fraction of this acreage into a pilot program and it is unclear how sustainable the management of that fraction really is. Meanwhile the company has punted the original 2-million-acre commitment to 2025.

Moreover at the last Tyson Foods shareholder meeting the Tyson-family-dominated board beat back a resolution calling on the company to study its use of plastic packaging another important sustainability issue. Around the same time a Ceres report showed that big meat processors including Tyson lag behind other food companies on sustainable water use. And just this week another new analysis shows that the livestock in Tyson Foods’ supply chain produce as much methane (a potent heat-trapping gas driving climate change) as the entire country of Russia.

Judging by the company’s sustainability performance under the Tyson heir’s leadership he didn’t exactly do a bang-up job before moving up to the C-suite. Nowhere else could you fail so hard and get a big juicy promotion. Moreover as Investopedia notes the CFO position in a big corporation is generally reserved for “very experienced professionals with established track records in their field.”

But this is Tyson Foods.

What can we expect next?

So now Junior is directly in charge of managing Tyson’s finances—no small task given the company’s $53 billion in sales in fiscal year 2022. But in a startling display of immaturity just a month into his tenure as CFO John R. Tyson was arrested for public intoxication and criminal trespassing after being found by a woman he reportedly didn’t know passed out in a bed of her Fayetteville Arkansas home. He has apologized to Tyson employees and says he’s seeking treatment but the incident has raised concerns about nepotism and its impacts—would anyone in a similar situation not named Tyson still be on the job? One corporate governance expert called this “a critical moment” for Tyson Foods warning “This lapse of judgment cannot be tolerated for such a serious job.” And the new CFO’s first quarterly earnings call with financial analysts and journalists this week was a doozy.

Earlier this year Fortune magazine named Tyson Foods the world’s most admired food company for a sixth year running. The improbable designation is the result of an annual survey of “top executives directors and financial analysts” who apparently are not troubled by a business model that exploits and endangers workers cheats farmers and consumers influences an amount of farmland twice the size of New Jersey and makes empty sustainability promises at a time when “sustainability” literally means survival on this planet. Because profits I guess.

For all its pledges and promises Tyson Foods is showing us that it doesn’t take sustainability seriously. Instead it treats it as a pet project for grooming young executives with no real accountability transparency or openness to shareholder concerns. Going forward John R. Tyson will maintain responsibility for sustainability in addition to his new gig. How much can we expect a new apparently in-over-his-head CFO to focus on sustainability?

Even if he tries to carve out time for it sustainability at Tyson will be an add-on an afterthought an extracurricular instead of the priority it must be if a food company wants to remain profitable. And if we all want to continue to eat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vY2l2aWxlYXRzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE3L2luanVyZWQtYW5kLWludmlzaWJsZS13b3JrZXItc2FmZXR5LWNoaWNrZW4taG9zcGl0YWwtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1vc2hhLWluanVyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson Says Its Nurses Help Workers. Critics Charge They Stymie OSHA.,"This story was produced in partnership with The Pulitzer Center. We also partnered with Gatopardo a Mexican monthly news magazine focusing feature stories and lifestyle from a Latin-American perspective to publish a Spanish-language version of the story.

Her scar runs from the meat of the palm to mid-hand a map that tells the story of the body as a machine. Her hands often become numb when she is trying to grab her keys or open the door causing frustration. For many years she has worked 10-hour days four days a week at a Tyson Foods poultry processing plant in the rural town of Green Forest Arkansas. “Esto se llama carpal tunnel” she said tracing the dry riverbed of her scar with a finger.

Investigation Highlight The outsourcing of risk is not new to the industry. The large corporations that process chickens hogs cattle and milk into consumer products have long outsourced risks to the farmers and smaller companies that own CAFOs and employ the workers inside. Tyson Foods’ own model now strategically routes injured workers to company nurses and clinics a process some allege short-circuits injury reports to OSHA limits scrutiny and complicates injured workers’ access to healthcare workers compensation and damages for life-changing injuries.

Read the full series here. She asked to be called María not her real name. In Green Forest in July 2022 a billboard for Tyson advertised a “4-day workweek” and a “$2000 signing bonus.” Tyson is the only large employer in the town of less than 3000. As the largest meatpacking company in the U.S. and the second largest in the world the company processes about 20 percent of all beef pork and chicken in the nation. It is headquartered in Arkansas where 20 plants are the primary employer in small rural towns like this one. At her home María stood facing a large portrait of her daughter in a fuchsia quinceañera dress. She thinks the pain began in 2017 but the Tyson on-site nurses involved did not provide her with paperwork to document her medical condition she said so she isn’t sure of the exact timeframe of events. Feet on worn carpet the late afternoon light filtering through the curtains María demonstrated her job at the time. She moved her hands precisely to cut an imaginary chicken wing making an incision where the wing joins the shoulder and then cutting downwards. If the incision didn’t slice through the tendon completely she could get hurt. Although line speed varied María used to cut 34 wings per minute—around 20000 per day and sharpening her knife after roughly every five wings. “That is what injured my hand” she said. Her injury is not unusual. According to worker interviews and expert research the prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome is high in poultry workers. One study found it to be 2.5 times higher than in other manual labor jobs owing to worker tasks that require repetitive hand manipulation like these: cutting eviscerating washing trimming and deboning. Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines advise companies like Tyson to rotate employees through such jobs to avoid musculoskeletal disorders. They also urge employers to provide early medical treatment to prevent permanent physical damage. Those things didn’t happen for María. Instead when the pain got so bad that she couldn’t function María asked her supervisor—the same one who could grant or deny her permission to use the bathroom—if she could visit the on-site nurse. “They have you sit there for a bit and put a bag of ice on you for 15-20 minutes and then they tell you to go back to work.” Tyson offers on-site occupational health nurses to address worker injuries like these. The model is emblematic of others in the meatpacking and poultry industries designed to streamline efficiency cut costs and reduce liability practices that are being emulated by animal feeding operations farther down the supply chain. Crucially the on-site nursing model also reduces hospital trips and doctor visits that would otherwise trigger mandatory reporting to OSHA. It thus obscures federal oversight of injuries and opportunities for workers to receive paid time off workers’ compensation and damages when they are hurt. Media investigations have shown that Tyson has a history of retooling workers’ compensation law to benefit the company’s bottom line. Critics say the on-site nursing model does the same. Explaining the role of nurses inside the poultry plant María said “They have you sit there for a bit and put a bag of ice on you for 15-20 minutes and then they tell you to go back to work.” OSHA does not require employers to report minor injuries that receive such first aid treatment. Workplaces are required to report severe injuries including amputations the loss of an eye and others that require at least a one-night stay in a hospital directly to OSHA within 24 hours. Injuries that require a simple doctor’s visit however are recorded in company logs that feed into reports to OSHA annually. The agency uses those reports to plan inspections of high-hazard workplaces and direct its enforcement. The system is designed to make efficient use of the limited number of OSHA inspectors. Companies can deflect OSHA’s attention however if the nurses they employ give injured workers first aid treatments instead of recommending medical care. This is one of several reasons workers in the Tyson system are not allowed to consult with doctors about an injury unless the on-site nurse recommends it according to a nurse and several plant workers employed by Tyson. If a worker wants to consult with an outside doctor they are required to pay for their own care.

María said she was denied requests to see a doctor despite months of visits to the nurse at the plant in Green Forest. The company she adds delayed her access to medical care proper treatment and time to heal. Other workers a former nurse and federal investigations of the industry say her experience is typical. Deborah Berkowitz now a fellow at Georgetown University’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor served as chief of staff and then senior policy advisor for OSHA from 2009-2015. She said the on-site first aid model at Tyson is common across the meatpacking and poultry industry. “Workers in these meat plants have incredibly high rates of carpal tunnel syndrome but the meat industry has figured out a way to hide these rates from the public” she said. “OSHA regulations require that only work-related injuries that are serious enough to require medical treatment have to be recorded on official company injury and illness logs. What the industry perfected is a way to avoid having to record these injuries—like carpal tunnel syndrome—by essentially delaying or refusing to send workers or refer workers to see a doctor to get treatment when they are injured or ill from work.” Tyson officials deny that the company refuses medical care to its employees. In a statement to Civil Eats company spokesman Derek Burleson said “The health and safety of our team members is our top priority” and that the company is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace. He provided a link detailing its goals. Burleson added that Tyson requires employees to report their injuries internally no matter how minor. “We do this because we believe in early intervention. We want workplace injuries and illnesses detected early so they can be immediately addressed” he said. Tyson follows a systematic approach for early reporting intervention evaluation and treatment of injuries and illnesses Burleson said a process that begins with evaluations by on-site nurses and progresses through a series of steps that includes referrals to doctors. He did not respond to María’s charge that on-site nurses did not provide her with paperwork documenting her medical condition or comment on the media investigation of Tyson’s approach to workers’ compensation. A former nurse who was employed at several Tyson plants said that despite Tyson’s systematic protocol for worker injuries in practice the company’s plant managers pressured nurses to provide first aid to workers to avoid having to document them. The nurse who Civil Eats is identifying as Nurse J asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Nurse J provided copies of an employee manual that detail steps for addressing musculoskeletal injuries at Tyson through the process described by Burleson. That nurse said that each Tyson plant has a nurse manager who is responsible for making decisions about how an injured worker is treated including when to approve a visit to a doctor. In practice however Nurse J said that in some Tyson plants managers who have no medical background pressure nurses to halt the progression of medical care often entering the room where the injured worker is being treated and providing their assessment of the injury and whether the worker should be approved to see a doctor. Nurse J said that when a worker appears to be seriously injured “the plant management team is like ‘Well then y’all need to like treat her and keep this from becoming OSHA recordable.’” If the nurse manager makes a decision that is not what the plant managers have recommended the nurse manager is “given the fourth degree” and asked to try alternative treatments like offering more ice or a soft tissue massage that Tyson calls “art therapy.” “If you were to take 20 nurse managers and ask them if they ever had pressure from their management the answer would almost always be ‘yes’” said Nurse J. Each year Tyson sets goals for decreasing OSHA recordable injuries at a plant usually aiming for about a 20 percent decrease she added. If the plant doesn’t meet its goal plant managers don’t receive raises or bonuses she said. Nurse J’s claims about delayed care at Tyson also appear in documentation from several OSHA inspections at meat and poultry plants and an investigation of the industry by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) that all found similar patterns. Rebecca Reindel the director of occupational safety and health for the AFL-CIO explained that the Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) at poultry and meatpacking companies “are focused on one getting people back to work and two not having it be reported.” Berkowitz said during a series of investigations “OSHA also found that in meat and poultry plants there are unsupervised first aid staff who often work outside their legal scope of practice.”

Tyson was arrested November 6 in Fayetteville Arkansas

Police in Arkansas have released bodycam footage showing Tyson Foods' newly appointed CFO being arrested after drunkenly falling asleep in a stranger's home.

John R. Tyson - a great-grandson of Tyson Foods' founder - was arrested November 6 in Fayetteville after a college-aged woman found him asleep in her bed at 2am and called the police.

The police footage released on Friday shows Tyson who has publicly apologized for the incident appearing disoriented and attempting to go back to sleep as police roust him from the stranger's bed.

'Mr. Tyson! John! Fayetteville Police Department you're not in your house' an officer can be heard shouting at the slumbering executive.

'I need you to wake up and talk to me before I drag you out of here butt naked' the officer continues.

When Tyson failed to comply the officers pulled the sheets back revealing the executive in his boxer underwear and moved to cuff him

After rolling over and gesturing with his hand Tyson 32 is seen pulling the sheets snugly up to his chin and going back to sleep.

The cops issued a final warning saying: 'You have two options either one you sit up and put your clothes on or two you go to jail just like you are right now.'

When Tyson failed to comply the officers pulled the sheets back revealing the executive in his boxer underwear and moved to cuff him.

Tyson can be seen reaching for the sheets in a feeble attempt to go back to sleep before he was placed in handcuffs. 'I'm going to sleep' he said.

Other than saying 'woah' and 'stop' as the cuffs went on Tyson made no further statements to the officers explaining his actions.

At one point as he was being led from the home he did request: 'Can I go pee real quick?' Police denied the request.

Earlier this week Tyson apologized for the incident on a quarterly earnings call with investors.

'I'm embarrassed and I want to let you know that I take full responsibility for my action' he said.

'Whoa' said Tyson as officers moved to put cuffs on him. The executive appeared not to understand the situation even after cops explained repeatedly

Other than saying 'woah' and 'stop' as the cuffs went on Tyson made no further statements to the officers explaining his actions as seen in the video

Tyson attended Harvard and Stanford University before coming aboard at the family company - he also worked as an investment banker at JP Morgan and in private equity and venture capital

Tyson also apologized to colleagues in a public memo saying that his behavior was 'inconsistent with [his] personal values the company's values and the high expectations we hold for each other.'

'I made a serious mistake and this has caused me to reflect deeply on the impact my actions can have on others' he said in the memo which was provided to the Associated Press.

It is not clear how exactly Tyson ended up in the woman's home but she told dispatchers at the time that she did not know him and may have left her front door open accidentally.

According to an incident report produced by the Fayetteville Police Department officers received a call early on Sunday morning from a woman who had come home to find a man she didn't know sleeping in her bed.

When officers arrived they tried to wake Tyson but found he smelt of alcohol and was 'sluggish and uncoordinated'. His clothes were on the floor.

Tyson was taken to Washington County jail and charged with public intoxication and criminal trespassing. He was released later the same day on a $415 bond and is scheduled to appear in court on December 1.

Tyson Foods based in Arkansas is worth around $24 billion. The Tyson family is worth around $3 billion

In addition to being the great-grandson of the company's founder Tyson is also the son of Tyson Foods Chairman John H. Tyson.

After working as an investment banker at J.P. Morgan Tyson joined Tyson Foods in 2019 and led its sustainability and enterprise strategy teams.

On September 27 the company based in Springdale Arkansas promoted him to executive vice president and chief financial officer.

Tyson Foods has announced its own board members would oversee a review into the incident though corporate governance experts are calling for an independent investigation.

Tyson Foods said a three-member governance committee on the board of directors will lead its review process.

According to the company's website the committee members are Les Baledge former Tyson Foods general counsel; former Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe; and David Bronczek former FedEx Corp president.

The Tyson Foods meat company has grown over the last three generations into a $24 billion brand. John R. Tyson is the youngest CFO currently serving a Fortune and S&P 500 company

'Our independent board of directors are overseeing a thorough review of this matter and I'm confident in this independent process' Chief Executive Donnie King said.

But experts urged Tyson Foods to hire an external firm because of John R. Tyson's deep family connections to the company.

'The board should send a strong signal that independence is important and publicly appoint an external adviser to conduct the review' said Paolo Volpin a finance professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia.

Philip Cochran a management professor at Indiana University said company investors and John R. Tyson would benefit from an external review.

'It's certainly not going to clear him at least in the public's mind if it's done simply by the board of Tyson Foods' Cochran said. 'There's too much potential for this to be seen as a conflict of interest.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQwMjl0di5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9wb2xpY2UtcmVsZWFzZS1ib2R5LWNhbWVyYS1mb290YWdlLW9mLXR5c29uLWZvb2RzLWNmby1hcnJlc3QvNDE5OTk0NTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police release body camera footage of Tyson Foods CFO arrest,"Police release body camera footage of Tyson Foods CFO arrest Share Copy Link Copy

The industry recorded total positive provisions of $13.05 billion in the third quarter up from positive provisions of $10.95 billion a quarter earlier according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The upward trend began in the second quarter of 2021 and has persisted as inflation rising interest rates geopolitical turmoil and the growing prospect of a recession have increased economic uncertainty.

Mixed provisioning trend

Provision for credit loss trends among the top 20 largest U.S. banks were a mixed bag in the third quarter with half reporting quarter-over-quarter increases and the other half reporting sequential declines.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. the largest U.S. bank based on total assets as of Sept. 30 reported a third-quarter provision of $1.16 billion down more than 5% from $1.23 billion in the linked quarter. However the company's ratio of reserves as a percentage of gross loans increased quarter over quarter.

If economic conditions sour or the bank believes the chances of adverse events are on the rise the bank's reserves will probably rise Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said on the company's most recent quarterly earnings call.

Dimon estimated that if U.S. unemployment were to rise to 5% or 6% during a recession the bank could increase reserves by $5 billion or $6 billion over the course of a couple of quarters.

""Easy to handle not a big deal"" Dimon said. ""It just does affect capital a little bit.""

Total reserves inch down

Fifteen of the 20 largest banks in the U.S. reported quarter-over-quarter increases to their reserves as a percentage of gross loans at Sept. 30 while three reported decreases and two reported no change.

Total reserves at U.S. banks fell slightly in the period following a small rise in the second quarter that broke the long-term trend of declines dating back to the end of 2020. The industry booked $177.39 billion in total reserves in the third quarter down from $179.20 billion in the linked quarter. Reserves as a percentage of total gross loans declined slightly to 1.49% from 1.52%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzY3MDE5MTEvYmFua3MtaG9saWRheS1vcGVuaW5nLXRpbWVzLWhvdXJzL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzY3MDE5MTEvYmFua3MtaG9saWRheS1vcGVuaW5nLXRpbWVzLWhvdXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are banks open on Black Friday?...,"Black Friday isn't a US federal holiday but some banks might still be closed the day after Thanksgiving

IF YOU have plans to hit the bank before you go Black Friday shopping it's always good to check ahead of time to see if they'll be open.

Black Friday isn't technically a US bank holiday but it is a holiday in certain states so we're breaking down whether or not your bank will be open.

2 Your bank will most likely be open unless you live in a state where Black Friday is a bank holiday

Are banks open on Black Friday?

Banks in many states will be open on Black Friday.

This is because it's not a federal bank holiday.

It is however a holiday for several states which means that bank branches in those states may choose to close for the day.

If you live in one of the states below it's smart to give your local bank branch a call before you head their way.

States where Black Friday is considered a holiday:

Remember just because a state celebrates Black Friday doesn't mean that your local bank will be closed.

We recommend calling your local branch ahead of time to confirm their hours or searching for updated holiday hours on Google.

Can I still use the ATM?

You should still be able to withdraw cash from ATMs on Black Friday even if the bank is closed.

You should also still be given the option to withdraw cashback from most big retail chains that typically offer the option at checkout.

The daily limits of cash you will be allowed to withdraw will depend on your bank and the limits you have set in your account.

It's always a good idea to stock up beforehand if you're going shopping somewhere that doesn't take debit or credit cards.

2 SHARES

Union Pacific have highlighted efforts to address climate change and outlined long-term strategies to reduce GHG emissions in their Climate Action Plan.

Union Pacific Railroad has published its second comprehensive Climate Action Plan highlighting the significant and innovative steps taken to address climate change while outlining long-term strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieve net zero by 2050.

“Last year we embarked on a journey to improve our environmental footprint and build a more sustainable economy for generations to come” Beth Whited Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resource Officer for Union Pacific said. “Our mission continues and we remain committed to finding and embracing bold solutions to address climate change and achieve net zero emissions.”

Commitment to net zero

Since the publication of its first Climate Action Plan in 2021 Union Pacific has taken considerable steps to reduce its environmental impact including increasing the use of low-carbon fuels and reducing fuel consumption by more than 11 million gallons in 2021 compared with 2020.

Union Pacific have also reaffirmed its commitment to reach net zero GHG emissions. Last month Union Pacific joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C an alliance of more than 3000 companies pledged to taking bold action to limit global warming to 1.5°C. As part of that pledge we committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to revalidate our short-term target in line with the 1.5°C global warming scenario and develop a long-term science-based target to reach net zero value chain GHG emissions by 2050.

During 2022 Union Pacific conducted an extensive climate scenario analysis to better understand the hypothetical impacts of climate change on its operations infrastructure supply chains and customers under both high- and low-carbon future scenarios. The analysis is being used to evaluate and develop potential strategies that address both future risks and opportunities arising from climate change.

Highlights of the 2022 Action Plan

Additional highlights of Union Pacific’s 2022 Climate Action Plan include:

Continued modernisation of existing locomotives – During 2021 Union Pacific continued modernising its locomotive fleet by upgrading 120 older units. These modernisations not only improve locomotive reliability but make each unit up to five per cent more fuel efficient and emit approximately 53 per cent less emissions. In 2022 Union Pacific announced the largest-ever investment in modernised locomotives in rail industry history: an agreement with Wabtec Corporation for 600 locomotive modernisations worth more than $1 billion

Plans to purchase new battery electric locomotives – Union Pacific announced plans to purchase North America’s largest carrier-owned fleet of battery-electric locomotives for testing in freight yard operations and are piloting this technology in its early adoption phase to better understand how it could be deployed at scale in operations

Increased use of renewable and biofuels – Working together with locomotive and fuel suppliers Union Pacific increased its use of renewable diesel and biofuels. 2021 low-carbon fuel consumption rose to three per cent of total diesel consumed up from 2.2 per cent in 2020. As the end of 2022 approaches this number is climbing above four per cent

Improved Energy Management System (EMS) utilisation – In 2021 Union Pacific’s full-year fuel consumption rate improved one per cent a new record low. This represents the third consecutive year Union Pacific improved fuel consumption rate on a year-over-year basis. By the end of 2022 EMS will have been implemented in approximately three-quarters of Union Pacific’s active road fleet

The first U.S. railroad to formally support the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) – This reinforces Union Pacific’s commitment to transparent disclosure. Union Pacific is committed to continuing to implement the TCFD framework in its climate reporting.

“We must continue to be forward thinking in our initiatives to see reductions in our absolute emissions. Climate change is caused by human behaviour and recognising our community impact is imperative” Maqui Parkerson Vice President of Labour Relations and Sustainability for Union Pacific said. “As a leader in the rail industry and critical link in the supply chain we will continue to strive to be a leader in the overall climate solution.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcm9jaGVsbGVuZXdzLWxlYWRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9ncm91bmRicmVha2luZy1ldmVudC1oZWxkLWZvci1yb2NoZWxsZS1pbnRlcm1vZGFsLXRyYW5zbG9hZC1jZW50ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Groundbreaking event held for Rochelle Intermodal Transload Center,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://rochellenews-leader.com/article/groundbreaking-event-held-for-rochelle-intermodal-transload-center/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcm9jaGVsbGVuZXdzLWxlYWRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9ncm91bmRicmVha2luZy1ldmVudC1oZWxkLWZvci1yb2NoZWxsZS1pbnRlcm1vZGFsLXRyYW5zbG9hZC1jZW50ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Credit: Tomek Baginski / Unsplash.

Heathrow Airport (LHR) in London UK is set to face a major disruption with Menzies’ ground handlers staging a three-day walkout over a wage dispute.

This strike by 350 of the UK’s Unite union members started at 4am local time on Friday 18 November.

It is said to come after Menzies’ ‘derisory’ pay proposals.

According to the trade union the offers made by Menzies are below the existing real inflation rate of 14.2% (RPI) and amount to a ‘substantial real terms pay cut’.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Unite’s members at Menzies play a critical role in ensuring that aeroplanes operate safely at Heathrow. Menzies is a wealthy company that can fully afford to pay its workers a decent pay increase.

“It is greed not need which is preventing a fair pay offer from being made. Unite’s members at Menzies will receive the union’s comprehensive support.”

The 72-hour strike will result in delays and cancellations for flights taking off from Heathrow Terminals 2 3 and 4.

Furthermore the union said that the walkout would impact various carriers including Air Canada American Airlines Lufthansa Swiss Air Air Portugal Austrian Airlines Qantas Egypt Air Aer Lingus and Finnair.

Unite regional officer Kevin Hall said: “The strike action will inevitably cause serious delays for passengers at Heathrow but this dispute is entirely of Menzies’ own making. It has had every opportunity to make our members’ a fair pay offer but it has stubbornly refused to do so.”

In September United Airlines Holdings staff at Heathrow Airport opened a ballot on whether to take industrial action over wages citing issues such as ‘outsourcing threats’ made by the carrier.

Source: David Odisho/Getty Images

With employees and advertisers fleeing Twitter Inc. Elon Musk's plans to grow subscription revenue are both more important and more implausible than ever.

When Musk pitched his purchase of Twitter to investors he said he expected to grow Twitter's revenue to $26.4 billion by 2028 including $10 billion in subscription revenue according to an investor pitch deck viewed by The New York Times in May. Twitter generated $5.08 billion in revenue in 2021 with the vast majority — $4.51 billion — coming from advertising.

While diversifying Twitter's revenue stream to make the microblogging platform less reliant on advertising is a laudable goal analysts and industry experts say it will be difficult to grow subscription revenue in the manner outlined by Musk. They also note that major advertisers are already shifting budgets away from the platform.

""[Musk] could promise the world"" said Luke Lintz founder and CEO of HighKey Enterprises a social media and digital marketing consulting firm. ""But there's no concrete data to back that up.""

Feeling blue

Few other social media platforms have a subscription offering and those that do derive minimal revenue from them Lintz noted. Microsoft Corp.'s LinkedIn Corp. has a multi-tiered subscription plan starting at $39.99 per month and Snap Inc.'s Snapchat+ subscription is $3.99 per month.

Musk's first effort to raise subscription revenue — the Twitter Blue Verified subscription feature which charges users $7.99 per month for a blue ""verified"" checkmark — was paused after a slew of fake tweets from ""verified"" accounts impacted companies across sectors. Shares in pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co. for instance fell after a fake account with a blue verified checkmark tweeted that insulin sold by the company was now free.

""[Musk] may have acted a little bit too fast"" said Daniel Newman founding partner and principal analyst of Futurum Research. ""I think he was of the impression that he could make really quick changes that would right the ship.""

It is also a security risk to have verified users who are not properly scrutinized said Michael Daniel president and CEO of Cyber Threat Alliance a nonprofit advocating for enhanced security of global digital platforms.

Compounding the problem: Twitter has far fewer resources devoted to monitoring the flood of new blue-check accounts and the content produced across the platform after thousands of employees were laid off or resigned over the past week. The latest wave of resignations came Nov. 17 after Musk imposed a deadline for employees to work ""long hours at high intensity"" or take a severance to leave.

If security and content moderation lapse in a noticeable way for users retention could quickly become a major issue.

""If a number of people decide that it's no longer safe or effective to be on it and you start seeing a mass exodus to the door then that effect compounds on itself just like a bank run undermining confidence in a bank"" Daniel said.

Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. Most of the company's communications team was laid off following Musk's takeover.

Advertising axiom

Major advertisers who have dropped their ads from Twitter following Musk's acquisition of the company include General Motors Co. United Airlines Holdings Inc. Pfizer Inc. and Kering SA subsidiary Balenciaga. Musk tweeted Nov. 4 that the advertiser exodus caused a ""massive drop in revenue"" for Twitter and said the departing marketers were ""trying to destroy free speech.""

Persistent macroeconomic headwinds mean advertising will continue to be a challenge not just for Twitter but for social media platforms across the board said Seth Shafer an analyst at Kagan a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence. Advertisers are not cutting off spending entirely but they are more likely to prioritize placing spots with video platforms from companies like Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. than social media companies the analyst said.

""I don't see a path where ad revenues at Twitter are going to grow"" Shafer said.

Those losses will not necessarily benefit Snap or Meta Platforms Inc. though advertisers are likely to allocate some of their ad money budgeted for Twitter to other platforms the analyst added.

""Twitter is not a big enough platform and a lot of these advertisers are spreading their dollars across a lot of different mediums"" Shafer said.",,,,,,,,,

Among the new developments are two UPS Healthcare facilities a new hangar and the expansion of leading aviation training capabilities.

Why it matters: “These investments from the supply chain and healthcare facilities to the flight simulators and the hangar will help us continue to provide our customers with safe reliable on-time service” said UPS EVP and President U.S. Nando Cesarone.

UPS Healthcare’s supply chain footprint will expand with two one-million-square-foot buildings that will join 21 other facilities in the region helping to bring life-saving medication and services to patients and hospitals around the world.

On the ground and in the air: UPS Airlines has begun construction of a second 275000-square-foot aircraft hangar. This building will be large enough to simultaneously park two 747-8s– the largest aircraft in the UPS fleet.

UPS is also investing in the next generation through an expansion of the Global Aviation Training Center. The center represents the future of aviation training and education and will house a total of eight state-of-the-art flight simulators when the project is complete.​

It all happens in Louisville: UPS leaders joined with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and state and city leaders to highlight the new developments as well as a relationship that has spanned decades and has brought significant business growth to the region.

UPS operations in Louisville began with a small facility sorting about 2000 air packages per day in the early 1980s. Today UPS Worldport is a 5.2 million square-foot global facility where more than 12000 UPSers process more than two million packages a day.

At UPS we’re committed to showing up where we live and work investing more than $1.2 billion and creating more than 6200 new jobs in Kentucky in the last five years.

“I’m here because UPS is a place of opportunity. This company creates pathways for people to support their families to go to school to grow” Nando said. “And world-class facilities like UPS Worldport and our operations buildings across Louisville and around the globe are the places that drive these opportunities.”

Transportation contributed $1.3 trillion (5.6%) to the economy in 2021

Transportation services (for-hire in-house and household) contributed $1.3 trillion (5.6%) to an enhanced U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)1 of $23.7 trillion in 2021—as measured by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' (BTS) Transportation Satellite Accounts (TSAs). The TSAs measure the full contribution of transportation to the economy from three types of transportation activities:

$0.7 trillion or 2.9% of 2021 GDP from for-hire transportation

$0.2 trillion or 1.0% of 2021 GDP from transportation activities carried out by non-transportation industries for their own purposes (known as in-house transportation)

$0.4 trillion or 1.7% of 2021 GDP from transportation activities carried out by households using personal motor vehicles.

Accounting for the contribution of in-house and household transportation doubles the overall contribution of transportation to the economy as measured by GDP (figure 1). Including in-house transportation brought transportation up from the sixth largest contributor (out of eight sectors) to the fifth largest contributor to the economy in 2021.

Transportation’s Contribution to the Economy Rose in 2021 from 2020 But Remains Below 2019

The contribution of transportation to enhanced-GDP rose from 5.4% in 2020 to 5.6%in 2021 but remains below the pre-pandemic level of 5.8% in 2019 due to for-hire air rail truck and water transportation contributing less in 2021 than in 2019. For-hire air rail truck and water transportation’s contribution to GDP remained unchanged in 2021 from 2020 (1.3%) but was 0.4 percentage points below its 2019 contribution. All other for-hire2 transportation’s contribution rose 0.1 percentage points in 2021 up from the 2019 and 2020 level (1.5% in 2019 and 2020 to 1.6% in 2021).

The contribution of in-house air rail water and truck transportation rose 0.1 percentage points (from 0.9% in 2020 to 1.0% in 2021); bringing in-house transportation’s contribution to the economy up to the same level as 2019. Household transportation contributed the same share to GDP in 2021 as in 2019 and 2020 (1.7%).

Rosie Ricca human resources manager at A Tool Shed and Robert Pedersen president and CEO at A Tool Shed lay out how their California-based company deals with substance testing.

Rental: Have positive drug tests among workers at your company increased in recent years? If so when did the increase start?

Ricca: Yes I have seen an increase in California since marijuana became legal for recreational use. Other substances did not seem to change in frequency. By 2020 it was definitely typical to see someone with THC still in their system. Our current commercial drivers have been consistent with having clean drug tests however. A precedent has been set within the training of Class A drivers for sobriety.

We used to test all employees. Before hiring one of the tests was marijuana and if they had marijuana in their system they wouldn't be hired. All that has changed now because it was an illegal drug at the time.

We make sure that they do the tests within 24 hours of the job offer so they have to pass it contingent upon the job offer within a day because some of the harder drugs leave your body quicker. If someone has some illegal substance in their system when they're applying for a new job it's probably not a good idea to have them work on heavy equipment.

The commercial drivers are tested randomly and that is done through a third-party administrator so we don't even know when our drivers will be tested.

Editor's Note: California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a bill that does not allow employers to discriminate against workers who smoke weed ""off the job and away from the workplace."" The new law goes into effect Jan. 1 2024.

The law prohibits employers from making hiring firing or other employment decisions based on a drug test that finds ""nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolites"" in someone's hair or urine which do not indicate current impairment but that someone consumed cannabis recently up to weeks prior.

Rental: How should rental companies address positive drug and alcohol tests?

Ricca: It depends on the substance. THC could be in someone’s system from last month and alcohol is about four to six hours. If you suspect someone is intoxicated while working taking them to get tested and terminating if positive for anything except THC would be fair. I think if an employee is a driver they should have random tests even if they are non-CDL and their tests should be 100 percent clean. Regular tests I feel would be invasive. Random testing I feel would be the best way to administer tests.

Rental: How can rental companies help prevent employees from engaging in such activities on the job?

Ricca: We cannot control people outside of work. We offer a lot of tickets to events in the surrounding counties and I think that certainly boosts morale and gives people some leisure time when they are off work. Supporting a work-life balance can help people be more content and hopefully draw habits away from substance abuse.

Rental: What kind of policies and resources can companies put in place to ensure employees follow safe work practices?

Ricca: Setting the expectation that safety procedures need to be followed and encouraging employees to communicate with their manager if they are feeling unable to do certain tasks safely that day. Perhaps they didn’t get any sleep took an over-the-counter or prescribed drug that is inhibiting their abilities and should be on other duties.

They have to know their staff and their team or at least the yard supervisor has to know them in order to see if there's something different going on with how they're working and how they're behaving. Our managers actually have gone through a class so they recognize the issues if somebody is under the influence of either drugs or alcohol or something along those lines. It was 120 minutes and it's based on the Department of Transportation guidelines. It's a training that's done later on at the management level. We've done it about every five years or if a new manager comes on into that position.

Rewarding those who show active use of safety procedures is a good practice. For example “I really appreciate how you always use the safety belt” and “Good idea you’ll need those safety goggles” etc. Support from a supervisor goes a long way.

Rental: What are the consequences of not addressing positive drug tests among employees?

Ricca: If it is positive at onboarding you may want to consider whether this person is to be hired. However this is a difficult decision in the current job market. If someone is positive for THC and not driving for us then I may consider continuing to hire. A discussion with them about how you expect them to be present and prepared at work would be in order. If someone is a current employee and you find they are intoxicated at work the consequences are termination. Potentially they could hurt themselves or someone else just being around the equipment so adding drugs and alcohol to the situation makes the probability of that even higher. It must be addressed.

Pedersen: Safety is a primary concern in our industry when you're working with equipment and other people around it and customers who aren't always familiar with the equipment. I can't stress safety enough and we push it all the time. Drug awareness is just part of that program.

Rental: Is there anything else you’d like to add?

Ricca: Managers must use their knowledge of equipment to observe how an employee is handling that equipment and use their expertise to gauge if that employee is behaving safely. We are not police officers or medical professionals or here to judge anyone. We should be able to know who we can trust with a potentially dangerous piece of equipment just by observing them. Retraining or evaluation of their state of mind may be in order. The other piece is that unless the test is random; a urine five-panel test is easily manipulated a physical exam at the time of onboarding with the drug test may be more telling than the drug screening alone.

Employers also need to be aware that laws are changing about giving employees access to recovery and to be rehabilitated if they have an addiction so it will be treated more as a medical condition.

Expand LyondellBasell Channelview Texas

The potential expansion would involve building a new propylene facility using LyondellBasell's existing technology to convert ethylene into propylene for use in the production of polypropylene and propylene oxide. The related product lines are used to make everyday items such as flexible foam for mattresses cosmetic packaging electrical covering for 5G network infrastructure plastic wrap for food packaging medical syringes vehicle bumpers furniture upholstery and pipe for home plumbing to name a few.

""In addition to the lower carbon emissions than competing technologies we believe the project has more favorable economics compared to other production methods"" said Ken Lane Executive Vice President Global Olefins & Polyolefins. ""The products offered through this investment will be an important element to helping our value chain partners achieve their long-term sustainability ambitions. Additionally this upstream investment would allow us to be less dependent on propylene market supply and demand providing us with the opportunity to serve growing customer needs better.""

A final investment decision on this 400 kiloton propylene expansion project is expected towards the end of next year.

The project would have an annual capacity of 950 million pounds per year. It would increase the company's propylene capacity at the Channelview Complex by more than 35 percent and would create approximately 10-15 new jobs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbWVjb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb25uZXdzLmNvbS81NTQ1OS91bml0ZWQtcmVudGFscy10by1hY3F1aXJlLWFoZXJuLXJlbnRhbHMtZm9yLTJibtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Rentals to acquire Ahern Rentals for $2bn,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='meconstructionnews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /55459/united-rentals-to-acquire-ahern-rentals-for-2bn (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60ECEB040>, 'Connection to meconstructionnews.com timed out.

Arizona-based Cat dealer Empire Southwest has agreed to acquire Nevada-based Cat dealer Cashman Equipment. The transaction is expected to close in December.

Cashman Cat with seven locations serving Nevada and parts of eastern California has been in business since 1931. Empire which was founded in 1950 operates 22 dealership locations serving Arizona and southeastern California. Both companies are third-generation family-owned Cat dealers.

The combined company will be led by Empire CEO Jeff Whiteman and will continue to serve clients in the construction mining energy agricultural and industrial sectors as well as offer expanded capabilities to serve one of the country’s fastest-growing areas the company says.

Commenting on the acquisition Whiteman said “We have tremendous respect and admiration for MaryKaye Cashman and her team. Cashman is a very high-performing dealership that has been dedicated to their people customers and communities for generations.

""We are honored and humbled by the trust MaryKaye and Caterpillar have placed in us. Like Empire the Cashman organization is full of amazing men and women who are committed to making things better. I’m confident that the new combined team will take the business in both service territories to new levels of client success by building on the industry-leading strengths of both dealerships.”

MaryKaye Cashman owner CEO and chairman of Cashman Equipment added “Since taking the reins of the company in 1995 I have dedicated my life to Cashman Equipment and our fantastic team which has done such exceptional work supporting our customers and rallying around me in my unique and new role as the head of a Cat dealership.

""Empire has long had a reputation for excellence among Cat dealers and as I pursue a new chapter in my life it is an exciting opportunity for our teams to be able to join forces. I have known the Whiteman family for decades and appreciate not just what their company does but how they have built it – with honesty respect and integrity and with employees and customers always at the center. Our cultures and values share a lot of common ground and I know that our team members will thrive in this new combined business that will deliver even more for the customers and communities we serve.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2Jlc3QtcGxhY2VzLXRvLWJ1eS1hLWxha2UtaG91c2UtaW4tdGhlLXVzLTY4Mjc3MTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Best Places to Buy a Lake House in the U.S. in 2023,"Lakes are quintessential all-American vacation destinations. Regardless of which side of the lake versus ocean debate you fall on you can't argue with the fact that the former provides a year-round reprieve from our busy lives along with an endless supply of water sports idyllic views and cool breezes. And with approximately 480000 lakes dotting the continental U.S. chances are there's a natural or man-made option a quick drive from your home.

So no wonder lakefront properties are an increasingly popular real estate investment. But as demand has risen so have prices. That's why vacation rental company Evolve put together a list of the best places to buy a lake house in 2023.

The company looked at three main factors when evaluating the data: median home value estimated yearly expenses and vacation rental performance metrics for lake house destinations across the U.S.

""When determining the best places to buy a lake house we look at destinations that have advantages for both potential investors and future guests"" Louis Olds director of real estate at Evolve told Travel + Leisure.

Saranac Lake New York

This historic mountain town in the Adirondacks tops Evolve's ranking thanks to its affordable median home prices ($250190) and great rental potential ($25294). Located in upstate New York — with proximity to not one but several lakes including Lake Placid — the charming destinations has a bustling cultural scene with year-round activities events markets and festivals only adding to its appeal with renters. In the winter the town becomes a major ski destination. Visitors can enjoy 15 acres of skiable terrain that's also perfect for snow tubing and snowshoeing.

Branson Missouri

Branson is a magnet for vacationers of all ages with many family-friendly activities in the area including theme parks live entertainment and hundreds of miles of scenic shoreline courtesy of Table Rock Lake. With a relatively low median home value — just over $232000 — the destination is an excellent option for first-time investors seeking an affordable property with good rental potential — almost $20000 a year according to Evolve.

Brainerd Lakes Minnesota

The Brainerd Lakes area sits in the heart of Minnesota and is home to some of the state's most scenic lakes (when your nickname is the ""Land of 10000 Lakes"" that says something about the region). Water sports and fishing are favorite pastimes here but with seven championship golf courses so is golfing.

The abundance of recreational activities available in the dozens of small towns here is excellent news for potential investors. Evolve experts note the average cap rate for lake houses in the region is around 5% with median rental revenue slightly over $27000. According to the company lakefront cabins and homes with decks fire pits and grills perform better than any other rental property type.

Traverse City Michigan

Known as the Cherry Capital of the World Traverse City located on the banks of Lake Michigan also sits close to vineyards wineries and most importantly several smaller lakes where investors can find prime real estate at much lower prices. Families flock to the towns around Silver Lake and Island Lake to profit from their calm waters and tranquil surroundings. Evolve estimates that a home in the area will bring in on average $33500 a year with an initial investment of about $425000 which is the median listing home price.

Smith Mountain Lake Virginia

Nicholas Carty/Getty Images

While Virginia is home to Lake Anna which can make investors close to $80000 in annual income lakefront homes in the area have unicorn status and if they do come along they feature a hefty price tag. Instead consider Smith Mountain Lake which boasts a 500-mile shoreline (more than double that of Lake Anna) with waterfront houses in the $500000 to $1 million range. While that likely still sounds like a lot you're looking at more than $33000 of yearly income. Add to that Virginia's low property taxes and the region's natural draw with vacationers and investing in the Smith Mountain Lake area makes plenty of sense.

Granbury Texas

Dallas residents love escaping to Granbury for its historic character and outdoor activities many of them on the water thanks to Lake Granbury and Brazos River.

Rest assured that a house here is a sound investment. According to Evolve data properties are booked for more than six months out of the year so owners can expect to add $28305 to their yearly income. Of course if you're hoping to make more invest in a house with direct water access but also be prepared to pay more than the median listing price which is $394776 for the area.

Pocono Lake Pennsylvania

New Yorkers love the serenity and sheer beauty of the Pocono Lake area and all the year-round outdoor activities it offers (skiing hiking and fishing to name a few). So if you have your eyes on the region you can count on a steady stream of urban renters seeking a place to escape the hustle and bustle of the big city (the area is about a two-hour drive from Manhattan).

Compared to similar lake destinations Pocono Lake is also pretty affordable in terms of listing price — $273682. But Evolve experts recommend hiring an experienced real estate agent familiar with the HOA rules and regulations in this area.

Norris Lake Tennessee

Tucked away in the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains Norris Lake has 800 miles of shoreline two rivers and several creeks plus it's pure heaven for nature and water sports enthusiasts catering to both adrenaline seekers (waterskiing anyone?) and those wanting the more quiet laid-back lifestyle of boating (there are 20 marinas on the lake).

Due to its relative proximity to Knoxville the region is a popular vacation home destination (it's the second-largest market for a lake property in the state) but if you house hunt in places such as LaFollette or New Tazewell you may find a home for under $500000. And with a cap rate of 4.4% investors are looking at about $27000 in potential income.

Lake of the Ozarks Missouri

Notoriously scenic the northern part of the Ozarks is home to epic fall foliage beautiful small towns and an endless list of recreational opportunities. The lake buzzes with boats during the summer while golf courses are packed with players. The off-season brings travelers seeking tranquility stunning lakefront views and fewer crowds.

Evolve's data shows that median home values here are a little less than $345000 with a cap rate of 4.3%. The company's experts recommend searching for a property in Gravois Mills Osage Beach and Lake Ozark to maximize your rental income.

Gilford New Hampshire

Cappi Thompson/Getty Images

Located on the southern shore of Lake Winnipesaukee Gilford is the quintessential New England lake town offering picture-perfect vistas hiking and biking trails boating and a vibrant music scene at Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion a 9000-seat concert venue. In the winter skiers and snowboarders flock to Gunstock Mountain Resort to enjoy its 49 trails and 227 skiable acres.

While waterfront mansions here come with multimillion-dollar price tags and an array of luxe amenities you can also find more modest homes that are in line with Gilford's median listing home value of $518389. You can expect to earn about $30000 in rental income which means a cap rate of 4%.

Lake Havasu City Arizona

Matthew Micah Wright/Getty Images

Drawing visitors from three states (California Arizona and Nevada) Lake Havasu City is a four-season destination set against the dramatic backdrop of the Mojave Desert. The lake offers renters a cooling respite from the hot Arizona sun along with a wealth of water activities and sandy beaches.

And while home prices are not necessarily on the lower end — the median listing value here is about $500000 — and waterfront properties are hard to find if you invest in a residence with at least three bedrooms a pool and a shaded patio your chances of having it rented for long periods of time will significantly increase.

Big Bear Lake California

Adrian Rudd/Travel + Leisure

Dubbed the ""jewel of the San Bernardino National Forest"" Big Bear Lake is a four-season lake destination that treats visitors to gorgeous views rugged nature excellent ski facilities hiking trails historic sites and much more.

As you may imagine it's not cheap to own property in a place so dreamy and popular as Big Bear Lake but your investment (the median listing price is $643468) will pay off as this is a region that draws vacationers from Phoenix and Las Vegas throughout the year."

From June 1 through Nov. 14 services and procedures performed by WakeMed hospitals outpatient clinics and specialists were charged at out-of-network prices for subscribers to some 20000 UnitedHealthcare subscribers.

The dispute left those with existing doctor-patient relationships and on-going treatments scrambling or shelling out more.

UnitedHealthcare described the new agreement as a ""multi-year relationship"" but did not include details of the length of the contract or any new costs to subscribers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL3BheWVycy91bml0ZWRoZWFsdGhjYXJlLWFhcnAtdGVhbS1sb3dlci1jb3N0LWhlYXJpbmctYWlkc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UnitedHealthcare AARP team up to lower the cost of hearing aids,"UnitedHealthcare and AARP are teaming up on a new program to reduce the cost of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids.

Hearing loss affects 48 million people in the U.S. and is ranked as the third most common chronic condition. In August the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids directly to consumers.

Through AARP Hearing Solutions which UnitedHealthcare is now administering the nearly 38 million members of AARP can buy hearing aids through UnitedHealthcare Hearing. Prices start as low as $699 per hearing aid according to the company and members also get professional support from a licensed hearing professional plus personalized assistance from UnitedHealthcare Hearing during and after purchase.

For many people without a hearing health care plan or insurance coverage that offers savings on hearing aids access to care and high prices have historically been barriers to obtaining treatment for hearing loss with the price of one prescription hearing aid typically ranging between $1000 and $4000. About 80% of people who could benefit from using a hearing aid don’t have one according to the Hearing Loss Association of America.

Untreated hearing loss is linked to higher rates of depression and dementia as well as increased risk of falls according to UnitedHealthcare executives.

""We sit in a unique spot where as part of United Healthcare we see the whole health of an individual and firmly believe that hearing health is part of overall health and well-being"" Dave Falda CEO of UnitedHealthcare Hearing said in an interview.

""Hearing loss unfortunately impacts millions of individuals across the country and many don't seek care. Programs like this really bring visibility consistency and transparency that allows people to ultimately seek more care"" he said. ""Hearing loss is tied to things like dementia it has ties to social isolation and depression greater risk of falls and greater risk of hospitalization. This program is not just about the technology and the savings it's also about the importance of treating hearing health as part of your overall health.""

The program does not require users to have UnitedHealthcare insurance but they must be AARP members.

""It’s a new audience for us to reach. With hearing health care on the rise it's a great opportunity while there's such awareness and appeal to make sure that we can reach an audience that is absolutely looking for something like this"" Falda said.

Through the program AARP members also have access to UnitedHealthcare Hearing’s national provider network of thousands of hearing health care professionals for no-cost hearing tests and in-person assistance for fittings adjustments and support plus direct delivery and virtual care options the organizations said.

""While OTC hearing aids are a big opportunity right now for delivering hearing healthcare to a wider audience right now the most trusted and proven method is through in-person care. We have hearing care professionals throughout the country that can deliver in-person care. While AARP members are in the office they can receive a hearing test which starts the journey and allows them to get educated on the process. They'll walk members through the options and then ultimately there are great savings on prescription hearing aids in that office setting"" Falda said.

The program also enables AARP members to access program pricing on OTC hearing aids which are a new option for people with self-diagnosed mild to moderate hearing loss. After completing an optional online hearing test AARP members can order OTC hearing aids from brands including Jabra Enhance Plus and Lexie B2 powered by Bose.

""We've been able to begin to strike partnerships within that arena to bring over-the-counter products to the market as well"" Falda said.

As the OTC hearing aid market is new to consumers Falda sees opportunities for UnitedHealthcare to serve as an educational resource as the market evolves.

""We will continue to evaluate OTC products. There are many coming to market and it will certainly be a great chance for more solutions but it's also more confusing because there are many options. We certainly want to be able to be a trusted point of truth to steer people toward proven solutions. I think our website will be a great resource for folks to research and get guided in the right direction"" he said.

Greg Marion AARP Services senior vice president of health products and services said offering members exclusive pricing on over-the-counter hearing aids could be a ""game changer for people with untreated hearing loss.""

""By providing members with hearing aid options that are best-in-class and affordable we found that UnitedHealthcare Hearing was the best fit to serve AARP members' hearing care needs"" Marion said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5oYnIuY29tL2dyb3VwLWR5bmFtaWNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Group dynamics,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5oYnIuY29tL2dyb3VwLWR5bmFtaWNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E6108A6EF0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5oYnIuY29tL2dyb3VwLWR5bmFtaWNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzY2hhbWJlci5jb20vb24tZGVtYW5kL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvaW5jcmVhc2luZy1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1hY2Nlc3MtYW5kLWhlYWx0aC1lcXVpdHktZm9yLWFsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Businesses Can Help Increase Health Care Access,"Access to health care is an ongoing issue in the U.S. especially among lower-income communities. Increasing health equity and fair access for all requires action from businesses and government systems alike.

At the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s 2022 Business Solves Corporate Citizenship Conference  industry experts spoke about how businesses are taking action to create a healthier future for all and achieve health equity.

Health Equity Involves More than Access to Clinical Care

Jay Bhatt Executive Director at Deloitte Center for Health Solutions and Deloitte Health Equity Institute  stressed that clinical care is only one facet of health care.

“I see the ills of our country show up in my exam room on my telemedicine visits [and] in the homes of patients I care for” Bhatt said. “I've come to the realization that health inequities [are] America's chronic condition. We've continued to put Band-aids on or not even address these issues rather than thinking more upstream about that.""

Bhatt compared the current health care challenges to the saying: “Give a man a fish feed him for a day; teach a man to fish feed him for a lifetime.”

“When we think about the complexity of health equity and that old adage: What about teaching women?” Bhatt continued. “What about communities that are historically denied fishing equipment?

What about the pond being polluted? That's [how] health equity … shows up.”

“There are differences among people where there shouldn't be those differences” he said. “How do we give everyone the possibility and the opportunity to have a fair and just shot at health and wellbeing?”

Bhatt noted that after treating his patients he feels he is sending them back to the same conditions that made them sick in the first place.

“We can do everything right clinically but they could still have worsening outcomes” he said.

Health Equity Depends on Identifying and Addressing Health Disparities Within Communities

According to Tracy Malone President of United Health Foundation and SVP of UnitedHealth Group  “about 80% of what influences a person's health actually happens outside a medical clinic or a doctor’s office.”

“We really look at data at the population level to get insights on what [is] causing these health disparities” Malone said. “The United Health Foundation has been looking at this for years through our America's Health Rankings platform … and we're able to use this data to really identify health disparities by race ethnicity gender age geography income and education to really inform the actions we take as a company to advance health.”

Last year UnitedHealth Group issued its inaugural America's Health Rankings (AHR) Health Disparities Report . Malone summed up the report’s noteworthy data points.

“Women have a 70% higher rate of depression compared to men and those with less than a high school education actually had 123% higher incidents of frequent mental distress” said Malone. “Even more concerning were the widening racial disparities that we continue to see in maternal health … [like] the persistent disparities for Black mothers and their high rates of maternal mortality.”

“We take that data and how we put that into action is we really use it to help us formulate our community partnerships” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzLmlucXVpcmVyLm5ldC8zNzMzOTIvdW5jb21wcm9taXNpbmctcHVyc3VpdC1vZi1leGNlbGxlbmNlLWtleS10by1vcHR1bS1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy1zdWNjZXNzLWluLWdsb2JhbC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1zZXJ2aWNlc9IBjQFodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzLmlucXVpcmVyLm5ldC8zNzMzOTIvdW5jb21wcm9taXNpbmctcHVyc3VpdC1vZi1leGNlbGxlbmNlLWtleS10by1vcHR1bS1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy1zdWNjZXNzLWluLWdsb2JhbC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1zZXJ2aWNlcy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uncompromising pursuit of excellence key to Optum Philippines’ success in global health care services,"Filipinos have long been recognized for their talent in various fields including outstanding healthcare services both locally and abroad. According to Managing Director Ivic Mueco Optum Global Solutions a member of the UnitedHealth Group can attribute its success to the great work that its Filipino workforce has contributed.

“As the largest global in-house center in the country we’ve made it our goal to harness and nurture Filipino talent which has been recognized anywhere we go” shares Mueco. “Aside from praises about the unparalleled quality of care and service we offer the consistent feedback from our partners and clients always includes Filipino talent as innovative and agile workers. Whenever problems arise however dire the situation or tight the deadline Filipinos will always find creative solutions and deliver results.”

Mueco says that it is the dedication and performance-driven mindset of local talent that have enabled Optum’s success here in the past 10 years. As the only health services company in the country specializing in whole-person health Optum is uniquely positioned to positively impact member experience in a more holistic way.

“The breadth and spread of our work allows us to touch on all aspects of health care resulting in best-in-class customer service because of our consistent delivery of accurate and speedy resolutions for our members.”

Furthermore in the clinical space Optum’s people programs train and empower nurses to deliver value-based care making a healthier life more accessible and more affordable to more people.

What initially started with 52 employees in its Quezon City operations in 2011 has now grown to a workforce of over 21000 spread across five locations around the country. This growth has also propelled Optum’s revenue to P15 billion in 2022.

“We’ve seen that Filipinos have a lot of potential and we at Optum would like to maximize this potential and encourage career growth by continuing to upskill our employees and provide them opportunities to expand their knowledge and nurture their talents. This way we are able to give the best care to our clients while opening up more opportunities for our employees” continues Mueco.

In the last decade Optum has reaped awards such as the Exceptional Story recognition from the Contact Center Association of the Philippines for its Virtual Reality-enabled learning program an initiative that provides learning opportunities for nurses that will expand their knowledge and enhance the quality of clinical patient care they will provide.

Aside from the Virtual Reality-enabled learning program Optum looks for more ways to elevate and bring forward Filipino talent. Through the USRN Academy they are able to provide company-sponsored self-paced training resources and support to nurses preparing for the US licensure exams. Another program worth mentioning is the Certified Professional Coders Academy which enables team members from different fields to develop skills in medical coding.

By fostering great talent the company has been able to maintain a double-digit growth rate in the last few years which allowed the company to bag PEZA’s Outstanding Exporter Award. The award reinforced the company’s success as it yielded results in export sales with an average 26.5% in growth from 2018 to 2020.

Beyond the awards they’ve earned Mueco stresses that successes aren’t just about achieving the bottom line. “At Optum growing our company does not just mean expanding and meeting our targets. With the challenges that the country and the rest of the world have been facing the importance of taking care of your team and keeping the community intact and happy have been even more apparent.”

This commitment to putting employee welfare first goes beyond the compassionate and nurturing environment Optum has built in the workplace. It also manifests in how employees and their families are given support to weather any storm – whether it’s a global pandemic or a severe typhoon like Odette (international name: Rai) which affected many of its employees in Cebu late last year.

“The continued investment of the UHG enterprise in our Philippine business is a reinforcement of the confidence in our ability to deliver high-quality service to keep the healthcare ecosystem of Optum and UnitedHealthcare running smoothly and efficiently” said Mueco. “Most recently Optum was recognized by UnitedHealthcare as its Partner of the Year in 2022 for consistently providing excellent care to the members it serves and its significant contribution to the overall mission of the company.”

“Optum looks to further a culture of compassion and care for our employees the clients we serve and the communities we are a part of.

Health Minister Adrian Dix left attends a news conference with Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé right with their provincial counterparts in Vancouver earlier this month.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Brian Day is the medical director of Cambie Surgery Centre in Vancouver and a former president of the Canadian Medical Association. Cambie Surgeries Corporation was one of the plaintiffs in a recent legal challenge seeking to have certain sections of British Columbia’s Medicare Protection Act declared unconstitutional. The B.C. courts ruled in favour of the B.C. government. Cambie is currently seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

In a recent highly publicized meeting in Vancouver our 13 provincial and territorial health ministers met with their federal counterpart to seek solutions to a self-inflicted crisis. The summit of 14 ministers – each of whom preside over a bloated bureaucracy that was almost 11 times as large as Germany’s on a per-capita basis in 2011 – was aimed at helping the millions of Canadians without timely access to quality medical care.

Earlier this month the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) announced that total health spending in Canada is forecast to hit a new record high of $331-billion this year which would represent 12.2 per cent of our GDP. That makes us the highest spender of all similarly developed countries that offer universal care – and yet one of the worst performers.

The facts speak for themselves. A 2021 Commonwealth Fund study ranked 11 countries’ health care systems based on access to care care process administrative efficiency equity and health care outcomes; Canada ranked 10th above only the U.S. which does not have universal care. According to the Fraser Institute’s analysis of OECD data examining 2019 Canada ranks 26th of 28 OECD countries in available physicians 14th in available nurses and 25th in available acute-care beds per thousand population.

In 2016 we had nine times as many patients who had to wait four months or longer for surgery as the French and 18 times as many as the Germans. For each hospital discharge Canadians paid double that of the OECD median of countries that offer universal care. Last year more than 11000 Canadians died waiting for surgeries diagnostic scans and appointments with specialists according to the think tank SecondStreet.org. And The Globe and Mail found that as of this summer only one in five British Columbians referred to an oncologist received a first consultation within the recommended period of two weeks despite the importance of timely treatment in cancer care.

In the 2021 Commonwealth Fund report Canada was also ranked last in equity of the 10 countries with universal care. Our government agencies have documented that Canadians of a lower socioeconomic status have the worst health outcomes and the worst access to care. Any claims that our current system looks after the poor and those in need are false.

But at the Vancouver meeting the provinces strongly rejected any suggestion that additional funding for our reeling health care system be subjected to performance monitoring. Being accountable is apparently considered inappropriate.

Provincial and territorial governments seem to have ignored the lessons of the 2004 First Ministers’ meeting on health care at which they agreed on a 10-year accord with added spending of $41-billion. Then-prime minister Paul Martin called it “the fix for a generation”; it fixed nothing. Now that generation of politicians is gone and accountability is a forgotten issue. Perhaps that’s why our current politicians are seeking a similar approach – another massive cash infusion to the provinces and territories – rather than looking for real solutions.

The governments’ proposal to prop up the status quo with stopgap funding only defers responsibility to a future generation. The current group of politicians won’t be there to worry about being re-elected.

Governments also plan in three-to-four-year electoral cycles and by doing so they often conveniently ignore past errors and omissions. In the early 1990s governments decided that our doctors and nurses were treating too many patients and blamed them for rising health costs. Their solution was to cut medical school spots reduce immigrant health workers and close nursing schools. When I came to Canada in the 1970s we ranked among the top in the world in doctors per population; we now rank 69th. Governments are lamenting the shortages they created.

In a recent statement the Canadian Nurses Association and the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions declared that “Canada faces one of the worst health-care crises and nursing shortages in its history.” They are right about the crisis but it is our hospitals rather than Canada that face the shortage. Among developed countries we have an above-average number of nurses but by failing to deliver on promises of timely care governments have allowed front-line health care workers to endure the brunt of patients’ frustration – creating a toxic environment in hospitals that many workers have chosen to simply leave.

For many decades we have lived with false promises. The current problems are not new. I could quote from numerous headlines from more than 25 years ago describing a health care crisis in Canada. The suggested strategy of propping up a failed system by pouring in more tax funds corresponds to the maxim sometimes attributed to Albert Einstein that doing the same thing over and over again while expecting different results is a form of insanity. Consistent with that approach B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix called for yet another national conference at the conclusion of the most recent summit. Canadian governments have previously called for hundreds of royal commissions and task forces about health care. They are a well-used strategy to evade responsibility or the need for action.

Some have also suggested that taxpayers should simply pay more through federal rather than provincial taxes. But that proposal ignores the reality of our struggling system and the reality that both sets of taxes would be extracted from the same Canadians.

Real solutions are available including from the top-performing social democracies in the world that outrank us in equity and access. We must end for instance the practice of funding hospitals in lump sums once a year so that each ensuing patient visit does not then represent a cost to the facility. In other countries each public patient brings revenue paid by the state which creates an internal market that incentivizes quicker and better care from hospitals that want more revenue.

The provinces should also introduce a care guarantee that patients must not wait longer than a benchmark time beyond which it is demonstrated that harm may result. If that time is exceeded the government must fund care elsewhere even if that involves funding private care or travel to another province or country.

Finally we must eliminate our unique state-enforced monopoly and allow non-government competition with private insurers and providers. Every other country in the world allows that option. Concerns about low-income Canadians being unable to afford private care can be addressed by ensuring public care is so good that private options are unnecessary or alternatively by funding their private care.

A 2022 poll by the firm One Persuades showed that nearly 75 per cent of Canadians believe private insurance should be allowed to access care in the face of unacceptably long waiting lists paralleling a similar finding in a 2018 Ipsos survey. Governments need to listen to this majority. The only special-interest groups that deserve consideration are patients suffering under the status quo. If they fail in this they will only prove what Winston Churchill said in 1903: “Governments create nothing and have nothing to give but what they have first taken away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndoby5pbnQvbmV3cy9pdGVtLzE4LTExLTIwMjItd2hvLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtb3JhbC1oZWFsdGgtbmVnbGVjdC1hZmZlY3RpbmctbmVhcmx5LWhhbGYtb2YtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXMtcG9wdWxhdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WHO highlights oral health neglect affecting nearly half of the world's population,"A new Global Oral Health Status Report published today by the World Health Organization (WHO) provides the first-ever comprehensive picture of oral disease burden with data profiles for 194 countries giving unique insights into key areas and markers of oral health that are relevant for decision-makers.

The report shows that almost half of the world’s population (45% or 3.5 billion people) suffer from oral diseases with 3 out of every 4 affected people living in low- and middle-income countries. Global cases of oral diseases have increased by 1 billion over the last 30 years—a clear indication that many people do not have access to prevention and treatment of oral diseases.



“Oral health has long been neglected in global health but many oral diseases can be prevented and treated with the cost-effective measures outlined in this report” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “WHO is committed to providing guidance and support to countries so that all people wherever they live and whatever their income have the knowledge and tools needed to look after their teeth and mouths and to access services for prevention and care when they need them.”



Rapid increase of oral diseases

The most common oral diseases are dental caries (tooth decay) severe gum disease tooth loss and oral cancers. Untreated dental caries is the single most common condition globally affecting an estimated 2.5 billion people. Severe gum disease – a major cause of total tooth loss – is estimated to affect 1 billion people worldwide. About 380 000 new cases of oral cancers are diagnosed every year.



The report underscores the glaring inequalities in access to oral health services with a huge burden of oral diseases and conditions affecting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. People on low incomes people living with disabilities older people living alone or in care homes those living in remote and rural communities and people from minority groups carry a higher burden of oral diseases.

This pattern of inequalities is similar to other noncommunicable diseases such as cancers cardiovascular diseases diabetes and mental disorders. Risk factors common to noncommunicable diseases such as high sugar intake all forms of tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol all contribute to the global oral health crisis.



Barriers to delivering oral health services

Only a small percentage of the global population is covered by essential oral health services and those with the greatest need often have the least access to services. The key barriers to delivering access to oral health services for all include:

Oral health care requires high out-of-pocket expenditures. This often leads to catastrophic costs and significant financial burden for families and communities. The provision of oral health services largely relies on highly specialized providers using expensive high-tech equipment and materials and these services are not well integrated with primary health care models. Poor information and surveillance systems combined with low priority for public oral health research are major bottlenecks to developing more effective oral health interventions and policies.



Opportunities to improve global oral health

The report showcases many promising opportunities to improve the state of global oral health including:

adopting a public health approach by addressing common risk factors through promoting a well-balanced diet low in sugars stopping use of all forms of tobacco reducing alcohol consumption and improving access to effective and affordable fluoride toothpaste;

planning oral health services as part of national health and improving integration of oral health services in primary health care as part of universal health coverage;

redefining oral health workforce models to respond to population needs and expanding competencies of non-dental healthcare workers to expand oral health service coverage; and

strengthening information systems by collecting and integrating oral health data into national health monitoring systems.

“Placing people at the heart of oral health services is critical if we are to achieve the vision of universal health coverage for all individuals and communities by 2030” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen WHO Director for Noncommunicable Diseases.



She added: “This report acts as a starting point by providing baseline information to help countries monitor progress of implementation while also providing timely and relevant feedback to decision-makers at the national level. Together we can change the current situation of oral health neglect.”

Like Banquo’s ghost the issue of universal free dental care keeps hovering into sight at Labour’s top table. ‘Tis a goodly progressive idea but it is also one that’s been done in repeatedly down the years by the shafts of political expedience some of which were fired again this week by Finance Minister Grant Robertson:

[Robertson] said dental care had to sit alongside many other priorities in the health sector. Going straight to universal dental care right away would be well over a billion dollars a year of extra funding we have to weigh that up against the other things that are needed in the health system.""

This is very misleading. The billion dollars figure is what New Zealanders spend annually on dental care in a very largely privatised fee-unregulated user pays environment. In reality an increase in government funded dental care (state subsidies are currently costing about $100 million annually) could be phased in as part of a national dental plan that would include funding to recruit and upskill the dentistry workforce. To offset some of the longer term costs such a plan should also include obvious preventative measures such as (a) a tax on sugared beverages and (b) a nationwide fluoridisation programme that is actually carried out.

As things stand dental care is a socially regressive area of unmet need that’s screaming out for government attention. As the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists (ASMS) pointed out in their latest research study released this week the 9000 residents of Wairoa have lacked adult dental health services for the past two years. This is just one example among many of unmet community needs. Yet this supposedly centre-left government is sniffing that it has other priorities.

As indicated the transition to universal free dental care could readily be phased in at considerably lower costs than those cited by Robertson. That is… According to these Health Ministry cost estimates revealed by Newshub in 2020 after concerted attempts had been made by the authorities to keep the figures under wraps:

$96 million to cover everyone up to their 27th birthday

$17 million to cover low-income pregnant women

$30 million for low-income parents and caregivers

$5.5 million for a one-off dental check-up for everyone turning 65.

As the ASMS has pointed out such changes would total only $148 million all up or less than 1% of the operational health funding as at 2018/19. In a back-of-the-envelope calculation the MoH further estimated it would cost roughly $12 million a year for every year beyond 27 – and with Kiwis living on average to 80 years of age the MoH ended up with an all up cost for free dental care for everyone for life of around $648 million annually.

Unfortunately the MoH report that contained those figures was then (reportedly) shelved by then-Health Minister David Clark with no cost/benefit analysis undertaken. Other estimates for providing significant levels of free dental care for adults have arrived at similarly sustainable costs:

Research from the New Zealand Dental Association (NZDA) published in 2019 estimated a public scheme for “basic dental services” for 380000 low-income adults would cost between $187 million and $450 million per year – the first based on the ACC fee schedule the second on an NZDA member fee survey.

At this point it surely needs to be stressed that additional government funding spent on dental care would be an investment not a cost. Certainly it would not be a dead weight cost like the government spending north of $3 billion on four planes loaded with surveillance gear useful only for detecting a regional “threat” from Chinese submarines that Defence is simultaneously predicting will never materialise. Meaning: when it wants to the government readily spends revenue in areas where there are no meaningful cost/benefit returns to this country.

Free dental care by contrast is an investment known to deliver significant social economic and individual benefits. For every dollar spent on dental care by the government the return has been variously estimated at anything between $1.60 (by the NZ Dental Health Association 2019) and $4.50. That latter figure (cited by the ASMS) is based on the savings made from early dental care that (a) pre-empts the development of serious dental complications and the exacerbation of other health conditions while also (b) delivering additional advantages via the reduced need for benefits increased employment and higher tax revenues. (For details see p.13 of the ASMS study.)

Spelling it out

Currently unmet dental care needs are imposing chronic pain employment hardship and social isolation on many New Zealanders - and especially on those on low incomes and Maori. If we’re talking about priorities many people are already struggling to meet their rent food and energy costs let alone to pay for visits to private dentists. They need extra help immediately.

Longer term the government arguably needs to develop a national Dental Workforce Plan to address some of the deteriorating workforce shortages that are also impeding access to affordable skilled dental care. In short New Zealand has to move beyond the Band-Aid responses we’ve seen thus far whereby (in Budget 2022) the government belatedly increased the WINZ grants for emergency dental care.

Here and elsewhere (e.g. Ireland) the take-up rate for such grants is known to be abysmal. Either the people with greatest need don’t know such grants exist or the hoops to be jumped through to obtain this “emergency” relief amount to a significant deterrent. The grants tend to be restricted to emergency remedial care and do not fund the preventative work required to avoid future problems.

That’s deeply unfortunate. Obviously untreated dental conditions deteriorate and then place downstream costs and pressures on the public health system and emergency departments. Untreated oral health conditions are also known to contribute to cardiovascular disease diabetes septicaemia and strokes. That’s one good reason why free dental care looks more like an investment than a cost.

Tooth Be Told

All of this and more has been canvassed this week in the succinct 28 page ASMS study (called “ Tooth Be Told”) linked to earlier. The figures it contains are alarming. Every year 250000 New Zealanders – including one in ten children – have teeth removed because of decay. Children in the poorest 20% of the population are almost twice as likely to lose their teeth as those in the top 20% income group.

Moreover:

In 2020 well over 1.5 million or 40% of adults were estimated to have an unmet need for dental care due to cost. Among Maori and Pasifika adults the figure is more than 50%....New Zealand recorded the highest unmet need for adult dental care among 11 comparable countries in 2020 based on survey of adults in those countries including 1000 adults in New Zealand.

Many of those unmet needs do eventually arrive on the doorsteps of our hospitals :

Publicly funded hospitalisation rates for oral health increased by 31% from 2007/08 to 2018/19 while the population increased by 17%.

The public health system is currently ill-equipped to cope with these rising needs which are increasing:

New Zealand’s dentist and dental specialist workforce is one of the lowest per capita in the OECD. The number of practising dentists and dental specialists has dropped….

Already serious regional variations exist in the availability of skilled dental care:

Six territorial authorities (Kaipara Westland Hurunui Mackenzie Waimate and Chatham Islands) had no dentists and no

dental specialists recorded in 2019. [Nationwide] the number of practising dentists and dental specialists dropped from 68.2 per 100000 population aged 15+ in 2017 to 61.3 in 2019…

And what does this worsening shortage mean in practice in communities outside of New Zealand’s urban centres?

On the West Coast there are two Lumino dentists in Hokitika and then going south the next one is in Wanaka. From there travelling inland the next one is in Christchurch so patients are driving more than an hour and a half one way just to get a filling.

Strange then to find an allegedly centre-left government being so dismissive of a health problem of this magnitude.

Labour’s ghost

As mentioned the provision of free and universal adult dental has haunted Labour ever since the first Labour government passed the Social Security Act in 1938. Largely thanks to lobbying by private sector dentists Labour fatally chose to treat dental care differently to other health needs and effectively excluded it from the social welfare safety net.

This country has been playing catch-up ever since. At the time the first Labour government did provide free milk in schools to improve the calcium protections to the enamel on children’s teeth. The Health Act 1956 enshrined the separation of dentistry from other forms of primary healthcare. Over the decades successive Labour governments have gradually made free dental care available to children and to adolescents with the age of eligibility being lifted to 18 where it currently stands.

Even so Labour’s failure to provide free dental care to adults continues to rest uneasily on its conscience. The late Jim Anderton pressed unsuccessfully for it. In 2018 – after a CTU remit –the provision of free adult dental visits became Labour Party policy but this has not been implemented and the funds required were diverted into the response to the Covid pandemic Meanwhile… Emergency dental care WINZ grants have been increased as a sop to party sentiment.

Costs of inaction

If the cost of universal fee dental care is an insuperable barrier for the government perhaps Robertson could consider trying to raise some of that revenue by enacting a tax on sugared beverages. After all… As the ASMS study points out New Zealand has the second highest level of sugar consumption per capita in the entire OECD/EU group of nations. Moreover:

In 2014 a Treasury paper advised: “Based on international evidence and our engagement with academics in this field we consider that the most promising regulatory approaches to explore further are a sugar sweetened beverage tax regulation of marketing to children and a mandatory front of pack food labelling system.” The papers point out that taxes on sugar- sweetened beverages (SSBs) have been introduced in a number of countries and evidence has shown these taxes to be effective in reducing consumption.

Unfortunately the Ardern government has been shown to have no appetite for tax increases. It has shied away from imposing a significant capital gains tax a wealth tax or windfall taxes on the excessive profits being made by banks and supermarkets. Instead of implementing a sugared beverage tax the government continues to rely on industry self-regulation. The ASMS commentary on this point is worth repeating:

In 2017 a panel of public health experts reviewing case for a “sugary drinks” (SD) tax concluded: “The proposition that a SD tax be adopted is promote child health and wellbeing in not new and is becoming standard practice in many parts of the world. The health benefits of reducing sugar intake provide compelling reasons for why a SD tax is necessary.”

According to the industry lobbyists a tax on sugared beverages would be regressive in that it would hit those on low incomes the hardest :

The panel countered the contention that such a tax would be regressive arguing that a similar rationale has been used against taxes on tobacco and “the health complications of high sugary drink intake are significantly more regressive as these diseases disproportionately impact on poorer communities”.

Perhaps because the diseases related to sugar intake do happen to regressively hit poor communities the hardest this poll outcome shouldn’t be surprising:

A UMR poll from July 2017 found that New Zealanders on the lowest income bracket were most supportive of a SD tax.

A tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would be a vital first step. In tandem there would also need to be regulations forbidding the marketing of sugary drinks to children and a mandatory front-of-pack food labelling system – perhaps with health warnings akin to those on tobacco products.

Fluoride: Epic fail

The tendency for both major parties to take a light handed regulatory approach to dental care has also resulted in a failure to ensure that local councils actually do fluoridise our drinking water despite the well-known health benefits from doing so. As a result… In this Team of Five Million only half of us (2.5 million New Zealanders) have access to fluoridated drinking water.

The Health (Fluoridation of Drinking Water) Amendment Bill introduced into Parliament in 2016 was finally passed in November 2021 and gives the Director-General of Health the power to direct local councils to add fluoride to drinking water. Funding is to be made available to support local councils to do this.

Just when this might happen remains unclear. In the meantime… Christchurch may be New Zealand’s second biggest city but none of its drinking water is fluoridated with little indication of when this might happen. Given the high level of nitrates in the same drinking water the Garden City is hardly shaping up these days as an ideal place to bring up children. Wellington also has problems with fluoridisation as the ASMS study notes:

There has also been recent controversy in Wellington with some parts of the region not receiving fluoridated water due to a fault at a treatment plant since last year. The public was not told for months and the problem won’t be fixed until later [in 2022].

Politics politics

Finally political change in dental care will not be the end product of a gradual accumulation of research evidence about the existence of need. That’s not how political change happens. Media pressure and political champions are essential for turning a worthy case into a politically compelling priority. Winston Peters for instance could easily make one of those MoH measures cited above – the $5.5 million for a one-off annual dental check-up for everyone turning 65 – a New Zealand First easily deliverable via the Gold Card.

If cost is a political barrier then this can be addressed in far more effective ways than Robertson’s preferred method of increasing the WINZ emergency dental grants already known to be unfit for purpose. (The uptake is low WINZ is not renowned for being a benign gatekeeper the “emergency” relief precludes preventative dental care etc etc.).

Besides imposing a tax on sugared beverages how else can the government address the cost to the state’s revenues of providing free dental care to adults? Well… One major party – National – currently wants property developers to once again be able to deduct interest payments on their properties from their tax bill. If we’re willing to gift landlords with tax breaks why not bestow on ordinary Kiwis a similar boon the ability to deduct dental care costs – capped at say $1500 annually – from their pre-tax gross income?

If even that is considered too much of a fiscal strain- or worse if it would incentivise taxpayers to get dental work done that they didn’t need – why not address the issue in the more controlled environment of the government’s planned social insurance scheme? Currently that is being framed as an unemployment insurance scheme paid into by workers and employers alike. Yet if as Canada does this same social insurance vehicle was extended to cover dental costs ( and again capped at say $1500 annually) it could then be cited by employers as an offsetting contribution in the context of wage bargaining.

All it needs is some politician to pick up the cause of free universal dental care and run with it.

Footnote One: The country’s historical emphasis on prioritising the dental care of children has always been something of a double-edged sword. As with re-defining the problem of poverty as being one of “child poverty” the approach looks less like a strategy based on compassion and need and more like a way of rationing the expenditure. Child poverty after all occurs within poor families and poor communities because of structural factors in the economy that cannot be addressed merely through the lens of “child” poverty. For similar reasons adults as well as children need ready access to affordable dental care.

Footnote Two: To be sure there will always be a need for ambulances at the bottom of the dental cliff. Older New Zealanders – who have suffered from decades of policy failure and dental neglect - now need attention for their dental needs as urgently as any other age group.

The dental needs of older New Zealanders – and the best available funding models and delivery mechanisms for meeting them – were the subject of an M.A. Thesis in public health by Anne Russell at Otago University's Medical School entitled“ A Gaping Hole…Oral Health Care for Dependent Older People. ” Useful comparisons were made therein as to how – and how effectively- federal and local governments in Canada UK Australia and Ireland have been meeting adult dental care needs.

Among many other factors Russell’s work canvasses the merits of targeted vs universal funding the virtues and drawbacks of fee-for service models and also the relative benefits (and problems) involved in delivering dental care within aged residential care centres at home in hospital settings and via mobile dental care vans.

Russell also discusses the targeting of dental care to indigenous communities where Canada has models for the dental care of First Nation peoples that we could usefully consider. Like the ASMS Russell points to evidence of the severe shortages of skilled dental workers in this country and especially for the dental treatment of those with disability and/or dementia. As one dentist told them there is a severe shortage of skilled special care dentists:

In our region] we have two fulltime or nearly fulltime Special Care dental specialists and we have about three or four other part-timers are dentists who have special interest in Special Care so we're working on a similar [Full Time Equivalent] to [another region] when our population is way bigger. All dentist informants discussed how a lack of widespread industry training on older people’s health needs meant special care dental specialists were taking on a disproportionate workload.

Funding and workforce issues aside dementia is not the only difficulty in providing effective dental care to older patients. Age and infirmity makes the option of general anaesthesia a riskier prospect.. As mentioned above New Zealand is still grappling with the historical anomaly whereby disease gets treated differently if it happens to be located in the mouth. Russell reports on the cost problems this has fostered:

Four informants discussed how being unable to afford dental treatment costs led to adults of all ages avoiding treatment altogether: When you suddenly go to the dentist and he says “Well yes that tooth needs to come out or this one needs replacing we need to do something there and it’s going to cost about $3000” there’s an immediate [reaction of] “I’ll just put up with it 'til it falls out…” “There’s this myth … that if patients have to contribute towards the cost of treatment they appreciate it more. So why aren’t we charging people for their hips? Why is it only dentistry? …”

The separation continues to have real life consequences. Another of Russell’s informants spoke of a ’silver tsunami' of older people with pressing dental needs. As one dentist informant put it: “We're going to be swamped with old people pliers and bottles of whiskey. There’ll be [WINZ] vouchers for Bunnings.”

That’s the future we have to avoid. Yet arguably it can be avoided only by taking a holistic approach to our current epidemic of unmet dental needs. For starters we need to treat children adolescents adults in paid work beneficiaries and pensioners equally... And provide for each according to their dental care needs.

Ticketmaster anunció a través de la red social Twitter el jueves que había cancelado la venta pública de entradas para la gira The Eras de la cantante Taylor Swift.

“Debido a una demanda extraordinariamente alta en los sistemas de venta de entradas y a la insuficiencia del inventario para satisfacerla la venta pública de mañana para Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour ha sido cancelada” escribió Ticketmaster en el tuit.

La noticia llega después de una frustrante carrera por las entradas en la preventa. Los que buscaban los tiquetes para el concierto tenían que esperar durante horas y el sitio web a veces colapsaba devolviéndolos al principio de una fila virtual con miles de personas por delante.

Swift añadió recientemente 17 fechas a la gira estadounidense 2023 que comienza en marzo en Arizona y termina en agosto en Los Ángeles. El tour constará de 52 conciertos.

Los representantes de Swift no respondieron inmediatamente a una solicitud de comentarios.

En un comunicado completo Ticketmaster explicó que la preventa batió récords en el sitio y reconoció que no había ofrecido la experiencia de compra de entradas que esperaba.

“Nos esforzamos por hacer que la compra de entradas sea lo más fácil posible para los fanáticos pero ese no ha sido el caso para muchas personas que intentaban comprar entradas para The Eras Tour asegura el comunicado.

Ticketmaster explicó que más de 3.5 millones de personas se preinscribieron para la venta a los fanáticos verificados de la cantante la mayor en la historia del sitio. Sin embargo el portal aseguró que normalmente el 40% de los fanáticos invitados a comprar entradas realmente lo hacen y compran una media de tres entradas.

Esto significa que 1.5 millones de fans fueron invitados a comprar entradas mientras que los 2.5 millones restantes quedaron en lista de espera.

En las redes sociales los fans expresaron su consternación al enterarse de que la venta pública había sido cancelada.

“Voy a saltar delante del tráfico” tuiteó una persona.

Otro escribió: “¿Se va a reprogramar? ¿qué está pasando? más información sería genial”

“¿Cómo es posible que se hayan agotado todas las entradas en preventa cuando se supone que sólo se ha puesto a la venta el 15%?” preguntó una persona.

Algunos han señalado los exorbitantes precios de reventa de las entradas conseguidas durante la preventa algunas de las cuales ascienden a decenas de miles de dólares. Los precios de reventa y los problemas con Ticketmaster han llevado a un creciente escrutinio de la plataforma y su empresa matriz Live Nation Entertainment.

Varios legisladores enviaron una carta dirigida a Michael Rapino presidente y director general de Live Nation Entertainment Inc. en la que expresaban “su grave preocupación por el estado de la competencia en el sector de la venta de entradas y su impacto perjudicial para los consumidores”.

En la carta la senadora Amy Klobuchar demócrata por Minnesota que preside un subcomité sobre cuestiones antimonopolio escribió que Ticketmaster no está sometida a la competencia lo que significa que no está obligada a innovar o crear un mejor servicio para los consumidores.

En la carta Klobuchar pedía a Rapino que respondiera a una serie de preguntas entre ellas cuánto ha gastado la empresa en actualizar la tecnología para hacer frente a los aumentos de la demanda y qué porcentaje de las entradas de las giras de alto nivel se reservan para la preventa.

El caótico despliegue de entradas también llamó la atención del fiscal general de Tennessee Jonathan Skrmetti quien aseguró que investigaría a Ticketmaster.

“Si se trata de una violación de la protección del consumidor y podemos encontrar exactamente dónde están los problemas podemos conseguir una orden judicial que obligue a la empresa a mejorar” agregó Skrmetti en una conferencia de prensa el miércoles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbXVuZG8vbm90aWNpYXMtNjM2ODMyMzLSAS9odHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL211bmRvL25vdGljaWFzLTYzNjgzMjMyLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticketmaster | “Son una vergüenza”: la ira contra la compañía por el caos en la venta de entradas para la gira de Taylor Swift,"Ticketmaster | “Son una vergüenza”: la ira contra la compañía por el caos en la venta de entradas para la gira de Taylor Swift

La imposibilidad de comprar entradas para ver a la cantante estadounidense Taylor Swift en la próxima gira por su país desató la ira de los fanáticos.

Este viernes se iban a poner a la venta los boletos para el público en general.

Pero el martes se había habilitado la preventa para grupos selectos que arrasaron con la boletería digital en la que hubo largas colas virtuales y provocaron que la compañía que se encargaba de comercializar los asientos Ticketmaster cancelara la venta general.

La empresa dijo que debió suspender la comercialización por ""exigencias extraordinariamente altas en los sistemas de venta y un inventario de boletos restante insuficiente"". Añadió que colocó más de dos millones de entradas en un solo día para la gira y que fue una cifra récord.

Lo sucedido volvió a poner en el tapete el negocio que maneja Ticketmaster en Estados Unidos tras su fusión con la empresa de eventos Live Nation y tanto los fans como la propia artista y políticos de renombre alzaron su voz con quejas.

""Esto es un fracaso colosal por parte de su empresa. Pasé horas y horas en varias colas de preventa y salas de espera todo para nada. ¿Y vendieron TODO vía preventa? Son una vergüenza"" escribió en Twitter Elana Fishman fanática de Swift y periodista.

""Estuve tan cerca tres o cuatro veces y el sitio web se cayó. Fue agonizante"" le dijo Nancy Abulmagd una madre que ganó el sorteo para unirse a la preventa a la periodista de la BBC Natalie Sherman.

Pasó horas el martes en una fila virtual detrás de miles de otras personas tratando de obtener asientos para su hija de 11 años y sus amigos solo para que el sitio web se bloqueara repetidamente y finalmente la rechazara y se quedara con las manos vacías.

""La experiencia fue realmente desalentadora. Confundió mis emociones y absorbió todo mi día"" dijo la mujer de 41 años que vive en Nueva Jersey.

""Esta fue una experiencia terrible. Estoy muy decepcionado con Ticketmaster"" afirmó Joseph Rich también fanático de la artista en un video de TikTok.

Taylor Swift hizo su descargo en un texto publicado como historia de Instagram. ""Les preguntamos en múltiples ocasiones si podían manejar este tipo de demanda y nos aseguraron que podían"" señaló en referencia a Ticketmaster.

""Es realmente asombroso que 24 millones de personas consigueran entradas pero realmente me enoja que muchos de ellas sienten que tuvieron que atravesar diversos ataques de osos para lograrlo"" siguió diciendo.

Respuesta política

El asunto se coló incluso en la política estadounidense. La legisladora demócrata Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cuestionó en Twitter que se le permita a Ticketmaster acaparar el negocio de la venta de entradas.

""Recordatorio diario de que Ticketmaster es un monopolio su fusión con Live Nation nunca debería haber sido aprobada y deben ser contenidos"" escribió al tiempo que hizo un pedido: ""Divídanlos"".

""Los tiempos de espera excesivos y las tarifas de Ticketmaster son completamente inaceptables como se ve con los boletos para Taylor Swift de hoy y son un síntoma de un problema mayor"" escribió el congresista David Cicilline quien supervisa el comité de competencia y antimonopolio de la Cámara Baja estadounidense.

""No es ningún secreto que Live Nation-Ticketmaster es un monopolio sin control"" añadió.

""Culpen a Ticketmaster. Tienen el monopolio de la industria de eventos en vivo lo que les permite salirse con la suya brindando un servicio terrible cobrando precios de boletos exorbitantes y agregando tarifas de servicio innecesarias"" dijo en Facebook Robert Reich exsecretario de Trabajo de Estados Unidos.

""Necesitamos desesperadamente una mayor aplicación antimonopolio para acabar con estos monopolios"" enfatizó.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fue una de las primeras figuras políticas en alzar su voz ante el caos por la venta de entradas de Taylor Swift.

En una carta dirigida a Ticketmaster la senadora Amy Klobuchar presidenta del panel antimonopolio del Senado expresó su ""seria preocupación sobre el estado de la competencia en la industria de venta de entradas y su impacto nocivo en los consumidores"".

""El poder de Ticketmaster en el mercado primario de entradas aísla de las presiones competitivas que normalmente empujan a las empresas para innovar y mejorar sus servicios"" dijo Klobuchar. ""Eso puede resultar en los tipos de fallas de servicio dramáticas que vimos en este semana en las que los consumidores son los que pagan el precio"".

Klobuchar invitó al presidente ejecutivo de Live Nation Michael Rapino a responder preguntas como cuánto había gastado la empresa para actualizar la tecnología para manejar los aumentos repentinos de la demanda y qué porcentaje de los boletos de giras de alto perfil se reservaron para preventa.

Mientras tanto el Departamento de Justicia de EE.UU. abrió una investigación sobre Live Nation Entertainment informó CBS socia de la BBC en EE.UU. Dos personas familiarizadas con el asunto confirmaron la investigación reportada originalmente en el New York Times el viernes pero dijeron que la pesquisa es anterior al caos de esta semana.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Taylor Swift no hace una gira de estadios en Estados Unidos desde 2018.

El mes pasado el presidente de EE.UU. Joe Biden quien expresó su preocupación de que los monopolios se han vuelto más comunes en toda la economía dijo que su administración analizaría las tarifas de las entradas para conciertos.

Krista Brown analista principal de políticas en el Proyecto Estadounidense de Libertades Económicas es parte de una coalición de artistas y otras personas que lanzaron una campaña el mes pasado para pedirle al gobierno que disolviera Ticketmaster.

Brown dijo que tiene la esperanza de que la indignación de la enorme base de admiradores de Taylor Swift aumente la presión sobre la administración para que actúe.

""Si hubiera una competencia saludable en este espacio (estos problemas) simplemente no estarían presentes y los clientes o fanáticos tendrían otros servicios a los que recurrir"" dijo. ""Probablemente no tendrías sitios que colapsaran (...) Cuando tienes (solo) un proveedor esto es lo que sucede"".

Decenas de miles de dólares por entrada

En las últimas horas aparecieron ofertas en internet de reventa de entradas por decenas de miles de dólares cada una y los fanáticos acusaron a revendedores de querer hacer ganancias atronómicas con la gira de Taylor Swift.

Ticketmaster negó esa versión y dijo en un comunicado publicado el jueves que las demoras se debieron a la alta demanda pero que todos los boletos fueron adjudicados a ""fans validados"".

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto La artista que comenzó en la música country en 2006 dijo estar enojada por las demoras para comprar entradas para su gira a través de Ticketmaster.

""La asombrosa cantidad de ataques de bots así como de fanáticos que no tenían códigos de invitación generaron un tráfico sin precedentes en nuestro sitio lo que resultó en 3.500 millones de solicitudes totales del sistema cuatro veces nuestro máximo anterior"" agregó.

Ticketmaster sostuvo además que el sistema de preventa está destinado a ayudar a evitar que los revendedores de boletos y los bots obtengan asientos.

El comunicado había sido retirado de su web este viernes.

BBC Mundo contactó a la compañía -también presente en México Argentina Chile y España- para preguntarle por lo ocurrido pero no obtuvo respuesta.

En una entrevista el jueves con el canal de noticias económicas CNBC Greg Maffei CEO de Liberty Media -accionista de Ticketmaster- se disculpó por los inconvenientes pero afirmó que la empresa promotora de la gira de Swift los eligió a ellos porque son ""la expendedora de boletos más grande y efectiva del mundo"".

""Una de las compañías más odiadas del mundo""

La gira de Taylor Swift denominada The Eras Tour era altamente esperada por los fanáticos después de cinco años sin hacer una ronda de conciertos en estadios en Estados Unidos y del lanzamiento de su último álbum Midnights que ha encabezado las listas de éxitos de todo el mundo.

Ticketmaster dijo que más de 35 millones de swifties como se conoce a los seguidores de la artista se registraron de antemano como ""fans verificados"" con la esperanza de conseguir entradas para alguno de los 52 conciertos que hará en Estados Unidos entre marzo y agosto del año próximo.

La compañía también organizó una preventa para personas que tuvieran una tarjeta de crédito de Capital One banco que patrocina la gira.

En un episodio de su programa de HBO Last Week Tonight a principios de este año el comediante británico John Oliver describió a Ticketmaster como ""una de las compañías más odiadas del mundo"" culpándola por los altos precios de las entradas las exorbitantes tarifas por servicio y la escasa disponibilidad que enfrentan aquellos que esperan asistir a conciertos u otros eventos.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto La fusión entre Ticketmaster y Live Nation fue aprobada en 2010 pese a que hubo voces reticentes.

El sentimiento negativo hacia la empresa es de larga data. En la década de 1990 Pearl Jam expresó su preocupación por el papel de Ticketmaster como el principal vendedor de boletos.

El poder de la compañía no ha hecho más que crecer desde entonces. En 2010 compró Live Nation que gestiona muchos de los establecimientos donde se hacen eventos en EE.UU. y tiene un negocio de gestión de artistas.

Desde entonces Ticketmaster está sujeta a la supervisión del gobierno que se le impuso para aprobar la adquisición.

La supervisión se amplió hace unos años después de que los reguladores descubrieran que la empresa había violado los términos del acuerdo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vY25uZXNwYW5vbC5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvY29sYXBzby12ZW50YS1ib2xldGFzLXRheWxvci1zd2lmdC1jYXVzYWRvLWFidXNvLXBvZGVyLXRpY2tldG1hc3Rlci10cmF4L9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vY25uZXNwYW5vbC5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTcvY29sYXBzby12ZW50YS1ib2xldGFzLXRheWxvci1zd2lmdC1jYXVzYWRvLWFidXNvLXBvZGVyLXRpY2tldG1hc3Rlci10cmF4L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"El colapso en la venta de boletas de Taylor Swift fue causado por ""abuso de poder"" de Ticketmaster dice la presidenta antimonopolio del Senado de EE.UU.","Los artistas más ganadores en la historia de los Grammy 1:15

(CNN Business) -- La senadora Amy Klobuchar criticó a Ticketmaster en una carta abierta a su presidente ejecutivo diciendo que tiene “serias preocupaciones” sobre las operaciones de la compañía luego de un colapso del servicio este martes que enfureció a los seguidores de Taylor Swift.

En la carta al CEO Michael Rapino el demócrata de Minnesota y presidenta de la subcomisión Judicial del Senado sobre Política de Competencia Antimonopolio y Derechos del Consumidor escribió que las quejas de los seguidores de Swift por no poder comprar boletos para su próxima gira además de las críticas sobre las altas tarifas sugiere que la empresa “sigue abusando de sus posiciones en el mercado”.

“El poder de Ticketmaster en el mercado primario de boletos lo aísla de las presiones competitivas que normalmente empujan a las empresas a innovar y mejorar sus servicios. Eso puede resultar en los tipos de fallas dramáticas en el servicio que vimos esta semana donde los consumidores son los que pagan el precio” escribió Klobuchar.

Ticketmaster y Live Nation el promotor de conciertos más grande del país se fusionaron hace aproximadamente una década. Klobuchar señaló que la compañía en ese momento se comprometió a ""desarrollar una plataforma única de fácil acceso"" para la entrega de boletos. Este jueves la senadora le dijo a Rapino el CEO de Ticketmaster que “parece que su confianza estaba fuera de lugar”.

“Cuando Ticketmaster se fusionó con Live Nation en 2010 estaba sujeto a un decreto de consentimiento antimonopolio que le prohibía abusar de su posición en el mercado” escribió Klobuchar. “Sin embargo ha habido numerosas denuncias sobre el cumplimiento de ese decreto por parte de su empresa”.

La carta incluye una lista de preguntas para que Rapino responda la próxima semana. Ticketmaster no respondió de inmediato a una solicitud de comentarios de CNN Business.

Este martes la compañía dijo que “ha habido una demanda históricamente sin precedentes con millones que se presentaron” para comprar boletos para la gira de Swift y agradeció a los seguidores por su “paciencia”.

Taylor Swift ocupa los primeros 10 puestos en los Hot 100 de Billboard 1:08

Críticas al dominio de Ticketmaster

Klobuchar es la última política de alto perfil en criticar abiertamente a Ticketmaster por el desastre de venta de entradas que dejó mala sangre entre los seguidores de Swift y la compañía.

“Los tiempos de espera excesivos y las tarifas de @Ticketmaster son completamente inaceptables como se ve con los boletos de @taylorswift13 de hoy y son un síntoma de un problema mayor. No es ningún secreto que Live Nation-Ticketmaster es un monopolio sin control” tuiteó el martes el representante David Cicilline actualmente presidente del Subcomité Antimonopolio.

“Recordatorio diario de que Ticketmaster es un monopolio su fusión con LiveNation nunca debería haber sido aprobada y deben ser controlados” tuiteó la representante Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Las quejas sobre el poder de monopolio de la compañía se remontan mucho antes de los problemas de boletos de este martes cuando la plataforma pareció colapsar o congelarse durante las compras de preventa para la última gira de Swift.

En 1994 cuando Taylor Swift tenía solo cuatro años y las colas de compra de boletos eran en persona o por teléfono no en línea el grupo de rock Pearl Jam presentó una queja ante la división antimonopolio del Departamento de Justicia afirmando que Ticketmaster tiene un ""virtualmente absoluto monopolio de la distribución de entradas para conciertos”. Intentó reservar su gira solo en lugares que no usaban Ticketmaster.

El Departamento de Justicia y muchos fiscales generales estatales han presentado quejas similares a lo largo de los años.

A pesar de esas preocupaciones Ticketmaster continuó volviéndose más dominante. La queja de Pearl Jam fue desestimada en silencio. El Departamento de Justicia y los estados permitieron que se llevara a cabo la fusión de Live Nation Ticketmaster a pesar de una presentación judicial en 2010 en el caso que planteó objeciones a la fusión. En la presentación el Departamento de Justicia dijo que la participación de Ticketmaster entre las principales salas de conciertos superó el 80%.

El gigante estadounidense de distribución de moda uno de los mayores del mundo por cifra de negocio ha finalizado los nueve primeros meses de ejercicio (periodo cerrado el pasado 29 de octubre) con sus ventas y beneficio a la baja. Para el cuarto trimestre el grupo ha reducido sus previsiones.

La facturación de la empresa se ha encogido un 63% en el periodo hasta 11.373 millones de dólares mientras que el beneficio neto se ha situado en 71 millones de dólares un 738% por debajo de los nueve primeros meses del ejercicio anterior.

Sólo en el tercer trimestre Gap ha elevado sus ingresos un 24% y ha vuelto a beneficios con un resultado neto de 282 millones de dólares frente a las pérdidas de 152 millones de dólares del mismo periodo de 2021. Entre agosto y octubre el margen bruto de la empresa se situó en el 374% debido al impacto de 53 millones de dólares de la cancelación de su línea con Yeezy la marca de Kanye West.

“Hemos agudizado nuestro enfoque en la ejecución para optimizar la rentabilidad y el flujo de efectivo estamos aportando más rigor a nuestras operaciones y si bien nuestros esfuerzos muestran signos tempranos de mejora tenemos claro que hay trabajo por hacer” ha señalado Bob Martin presidente del grupo y consejero delegado interino. A cierre del tercer trimestre el inventario de Gap ascendía a 3.040 millones de dólares un 12% más que en el mismo periodo de 2021 debido al incremento del stock en tránsito.

La compañía ha vuelto a revisar sus previsiones a la baja después de reducirlas en el segundo trimestre y espera que en el cuarto trimestre la facturación se reduzca entre un 2% y un 3% debido al “comportamiento incierto del consumidor” y “al entorno cada vez más promocional”. Para el periodo la compañía espera que se normalicen los costes de los fletes lo que tendrá un efecto positivo de 540 puntos en el margen (ya que en el cuarto trimestre de 2021 hubo un coste extra de 245 millones de dólares por esta partida). Sin embargo este efecto se verá parcialmente compensado por el impacto de 200 puntos básicos de la inflación.

“Si bien nuestros resultados del tercer trimestre subrayan un el progreso inicial que estamos logrando para reequilibrar nuestro surtido y reducir los inventarios seguimos adoptando un enfoque prudente” ha explicado Katrina O’Connel vicepresidenta y directora financiera de Gap. Para la próxima primavera la empresa espera haber capitalizado su estrategia de reducción de inventario.

“En el corto plazo nos mantenemos enfocados en las acciones necesarias para reducir el inventario reequilibrar nuestros surtidos para satisfacer mejor las necesidades cambiantes de los consumidores administrar y reevaluar agresivamente nuestras inversiones y fortalecer nuestro balance” ha señalado. Para 2022 el capex de Gap ascenderá a 650 millones de e dólares.

La compañía espera cerrar el cuarto trimestre con un descenso de sus ventas de un dígito medio

En el cuarto trimestre además Gap continuará ejecutando su plan de cierres que ha llevado a cabo durante el año y espera cerrar otros treinta establecimientos de Banana Republic y Gap en Norteamérica que se suman a las 29 tiendas que ya ha cerrado. Para Old Navy y Athleta el grupo cerrará el año con treinta y con diez nuevos establecimientos respectivamente.

Banana Republic ha sido la marca que más ha crecido durante el tercer trimestre con un incremento de los ingresos del 8% mientras que la cadena homónima ha registrado una evolución plana durante el periodo. En el caso de Old Navy la facturación se ha elevado un 2% entre agosto y octubre mientras que la cifra de negocio de Athleta cerró el tercer trimestre con un alza del 6%.

Por mercados Europa ha sido donde el grupo más ha reducido sus ventas en el tercer trimestre con un retroceso del 33%. Durante el año Gap ha ido deshaciendo posiciones en el mercado cediendo su negocio a distintos franquiciados de la región.

En Estados Unidos las ventas del grupo se han elevado un 3% mientras que en Canadá Gap ha evolucionado a la baja en el tercer trimestre con un retroceso del 11%. En Asia en cambio las ventas del grupo se elevaron un 12%."

On Thursday the nation's largest wireless carrier announced a new ""Verizon Test Drive"" program that allows people with an unlocked eSIM-compatible phone to connect to Verizon's network for 30 days.

The program which is available now in beta will give you unlimited talk text and 100GB of 4G LTE/5G data including access to Verizon's faster 5G Ultra Wideband network should you have a compatible 5G phone. Like rival programs from T-Mobile AT&T's Cricket and even Verizon's own Visible the program is free and there is no credit check need to give over a credit card number or commitment needed to partake.

At a month in length Verizon's Test Drive is longer than Visible and Cricket's respective roughly two-week trials but shorter than T-Mobile's Network Pass which runs for three months. Similar to other trials you can only do the Test Drive trial once a year with that clock starting from the first day you use the trial.

As with those programs the Test Drive will add Verizon's service alongside your existing provider so you can compare the two in real time. It does not replace your existing phone number which you can keep as your voice line while using Verizon's network for data to see how it performs.

The Verizon trial works with a variety of recent Apple Samsung and Google devices. Apple devices date back to the iPhone XR and XS lines and Google devices go back to the Pixel 4 line though according to Verizon's support page Samsung devices are limited to more modern models like the S21 and S22 lines the Note 20 line the Z Flip 3 and Flip 4 and the Z Fold 3 and Fold 4.

As with other carrier trial programs your phone will need to be unlocked to try this. Verizon automatically unlocks phones even those bought on installment plans after 60 days. T-Mobile automatically unlocks after all device payments are completed. AT&T will allow you to unlock your phone after you've completed all installment payments are finished though you need to submit an unlock request to the carrier to have them release the phone.

To join the Test Drive you need to download the My Verizon through a QR code which can also be found on that support page. Downloading the app directly from the App Store or Play Store without scanning the QR code will not give you the right app and won't let you sample Verizon's network.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY3J1bW9ycy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xOC92ZXJpem9uLXRlc3QtZHJpdmUtcHJvZ3JhbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Try Verizon's Service for Free With New Test Drive Program,"Verizon this week announced the launch of a new Test Drive program that is designed to allow you to try the Verizon network for free over a 30-day period.



Any U.S. smartphone user with an eSIM and unlocked device can get 100GB of 4G/5G data to test out the Verizon network before committing to switching to the carrier. Verizon's program is similar to the Network Pass option offered by T-Mobile though it doesn't last as long.

In addition to 100GB of data Verizon's test program includes unlimited talk and text and the service can be used alongside an existing cellular subscription. 4K streaming quality is available over 5G Ultra Wideband while streaming is limited to 480p on LTE and 5G Nationwide.

Those who want to try Verizon can scan the QR code on the Test Drive FAQ page to download the My Verizon app to get access to the free trial. As mentioned above an unlocked eSIM-capable smartphone is required and testers cannot be existing Verizon subscribers. eSIM compatible iPhones include the iPhone XR and later.

After the Test Drive Verizon offers a streamlined process for porting a number over and choosing a 5G plan. For those who opt not to continue with the service the trial simply ends when the 30-day period has expired with no need to cancel as no credit card is required.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4LzIzNDY2MzYzL3Zlcml6b24tNWctdGVzdC1kcml2ZS10cmlhbC1lc2ltLWZyZWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon will now let you test drive its 5G network for free,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4LzIzNDY2MzYzL3Zlcml6b24tNWctdGVzdC1kcml2ZS10cmlhbC1lc2ltLWZyZWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60F458910>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE4LzIzNDY2MzYzL3Zlcml6b24tNWctdGVzdC1kcml2ZS10cmlhbC1lc2ltLWZyZWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcmV2aWV3ZWQudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tL3NtYXJ0cGhvbmVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2lzLXZlcml6b25zLW5ldy11bmxpbWl0ZWQtZGF0YS1wbGFuLXRvby1nb29kLXRvLWJlLXRydWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon has a new unlimited data plan–but is it too good to be true?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcmV2aWV3ZWQudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tL3NtYXJ0cGhvbmVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2lzLXZlcml6b25zLW5ldy11bmxpbWl0ZWQtZGF0YS1wbGFuLXRvby1nb29kLXRvLWJlLXRydWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60F459D80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcmV2aWV3ZWQudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tL3NtYXJ0cGhvbmVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2lzLXZlcml6b25zLW5ldy11bmxpbWl0ZWQtZGF0YS1wbGFuLXRvby1nb29kLXRvLWJlLXRydWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Patient Inspiration

November 17 2022

In hindsight Shazia Khan realizes how lucky she has been. In February 2018 while visiting her parents she experienced a shortness of breath and a stitch-like pain on her right side that began while she was holding her young niece on her lap.

At first those symptoms didn’t seem serious. But when she returned home she went to see her doctor; she couldn’t speak a full sentence without catching her breath and she had developed a cough and chest pain on her right side.

Her doctor sent her to the hospital for further testing. Later Shazia – who works for Viatris in the United Kingdom as the Global Portfolio Process Lead – would learn that her medical practice had experience in diagnosing pulmonary embolisms which are blood clots that block the pulmonary arteries in the lungs often after traveling from deep veins in the legs or other parts of the body. So even though Shazia lacked some of the telltale symptoms such as swelling in her legs or a family history that would put her in a typical risk category the hospital visit would prove to be critical.

The condition can be life threatening although prompt access to treatment greatly reduces that risk and proactive steps can help prevent the clots from developing. Each year one in four people worldwide die from conditions caused by thrombosis which is the term for clots that block veins or arteries.

In addition to providing solutions to address thrombosis related illnesses Viatris partners with key medical societies patient advocacy groups and civic associations to provide recovery support as well as prevention strategies.

Test results at the hospital revealed sobering news for Shazia: she had three clots in her lung as well as damage to both her lung and heart. She was just 47 years old.

“I was just shocked” Shazia said. “And then it was just: ‘OK I have to pull myself together.’ It was a very emotional experience. I think it was just a lot to take in.”

Immediately her health care providers prescribed a daily regimen of medication designed to cure the thrombotic event and to reduce the risk of recurrence. Shazia also began to implement key lifestyle changes: she quit smoking lost weight began walking more and eating healthier foods. The experience inspires her in her work at Viatris: “I’ve been there. And I know those drugs can make a difference in people’s lives” she said. “I might not think about it directly every day but I know that I can help and make a difference.”

In addition to medication and lifestyle changes Shazia also learned to reduce her stress levels: “I have a tendency to push myself a little bit too much without realizing it” Shazia said. “And my body told me ‘No that’s not allowed.’ It was a good wake-up call for me.”

It took her time to accept the gravity of her situation.

“The recovery was really challenging for me on a physical level as well as an emotional level” Shazia said. “The doctors couldn’t stress enough that I’d had a serious illness … I never thought it could happen to me. What does this mean now? What happens next? Those were the key things that were going through my head.”

A related anxiety attack motivated Shazia to start researching patient support groups eventually leading her to Thrombosis Ireland. Hearing other people’s experiences aided her own recovery and inspired her to share her own story.

“It taught me a lot about myself” Shazia said. “The recovery process is challenging each patient has a different timeline and it’s not easy. It’s really about the patients and how they are able to manage their health how they feel and understanding what they are going through.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL2VsaS1saWxseS13YWRlcy1kZWVwZXItY29weWNhdC1pbnN1bGluLW1hcmtldC1pbnRlcmNoYW5nZWFiaWxpdHktbm9kLWxhbnR1cy1iaW9zaW1pbGFy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lilly scores interchangeability tag for its Lantus biosimilar,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.fiercepharma.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /pharma/eli-lilly-wades-deeper-copycat-insulin-market-interchangeability-nod-lantus-biosimilar (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60FCC1600>, 'Connection to www.fiercepharma.com timed out.

These baits are my favorite way to catch big bass which has led to me testing hundreds of them throughout my career. To be quite honest I’m a big fan of the older discontinued crankbaits and I’ve been known to spend a pretty penny of ‘em. But I’ll admit that there have been some awesome mass-produced crankbaits that have hit the market this past year.

After a lot of testing I can confidently add the Berkley Digger crankbait to this category. It comes in at a reasonable price point and offers extremely impressive performance for its price.

Hang with me for a minute or two and I’ll explain why I like this crankbait so much.

These treble hooks are the real deal

If you’re anything like me you can’t count the number of crankbaits you’ve bought over the years that are equipped with terrible treble hooks. I’ve said it several times before and I’ll stand by it to this day: I don’t want to be a tackle tinkerer. I want to fish and catch bass. So I’ll pay a few extra bucks to buy a plug that’s ready to fish straight from the package.

The Berkley Digger Crankbait fits that bill perfectly. From the moment you take it out of the package you’ll notice the Fusion19 treble hooks sticking to anything they touch. They’ll stick on the packaging your long-sleeve shirt your skin… they are some of the sharpest treble hooks I’ve ever used throughout my career and that’s no bull. I was showing this crankbait to a buddy just last week and got it all tangled and hooked-up in my long-sleeve shirt and I barely brushed against the dang thing.

There’s a lot to be said about a crankbait already equipped with such awesome treble hooks. It saves you money over time and allows you to make quick on-the-water adjustments without messing around with split rings and all that kind of mess. This is one of the best-equipped crankbaits I’ve tested in recent years.

Solid bill-to-body connection

I’ve been testing the Berkley Digger 6.5 model which dives to the 5- to 8-foot range when cast on a medium-action rod and 12- of 14-pound fluorocarbon line. I’ve found this particular model to be an excellent choice for riprap banks clay banks and steeper transition banks. My home lake has experienced an influx of aquatic vegetation throughout the past few years and I’m super pleased with the durability of this plug.

I say that because it has a really solid bill-to-body connection. This means you can get a few strands of grass on it and (lightly) slap it on the water without worrying about the bill coming apart and ruining your crankbait.

A lot of times in this price point you’ll see a thin strip of glue connecting the bill to the body of the crankbait but that’s not the case with the Berkley Digger. It’s a super-solid connection that holds up well when bounced around hard cover such as rocks boat docks and laydowns.

The body shape is versatile

Fishing lure manufacturers often put all of their proverbial eggs into one basket—they either make a flat-sided crankbait or a wide-wobbling crankbait. While each category has a clear purpose in bass fishing I’m really pleased with the middle line Berkley was able to toe with the Digger crankbait.

It’s a great option for a myriad of situations which I’ve really enjoyed throughout my testing. Although it’s advertised as an aggressive wobble I personally consider it an outstanding “in-between” action that works well in both clear and dirty water.

Dives quickly and efficiently

This durable bill is situated on the nose of the bait in a manner and at an angle that allows it to dive to its maximum depth very efficiently. At 1/2-ounce the Berkley Digger 6.5 I’ve been testing can cast a country mile and within just a few cranks of the reel handle it dives to its maximum depth with ease. This very important characteristic allows it to stay in the strike zone longer which gives you more opportunities to put the lure in front of nearby bass.

Final thoughts on the Berkley Digger crankbait

This is one of the more versatile bass fishing crankbaits I’ve tested recently. It’s available at a reasonable price point it dives quickly the finish lasts a long time and the bill-to-body connection is as solid as I’ve seen. So whether you like to fish open water or bang your crankbaits against hard cover I think you’ll be able to appreciate the characteristics of this outstanding crankbait.

More than 40 car crashes happened at the intersection of Mesa Avenue and Berkley Avenue over the past 10 years. The latest accident happened earlier this year when a car hit a bus. That bus then ran into a home.

Due to the frequency and call for safer roads and intersections from the public the City of Pueblo will be using a million dollars to build a roundabout at the intersection.

""Roundabouts typically if there was an accident usually result in a glancing blow reduces property damage reduces injuries significantly so we believe these are safer alternatives for particularly on intersections where we have had a higher number of accidents like on Berkley and Mesa"" says Andrew Hayes of Pueblo Public Works.

Work on the intersection is expected to begin by the middle of next year and be done by the end of next year.

BERKLEY — A Berkley City Councilwoman has been elected to the Michigan House of Representatives.

Democrat Natalie Price was chosen by voters Nov. 8 to become the state representative in the 5th District of the Michigan House. She defeated her Republican opponent Paul Taros with more than 78% of the vote. In total 30637 people out of 39112 voted for Price.

Price said she was thrilled to head to the House which — along with the Michigan Senate and re-election of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — are all in Democratic control.

“I think the voters put a lot of trust in us as Democrats giving us the majority in the House and the Senate and the Governor’s Office and this is really historical and exciting for us to be able to get good work done for Michiganders” she said.

Price said she’s excited to get to work in the House and for the 5th District which covers cities in Oakland and Wayne Counties.

“I think there have been a lot of things that have been stuck in session for many years because of a Republican majority in the House” she said. “One that comes to mind is commonsense gun reform has never made it out of committee and onto the floor. I believe commonsense gun reform bills are not partisan. They should not be partisan. They should be about human rights and yet I think it takes having a Democratic majority to get those bills onto the floor for a vote and I can’t wait to see them there and be able to cast my vote in support of that.”

Because of her election to the House Price will have to resign from her seat on the Berkley City Council. Price was elected to her first term of four years in November 2019.

Price stated she has handed in her letter of resignation to the city which states it will go into effect either when she is sworn in as state representative or when the City Council appoints a successor whichever comes first.

“I will continue to serve on council. I absolutely plan on serving at the next meeting (Nov. 21)” she said. “Again depending on when they appoint my successor or when I’m sworn in I don’t yet know whether I will be able to continue at the meeting following that. I think that’ll depend on the timing of both of those things.”

According to Berkley’s bylaws the city has 30 days from the date of resignation to appoint a new council person. After a period to accept applications those will be reviewed by an ad hoc committee of the mayor pro tem Bridget Dean the most senior member of council Steven Baker and the most junior member of council Jessica Vilani.

“They’ll be the group tasked with putting the advertisement out reviewing applications from the community when they come in conducting an initial set of interviews and then having a recommendation to the council as a whole” City Manager Matt Baumgarten said. “They would make the recommendations of who to interview to council and council as a whole would make that decision (of who to appoint).”

The person appointed to Price’s seat will serve the remainder of her term which ends in November 2023. For those interested in applying Baumgarten said “It’s wide open. If you think you might have an interest in serving the community in this way please consider applying.”

Price began as a community organizer in Berkley from working at the community center to helping orchestrate citywide diaper drives.

She said being able to step from that role where she worked on service projects in the city to serving the residents on council was impactful as she could see the ways in which her votes could make positive changes in the community. That includes making playgrounds more accessible and working on projects with the Downtown Development Authority such as the plaza on Coolidge Highway.

“(To) be able to go show up and use those spaces with my family seeing how inclusive and wonderful they have been as placemakers for our community those were really really fantastic ways for me to see how my involvement and the things that I champion could … come in and get concrete benefits for the community and the people around us” she said. “I will miss that part of serving on council; the hyper-local nonpartisan getting-things-done aspect of local government was just fantastic and I encourage anyone who’s interested to look around at the service projects that need their experience and their help and jump in and get started and see where it takes them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy9wYXVsLXZlcmhvZXZlbi1kb2VzbnQtdGhpbmstZWxpemFiZXRoLWJlcmtsZXktaXMtdG8tYmxhbWUtZm9yLXNob3dnaXJscy1wb29yLXJlY2VwdGlvbi_SAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbGFzaGZpbG0uY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvcGF1bC12ZXJob2V2ZW4tZG9lc250LXRoaW5rLWVsaXphYmV0aC1iZXJrbGV5LWlzLXRvLWJsYW1lLWZvci1zaG93Z2lybHMtcG9vci1yZWNlcHRpb24v?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul Verhoeven Doesn't Think Elizabeth Berkley Is To Blame For Showgirls' Poor Reception,"Berkley's career had just been gaining momentum and ""Showgirls"" ended that almost entirely as she was dropped by her agent and became somewhat of an outcast in Hollywood circles.

My son Ray and I have both been music lovers our whole lives. (Well I was first!)

In 1980 I was at The Brighton Bar in Long Branch my sneakers sticking to the beer-covered floor waiting to see the band The Chronic Sick.

In 2010 Ray walked to Brighton on a blistery cold Friday night from our home a few blocks away to try to catch Grant Hart from Hüsker Dü.

That was the Brighton Bar.

attachment-1 loading...

A symbol of all that was great about youth music and Long Branch.

Open since 1915 the Brighton Bar in Long Branch owned since 1996 by Greg Macolino closed in April 2021 and according to reports demolition is slated for today.

It's a sad day.

The story of the Brighton Bar is legendary:

Greg and his rock band The Chronic Sick used to play at the Brighton. After working there he purchased the business and began bringing in original rock bands of all ages giving hopes of stardom to all of them.

While Brighton Bar specialized in punk rock bands over the years they also had jazz bands country artists blues acts even poetry and artists.

In fact Its Wall of Fame is a Who's Who of artists including Fountains of Wayne (""Stacy's Mom"") Three Doors Down (""Kryptonite"" ""Here Without You"" ""Let Me Go"") and even Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi.

Oh lest I forget my son Raymond's band Secret Mountain had a gig there too.

An article in the Long Branch paper last year said:

""It was a badge of honor to play on stage with the Brighton lights behind you. Closing will no doubt break a lot of new young rocker's hearts. There was no place to play on stage for the first time like the Brighton. Greg kept The Brighton going through good times and bad until the present.""

On @newjerseyhardcore Instagram account users are weighing in with their memories:

""The cbgb of the jersey shore. Just a little cleaner.""

""Honored to have played on that stage.""

""Damn this one hits hard. Countless memories as a musician and a participant""

The Brighton bar's Facebook page looks forlorn. Its last post there was from November 2021. A year later and its demolition day is set.

The neighborhood where the Brighton Bar stands was once called a ""little Greenwich Village"" with a Bohemian feeling. It's where the Village-esque coffee house The Inkwell was located before its post-COVID closing. It was also home to the turntable record shop where you'd wait in line for tickets to anything from Dead Kennedys to Bruce Springsteen.

The ""West End"" neighborhood attracted us: the artists the misfits the misunderstood the musicians and poets. The area's gentrification isn't surprising but still like all change has its happy and its sad.

The slogan of this legendary Jersey Shore bar was ""The Home of Original Live Music.""

""Long Branch had no business getting the caliber of punk bands that Brighton Bar managed to get somehow"" Ray mused.

But that's the thing. They did. And the reason they were able to attract those bands is this: The grungy little place stood for something. And with fewer and fewer venues for indie music and small local bands to hone their chops that something will be missed.

The “L.A. ’22” limited-edition sunglasses are an updated version of the iconic frames the legendary singer wore at his two career-defining sold-out concerts in 1975 to celebrate the end of his U.S. touring career in the same venue.

As part of the limited-edition launch 600 sunglasses will be available online for $99 – each coming with a commemorative case keepsake cleaning cloth and packaging featuring the image of Sir Elton performing in the original frames. Just like the legendary concert once these frames sell out they will not be restocked.

Cory Patterson the Mississippi man charged with stealing a plane and threatening to crash it into a Walmart in September died Monday while in federal custody according to his attorney Tony Farese and information from the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Patterson 29 was at Federal Detention Center Miami in Florida when he was found unresponsive at around 1:20 p.m. on Monday according to a news release from the Bureau of Prisons. Staff at the prison and responding EMS personnel attempted life-saving measures but he was pronounced dead at the facility according to BOP.

Patterson who was not a licensed pilot had pleaded not guilty to charges of grand larceny and making terroristic threats CNN has previously reported. He was accused a stealing a twin-engine aircraft from a regional airport in Tupelo Mississippi and calling 911 to say he was going to crash into a local Walmart.

The threat caused chaos in the city as officials rushed to evacuate the store and its surrounding areas and close down major streets police said. After Tupelo Police negotiators attempted to guide Patterson to land at the airport he eventually touched back down in a field and was arrested.

Patterson was sent to the Miami detention center to receive psychological evaluation which Farese requested in September the lawyer told CNN.

Patterson arrived in Miami on November 10 and died four days later according to BOP which did not provide a cause of death. Farese said Patterson died by suicide.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and US Marshals Service were notified of the death. The Miami-Dade Medical Examiner’s Office told CNN Patterson’s death is still under investigation.

Farese said the BOP and FBI would be investigating as is protocol. A spokesperson for the FBI however neither confirmed nor denied the existence of an investigation into the case but acknowledged the agency investigates in custody deaths of federal inmates as a practice.

Farese said he is working with the BOP to return Patterson’s body home to his family in the Tupelo area."

My first introduction to Mickey Mouse was probably in the movie theater. I'm an old codger. We didn't have television back in the old days so we went to the movies. And when my parents took me to the movie theater and I saw the big splash screen of Mickey on the screen and it said “Walt Disney Mickey Mouse Cartoon” that was my first introduction to Mickey Mouse. And then of course after that I suddenly found that Mickey Mouse was available everywhere. He was in storybooks he was in comic books he was in the newspaper. He was everywhere. And so I realized that Mickey like it or not was going to be a big part of my life.

Mickey was created by Walt Disney who not only gave him his look but literally provided Mickey’s voice. What aspects of Walt Disney do we see in the character?

You get to see Walt's personality. You get to see Walt Disney's amazing optimism. Walt was an optimist you know almost to a fault. Mickey Mouse is a total optimist. Walt Disney was incredibly resourceful. And boy Mickey is resourceful. And Mickey is also somewhat cheeky. There's a mischievous side to Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney as well. Walt’s family has often spoken to me about what a prankster Walt could be and Mickey is a prankster too. So there's so much of Walt Disney in Mickey Mouse and so much Mickey Mouse in Walt Disney.

My favorite Mickey is Sorcerer Mickey in “Fantasia” followed by “The Band Concert” and “Mickey and the Beanstalk.” We saw so many different sides of Mickey in this movie. What is your favorite?

There are so many! ""The Band Concert"" is one and “The Brave Little Tailor” is another. But I think for me the ultimate Mickey Mouse was the Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence from “Fantasia.” You get a chance to see every aspect of Mickey's personality. The mischievous Mickey the sad sorry Mickey the repentant Mickey the cheeky little guy who probably sticks his fingers where they shouldn't be. It is probably Mickey's greatest performance and worthy of such an elegant venue as that film.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rtb3JuaW5nYW1lcmljYS5jb20vbGl2aW5nL3ZpZGVvL3N0b3J5LXZpcmFsLXZpZGVvLXdhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXN1cnByaXNpbmctbWlja2V5LW1vdXNlLTkzNTg0Mzkx0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZG1vcm5pbmdhbWVyaWNhLmNvbS9hbXAvbGl2aW5nL3ZpZGVvL3N0b3J5LXZpcmFsLXZpZGVvLXdhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXN1cnByaXNpbmctbWlja2V5LW1vdXNlLTkzNTg0Mzkx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The story behind viral video of Walt Disney look-a-like surprising Mickey Mouse,"The story behind viral video of Walt Disney look-a-like surprising Mickey Mouse

Warner Bros. Discovery business is a long-term game says Liberty Media Chairman John Malone

CNBC's David Faber sits down with Liberty Media Chairman John Malone on the company's investor day to discuss his stake in Warner Bros. Discovery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2pvaG4tbWFsb25lLXRhbGtzLXN0cmVhbWluZy13YXJzLTEyMzUyNjQ0MTYv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5ld3Mvam9obi1tYWxvbmUtdGFsa3Mtc3RyZWFtaW5nLXdhcnMtMTIzNTI2NDQxNi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Investor John Malone’s Streaming Wars Update: “There’s a Lot of Blood Flowing Down the Gutters”,"John Malone a major investor at Warner Bros. Discovery says the streaming world is hobbled by too many competitors and that online video giants will do better after inevitable industry consolidation.

“At the moment there’s a lot of blood flowing down the gutters of people who are streaming and some can afford it and some cannot” Malone said during a panel appearance at Liberty Media’s Investor Day. The billionaire investor expressed confidence in Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav for earlier seeing value in merging Scripps Networks Interactive with Discovery and then creating a scripted and unscripted content giant with the spinoff by AT&T of Warner Bros. to merge with Discovery.

The difficulty for streaming giants like Netflix Disney and now Warner Bros. Discovery is too much competition” he argued. “Let’s face it. Everyone went for this mad Oklahoma land rush of streaming … That was a fool’s errand” Malone told investors.

He added AT&T got caught up in that industry stampede before completing its Warner Bros. spinoff with Discovery. “They threw everything but the kitchen sink at it and they put the run-rate of the business in a little bit of stress” Malone recounted.

At the same time he argued Warner Bros. Discovery was throwing off “meaningful cash flows” and the synergies expected from the combined businesses were “not trivial.” Malone also rejected a comment made by an Investor Day audience member that CEO David Zaslav was “overpaid and arrogant.”

Malone who is a member of the Warner Bros. Discovery boardroom and a major investor in the studio said he is obligated to hold his stake for two years because of tax implications “so I’m not wasting any energy on thinking about who Warner Bros. could merge with or what corporate transaction can take place there.”

He added that on paper Zaslav appeared to be overpaid. (The Warner Bros. Discovery CEO’s pay package in 2021 totaled $246.6 million.) “But remember almost all of his compensation is in the form of options that are priced as multiples of today’s stock price. So unless that stock really performs he’s really not overpaid” Malone insisted.

The Liberty Media exec also praised Netflix CEO Reed Hastings for launching his company into video streaming before anyone else and only now facing headwinds because of increased competition. But Malone warned Hastings to tread carefully while bidding on live sports for additional content offerings.

In the U.S. market Malone argued “sports has gotten to be a tax on the public and to be perhaps prohibitively expensive” unlike Europe where expensive sport offerings have always been purchased a la carte by pay TV subscribers.

“If you can buy a big sports event exclusively you will always gain customers. And then you have to chalk that up to marketing expense” he said. Malone added Netflix would recover its footing when there was less competition in the streaming world and reduced spending on expensive original content.

“How profitable they are will depend on the discipline they exude in terms of controlling their costs and keeping their expected growth rationale and not throwing too many Hail Mary passes” Malone argued about the streaming world as it evolves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLWJhbmtlcnMtbWVkaWEtZGVhbHMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1ob2xseXdvb2QtMjAyMi050gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Media Bankers Driving M&A at Warner Bros. Discovery Amazon More,"Many on Wall Street believe that big dealmaking is on pause. The rising cost of borrowing is chilling activity in some corners of the TMT (tech media and telecom) sector which plays a big role in the banks' overall M&A business.

And the big banks haven't been immune to the wave of layoffs affecting large media and tech companies with Goldman Sachs cutting about a dozen in its TMT group in September.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

WarnerMedia was at the heart of the richest transaction fee waterfall for big banks in 2022. AT&T's $43 billion spinoff that created Warner Bros. Discovery also netted big banks some $320 million according to the Financial Times. Some of those same banks had already won big transaction fees when AT&T acquired Time Warner.

It's been a big year too in other sectors of the entertainment universe with sports teams and gaming companies trading hands.

Moelis and LionTree were tapped in August to help figure out what's next for Sinclair's Regional Sports Networks Diamond Sports Group while Brad Pitt's production company Plan B also hired Moelis to shop the production company according to Variety. Bloomberg reported in October that French production company Mediawan which has backing from private equity giant KKR is the frontrunner to acquire Plan B.

The next buzzy deal on the horizon could involve distributor and producer Lionsgate. The company said Wednesday that it has begun the process of spinning off of its studio business from cable network Starz. The ""Hunger Games"" maker whose current market cap is just under $1.8 billion has worked with advisors from LionTree Raine and PJT Partners in the past.

On a smaller scale bankers have also been busy putting together deals for these four emerging entertainment players:

Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs' Candle Media backed by Blackstone acquired all or parts of ventures involving Reese Witherspoon Will Smith and Spanish-language kids content initiatives from Isaac Lee.

Peter Chernin's North Road backed by Providence Equity Partners bought up Red Arrow Studios.

Joshua Grode's Legendary Entertainment backed by Dalian Wanda and now Apollo Group which took a stake in the studio in January.

Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital which funded David Ellison's Skydance and in June backed Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's new production company while also making huge bets in sports leagues such as AC Milan. Earlier this month RedBird added to its Skydance bet as part of a $400 million cash infusion led by KKR.

Perhaps one of the biggest surprises in media circles was Kim Kardashian's entrance as a nascent buyer of media and tech companies in partnership with former Carlyle dealmaker Jay Sammons. With their new private equity venture called Skky Partners the pair have said they'll eye consumer products digital e-commerce hospitality and luxury — a world where they both have plenty of contacts.

There's lots of dry powder still in private equity Navid Mahmoodzadegan co-founder and co-president at investment bank Moelis told Insider. ""The level of dialogue is still very high both with strategics and private equity firms. It's a tougher deal environment for sure given the macroeconomic outlook inflation and interest rates but secular forces leading to M&A are still very much intact and the appetite to do transactions is still very strong"" he said.

Prices for attractive acquisitions might be coming back to earth Mahmoodzadegan predicted. ""As you look out a little bit the disruption in the markets will create opportunities for private equity and strategics to buy assets at more reasonable valuations and potentially engage in public-to-private [deals] once the markets come back at a more active pace.""

""For bigger deals to happen it would be helpful for financing markets to get healthy again"" Mahmoodzadegan noted. ""Generally bigger deals require debt financing at large scale and right now it's difficult to do."" But he's upbeat about the future. ""At some point that will work its way through the system and the debt capital markets will become functional again.""

Insider took a look at some top media bankers who made standout deals in 2022 and are scoping out the opportunities in the rapidly changing world of media. They're in business not just to crunch the numbers but also to understand the personalities and impulses behind new financial structures and fresh combinations to come in 2023.

Discovery team led by David Zaslav amid the drama and red ink of today’s streaming wars.

“At the moment there is a lot of blood flowing down the gutters of people who are streaming. Some of them can afford it and some of them can’t. So my guess is the ones who can’t will ultimately have to look for some kind of consolidation or exit” said Malone during a Q&A at the end of Liberty Media’s annual investor day in NYC. It’s one of the rare regular public appearances for the savvy longtime media investor a major shareholder of Discovery and now of WBD.

One question: What makes him confident the merger will be a success and not “an LBO [leveraged buyout] gone bad?” The company missed expectations last quarter on slow advertising and high mergers costs.

“One thing that gives me confidence is the management. I have enormous confidence in [WBD CEO] David Zaslav and his guys having seen the integration of Scripps with Discovery a couple of years ago” Malone said.

Second the balance sheet which is “very light on near-term maturities” despite a hefty debt load.

Third “even in its absolutely worst year it is generating a 10% cash return on its equity value. So to stay in as an investor and look to the future where the cash return is almost certain to dramatically increase is a pretty good upward pointed vector” said the billionaire with degrees in electrical engineering and economics. The company is generating “meaningful” free cash flow and targeting $3.5 billion in synergies.

WBD in any case can’t be sold for at least two years because the deal was a tax free spinoff Malone noted. “So I am not wasting any time or energy thinking about who [WBD] could merge with or what corporate transaction could take place.” He hinted however at some shakeout. “There are a ton of small streamers who are very specialized who… might have to consolidate into the bigger guys if their content is unique and relevant.”

“Let’s face it. Everybody went through this mad Oklahoma land rush. I am not going to call AT&T management fools but they certainly … threw everything but the kitchen sink at it and put the run rate of the business in a little bit of stress” he said of Warner Media’s previous parent.

He’s not sure how easy it will be to replicate the dual revenue stream of a shrinking linear business which still generates lots of cash. And he blames sports in large part for cord cutting by driving up the price of the cable bundle. “A lot of the consumers were not bailing on the content but the price tag compared to what Netflix and others were offering for entertainment.”

But “as long as there is competition between distributors sports will continue to have a disproportionate market power” he said.

Even Netflix is moving into the arena. Malone called that streamer a “foundational service” and said “Reed Hastings’ shareholders should build him a huge monument…He got out in the lead saw the opportunity and exploited the opportunity and went for scale. Netflix was there early and does an excellent job.” But broadening out the service “by spending so much on so much content is not likely to be successful.”

Netflix started a huge scare earlier this year when it lost subscribers for the first time. A previously rah-rah Wall Street cooled to the business with a much sharper eye on spending and profitability. Streaming profits depend on discipline controlling costs and “rational growth expectations” Malone said.

Meanwhile experimentation especially around bundling will continue. “Disney is trying a bundle of three different streams serving three different audiences [with Disney+ Hulu and ESPN]. HBO Max is attempting to bundle with Discovery+ to see what kind of stability that creates” he said. WBD plans to roll out its combined service this spring.

“If you can buy a sports event exclusively you can always gain users.” But given marketing costs and churn in the long run the service with the best bundle and the lowest costs will be the most profitable” Malone said.

Malone even addressed Zaslav’s pay package after one attendee called him “overpaid.”

“Yes on paper he is quite overpaid. But remember almost all of his compensation is in options that are priced at multiples of today stock price. So unless the stock really performs he is really not overpaid.”

Zaslav’s total pay package came to more than $246 million for 2021 inflated by an option grant valued at an eye popping $202 million. But the options require the stock to hit certain metrics over seven years before they’re in the money. Discovery shares were at $23 when the package was announced and would have needed to hit $35 for instance for the first tranche to be exercised. It hasn’t been a great run and the shares closed today at just under $11.

Malone’s Q&A with Liberty CEO Greg Maffei also presiding followed presentations by executives from Liberty’s various holdings including the Atlanta Braves Formula 1 Charter Communications SiriusXM and Live Nation. The Braves will become a public company. And Liberty Live a new tracking stock will house Liberty’s Live Nation holding.

The Integrated Review Service for Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel Management Decommissioning and Remediation (ARTEMIS) team concluded a six-day follow-up mission to Germany the first IAEA follow-up to an ARTEMIS mission which took place from 7 to 12 November.

The mission was carried out at the request of the Federal Ministry for the Environment Nature Conservation Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) to review the implementation of the findings identified during the initial ARTEMIS mission in 2019. It was hosted by Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit gGmbH (GRS) Germany's central professional organization in the field of nuclear safety in the city of Cologne.

The scope of the ARTEMIS follow-up mission covered all aspects and topics related to the development and implementation of the RWM programme. The mission focused on the national policy and strategy for the management of radioactive waste application of selection criteria in the identification of a site for a disposal facility for high level radioactive waste and cost assessment for the RWM programme. It also reviewed the national plan and cost estimation for the retrieval of waste from the ASSE II former salt mine.

ARTEMIS missions provide independent expert advice from an international team of specialists convened by the IAEA. The review team comprised seven experts from Belgium Finland France Italy the United Kingdom and two IAEA staff members. Reviews are based on IAEA safety standards and technical guidance as well as on international good practices and follow the guidelines of the ARTEMIS review service.

Mission team leader Patrice François Senior Expert in Radioactive Waste Management and Decommissioning at the Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety in France said: “Germany as the first country to call for a follow-up ARTEMIS mission has shown its dedication to meet the findings from 2019 and strong commitment to transparency of communications in the interest of improving standards of safety in implementing its national programme for radioactive waste management.”

Germany has made the decision to stop generating electricity from nuclear power plants. The three remaining operational nuclear power plants were planned to be shut down by the end of 2022. However due to the current energy crisis these reactors which have a total net capacity of 4000 MW(e) they will remain in operation until 15 April 2023 at the latest. Owing to the country’s previously large nuclear power programme with a total of 33 reactors including the three in operation a significant amount of radioactive waste will be generated by decommissioning activities. The waste will need to be stored until it can be safely disposed.

Currently Germany does not have a receiving radioactive waste disposal facility. The Morsleben disposal facility has stopped receiving waste and is being closed. A new disposal facility for low and intermediate level waste is being constructed at the site of former iron ore mine Konrad. A nationwide search has begun to identify a site for a disposal facility for high level radioactive waste.

The mission included interviews and discussions with representatives of BMUV GRS Federal Office for the Safety of Nuclear Waste Management (BASE) Federal Company for Radioactive Waste Disposal (BGE) Company for Storage (BGZ) as well as a site visit to the Biblis Nuclear Power Plant a pressurized water reactor in permanent shutdown situated around 200 km southeast of Cologne to observe the status of the dismantling and the management of radioactive waste.

The team found that Germany has successfully implemented many recommended actions from the 2019 mission. Of the three recommendations and 12 suggestions identified in the initial mission two recommendations and two suggestions require further development including:

Updating the cost assessment for the national waste management programme in the Cost Report based on a consistent approach across all activities including waste retrieval from Asse II mine.

Analysing risk and uncertainty when updating the cost assessment for all public sector components of the radioactive waste and spent fuel management programme.

Assessing whether the geosphere requirements for non-heat generating waste are different from those for high level waste and if they are taking them into account in the application of disposal facility siting criteria.

Making greater use of the radioactive waste inventory to monitor changes in the inventory over time and demonstrate waste minimization.

Gerrit Niehaus Director General for Nuclear Safety and Radiation Safety at BMUV said: “We are happy that we were able to demonstrate that we made progress that most of the 2019 findings could be closed and that no new ones were identified. The findings that remain open will be used to guide us on our way to further improve the safe management of radioactive waste in Germany our national programme and our communication.”

The final mission report will be provided to the Government in about two months.

LOS ANGELES CA — Measuring marine biodiversity with “environmental DNA”—an application of gene sequencing to environmental biology—should permit rapid assessment of changes in marine life. That makes environmental DNA (eDNA) a critical tool for managing our response to climate change. But eDNA only works well if key implementation steps are followed according to a new study of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area published in the journal PeerJ.

“What do we need to know to use eDNA in the coastal ocean and can we make it work well in an important urban setting? Those are the questions that motivated us to launch this study” said Regina Wetzer Curator and Director of the Marine Biodiversity Center at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (NHM).

Answering those questions involved contributions from a natural history museum multiple academic institutions environmental consultants and government agencies—highlighting the challenges involved in using eDNA but also the widespread interest in its use.

eDNA uses genetic sequencing of samples from the environment (in this case ocean water) to inventory biodiversity. “There are genes that differ enough between species that they can be used as identification markers. Every organism sheds DNA by dropping skin cells or other materials so we can take a cup of seawater sequence the DNA in it and use that to inventory organisms in the area” said Zack Gold lead author of the study.

The neighboring Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach form one of the largest port complexes in the world and are a site of intense environmental interest. That made it an interesting site to test eDNA’s ability to act as an effective tool for biodiversity assessment.

This study paired eDNA sampling and conventional ship-based trawl net sampling at seven sites in the port complex. At each site researchers collected multiple eDNA samples each about one liter of seawater just before the trawl net was towed through the same area. That permitted a comparison between eDNA and traditional biodiversity assessment techniques: eDNA detected nearly all of the 17 species of fish found in the trawls but also detected an additional 55 native fish species. Detecting those additional species through conventional sampling requires many more sampling trips and a very high expense.

“We were happy to see eDNA validated alongside ‘conventional’ sampling but we were really excited to see the extra information that came from the eDNA” said Dean Pentcheff researcher and program manager of the Diversity Initiative for the Southern California Ocean (DISCO) at NHM. But getting that extra information depended on having a complete genetic reference library for all the fish in the area—a genetic sequence in an eDNA sample can only be resolved to a species if there is a reference sequence on file for that species. All the fish in the eDNA samples in this study were resolved only after the researchers added the last few fish references to the sequence library.

The eDNA samples from different locations in the ports yielded different species inventories at a statistically significant level. That answered an important question: can eDNA measure variability across an area as small as the port complex or does seawater mix so thoroughly that local differences are completely blurred? This study demonstrated that eDNA in this ocean environment can expose differences between places as close as a few hundred meters apart.

Based on this pilot project the authors assembled a set of recommendations for managers considering eDNA as a tool for biodiversity assessments. The recommendations cover careful selection of the identifying genes and specific advice on how to clean up the sequence data from eDNA samples before searching for sequence matches. Because of the successful species resolution that resulted from building a full sequence reference library a key recommendation is to create regional reference databases.

“These samples of the environment are like time capsules that we’ll be able to exploit in the future” said Adam Wall Crustacea Collections Manager at NHM. That sentiment prompted another of the group’s recommendations: archive eDNA samples and sequence data for long-term use. As sequencing technology improves additional information could come from the samples. As genetic data analysis techniques improve and genetic reference libraries are expanded the sequence data can be analyzed again to get additional results beyond the fish inventories published in this study.

Co-authors on this study include researchers from a broad suite of institutions: Zachary Gold (now at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Rachel S. Meyer (now at the University of California Santa Cruz) Paul H. Barber and Robert Wayne at the University of California Los Angeles; Teia M. Schweizer at Colorado State University; Emily E.

But the split decision by the top court has muddied the waters again on s.15 jurisprudence.

The Supreme Court of Canada's 5-4 decision in Sharma has left many in the legal community disappointed with its interpretation of Section 15 Charter rights and in addressing the impact of mandatory minimum sentences on Indigenous people women in particular. The ruling is somewhat blunted by the passage of Bill C-5 now law by repealing most mandatory minimum sentences from the Criminal Code. But critics say the ruling could still complicate other s. 15 equality claims.

""The outcome is really frustrating"" says Kyla Lee a criminal defence lawyer with Acumen Law Corporation and the vice-chair of the CBA's criminal justice section. ""There is obviously a significant conflict between Sharma and previous Section 15 decisions which talks about where the burden lies in proving that something is discriminatory.""

In Sharma the majority allowed an appeal by the Crown that restored the accused's sentence of imprisonment thereby affirming the constitutionality of provisions that restrict the availability of conditional sentences for certain Criminal Code offences -- in the case at hand for importing cocaine.

Lee takes issue with the majority's view that it needs statistical and academic evidence showing that eliminating conditional sentencing orders contributes to the over-incarceration of Indigenous people. It should have been able to draw the inference she says.

Lee says this runs contrary to the court's jurisprudence on ""the disproportionate effect that sentencing generally has on Indigenous people"" and Gladue principles which require that the circumstances of Indigenous offenders be taken into account in sentencing. ""It's contrary to common sense for a reasonably informed member of the public looking at the justice system.""

Kerri Froc a law professor at the University of New Brunswick says that the majority on the court appears to be trying to resurrect old analysis related to Section 15 of the Charter as well as old legal analysis of discrimination that has been shown to disadvantage equality claimants.

""I'm especially disappointed as someone who calls themselves an originalist that [Justice Russell] Brown is looking at text and history with respect to other constitutional provisions. But when it comes to Section 15 it seems like all bets are off"" Froc says. ""He's going to just resurrect old jurisprudence that wasn't consistent with the purpose of Section 15 for his own ends.""

""As for the scope of the government's obligation under s. 15(1) there is no general positive obligation on the state to remedy social inequalities or enact remedial legislation nor is the legislature bound to its current policies"" wrote Justices Brown and Malcolm Rowe for the majority.

Froc calls the assertion ""purely wrong"" since the government is already legislating on sentencing and in particular conditional sentencing orders.

""It's the denial of a benefit that already exists—the benefit of a conditional sentence"" Froc says. ""This harkens back to old case law in the early 1990s from Ontario in particular which was trying to manipulate the case to scrounge some sort of positive rights element so they could deny on that basis. That is not what you're supposed to be doing in Section 15—it's supposed to be a transformative provision that has positive elements. In Eldridge and Vriend it was talking about a thin and impoverished version of equality to say that it was devoid of any positive element at all.""

Independent Senator Kim Pate a former executive director of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies is also baffled.

""The fact that the majority seems to predicate its position on the fact that there is insufficient evidence to show that mandatory minimum penalties are linked to the over-incarceration of Indigenous people and in particular Indigenous women is quite unbelievable"" Pate says. ""You'd have to have your head in the sand and not pay attention to what's going on. There was ample evidence provided by intervenors.""

Siding with the dissent Pate adds that ""the failure to allow conditional sentences to be used directly impairs the ability of sentencing judges to apply Section 718.2(e) [of the Criminal Code] in sentencing decisions."" This hinders their ability to do their job ""in a way that breaches the Section 15 equality rights in particular of racialized people most especially Indigenous people and even more particularly Indigenous women.""

Froc says that the majority's analysis of discrimination appears to be trying to resurrect the contextual factors from the court's 1999 Law ruling that were problematic for claimants but using different language. The court also seems to be trying to rewind the decision in Fraser in which the court recognized the adverse effects of discrimination based on sex.

""I don't even know what I'll be teaching in terms of [telling] students how to apply the equality test because the majority talks about clarifying it"" Froc says. ""It was clear as day in Fraser and again on all fours with the text and history and now this so-called clarification is putting the law in disarray and I've lost count of the number of equality tests. It's frustrating to see that we were on a good path with equality things seem to be fairly clear and now this is muddying the waters yet again.""

The saving grace in the Sharma ruling is that the court left the door open to future challenges where statistical evidence shows a disproportionate impact on Indigenous offenders says Lee. That evidence should be relatively easy to get. ""We just need to push a little harder.""

Meanwhile Bill C-5 which would repeal several mandatory minimum sentences is nearing completion at the Senate. However Pate says the bill doesn't go far enough when viewed through the lens of reducing the over-representation of Black and Indigenous people in prisons.

""It repeals fewer than half of the mandatory minimum penalties that have been deemed unconstitutional by various courts"" Pate says. ""It therefore leaves a patchwork of some mandatory minimums applying in some jurisdictions and not others."" It also doesn't take into account what former Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin recommended in the court's 2016 Lloyd ruling -- building safety valves into mandatory minimums that would allow judges to exempt outliers to avoid instances of cruel and unusual punishment.

Others such as former senator Murray Sinclair and Marion Buller the former Chief Commissioner for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls have recommended that the government at least include a provision that allows judges to apply the Criminal Code's s. 718.2(e) Gladue analysis for mandatory minimum penalties that remain in place.

Without it we cannot address the disproportionate jailing of Black and Indigenous people particularly Indigenous mothers who often are responding to violence perpetrated against them.

The CBA's criminal justice section supports Bill C-5 even without the safety valve amendments. ""We support anything that allows the elimination of mandatory minimums and it is a CBA policy enacted at the AGM two years ago that the CBA position is to eliminate mandatory minimums and include a safety valve for all sentences except for murder"" Lee says. ""The bill is significant progress toward that.""

Even so Lee adds that she personally wishes the bill went further which is why she supports Pate's proposal to free sentencing judges from following mandatory minimum requirements.

""There is a lot more that could be done and needs to be done"" Lee says. ""A lot of people look to C-5 and say we don't really need a Sharma-style challenge anymore because all of these guns and drugs mandatory minimums are going away. But those are not the only mandatory minimums and limitations on your ability to get a [conditional sentencing order] that exist in the Criminal Code.""

""If we give judges discretion they're going to use it judiciously"" Lee says. ""Giving judges more discretion is not going to lead to more injustice. It's going to lead to a better delivery of justice in our legal system.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xkY29hc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvaG9yc2UtcmFjaW5nL2FuZHJlYS1sZWVrLXRyYWluZWQtaGlnaGJveS10aGUtYmVzdC1iZXQtb2YtZnJpZGF5cy1tb2UtcmFjZXMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8zNzNlOGE3MmJjN2Y3Y2E5YzcwZDA2M2NlNjIzYWNlNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andrea Leek trained Highboy the best bet of Friday’s Moe races,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/sport/horse-racing/andrea-leek-trained-highboy-the-best-bet-of-fridays-moe-races/news-story/373e8a72bc7f7ca9c70d063ce623ace4 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xkY29hc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvaG9yc2UtcmFjaW5nL2FuZHJlYS1sZWVrLXRyYWluZWQtaGlnaGJveS10aGUtYmVzdC1iZXQtb2YtZnJpZGF5cy1tb2UtcmFjZXMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8zNzNlOGE3MmJjN2Y3Y2E5YzcwZDA2M2NlNjIzYWNlNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Bilateral agreement adds additional currency being settled between the two banks

Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) and HSBC Bank plc today announced that the blockchain-based solution they are using for bilateral FX settlements is expanding to include the offshore yuan (CNH). The offshore yuan marks the fifth currency to be settled between the two banks using a shared settlement ledger that currently encompasses the U.S. dollar Canadian dollar British pound sterling and the euro. Since launching the shared DLT solution in December 2021 HSBC and Wells Fargo have settled over $200 billion in transactions and plan to add additional currencies over the coming months.

“We are pleased to expand the capabilities of the platform to include CNH allowing us to reduce risk in the payment settlement process” said Vince Hindman global head of Rates and FX Solutions Wells Fargo Corporate & Investment Bank. “The collaboration shows that we can pursue innovative technologies and apply them in a way that enhances our existing infrastructure and ultimately benefits our clients.”

Commenting on the announcement Mark Williamson global head of FX Partnerships & Propositions at HSBC said: “Extending CNH PvP settlement to Wells Fargo is an important milestone for reducing Herstatt Risk outside G10 currencies. This development is only our first step in extending our coverage into Emerging Markets currencies.”

The shared private ledger is managed by joint Operations teams at HSBC and Wells Fargo with full visibility by each of the parties to the relevant FX settlement along with shared FX transaction records. The platform is governed under the framework of an agreed rulebook that facilitates efficient netting and settlement of FX transactions between HSBC and Wells Fargo in EUR GBP CAD USD and now CNH. Participants in the network are only privy to transactions in which they are a counterparty.

The platform runs on Baton Systems’ proprietary CORE distributed ledger technology and is governed by the Baton rulebook. The platform enables participants to efficiently settle bilateral cross-border obligations across multiple onshore and offshore currencies coupled with the added flexibility of extended settlement windows to optimize PvP risk reduction opportunities.

Notes to Editor:

The FX and payments markets continue to prioritize reducing settlement risk utilizing PvP risk reduction tools on-us settlement and payment netting mechanisms. Recent global industry body statements on these topics include the FX Global Code’s settlement risk principles 35 and 50 the Financial Stability Board’s G20 roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments and the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures Stage 2 report to the G20.

The American Customer Satisfaction Survey (ACSI) is one of the most widely followed studies of customer opinions across dozens of industries. Its most recent industry research covers banks and financial companies. In its “Finance Study 2021-2022” report it revealed that Wells Fargo has the worst customer satisfaction among America’s largest banks.

Some 13546 respondents were surveyed between October 2021 and September 2022. The results covered banks credit unions financial advisors and online investment service providers.

Wells Fargo ranked behind Citibank Bank of America and Chase. In fact it ranked at the bottom of this universe.



The results should be no surprise. Wells Fargo has a long history of customer problems and government punishment. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is pressing Wells Fargo to pay over $1 billion in penalties. The transgressions cover its auto lending business deposit accounts and mortgage loans.



Wells Fargo’s customer problems reached back to scandals in 2016. These have cost two CEOs their jobs according to Think Advisor.

Transcript:

Penny Crosman ( 00:09 ):

Good morning and welcome everyone. I'm Penny Crosman executive editor of technology at American Banker. Fintech partnerships have been in the news quite a bit lately. The Treasury Department released a 128-page report yesterday calling for firmer regulation around bank- fintech partnerships. The OCC and other bank regulators have also called for more guardrails about around bank-fintech partnerships. And there are obviously a lot of risks to working with third parties such as fintechs. And there are also rewards. Here to talk with us today about all of this is Michelle Moore executive vice president and head of digital at Wells Fargo. Welcome Michelle.

Michelle Moore ( 00:58 ):

Thank you Penny. Good morning everyone.

Penny Crosman ( 01:01 ):

Thank you so much for joining us. So if you were in charge of writing rules for bank-fintech partnerships or relationships what would be on your wishlist or your list of rules?

Michelle Moore ( 01:16 ):

Well I would keep it simple and easy for everyone to remember which is I believe that we all should be held to the same standards for the benefit of all of our customers. We're all doing the same thing with the same objective. We're handling customers' data their identity their authentication their finances and it is incumbent upon us all to act together as one to make sure that they are safe and secure.

Penny Crosman ( 01:46 ):

And what do you see as some of the risks that banks and fintechs should be concerned about when they work together?

Michelle Moore ( 01:55 ):

Well the risks are really related to my comments around the standards. The risks are as an individual consumer what is happening to my money what is happening to my identity? And I put that in the hands of the financial institutions that manage that on my behalf. And I'm putting a lot of trust into these institutions. So the risks are we're not coordinated we're not talking we're not handling the data the same way we're not protecting it the same way which therefore if we had standards that were all on a level playing field it would help I think all of us to move forward as an industry.

Penny Crosman ( 02:42 ):

And when you are looking at a fintech that you might work with what are some of the due diligence steps that you think about and take?

Michelle Moore ( 02:53 ):

Well that's a great question. Just last week I was in California meeting with some fintechs and I had one yesterday. I'm always meeting with fintechs. I think partnership and collaboration is very important in our industry. We can build off of each other but when I'm talking to them I am talking about the client experience. How does it feel? How does it work? But I am also concerned about their business continuity plans their operational stability their operational excellence metrics. So how are they ensuring that they're operating at a standard that if we are in partnership if something happens how do we ensure that it it is seamless to customers and that they can continue to go on managing their finances.

Penny Crosman ( 03:45 ):

Now an audience member has just asked whether greater opening to fintechs puts at risk the financial commercial separation. I'm not sure exactly what's meant by the financial commercial separation but how do you feel about that?

Michelle Moore ( 04:14 ):

I don't see it that way. I see it as partnership. Because if you think of what has happened in our industry from Apple Pay that launched way back in 2014 to what we announced at Money 2020 with our partnership with Google in Fargo is making us a better stronger value add to our clients for everyone. So I don't know that I feel that if we don't figure out and always have a healthy sense of paranoia on meeting in ourselves then someone's going to do it and we can either partner with them or we can let them take over which is not what any of us are trying to do. We have an opportunity to serve millions and millions of clients together.

Penny Crosman ( 05:05 ):

And we should probably point out there are different kinds of fintech relationships. Your relationship with Google I would call a vendor relationship where there's also collaboration because you're using the Google Cloud and you're working with Google engineers to help you with the Fargo digital assistant. I think maybe what the question was about was more where you're working with a fintech that does something really different that's not necessarily a financial business maybe more the rent a charter type relationships. Does there have to be a separation between the financial work that the bank does and a fintech that does something really different from the basic business of the bank?

Michelle Moore ( 06:01 ):

Well and it's where you have to make sure you have all the right controls in place. And so every situation will be different. But large institutions such as Wells Fargo we have a responsibility to make sure that our risk and controls are proper and in place whether we're direct or that we're partnering. And that goes back to my comment at the beginning same standards. Everyone needs to be held to the same standards regardless of size. As you were talking I was watching one of the questions come up about convincing execs that fintechs are worth the spend and the time which I think is kind of related to the question that around the financial commercial.

( 06:47 )

I personally am very open to having these discussions with fintechs. As I mentioned I was in California last week I had a conversation the other day. Some of them are like you talked about our relationship with Google is different than the fintech that I met with on Monday that provides a very distinct service. It's worth the investment if you can't do it yourself if it doesn't make sense for you to do it yourself you ensure that the continuity is there that the fintechs can handle the volume of your institution. And that's how I would go about convincing if I wanted to bring on a completely new fintech to Wells Fargo. That's my thought process are they stable? Can they handle the volume? Do they have business continuity? Do they have the right controls in place to protect the customer experience? Who owns the customer experience? I mean there's a litany of questions that we go through but the spirit of all of it is collaboration and partnership for sure.

Penny Crosman ( 07:59 ):

That makes sense. And I think there was a question about would you prefer to work with a young innovative young company or an older more established company? Is that part of your calculation?

Michelle Moore ( 08:14 ):

No because I'm really evaluating what it is that they have to offer. And so I don't really. I might have to have different questions for younger startup companies on their own financial stability and health and what is the backup plan if something were to go wrong. But I don't look at it that way. I'm more interested in what can they do to help Wells Fargo be more successful with our customers and our clients.

Penny Crosman ( 08:47 ):

Can you share how many fintechs you work with?

Michelle Moore ( 08:51 ):

Oh gosh. Honestly Penny. I don't know that number offhand.

Penny Crosman ( 08:54 ):

Okay. And there's also a question about whether you have formal agreements with FinTech. I would assume there's always some sort of contract.

Michelle Moore ( 09:05 ):

Yeah Wells Fargo for sure at the big banks definitely. There's very rigid process and documentation and my legal risk and compliance partners are my best friends.

Penny Crosman ( 09:19 ):

And are there certain things that are always in those agreements certain clauses or

Michelle Moore ( 09:27 ):

I'm sure but again that's why I rely on my partners because I've seen some of those agreements and I'm not sure that I'm the right person to sign off on them. That's definitely the expertise of my legal risk and compliance partners.

Penny Crosman ( 09:42 ):

Right. And then I think there's also been talk of monitoring fintechs especially in those rent-a-charter style relationships to make sure that nothing untoward is happening. Is that something that you've had to maybe do more of keep a closer eye on fintech partnerships?

Michelle Moore ( 10:09 ):

Well I keep a close eye on all of our partnerships through monthly business reviews and metrics and tracking and auditing. And once we're partners it is as if they report into us into Wells Fargo. Again we hold our vendors to the same standards that we are held accountable to working directly with our customers. So I enjoy actually having the meetings to see how we're progressing on metrics to ensure the stability is therem to name a few.

Penny Crosman ( 10:49 ):

We've also gotten a question about when you do collaborate and partner how does Wells think about promoting that partnership and talking about the experience and results. You obviously have done that with Google but how do you look at that in general?

Michelle Moore ( 11:04 ):

Well again I do think that it depends on the partnership and what we can and cannot say. I was very proud to showcase and talk about the partnership with Google a few weeks back but that was the first big one that I've been a part of since I've been here. And I'm just coming up on my two-year anniversary here. So probably more to come on that one in the future that I really have experience with here.

Penny Crosman ( 11:38 ):

And just to close out the risk side of the discussion... well actually we just got a good question about have you ever worked with a fintech and then they ended up dissolving their business? That's an interesting question.

Michelle Moore ( 11:53 ):

No actually I've been a part of where we've had to make sure that they had enough capital to stay solvent paying attention to what's going on there. But nothing where we've had to shift course and step into our continuity plans. But that is also why we have the continuity plans. In the event that happens what do we do? And we are very diligent here at Wells Fargo to make sure that those continuity plans are living breathing documents.

Penny Crosman ( 12:31 ):

And then there's also a question about how have your partnerships affected regulatory exams and what kind of feedback have you gotten from regulatory agencies?

Michelle Moore ( 12:44 ):

Well of course they're very interested in what are the metrics how are we monitoring how are we auditing how are we sharing the data across how are we protecting customer data? But nothing different or new to me. I've been in this industry for so long it just seems like it's normal course of business whether it's talking directly to me about what's going on in Wells Fargo or what's going on with Wells Fargo and Google and what did we do there? So to me it's nothing I haven't seen a change. It seems like it's just part of business.

Penny Crosman ( 13:22 ):

And then also an interesting question about how important is it for a fintech to offer a proof of value period to help decide whether the solution is potentially viable for Wells or not? And then how competitive is the internal resource allocation for IT staff to be able to conduct a proof of value?

Michelle Moore ( 13:43 ):

Well I know this is probably going to sound like a non answer but it depends on what we're doing. And it depends on the solution and the size of the company and the magnitude of the project. Sometimes we have to do an extensive proof of concept sometimes we don't. But I don't have a one solid answer because it really is very specific to the partnership the company and the outcome.

Penny Crosman ( 14:11 ):

And then we also have a question about how do you think about build versus partner? I'm sure that's a constant question.

Michelle Moore ( 14:20 ):

A constant question for a long time. For as long as I've been in this space. Look when we partnered with Google to be the engine for Fargo Google provides the best natural language processing. Why wouldn't we partner with them to do that? And so for me it is can we build it? Should we build it? If we partner can we go faster? Can we go better? So I am in favor of building versus buy decisions. Sometimes companies choose to go 100% internal sometimes they buy everything. I'm in the middle which is evaluate all of your options and make the right decision based on the company and the customer.

Penny Crosman ( 15:13 ):

And there's also a question about are there trigger points in a relationship where you would decide to acquire the fintech?

Michelle Moore ( 15:22 ):

I am sure there are but I have not had that experience so I don't have a very good answer on that one.

Penny Crosman ( 15:28 ):

Okay. I also wanted to ask you I feel like for a fintech working with a big bank can be fantastic because if they can talk about it then they can get all sorts of other customers. Because if this big bank has vetted and said that it is using it then it must be safe good for others. But I've also seen and heard of cases where a fintech team meets with a bank team shares their ideas and then the bank team takes those ideas and develops them themselves. And the fintech is kind of cast off. And I just wondered what you think about that. Is there anything that can be done? Is there anything you try to do or think about to make sure that it's fair for everybody?

Michelle Moore ( 16:15 ):

Well that's right. I'm just one person but that's the way I approach it which is I don't think that is the right thing to do to take somebody else's idea. But for me it's more about again the partnership the evaluation what are we going to do? And if we choose not to then that's their proprietary information. And it is hard for fintechs to work with big banks. I know our processes are cumbersome and require a lot of work. So to be tried and true and tested that's great. And if we choose to go different ways I mean the fintech should protect themselves with their nondisclosure agreements and any other legal documents to make sure that their intellectual capacity or isn't stolen.

Penny Crosman ( 17:16 ):

Can you give an example of a fintech partnership that's worked out really well for you either at Wells Fargo or at Bank of America?

Michelle Moore ( 17:28 ):

Not that I could disclose I don't think. Anything that you've read about you would know. Obviously I'm going to continue to point to what we just did with Google because that's public knowledge but most of the others I don't know that I could say publicly.

Penny Crosman ( 17:45 ):

Just further on that how do you decide what to announce publicly and what not to?

Michelle Moore ( 17:54 ):

Well I get a lot of help from legal risk and compliance. But I mean the journey with Google started with Wells Fargo's overall cloud strategy the year prior which was also an announcement. So this was our first rendition of using that partnership to bring Fargo to market. But again it all is based on a lot of due diligence internally as to what we can and cannot say publicly.

Penny Crosman ( 18:22 ):

That makes sense. So this is our leader's channel. So we always like to ask a few leadership questions. So you've got an internal team of I don't know how many people but a lot of people. And then you have fintechs that you work with. How do you manage these groups of people that are inside and outside of the bank both from just a management point of view and from sort of a culture point of view? I'm sure there are culture differences between the companies sometimes.

Michelle Moore ( 18:51 ):

Well I have a wonderful leadership team and they are aligned to their respective partnerships and fintechs and managing through them. I meet with many of them throughout the year at random different cadences. And I spend a lot of time in California and New York and in other places. I like to be out in the market and out meeting people. A good portion of my team is on the West Coast so that we are part of the community there. Once we're a partnership and we're in collaboration to me it's as if we operate as one because we have the same goal in mind which is Wells Fargo customers. And that is very important to me. By the way Penny when I'm evaluating partnerships do they share the same goal and vision which is to help Wells Fargo's clients. That has to be paramount to the discussion and where the partnership goes in the future.

Penny Crosman ( 20:03 ):

That makes sense. And you started at Wells Fargo during the first year of the pandemic. What do you feel we've from so many people I'm assuming you don't have a piano in your office so you're working from home today what do you think we've learned in the past two years about managing people remotely from a productivity point of view from a communication point of view from a process point of view keeping everything going?

Michelle Moore ( 20:46 ):

Well what I think we all learned is that when the pandemic hit we all moved fast to make sure that there was no loss in productivity and that we could accommodate the needs of everyone. And then as time progressed we learned that there is something to be said about being in the office and walking down the hallway and knocking off a few to-dos and the personal conversation that can happen versus a scheduled got to log into Zoom. There's spontaneity in being in the office and a personal touch about just being there with someone. So we learned we could go home. We learned that we missed each other. So then therefore now we have a hybrid which I believe should be in Wells Fargo to be in the office a portion of the week. And today I am at home which I am very thankful for the opportunity to be here today for things I have to get done. But I spent the rest of this week in the office. And so it is possible to manage at home or in the office. And I believe that we're all working to figure out the right balance. But I think remote working is something we learned was possible. I don't believe pre-covid we ever would've thought it was how could you do that? What is everybody doing at home? And now we all know what everybody's doing at home and that I play the piano. But yeah I'm a fan of what the pandemic taught us which is we can do a hybrid work style.

Penny Crosman ( 22:33 ):

Do you think it's harder to motivate people or is it easier to motivate people because people need to prove themselves more since they're not in the office every day.

Michelle Moore ( 22:43 ):

I don't think so. I don't see that particularly in my experience with my team everybody you still have the same deliverables and due dates and execution dates and scrum team meetings whether you're in the office or you're not. So that is what we all are held to objectives and key metrics. Those don't change depending on where you're sitting.

Penny Crosman ( 23:06 ):

All right. And we have another question that's come in from the audience. How do you think about the rapid adoption of digital banking during the pandemic has influenced Wells Fargo's relationships with customers? Do you think the digital banking experience is as strong as the retail experience?

Michelle Moore ( 23:27 ):

So I always have been a proponent of both and it's the branches and digital. I'm super excited of course from where I sit about the accelerated use of adoption I of digital I believe it just helps customers do things that they really don't need to leave their house to go do. Drive to the branch to deposit a check for example or call the call center to activate your debit card. Why we want to have our teammates be there in those times of need in those times of opening an account of advice planning. And so there is a opportunity to ensure the bridge exists between digital and physical. But I am glad that the adoption has accelerated so that clients are aware of everything that they have available to them.

Penny Crosman ( 24:29 ):

And so to kind of close out the initial theme of this topic of this whole session what do you think are the biggest rewards and the biggest risks of working with fintech?

Michelle Moore ( 24:43 ):

The biggest rewards and the biggest risk of fintechs. The rewards are the collaboration the extension of your imagination of what is possible and different perspectives and diversity of thought and different ways to approach and achieve solutions. Those are the rewards. Because you're outside of the box you have multiple ways of looking at the opportunity which is why I like the partnerships. The risks of course are related to the controls of the industry that we work in and we have to get that right. Risks and controls are our business as well. And the fintechs while it may not be the top of mind it is what is important to the industry that you're partnering with. And we have to make sure that we get it right. So that's the risks are the controls and the procedures and the stability and making sure that things work as designed.

Penny Crosman ( 26:00 ):

And I suppose the ultimate risk is if something goes wrong and customers get hurt. How do you typically look at the responsibility if you're working with a fintech to offer something like Fargo to customers who's ultimately responsible when something goes wrong and who's the throat to choke is the expression.

Michelle Moore ( 26:26 ):

Well that example me and mine. The customer doesn't know who's providing XYZ service. They know that Wells Fargo is their institution and they're holding Wells Fargo accountable. And therefore we are accountable. And that's why the standards that we have for anybody we bring on board are equivalent to the standards we keep for ourselves.

Penny Crosman ( 26:57 ):

That makes sense. And would you ever work with an outside third party on your actual strategy? Is strategy ever a shared collaborative thing or is strategy all in house?

Michelle Moore ( 27:17 ):

Depends. So I have seen it done in different ways and I did spend some time working as a consultant on strategy prior to joining Wells Fargo. So I think it's specific to the institution and what they want it to be.

Penny Crosman ( 27:39 ):

All right. Well unfortunately we are just about out of time. I wanna thank you Michelle Moore so much for coming. I really appreciate it. Great conversation. And I want to thank everyone in the audience for your great questions. I appreciate that and I hope you all have a great day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJsb3R0ZW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2JhbmtpbmcvYXJ0aWNsZTI2ODg4ODYzMi5odG1s0gFNaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY2hhcmxvdHRlb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFua2luZy9hcnRpY2xlMjY4ODg4NjMyLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Need a quick $500?

The winners and losers already are being sorted as the latest round of real estate investment trust (REIT) earnings made clear. And unsurprisingly strong regional operators are leading the pack.

Welltower (NYSE: WELL) and Sabra Health Care REIT (Nasdaq:SBRA) both transitioned and/or sold large portfolios to operators they believed were stronger partners.

LTC Properties (NYSE: LTC) has taken somewhat of a similar approach as it works to de-age its portfolio and redeploy capital into more strategic assets.

National Health Investors Inc. (NYSE: NHI) is also taking advantage of a normalizing seller’s market and pruning its portfolio of underperforming assets as it looks to be buyers in the coming years.

Some like Invesque (TSE: IVQ.U) have shrunk their involvement in nursing homes all together in favor of a primarily private-pay seniors housing portfolio.

Looking ahead the end of the public health emergency (PHE) sometime in 2023 should only accelerate the big sort that is happening.

I believe CareTrust REIT (NYSE: CTRE) Chief Investment Officer Mark Lamb said it best: “I think the end of the public health emergency … will be the end of the line for a lot of operators.”

While the industry may see further constriction I also believe the best in class operators will only get stronger and that in turn will make the industry as a whole better able to weather any future storms.

Below are my takeaways from Skilled Nursing News’ coverage of 3Q REIT earnings calls.

The end of the road for some

As larger providers downsize and reframe their portfolios to focus more on market-based strategies REITs will continue to look to partner with the best operators to make those transitions possible.

Sabra for example divided up a 24-SNF portfolio previously leased to operator North American Health Care Inc. to the Ensign Group (Nasdaq: ENSG) and Avamere Family of Companies.

Avamere while operating across eight states has a stronghold in the Pacific Northwest and has a portfolio entirely west of the Mississippi. And while Ensign is an industry giant the company is well known for its locally-focused operations and region-specific structure.

The REIT considered other options for the transitioning SNFs such as rent reduction but Sabra leadership felt the option wasn’t in line with the portfolio’s performance.

In terms of the Sabra deal Chief Investment Officer Chad Keetch said during the Stephens Annual Investment Conference that the team is excited to build that relationship in a market where Ensign’s foundation is strong.

“All of those are fantastic opportunities with prices that we’re excited about and spread out [between] South Carolina Texas Arizona … backfilling within the geographies that we have which is always our first priority” Keetch said. “We love to grow where we exist and there’s lots of room to continue to do that.”

Welltower CEO Shankh Mitra called the decision to transition and sell 147 ProMedica Senior Care skilled nursing assets to Integra Health a “win” for all parties involved.

“ProMedica wants to focus on its core business and wants to be in the higher margin business … It’s a very significant improvement in their credit. For Welltower it’s obviously a great day for some value realization as well as obviously taking this portfolio to the hands where we can create another round of very significant upstep of values. For Integra they’re coming in at a very attractive basis and obviously they’re creating the value that they will share the upside with us” he said during the company’s Q3 earnings call.

ProMedica agreed to surrender its 15% interest in the SNF assets involved in their existing 85/15 joint venture with the real estate investment trust (REIT) and is contributing nearly $500 million in a working capital consideration.

The transaction will also bring ProMedica Senior Care’s remaining portfolio which includes 10 non-Welltower SNFs back to profitability.

Mitra also specifically noted during the earnings call that unlike senior living and other businesses where Welltower is more familiar the REIT has no issue relying on Integra and its regional affiliates to execute on the necessary operational improvements to drive margins.

LTC Properties recently announced a $62 million joint venture with PruittHealth to purchase three nursing homes in Florida making the first time the REIT and operator are working together.

The three facilities were constructed between 2018 and 2021 with a combined licensed bed count of 299 – primarily offering private rooms.

This deal and LTC’s $52 million purchase of four newly built Texas facilities in 2Q to be operated by Ignite Medical Resorts align nicely with the REIT’s plans to shift its portfolio.

The common theme in these moves across different REITs is a deepening reliance on strong regional operators while the ProMedica deal sees another industry giant radically shrink. Golden Living’s transition to Brickyard and Consulate’s pivot to a regional focus are other recent examples of this trend.

2023 could be ‘the best year of growth’ for skilled nursing

Industry headwinds are real with labor shortages and inflation among the challenges cited across the REIT earnings calls.

But the messages were not entirely dire with payment rates being one positive.

Some providers operate in states that have already increased Medicaid payments permanently or extended Covid-related bumps into the next year and will benefit compared to those that do not.

For the industry as a whole operators were granted a reprieve as the 2.7% Medicare rate increase that went into effect in October was better than initially feared.

While recognizing the expected challenges ahead Stifel analysts noted that 2023 could be a strong year for growth in skilled nursing.

Ensign has long been seen as a very strong operator that only continues to grow. The San Juan Capistrano Calif.-based company is now likely the largest nursing home provider in the country and Keetch calls its current acquisition strategy “opportunistic.”

During Q3 2022 alone Ensign acquired 17 new SNFs with 12 in Texas two in South Carolina two in Arizona and one in Nevada marking one of the biggest acquisition quarters in years.

“At a time when economic uncertainties are high we expect continued outperformance from Ensign’s experienced management team localized operating model strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation” Stifel analysts wrote in a note published Oct. 26.

And Ensign is not the only one expected to flourish in 2023.

Like CareTrust LTC Properties also expects valuations to come down further in the coming months as operators exit the space voluntarily or are forced to make difficult decisions and make deals at prices that are more reflective of historical cap rates and price per bed valuations.

“We’re seeing more actual acquisition opportunities in markets that we and our operators are looking to grow in. Unfortunately yet predictably sellers still believe they’re going to achieve peak pricing that they could have received in 2021 in early 2022. It remains to be seen how long this period of price discovery lasts” CareTrust’s Lamb said during the company’s earnings call.

By the middle of next year REITs should be in a good position to make more investments and contribute to the growth of strong operators further establishing a new pecking order in terms of operating companies that boast both scale and quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s a big statement coming a week after Eli Lilly lost around $15 billion from its market cap after a fake account tweeted out that “insulin was free now.” The saga forced Lilly to apologize and according to reports from The Washington Post pull back ads from the platform and pause its comms strategy.

The fake account took advantage of the Twitter Blue subscription service an idea from new owner Elon Musk that charges people $8 a month to have the blue tick on their account. The checkmark used to mean the account had been verified and authenticated. Under the new service though the supposed verification badge could be bought by anyone.

The fake Lilly account had that tick leading it to garner thousands of views and likes as it looked like the real thing.

But ZoomRx's quick-fire report shows that while what happened to Lilly may have irked pharma doctors—a core target on Twitter for the industry—are not leaving and therefore neither should they.

ZoomRx tapped its social media scraping artificial intelligence tool to look at the impact of the Lilly/Twitter debacle on physicians' attitude and usage of Twitter. The firm found that 75% of physicians—via a sample size of 566 doctors—who were active during oncology conferences continued to post on Twitter over the past week.

“Despite the frustration with Elon Musk it seems physicians aren’t quitting” the report shared with Fierce Pharma Marketing found.

Looking through examples of some leading doctors on the site found that “despite expressing frustration physicians—especially digital opinion leaders—have decided to stay because Twitter has become essential to help patients advance science and fight misinformation.”

ZoomRx's advice? “Pharma firms that manage to maintain positive relations with the #MedTwitter community even during this chaos would end up increasing their brand equity.”

There was similar advice from the FDA Commissioner Robert Califf M.D. who earlier this month—and before the Lilly fiasco—implored users to not “abandon Twitter” and that he “believes in the power of social media being used for good.”

Twitter Blue is currently paused while Musk plans the launch a new version of the paid service targeted for the end of the month. There may be bigger problems however as rumors swell that many of the core Twitter staff are exiting the company in droves leaving the site’s future in the balance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1YmJlcm5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZnJldWRlbmJlcmctcGFya2VyLWhhbm5pZmluLXRvcC1maXJzdC1ydWJiZXItbmV3cy1tb2xkZWQtZ29vZHMtcmFua2luZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freudenberg Parker-Hannifin top first Rubber News molded goods ranking,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.rubbernews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/freudenberg-parker-hannifin-top-first-rubber-news-molded-goods-ranking (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001E60FCC4850>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1YmJlcm5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZnJldWRlbmJlcmctcGFya2VyLWhhbm5pZmluLXRvcC1maXJzdC1ydWJiZXItbmV3cy1tb2xkZWQtZ29vZHMtcmFua2luZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWVyY2VwaGFybWEuY29tL3BoYXJtYS9hcGVsbGlzLWNsb3NlbHktd2F0Y2hlZC1leWUtZHJ1Z3MtZ2V0cy1uZXctZmRhLWdvYWwtZGF0ZS1hZnRlci1jaGFuZ2UtZGF0YS1zdWJtaXNzaW9uLXNjYXJlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apellis' closely watched eye drug gets new FDA goal date after changes to its filing scared investors,"After some investor clamor Apellis Pharmaceuticals’ blockbuster hopeful eye drug pegcetacoplan is back on the FDA’s review track.

The FDA has accepted a voluntary amendment to Apellis’ application for pegcetacoplan as an eye injection for geographic atrophy (GA) an advanced stage of age-related macular degeneration the company said Friday. The agency has set a new target decision deadline of Feb. 26 2023.

The FDA was previously expected to deliver a verdict by Nov. 26. But in a surprise development Apellis earlier this month said it was submitting extended 24-month efficacy data—on top of the 18-month and one-year results in the original application package.

Investors were confused by the change in plans and Apellis’ stock price tanked on the news at the time. Industry watchers feared that the company might have received some negative feedback from the FDA that prompted the change in plans.

For its part Apellis believes that with the inclusion of the 24-month data the company has the “potential to have the best product profile at launch for pegcetacoplan with minimal impact to launch timing” CEO Cedric Francois M.D. Ph.D. said in a Friday statement.

Apellis has a lot hanging on pegcetacoplan a C3 complement inhibitor that’s currently approved under the brand name Empaveli as an under-the-skin infusion for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In that rare complement-driven disease the drug faces competition from AstraZeneca’s C5 inhibitors Soliris and Ultomiris. In the third quarter Empaveli only generated $17.7 million in the U.S.

By comparison there’s no FDA-approved therapy for GA which affects an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. alone. Analysts believe the drug could generate blockbuster-level sales in GA with consensus forecasts collected by Evaluate Pharma recently putting the drug’s 2028 sales at $2.6 billion. Still competition in the form of Iveric Bio's C5 agent Zimura is tailing close behind.

In its Friday announcement Apellis again emphasized that the revision was “unsolicited” meaning it wasn’t requested by the FDA.

During Apellis’ third-quarter earnings call last week CEO Francois defended the decision arguing that the revision would allow pegcetacoplan the “best possible label” at launch.

By Francois’ estimate the extended review period would mean just a six-week delay to the commercial lunch of pegcetacoplan in GA. But submitting 24-month results after an initial approval would mean a separate filing that could take months to work its way through the FDA process he added.

Apellis says it was emboldened by the longer-term data from its two phase 3 trials Derby and Oaks. In the trials pegcetacoplan showed “an acceleration in the reduction in lesion growth” after the 24-month follow-up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZWhlYWx0aC5lbGV0c29ubGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS9lbWVyZ2luZy1mcm9tLWRpc3J1cHRpb24taW5kaWFuLXBoYXJtYS10YWtlcy10aGUtbmV4dC1sZWFwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emerging from Disruption: Indian Pharma takes the next leap,"Riding the digital transformation wave that unleashed a slew of transformations the Indian Pharma sector has turned a new leaf. As the world adapts to an amalgamation of the old & new all industries— including the pharmaceutical sector—will need to adopt novel technology and alter its methods of operation shared industry experts with Kaanchi Chawla of the Elets News Network (ENN).

The pharmaceutical sector has seen significant changes recently and is expected to reach $65 bn by 2024 and to $120 bn by 2030. Popularly known as the Pharmacy of the world the Indian Pharma sector has been developing treatments and cures for over a century now. And with the development of 21st-century technologies the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a massive revamp. The most important trends in the pharmaceutical sector include Artificial Intelligence (AI) Blockchain Technology Cloud Technology Digital Processes and other Industry 4.0 technologies that are spurring innovation throughout the trends in the pharmaceutical industry.

The country also accounts for ~60 per cent of global vaccine demand and is a leading supplier of DPT BCG and Measles vaccines. 70 per cent of WHO’s vaccines (as per the essential Immunisation schedule) are sourced from India.

Trends in the Pharmaceutical Industry

Use of Artificial Intelligence

All industries including the healthcare industry are embracing Artificial Intelligence. Over the past two years the pharmaceutical business has experienced invasive growth. Artificial Intelligence is often employed to enhance medication design methods and preparation times. It is a powerful data mining tool that uses massive pharmacological data and machine learning techniques. Accelerating drug research and development is only one of the distinct roles that using AI in the pharmaceutical sector is predicted to play in the future. Clinical studies fraud detection and the general improvement of drugs are some of the important areas in which AI will help.

Integration of Blockchain Technology

The pharmaceutical business is one of many that is driving digital transformation with blockchain technology. Pharmaceutical firms can increase productivity by optimising operations when they employ blockchain technology. This consists of transactions between hospitals clinics regulators and other stakeholders in the healthcare industry. Additionally it can enhance the effects of research and development.

Digital Processes

We are not entirely unfamiliar with digital procedures. It is something that will nevertheless pick up steam in the pharmaceutical sector. Over time manual procedures have grown to be accepted as standard. But today digital processes which have enriched operational efficiency and facilitated adherence to standard operating procedures with greater ease have replaced it. This is a style that will endure. Because the advantages of integrating digital procedures far outweigh the costs many pharmaceutical companies value them. Additionally it increases transparency and may lessen data loss.

Use of Cloud Technology

Pharmaceutical firms can effectively collaborate with a variety of stakeholders. It offers a chance to enhance data integrity by putting in place a solid architecture employing cloud technology. Due to applications deployed on the cloud there have been increased observance of appropriate approaches/methods quality requirements and laws. The pharmaceutical industry will expand in tandem with other industries thanks to the expanding use of technology.

Precision Medicine

Precision medicine is needed for both efficient drug development and patient health care. Precision medicine’s goal is to make sure that a drug is formulated for maximum patient effectiveness and results. More than 450 drugs have been taken off the market in the last 25 years as a result of negative side effects. This is one of the reasons precision medicine is envisioned to be such an essential part of the transformation in the industry.

More emphasis on the significance of R&D

The healthcare sector has a sophisticated emphasis. Making sure that research and development reach the intended audience is something that pharmaceutical companies are more worried about than ever.

Three key criteria (i.e. anticipated lifetime global profits from a new medicine estimated expenditures to produce a new drug and laws and programmes that affect the supply and demand for prescription drugs) determine how much money pharmaceutical corporations spend on R&D.

These factors are altering the pharmaceutical industry’s operations and its rate of expansion. The industry’s levels of innovation are likely to have a significant influence and will benefit the developing pharmaceutical industry.

Almost 38 per cent of industry experts predict big data to have the most significant impact in the pharma segment. Pharmaceutical companies can speed up to $100 million per year on recalls linked to labeling mistakes.

Many trends and breakthroughs have emerged in the pharmaceutical industry as a result of the expanding use of technology in the sector. Nikkhil K Masurkar CEO Entod Pharmaceuticals shared “The pharmaceutical industry along with the healthcare industry is witnessing a huge digital transformation in recent times. Developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Blockchain Big Data analytics and Data Science have completely changed how the pharma industry works. Using AI in the pharma industry has various roles expected to expand like accelerating drug discovery and development.

The Indian pharmaceutical industry has come a long way and has become the sunrise sector of the country. Using AI in the pharmaceutical industry has redefined how scientists develop new drugs tackle diseases and more. The key benefit of employing AI in the pharmaceutical industry is the time it takes to test a drug and the time it takes for a drug to get approval and reach the market.

Dr Vishal Rajgarhia Director Finecure Pharmaceuticals Limited stated “The use of Artificial Intelligence has hastened the discovery and production of new medications and therapies at considerably reduced costs which help in increasing productivity and improving efficiency. Artificial Intelligence is also a great help in designing marketing strategies and practical accessibility to hitherto unexplored markets. Big data is an information treasure trove an asset for developing new solutions. Pharmaceutical companies can use the power of unlimited data to make more remarkable strides in discovering and developing new drugs as well as new applications for existing compounds. Blockchain technology is another innovation that has helped the industry evolve and grow.”

And that’s not all. Arjun Deshpande Founder & CEO Generic Aadhaar expressed “Digitalisation Big Data and Artificial Intelligence help in increasing the productivity of the pharmaceutical sector. Demand and need have increased in R&D that ultimately leading to the increasing number of medicines. It has also a positive effect on the sales of medicines. Technology in the pharma sector has made pharmacy easier and more accessible for everyone.”

The growing expanse of technology has resulted in the generation of huge amounts of data that needs to be leveraged well to get a better grasp of the growing industry trends. Jitendra Mishra Chief Information Officer-VP Akums said “Advancing technology means employees are becoming more and more able to make data-based decisions for their customers. Businesses need a transparent flow of the results throughout the business – customer information focusing on customer satisfaction and customer happiness. Capturing digital transformation data is vital for any size of business. Creating a completely transparent and data-based business culture between departments saves significant time and costs.”

The future landscape of the sunrise sector

There is no denying that covid has given rise to new possibilities and developments in the Indian pharmaceutical sector. The pharmaceutical business periodically launched new trends and technologies to address the issues of COVID which helped them gain momentum in the next few years. People all throughout the world had different issues as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite it hitting hard the pharma sectors turned the crisis into an opportunity. The demand for vaccines along with saving the lives of people became strong and this led to various innovations in the pharma sector.

The pharma industry has undoubtedly risen to the challenge in the years following COVID-19 exemplified by the fast-tracked innovation and new technologies developed during the crisis. Disruptive technologies and emerging trends such as Artificial Intelligence 3D printing precision medicine and blockchain will impact the manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceuticals. The pharmaceutical business must further adopt newer technology to successfully compete for a brighter future in the healthcare ecosystem.

On the portable SSD (PSSD) front the WD_BLACK P40 Game Drive SSD augmented the company's strong set of offerings in the gaming market. As a complement to the popular WD_BLACK P50 Game Drive SSD the new PSSD retained the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps) link while adding RGB lighting to the case.

The P40 was launched at a much lower price point compared to the P50. In order to achieve the lower price point and make the P40 a mid-range offering the company has cut some corners while still advertising the drive as a 2GBps-class one. The review below presents a detailed evaluation of the WD_BLCK P40 Game Drive SSD and compares it against a host of other PSSDs in the same capacity class. Our analysis reveals use-cases where the P40 does make sense to use without spending much more for the premium-class P50.

Introduction

External bus-powered storage devices have grown both in storage capacity as well as speeds over the last decade. Thanks to rapid advancements in flash technology (including the advent of 3D NAND and NVMe) as well as faster host interfaces (such as Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.x) we now have palm-sized flash-based storage devices capable of delivering 3GBps+ speeds. While those speeds can be achieved with Thunderbolt mass-market devices have to rely on USB. Within the USB ecosystem USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) is fast becoming the entry level for thumb drives and portable SSDs. Premium devices sporting the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps) interface have been making it to the market over the last couple of years with host support in desktops and other computing platforms starting to pick up. Broadly speaking there are five distinct performance levels in this market:

2GBps+ drives with Thunderbolt 3 or USB4 using NVMe SSDs

2GBps drives with USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 using NVMe SSDs or direct USB flash drive (UFD) controllers

1GBps drives with USB 3.2 Gen 2 using NVMe SSDs or direct UFD controllers

500MBps drives with USB 3.2 Gen 1 (or Gen 2 in some cases) using SATA SSDs

Sub-400MBps drives with USB 3.2 Gen 1 using UFD controllers

The PSSD we are looking at today - the WD_BLACK P40 Game Drive - belongs to the second category in the above list. Western Digital's WD_BLACK lineup of products targets the gaming market with focus on performance numbers as well as industrial design / RGB lighting. The company has also been using the lineup to bring new technology to the market - such as the WD_BLACK P50 Game Drive SSD back in 2019. It was one of the first 20 Gbps PSSDs to hit the market when it was launched. This allowed the company to charge a premium for the high-performance product that continues to this day. In an attempt to expand the lineup with a mid-range offering WD launched the P40 Game Drive SSD with very similar specs (up to 2000 MBps) earlier this year at a much lower price point.

The WD_BLACK P40 Game Drive SSD retains the industrial design and appearance of its premium sibling while being slightly more compact. One of the key updates appreciated by the target market is the addition of RGB lighting (controllable via WD's dashboard software) to the case. Instead of supplying two separate cables WD is providing a single Type-C to Type-C cable with an attached Type-C to Type-A adapter.

The solid aluminum metal casing lends a rugged look to the drive and lays to rest any potential thermal concerns during operation.

CrystalDiskInfo provides a quick overview of the PSSD as seen by the host system. The P40 support S.M.A.R.T passthrough and TRIM as shown in the screenshot below. Compared to the DRAM-equipped SN750E used in the P50 WD is using a DRAM-less SN560E in the P40. The cost-savings translate to the lower price on the P40 compared to the P50.

Prior to looking at the benchmark numbers power consumption and thermal solution effectiveness a description of the testbed setup and evaluation methodology is provided.

Testbed Setup and Evaluation Methodology

Direct-attached storage devices are evaluated using the Quartz Canyon NUC (essentially the Xeon / ECC version of the Ghost Canyon NUC) configured with 2x 16GB DDR4-2667 ECC SODIMMs and a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD - the IM2P33E8 1TB from ADATA.

The most attractive aspect of the Quartz Canyon NUC is the presence of two PCIe slots (electrically x16 and x4) for add-in cards. In the absence of a discrete GPU - for which there is no need in a DAS testbed - both slots are available. In fact we also added a spare SanDisk Extreme PRO M.2 NVMe SSD to the CPU direct-attached M.2 22110 slot in the baseboard in order to avoid DMI bottlenecks when evaluating Thunderbolt 3 devices. This still allows for two add-in cards operating at x8 (x16 electrical) and x4 (x4 electrical). Since the Quartz Canyon NUC doesn't have a native USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 port Silverstone's SST-ECU06 add-in card was installed in the x4 slot. All non-Thunderbolt devices are tested using the Type-C port enabled by the SST-ECU06.

The specifications of the testbed are summarized in the table below:

The 2021 AnandTech DAS Testbed Configuration System Intel Quartz Canyon NUC9vXQNX CPU Intel Xeon E-2286M Memory ADATA Industrial AD4B3200716G22

The testbed hardware is only one segment of the evaluation. Over the last few years the typical direct-attached storage workloads for memory cards have also evolved. High bit-rate 4K videos at 60fps have become quite common and 8K videos are starting to make an appearance. Game install sizes have also grown steadily even in portable game consoles thanks to high resolution textures and artwork. Keeping these in mind our evaluation scheme for direct-attached storage devices involves multiple workloads which are described in detail in the corresponding sections.

Sequential write stress test

In the next section we have an overview of the performance of the WD_BLACK P40 Game Drive SSD in these benchmarks. Prior to providing concluding remarks we have some observations on the device's power consumption numbers and thermal solution also.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYmxvY2tzYW5kZmlsZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTgvc3RhcnR1cC14aW5ub3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xinnor is old RAID wine in a fresh new bottle – Blocks and Files,"A company called Xinnor has apparently sprung up out of nowhere with mature xiRAID software RAID technology that seemingly goes faster than the high-speed GPU-powered SupremeRAID card developed by GRAID.

Xinnor with the company itself based in Israel is actually RAIDIX reinvented. The story starts in 2009 when a software RAID developer called RAIDIX was founded in St. Petersburg Russia. It opened a second office in Stansstad Switzerland and developed its ERA software providing RAID for NVMe SSDs. In 2019 it claimed this could deliver 35GBps and 5.5 million IOPS from a server with an NVMe storage chassis achieving this with parallel IO handling fast and patented methods of erasure coding lockless datapaths and fast checksum calculation.

In the 2010–2020 decade RAIDIX partnered with Western Digital Broadcom Micron Supermicro and other suppliers and gained more than 5000 installations of its software. It had a network of channel partners in Russia and abroad including the United States South Korea the United Kingdom Brazil India Egypt and other markets.

RAIDIX and Western Digital video.

The ERA software is high speed. A RAIDIX video says its ERA software can provide RAID 5 performance with 8 x WD Ultrastar DC SN640 NVMe SSDs equivalent to RAID 10 performance with 16 NVMe SSDs and competing RAID technology such as Intel’s hybrid VROC (Virtual RAID On a Chip). This saves up to 50 percent of drive costs.

RAIDIX customer Eurotech used ERA software and WD NVMe SSDs in its DynaCOR 40-35 HPEC (High Performance Embedded Computing) networked storage system for Level 5 autonomous driving applications with an 80Gbit/s write speed.

RAIDIX was sold to Russia-based technology group Yadro in September this year. Some of the St Petersburg-based team emigrated to Israel and started up Xinnor funding it from the proceeds of the buyout and took key development engineers and architects onboard from RAIDIX.

By the terms of the purchase agreement Yadro gets the rights to RAIDIX IP in Russia and Xinnor has the rights to use the IP outside of the Russia/CIS region. The Xinnor product ERA as was is now called xiRAID. Xinnor also was able to keep all the international customers in the RAIDIX-Yadro buyout such as Elements.TV Core Micro Systems SGO DriveSys Artiza Network CheetahRAID and EchoStreams.

Now we have Xinnor promoting its xiRAID faster-than-RAID-hardware software for NVMe SSDs with several performance tests results from the RAIDIX era – for example Western Digital here and here Intel here and here.

We understand that in a couple of weeks Western Digital will publish a new paper describing the use of xiRAID to accelerate the BeeGFS based storage systems. Xinnor has been testing xiRAID against GRAID in a Western Digital lab and is planning a run against the newest PCIe 4.0 GRAID SR-1010 hardware-accelerated software RAID card versus its xiRAID 4.0 in the lab.

GRAID point of view

Thomas Paquette GRAID SVP and GM said he does “find it pretty hard to believe especially with only 10 percent CPU utilization without employing a massively powerful CPU WD did a ‘bake-off’ between Graid and s/w RAID and we came out on top. The summary of that testing can be found here.” That bakeoff was against RAIDIX ERA software RAID and used GRAID’s SupremeRAID SR-1000 PCIe 3.0 adapter.

WD test of baseline performance GRAID card + SW and software RAID

The testing was detailed – it’s worth a read – and the result concludes: “The critical issue in this solution is making RAID 5 which has always been the most desired RAID configuration (add one device to eliminate a single point of failure) sufficiently performant for use across most general storage needs. The SupremeRAID does this in an elegantly simple implementation requiring no significant changes to the environment.”

Sergey Platonov Xinnor’s VP for Product Strategy tells us that “while GRAID is indeed very fast it comes with a slot tax taking up PCIe lanes that are usually at a premium in NVMe-heavy setups.”

Special to The Desert Sun

The mystery of the desert begins with the barren land dotted with cactus mesquite and Joshua trees and scattered palm-laden oases. The area has motivated architects to go wild with innovative ideas for urban modernism. Solving the desert mystery is the objective of ""Desert Vibes"" a photography exhibition exploring the Western landscape through photography and digital art.

Delphine Bordas and Matthew Bamberg artists at the Desert Art Center in downtown Palm Springs explore the contrasting scenes of the West from the organic forms and shades of gray in Borda’s black and white prints to Bamberg’s rendition of the vivid colors and shapes of mid-century modern signage and architecture.

To put the landscape puzzle together one must consider the towering mountain ranges that prevent rain-producing clouds from entering the inland portions of the West creating an endless array of thorny cacti and tiny-leafed brush rising from the sandy terrain under the blistering sun.

Bordas’ outdoor desert playland of light and texture encapsulates the mysteries of nature’s beauty and spirituality in an arid land. She is not into capturing reality as the focus of the black-and-white prints created for the exhibition depict the desert’s serenity and warm spirit of cacti mesquite and sage. Her life-affirming art unravels the desert’s hot dry environment and converts it to an experiment of light and shadow.

The West’s development mystery can be seen in Bamberg’s digitized photography that evokes mystique of humans’ enthrallment with the modernism that came after the machines of the industrial age streamlined building processes and designs. The last century’s technology advances necessitated a call for architects and artists to update technological and aesthetic elements to match the movement of people in mass-produced vehicles — planes trains and automobiles.

The West responded with partially replacing Spanish architecture with minimalist modern design so that new materials could be used for protection from the West’s hot temperatures. Along came rooftops extending beyond the steel concrete and glass to direct cooling shadows and to frame mountain views. Streets and highways were built with themed neon signage that have played the role of highway flypaper to captivate travelers and encourage them to stop to shop eat and sleep.

For many years Bordas’ interest in the natural desert stems from the varied forms of plant life to produce compelling images highlighting bulging trunks of vegetation that serve as water storage units among twisted branches of thorns in a near-rainless land. Both photographers use optimal light that enhances shape and form of objects depicted.

Since 2000 Bamberg has processed images of signage and original building designs in order to isolate them as art. His computer-driven images are freed from the background clutter in order to emphasize their bright eye-candied colors and unique geometric shapes. Adding the creative architectural edge to highways and surface streets served up a picture-perfect environment to create the Disneyesque Tomorrowland edifices featured in Bamberg’s digital photography. The mystery of design in his images shows how new technology (neon) motivated businesses to erect eye-popping car-stopping structures into the barren dusty outdoor space. Googie-style buildings serviced the new culture of mobility: themed motels gas stations roadside cafes convenience stores and drive-in restaurants.

Bamberg’s photography transports viewers back in time to a campy universe of urban color that once was. With the intent to preserve history for future generations many of the structures he has captured have been exposed to the wrecking ball and no longer exist and/or the perils of redesign.

The solved mysteries are on display at the photography and digital art expo this weekend at the Desert Art Center.

Benchmarks such as ATTO and CrystalDiskMark help provide a quick look at the performance of the direct-attached storage device. The results translate to the instantaneous performance numbers that consumers can expect for specific workloads but do not account for changes in behavior when the unit is subject to long-term conditioning and/or thermal throttling. Yet another use of these synthetic benchmarks is the ability to gather information regarding support for specific storage device features that affect performance.

Western Digital claims read and write speeds of 2000 MBps but these are not backed up by any of our usual synthetic benchmarks. As we shall see further down in this review the P40 can sustain the advertised numbers only over a very small data size. One can run ATTO with a 256MB file size and CrystalDiskMark with a 1GB span and back up WD's numbers but those are not the sizes we use for evaluation.

ATTO benchmarking is restricted to a single configuration in terms of queue depth and is only representative of a small sub-set of real-world workloads. It does allow the visualization of change in transfer rates as the I/O size changes. For a 32GB file size optimal write performance is reached for an I/O size of 128KB. Reads are ot affected much reaching very close to advertised numbers at 512KB and sustaining it beyond that for a queue depth of 4. It is a matter of concern that none of the other 20 Gbps-class PSSDs have a problem with the ATTO file size used in our evaluation.

CrystalDiskMark uses four different access traces for reads and writes over a configurable region size. Two of the traces are sequential accesses while two are 4K random accesses. Internally CrystalDiskMark uses the Microsoft DiskSpd storage testing tool. The 'Seq128K Q32T1' sequential traces use 128K block size with a queue depth of 32 from a single thread while the '4K Q32T16' one does random 4K accesses with the same queue configuration but from multiple threads. The 'Seq1M' traces use a 1MiB block size. The plain 'Rnd4K' one uses only a single queue and single thread . Comparing the '4K Q32T16' and '4K Q1T1' numbers can quickly tell us whether the storage device supports NCQ (native command queuing) / UASP (USB-attached SCSI protocol). If the numbers for the two access traces are in the same ballpark NCQ / UASP is not supported. This assumes that the host port / drivers on the PC support UASP.

The P40 can only average around 1250 MBps writes over a 32GB span. Every other PSSD in its class can sustain 1800 MBps+ for similar sequential accesses. The reads and high-queue depth random accesses are a bit of a saving grace for the P40 when compared to other PSSDs. Low queue-depth performance suffers due to the lack of on-board DRAM."

John Davis the former CEO is seeking at least $300 million in a new lawsuit filed in federal court in the Northern District of Texas to compensate for lost career opportunities and reputational damage.

Inga Dow who owns Keller Williams offices in Fort Worth and Johnson County sued Davis Keller Williams and executive chairman Gary Keller in federal court last November alleging decades of sexual abuse and harassment by Davis that the company failed to take action against. She also included a D-FW operating company and regional owners as defendants.

In the new lawsuit Davis claims Dow falsely accused him of sexual assault to force the sale of her businesses for more than they were worth after she had tried unsuccessfully to sell them.

Davis’ lawsuit followed U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman’s decision Sept. 2 to send Dow’s claims against Keller Williams and Gary Keller to arbitration. He suspended the case against Davis and the other defendants until the arbitration is complete.

Pittman wrote in an opinion in September that Davis and the other defendants are not subject to arbitration because they are not parties in Dow’s license agreements with Keller Williams.

“This decision puts Davis in a terrible position because it allows Dow’s false and malicious claims against Davis to remain unresolved possibly in perpetuity and further harm his reputation and ability to earn a living commensurate with his previous position” said Paul Omodt of Omodt & Associates Critical Communications LLC on behalf of Davis. He said Davis is not talking to the media.

Omodt said the end of Davis’ nondisparagement and noncompete clauses with Keller Williams allowed him to file suit and prove Dow’s allegations are false.

“Now it’s our time; we can legally tell our story” Omodt said.

Davis’ suit states that he met Dow around July 1996 before he joined Keller Williams and that they dated from 1998 to 2004. This isn’t the first time Dow has made false claims according to Davis’ lawsuit. It states that in 1998 Dow made false allegations about their relationship to his aunt that she admitted were fabricated months later. Attempts to reach Dow and her attorneys were unsuccessful.

“Dow’s allegations in the federal lawsuit would have one believe that Dow’s sexual encounters with Davis were involuntary nonconsensual isolated or few and far between” the lawsuit says. “This could not be further from the truth.”

Davis’ lawsuit also claims that Keller Williams did not disclose Dow’s allegations to Davis while he was negotiating the sale of his own businesses to the company in 2020. The company rejected a deal for him to sell them to another Keller Williams operator for about $46 million and he sold to Gary Keller for tens of millions of dollars less according to Davis’ suit.

The lawsuit claims Keller Williams rejected the first deal because of Dow’s allegations.

Keller Williams spokesman Darryl Frost said: “Mr. Davis’ attempt to involve Keller Williams in his quest to clear his name is unfortunate. As this is ongoing litigation we do not intend to comment any further at this time.”

The lawsuit blames a business strategy implemented by Gary Keller as the reason Dow was unable to sell her businesses. At the end of 2017 Keller decided to reduce market center caps — the fees that agents pay to their Keller Williams office that are used to support agents and pay bills — and Davis tried to push back on this because he believed it would hurt independent operators according to the suit.

Dow incorporated Keller’s management strategy of reducing market center caps causing her locations to suffer financially according to Davis’ lawsuit. Dow tried to sell her market centers shortly after that but because of the decrease in cash flow her businesses were not worth the price she was asking the lawsuit states.

“It is at this point that her desperation caused her to cross a clear moral and legal line to extort Davis Keller Williams Keller and others associated with Keller Williams that Dow holds animus towards” the lawsuit states.

According to the lawsuit Davis resigned in January 2019 because he disagreed with this strategy making him the first and only CEO under Keller to resign and completely separate himself from the company.

Keller did not take the resignation lightly according to the lawsuit. Josh Team former president of Keller Williams was also named in Davis’ suit. According to the lawsuit Team was Gary Keller’s right-hand man and interviewed individuals following Davis’ resignation demoting or terminating those who held Davis in a positive light and promoting those who spoke ill of him. Team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit says that the company Keller and Team “furthered Dow’s malicious scheme when they engaged in a continual smear campaign to muddy Davis’s reputation in the real estate industry including falsely insinuating to agents and others that Davis was fired for sexual harassment or misconduct and silencing anyone associated with Keller Williams who held Davis in high regard.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL2hlYWx0aC53dXNmLnVzZi5lZHUvbnByLWhlYWx0aC9ucHItaGVhbHRoLzIwMjItMTEtMTgvaGUtc3RhcnRlZC1wcm90ZXN0aW5nLWFib3V0LWhpcy1taWRkbGUtc2Nob29sLXByaW5jaXBhbC1ub3ctaGVzLXRha2luZy1vbi1iaWctb2ls0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,He started protesting about his middle school principal. Now he's taking on Big Oil,"The first time Nigerian environmental lawyer Chima Williams took on the establishment he was 12 years old.

The principal at his middle school had been showing up late staggering and drunk he says and so he and his fellow students made a protest at their school in southern Nigeria. They were dancing and chanting slogans calling for the principal to go. Then the police arrived and took the scrawny teen to jail – where he raised a ruckus.

A police officer asked ""Who is making the noise there"" Williams recalls with a laugh. ""I was so tiny."" The police didn't end up booking him and the principal was transferred to another school.

The lesson he learned he says is that ""there is power in what you believe and how you go about it uncompromisingly.""

Now 53 Williams has gained fame by going up against a much bigger player than his principal. Working on behalf of a group of Nigerian farmers he sued Shell one of the world's biggest oil companies.

A chief's son reports an oil spill

It started in 2004. Williams was sitting in his Nigerian law office a two-story building with a mango tree out front when an old friend brought him a new potential client. Eric Dooh was the son of a chief from a small community called Goi. Williams had never heard of it.

/ Austin Ekeinde/Reuters / Austin Ekeinde/Reuters Oil from a leaking pipeline burns in Goi a village in the Niger Delta in Nigeria. The spill came from Shell Nigeria's pipeline and the ensuing fires burned through Goi and its mangroves. A local farmer came to attorney Chima Williams and asked: ""Can you do this case for me?""

Goi is in the Niger Delta where oil pipelines crisscross through mangroves and creeks and communities live alongside fossil fuel infrastructure – some dating to the 1960s.

Dooh told Williams about an oil spill in his community from a pipeline belonging to a Nigerian subsidiary of Shell. In October 2004 the pipeline broke sending oil into Goi's waterways where it eventually caught fire burning through the village and its mangroves. Dooh's family bakery fishery and farm were destroyed. ""I asked Chima 'Can you do this case for me?' And Chima said that he is going to study the matter"" Dooh says.

The people of Goi said Shell's aging pipelines caused the spill. ""Their pipes were over-aged"" says Dooh. But Williams worried that even if he could prove that Shell Nigeria was responsible he feared a legal judgment in Nigerian court wouldn't be enough to get Shell Nigeria and other energy companies to implement new safety and environmental measures. ""It became a question of enforceability"" he says.

Shell told NPR it could not comment on the Goi case but in a statement earlier this year Shell's Nigerian subsidiary said the oil spill in Goi was ""the result of sabotage.""

Left to right: Chief Fidelis A. Oguru-Oruma and Eric Dooh sitting in the law courts in The Hague where the trial was held.

A new strategy to take on Shell

Williams wanted to target Shell – the international energy company with the biggest presence in Nigeria – for a reason ""Our belief is that if we can get Shell to do things right then the smaller companies will equally behave well.""

That's when William and his colleagues had an idea. At a meeting in South Africa they agreed to try ""taking the battle to [oil companies] in their own home countries"" he says. Instead of suing Shell in Nigerian courts they would file a lawsuit in the Hague Netherlands where the energy company was then based. Williams hoped a win in Dutch court would have ripple effects across the Nigerian energy industry.

Williams and his legal team traveled through the Niger Delta by car and by boat through the creeks to build their case. They went to Goi and other communities affected by spills on Shell Nigeria's pipelines to learns how the oil pollution affected the health of locals and their livelihoods.

And the verdict ...

In 2008 Williams' Nigerian plaintiffs and Friends of the Earth Netherlands officially began their lawsuit in the Netherlands. More than a decade later after an initial loss and an appeal they finally got their verdict. On Jan. 29 2021 the Court of Appeal in the Hague ruled that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary had to pay compensation for the pipeline spills in Goi and Oruma. The court further ruled that both Shell and its subsidiary must install a leak detection system to prevent further spills.

And earlier this year Williams got more good news. He was named one of this year's seven Goldman Environmental Prize winners for his work on the oil spill litigation. ""That this legal campaign took over 13 years and continued through major obstacles and setbacks is a testament to Chima's commitment to the Niger Delta and the people who live there"" says Ilan Kayatsky the prize's communication director.

Left to right: Farmers Friday Alfred Akpan-Ikot Ada Udo and Eric Dooh; Nini Okey Uche of the Nigerian Embassy; lawyer Chima Williams and farmers Chief Fidelis A. Oguru-Oruma and Alali Efanga.

Williams says he's already seen a positive impact of the Hague ruling in Nigeria. He says the win is encouraging more communities to pursue litigation against oil companies – because the problem of oil spills hasn't gone away.

Oil spills continue

A joint investigation by the Nigerian government and Shell's Nigerian subsidiary found there was an oil spill in early August in the Niger Delta community of Bodo about 5 miles from Goi.

On Sept. 1 fisherman Behbari Nyiedeh gave NPR a live tour via Whatsapp video.

Amid cassava plants half-covered in mud Nyiedeh showed NPR what looked like an overflowing water fountain – but with oil. ""You can see the crude oil everywhere on our land"" Nyiedeh says ""It has a very shocking smell. It shocks you.""

What happened? According to the investigative report the spill was ""due to equipment failure."" There was a hole in Shell Nigeria's pipeline and the cause was ""operational.""

Nyiedeh says the oil NPR saw on Whatsapp was in the same area cited in the investigative report; as of November he says it still hasn't been cleaned up. Shell tells NPR that the planned clean-up date is in late December. In an emailed statement Shell maintains that ""the vast majority of oil spills in the Niger Delta are caused by crude oil theft or the sabotage of pipelines"" and that ""irrespective of who or what caused spills from our facilities or pipelines we clean up and remediate affected areas.""

Williams says the continued oil spills worry him especially because of what's currently happening in Nigeria's oil sector. Many major international energy companies operating in the country are selling or want to sell many of their onshore oil assets in Nigeria. A lot of these sales would transfer ownership of pipelines and wells to smaller Nigerian companies which concerns Williams. ""[These] entities do not have the capacity to maintain the facilities and structures that these divesting multinational companies are bequeathing to them.""

Worries about a pivot to gas

Williams is also concerned about Nigeria's push for new gas infrastructure including a multibillion dollar expansion of Nigeria's main liquified gas export company NLNG and plans for an overland gas pipeline to Morocco. Nigeria is looking to up its gas exports to Europe which has cut off Russian gas supplies because of the war in Ukraine ""It's only natural ... to cater to Europe's need for gas"" says Yusuf Tuggar the Nigerian ambassador to Germany ""But beyond that we also want to utilize our own gas for our own industrial development.""

Nigerian gas proponents say gas pipelines aren't as easy to vandalize as oil pipelines but there still are break-ins. ""We witnessed about 14 incidents [last year]"" said Leye Falade NLNG's general manager in a webinar for a Nigerian gas industry group ""14 times that we have to shut down the pipeline and fix it because people went into that pipeline."" That's compared to what he says is the norm of 1 or 2 break-ins a year.

And Williams says there's still gas flaring in Nigeria. That's the practice of burning off excess gas which is dangerous to the health and safety of local communities and releases methane a potent planet-heating gas. ""It is that gas flaring that makes Nigeria the biggest source of [methane] emissions in Africa"" Williams says.

In recent months Nigeria has faced its worst flooding in a decade with 600 people dead and more than a million displaced. In some parts of the country homes are still submerged. The Nigerian government attributes the flooding in part to climate change.

World leaders and country representatives are now gathering at the United Nations international climate conference COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh Egypt. Williams is currently attending the so-called ""African COP.""

He says he hopes the conference will give Africans true agency to shape the discussion around the intersection of fossil fuels and climate change. And if not? ""Then it should not be called an 'African COP' it should be called 'a Western COP held in Africa'! It's as simple as ABC.""

To stay on top of HCM matters compensation committees are increasingly broadening their scope to address:

Building and sustaining an inclusive and diverse workforce.

Focusing on leadership succession preparing for transitions beyond just top-level executives.

Executing business strategy by acquiring and keeping key talent.

Strengthening workforce engagement and productivity.

Establishing a strong and healthy corporate culture.

Recent world events — including the COVID-19 pandemic investor focus on environmental social and governance issues (ESG) and the great resignation — have intensified the demands and responsibilities of boards and committees leading more compensation committees to add or take on even greater HCM roles.

WTW research on S&P 500 companies corroborate these anecdotal observations and provide further insights into HCM developments at the board and committee level since we first reviewed this issue in 2019.

In 2022 we can confirm the continuing changes both in name and responsibility of traditional board compensation committees. These changes reflect the current ESG climate with an HCM focus both in and out of the boardroom. The most recent study of S&P 500 companies’ charters and committee names conducted by WTW’s Global Executive Compensation Analysis Team revealed some noteworthy results.

Within S&P 500 compensation committee names:

Nearly 50% of the S&P 500 (242 companies) now refer to the committee responsible for executive compensation oversight as something beyond just the compensation committee. This is a 10-percentage-point increase from our 2019 study findings.

Companies are changing compensation committee names to reflect broader responsibilities at a faster clip. Fifty-four companies changed the name of their compensation committee to reflect broader duties compared to the 45 changes over the previous decade observed during our 2019 review.

Of the 54 companies that changed the name of their compensation committee between 2022 and 2021 44% (24 companies) added “human capital.”

Within S&P 100 compensation committee charter reviews:

Only seven committees’ charters do not name any HCM oversight responsibilities.

Over 75% of the companies require committees to maintain oversight of broad-based compensation programs and benefits.

In addition to overseeing broad-based compensation nearly half (44%) of companies are responsible for broad-based recruitment promotion retention and turnover. 62% of companies have given the committee diversity and inclusion program oversight.

Increasingly compensation committee oversight includes not only establishing and managing executive compensation matters but also instituting and maintaining global HCM concerns. Figure 1 provides a breakdown of the common compensation committee name variants used by S&P 500 companies.

Figure 1. Common name variants for S&P 500 compensation committees

Notes: Statistics are based on 242 S&P 500 companies with committee names other than “compensation committee” or “executive compensation committee.” Some boards do not have distinct compensation and governance committees. These boards typically combine compensation with governance/nominating making “governance/nominating” a common name variant.

To determine whether these broader oversight responsibilities went beyond just committee names WTW reviewed the current compensation committee charters of the 100 largest S&P 500 companies. Comparing 2019 with 2022 WTW found an increase in every topic we categorized in the first study as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Additional duties and responsibilities conducted by S&P 100 compensation committees

Note: Statistics are based on a review of committee charters among the largest 100 S&P 500 companies as determined by revenue.

The Role of the Compensation Committee in Human Capital Governance

News-making events over the past four years have raised awareness of disparities across race/ethnicity gender class and other important social markers leading companies to step up their efforts to combat these inequalities.

WTW analysis found that inclusion and diversity (I&D) remains topical; there was a 29-percentage-point increase (62% in 2022 vs. 33% in 2019) increase between 2019 and 2022 in compensation committees adding “inclusion and diversity” to their list of responsibilities.

Committees are not only reviewing programs and practices related to workforce I&D but also ensuring the equitable administration of compensation programs. Currently 76% of companies include oversight of broad-based compensation and benefit programs compared with 58% in 2019.

Another growing area of responsibility among compensation committees is “culture employee relations and engagement” (Figure 2). There was a 26% jump between 2019 and 2022 in compensation committees adding these responsibilities attesting to the growing need to address changes in a post-pandemic workforce.

The sharp rise in employees working remotely may be COVID-19's most evident effect within the executive suite as well as among broad-based employees leading to key questions like:

How do we maintain the company’s culture or is there a need to modify it?

Without day-to-day in-person interaction how do we keep employees engaged?

What’s the best way to create manage and maintain a positive connection between management and the workforce?

More HCM-Related Issues

Compensation committees continue to oversee traditional matters of executive succession and evaluation of risk from compensation programs. But I&D and culture employee relations and engagement matters have made their way into committees’ expanded scope of responsibilities. In WTW’s review we noted new and more focused areas are being added to the committees’ oversight (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Emerging HCM duties and responsibilities conducted by S&P 100 compensation committees

Note: Statistics are based on a review of committee charters among the largest 100 S&P 500 companies as determined by revenue.





Although compensation committees’ incorporation of these matters is still relatively low advocacy and questions from investors employees customers and regulators may be contributing factors that lead more compensation committees to include them.

Expanding outside HCM specifically and looking at ESG responsibilities more broadly our 2022 review found that 14% of S&P 500 governance committee names included some aspect of ESG issues relating to corporate social responsibility sustainability and the environment. In addition 90 companies established at least one or more additional committees beyond the standard audit compensation and governance committees to tackle the same ESG concerns.

Companies are realizing that their people are the best asset and are the key to attaining goals as they work to positively influence society create value and improve long-term business performance.

As pressure from a variety of stakeholders continues to center on ESG issues the functions and responsibilities of the board and its committees are deepening to include more aspects of human capital considerations.

Key takeaways Greater scope of responsibilities. Compensation committees are expanding their role in human capital management matters including building and sustaining an inclusive diverse workforce and strengthening engagement and productivity.

While fears of a recession continue to loom large many insurers see crime as a stabilizing force in an otherwise uncertain insurance market. The fact is that recent rate increases were largely the result of losses suffered over the broader professional liability portfolios of our insurance partners not a material spike in crime losses. At no point over the past two years was the crime market in need of a “correction.” Rather the rate increases impacting the crime space were driven by an overall rate “need” in the professional liability space and crime was there to help support this initiative. For those crime insurer’s that had a separate division not tied to the professional liability market underwriters took the opportunity to increase rates that had not been changed in over a decade. We believe that this is now behind us as underwriters are now more focused on shoring up this profitable line of business. However first we will look back at how we got where we are today.

The “impact” of COVID-19 and work-from-home

In early 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic not only changed how people worked but also stoked fears that the changes would increase the number and/or severity of crime losses the mindset was that there would be less supervision allowing employees to steal and less focus by employees on internal controls that would allow third parties to steal. With the benefit of hindsight we know that these fears did not become a reality. In fact total crime losses remained consistent over the last couple of years despite the changes caused by the pandemic. However the mix of losses impacting crime insurers did change.

The old (employee theft) and the new-ish (SEF)

Internal fraud (i.e. employee dishonesty) continues to drive the largest losses for insureds. These schemes often go on for years before ultimately being discovered leading to the losses’ severity. Social engineering fraud (SEF) schemes on the other hand continue to cause trouble and were the most frequent loss schemes impacting our commercial clients in 2022. However SEF losses continue to be less severe with median losses of $172000. Computer crime can also result in severe losses but SEF and old means of stealing such as robbery and forgery are relatively low severity but have an impact in terms of frequency of losses.

Social engineering

While insurers continue to tread lightly with respect to social engineering limits generally offering SEF limits at a fraction of the crime policy standard coverage limits we believe the market is beginning to turn the corner here as well. As 2022 concludes we are seeing markets slowly beginning to offer increases in SEF sub-limits especially in the FI space. Markets are expected to continue to home in on and require additional underwriting information about how clients manage their payment functions. Yet unlike in years past where securing additional limits for SEF was limited to pushing small incremental increases up the insurance tower some carriers are now offering more meaningful limits starting in the primary layer. Still SEF limits continue to be provided well below the policy limits for most clients apart from those with significant deductibles (i.e. in the millions). This makes sense when viewed through the lens of a claims examiner. From a frequency perspective social engineering losses are at the top of the list. However with a median loss of $172000 losses impacting the crime underwriters are death by a thousand cuts. Most criminals understand that requesting a transfer of $100000s or more will generally set off alarm bells. However smaller amounts may continue to go undetected up and until a larger amount is breached.

The only constant is change

We have seen changes in the crime space this past year. Fewer markets now offer Destruction of Data by Hacker or Virus in their crime policies. While this had been a standard coverage in computer crime for over 30 years the adoption of this coverage by the cyber market has allowed most Crime markets to drop the coverage and focus only on theft and fraud related exposures.

Many carriers have also added endorsements to “clarify” that computer crime coverage does not apply to social engineering losses. This is nothing new. Crime policies often contain “funneling” exclusions to ensure that losses are constrained to certain coverage sections.

Another change we have seen in 2022 is that cryptocurrency exclusions have become more prevalent. While most policies crime forms define money to mean currency adopted by a domestic or foreign government many crime insurers have gone the extra step to add cryptocurrency exclusions to their form leaving no doubt about the absence of coverage under their policy. The same is also happening with respect to non-fungible tokens or NFTs. A major challenge in 2023 will be securing meaningful limits for client’s that invest in or hold cryptocurrency (and other digital assets) on behalf of clients. While there is some capacity in the London market overall markets have been slow to offer meaningful coverage for these digital assets.

Looking ahead to 2023

We expect the softening of the crime market to continue into 2023. The numbers continue to support the fact that crime insurance is not only profitable but for many insurers that include fidelity in the professional or FI books a means of bolstering their bottom lines. We would expect to see continued pressure on pricing especially on excess layers due to increased competition in the marketplace. Yet we do not expect rate decreases on primary layers just yet. Rather we would expect pricing to go back to being based on rateables and risk factors as opposed to being driven by a market “needs.” This is good news for our clients as rates should become more stable and we should begin to see many more flat renewals than we have seen in the past two years.

Nearly half of employees (48%) say their wellbeing declined in 2022 and 28% say they are miserable at work according to a survey of 9000 employees globally from Gympass an employee wellbeing platform. Not only that but in the U.S. nearly half (48%) of Americans aren’t satisfied with their wellbeing at work and over 25% are “completely unhappy” in their jobs. The report also points to recent Gallup data that finds that employee stress is at an all-time high and 60% of employees are emotionally detached at work.

The information is the latest to paint a dire picture of employees’ wellbeing. Largely speaking stress anxiety depression burnout and other conditions have soared over the last couple of years as uncertain event after uncertain event—from the ongoing pandemic to political turmoil—has resulted in a nosedive in how employees are feeling. On top of that soaring inflation and fears of a recession have also taken their toll on employees with financial stress skyrocketing.

The research is a call to action for employers and HR leaders in particular tasked with making strides in employee wellbeing. Organizations says Cesar Carvalho Gympass founder and CEO have a “responsibility to confront this crisis head-on to support our employees through better habits—be it fitness healthy eating meditation mental health or hundreds of other activities.”

“There’s an altruistic element to supporting our employees in this way but it also has a positive impact on our bottom lines when our employees are happier healthier and more engaged” he says. Employee stress experts contend impacts job performance affecting productivity absenteeism and more making it imperative for employers to act.

Although handfuls of employers have made strides in mental health and other wellbeing efforts prioritizing efforts and enhancing benefits in the last couple of years as the pandemic took a dramatic toll on employees’ emotional health the startling data indicates there is more work to be done. Some ideas from the report? Employee wellness best practices include helping employees prioritize their mental and physical health like local gym memberships or meditation classes as well as incentivizing employees to take breaks recharge and find time during the day to move.

Other recent research predicts that increased commitments will be coming to employee wellbeing in the next few years. For instance two out of three U.S. employers say they plan to make employee mental health and the emotional wellbeing programs and solutions that support it one of their top three health priorities over the next three years according to a survey of 455 U.S. employers from Willis Towers Watson.

“COVID-19 took a terrible toll on employees’ lives including substantially worsening mental health” Erin Terkoski Young senior director for WTW’s Health Equity & Wellbeing practice recently said. “And even as the pandemic takes a different shift mental health challenges continue to persist.”

Although HR and company leaders increasingly say investments in employee wellbeing are the right thing to do the decision to do so is often about more than that. There are hard numbers to justify employers’ efforts: The vast majority of employees (77%) say they would consider leaving a company that doesn’t focus on wellbeing the Gympass survey finds.

Meanwhile 83% of employees believe their wellbeing is just as important as their salary and 85% of employees are more likely to stay in their role if their employer focuses more on wellbeing.

Any racing fans out there have $1 million to spare? Wynn Las Vegas wants to make you a deal.

Ahead of next year’s Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix the hotel is advertising a “personally curated all-access” race weekend experience for the high high price of $1 million.

Included in the package are daily rides to and from the race as well as airport transportation; spa treatments; caviar; four nights in a three-bedroom duplex; luxury seating at a show; VIP passes for a variety of race-related events; and much much more.

The “all-access experience” is designed for six people to enjoy meaning that it averages out to about $167000 per head.

“This one-in-a-lifetime opportunity will really get your heart racing” Wynn’s advertisement says.

The pricey package may sound extreme but it’s well-matched with a racing event that’s expected to be one of the most expensive of the year. Price of admission starts at $500 which gets you a three-day general admission pass according to The Associated Press.

“We are going to deliver the greatest spectacle in the world as a statement of F1. That needs to be recognized and in terms of price positioning we are going to be on the top side because this is Las Vegas and that is the nature of the customer coming to Las Vegas” said Stefano Domenicali the CEO of Formula One to the AP.

Race organizers and sponsors are also trying to recoup the high costs of bringing a Formula One event to Las Vegas.

“For us as a company this will be the largest race in terms of revenues. It will also be the most expensive race in terms of costs” said Greg Maffei CEO of Liberty Media which owns Formula One to the AP.

Wynn Las Vegas is a founding partner of the race and so are MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Like Wynn the latter two companies plan to offer lavish race weekend packages for wealthy racing fans Front Office Sports reported.

“MGM CEO Bill Hornbuckle has said that the company will purchase between $20 million and $25 million in F1 tickets to offer in packages including some that cost upwards of $100000” the article said. “Caesars packages for race tickets food and a three-night stay average $2600 per night.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rtb3JuaW5nYW1lcmljYS5jb20vdHJhdmVsL3ZpZGVvL21pbmQtYmxvd2luZy1sYXMtdmVnYXMtc2hvdy1hd2FrZW5pbmctOTM0Njg4NDfSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29kbW9ybmluZ2FtZXJpY2EuY29tL2FtcC90cmF2ZWwvdmlkZW8vbWluZC1ibG93aW5nLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1zaG93LWF3YWtlbmluZy05MzQ2ODg0Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A look at the new mind-blowing Las Vegas show ‘Awakening’,"A look at the new mind-blowing Las Vegas show ‘Awakening’

XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbm5lc290YS5lZHUvbmV3cy9tLXN0YXRlLXBhcnRuZXJzLWVuZXJneS1jYXJlZXJzLWFjYWRlbXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M State partners on Energy Careers Academy,"Minnesota State Community and Technical College Xcel Energy and the Minnesota State Energy Center of Excellence are working together to engage students with more diverse backgrounds in energy-related fields of study.

Electrical linework students in the new Energy Careers Academy set their first poles at the Riverside Training Center in North Minneapolis. in the fall of 2022.

The Energy Careers Academy launched earlier this fall arose in response to a need from energy companies to attract new people to the industry and address a pending labor shortage. A 2020 report to the state Legislature showed that only about 10% of the industry’s labor force is classified as ethnically diverse and recommended the creation of new inclusive training programs as one way to increase engagement and representation.

The Energy Careers Academy now offers one such training program in electrical linework and plans are developing to offer a new gas utility construction and service program.

The programs are designed to be accessible to an urban student population removing a potential geographical barrier: Energy-related educational programs are often offered at technical schools in rural communities; enrollment in the academy is targeted to students who live within the seven-county Twin Cities metro area.

Students at the academy receive hands-on instruction at Xcel Energy’s metro-area training facilities.

“We’re proud to be a partner in this effort to bring more opportunity to historically underserved student populations and to bring them into a career field that offers stable high-paying jobs to workers” said M State President Carrie Brimhall. “The goals of the Energy Careers Academy align with our mission at M State – to specialize in affordable and exceptional education service and workforce training. We welcome all students and engage them in shaping their futures and their communities.”

M State provides the course curriculum accreditation and instructors for the academy programs as well as student support and career prep services. Xcel Energy provides the training facilities equipment and other soft skills training in addition to exposure to current Xcel Energy employees and leaders who hire for the positions the students are working toward. The Minnesota State Energy Center of Excellence is a key coordinator providing general oversight and input to ensure the academy operates smoothly.

This is the first time the three entities have worked together on an academy of this sort. The hope is to expand the academy’s offerings in the future to include longer-running higher-credit diploma programs.

“Being able to launch this program is the culmination of seven years of planning and implementation of phases of the programs” said Bruce Peterson Project Manager with the Minnesota State Energy Center of Excellence. “Bringing these educational opportunities closer to where our targeted populations live is a huge key to our long-term goals. It is incredibly gratifying to observe the students as they develop their skills and prepare to enter these technical fields.”

Peterson said the Center of Excellence had initial conversations about the creation of an Energy Careers Academy with Xcel Energy in the summer of 2021. As the only college within the greater Minnesota State system to offer programs in both electrical linework and gas utility M State was asked to join in as a collaborator.

The implementation of the Legacy professional development program for students is another key element of the Energy Careers Academy. Through the Legacy program students participate in core skills training and develop professional skills for the workplace.



“The Energy Careers Academy will help train and support the next generation of clean energy workers and leaders at Xcel Energy and across Minnesota” said Chris Clark President Xcel Energy-Minnesota. “Developing and retaining a diverse workforce is important to us and we’re pleased that this program will remove barriers and provide access for more individuals interested in electrical linework and gas utility work.”

The electrical lineworker program began in late August and has about a dozen students enrolled. The gas utility program is currently being developed and is expected to roll out in 2023.

M State serves more than 6500 students in credit courses each year in more than 70 career and liberal arts programs online and at its campuses in Detroit Lakes Fergus Falls Moorhead and Wadena. By partnering with communities the college also provides workforce development services and other responsive training programs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vZW5lcmd5YW5kcG9saWN5Lm9yZy94Y2VsLWNhcmJvbi1mcmVlLWZ1dHVyZS1tbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel Energy is recruiting Minnesota cities to thwart governor's clean energy agenda,"Xcel Energy is recruiting Minnesota cities to lobby against emissions reduction goals included in Governor Tim Walz’s climate agenda but its campaign is off to a sputtering start after staff in several municipalities questioned the legitimacy of the effort and wondered whether it would undercut their own climate goals.

Xcel began approaching cities to join its Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition and lobby state officials earlier this year. At the same time Chris Clark president of Xcel’s Minnesota operations participated in a stakeholder process to help shape Walz’s climate objectives. Clark was involved in discussions on the Climate Action Framework which set a goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 – a decade ahead of Xcel’s corporate goal and in closer alignment with the swift action scientists say is needed to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change.

As part of Walz’s advisory council on climate change Clark participated in state-led discussions on carbon-free electricity goals at least as far back as November 2020. By early 2022 his company had quietly debuted the Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition with a website and a video praising its plan to hit 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. Emails obtained by the Energy and Policy Institute via public records requests show Xcel began approaching public agencies to join the group soon after the Walz administration published a draft climate plan that solidified its commitment to carbon-free electricity by 2040.

With Minnesota falling short of its climate goals state leaders have doubled down on achieving 100% carbon-free electricity. The final draft of the Climate Action Framework released in September 2022 lists the 2040 benchmark as “an ongoing priority for the Walz-Flanagan administration.” State Rep. Jamie Long who chairs the House Climate and Energy Finance and Policy committee had previously pushed to codify the 2040 clean electricity standard in state law.

Minnesota is in its strongest position in nearly a decade to pass climate and clean energy legislation after Walz won another term and his Democratic-Farmer-Labor party sealed majorities in the state House and Senate earlier this month. Legislation requiring 100% clean electricity by 2040 remains a top priority. Asked by EPI whether it would oppose such a bill Xcel did not directly answer. A company spokesperson said the utility plans to work with Walz and other policymakers to “align our energy leadership with the polices (sic) of the states and communities we serve.”

But Xcel appears eager to stall a faster transition to carbon-free electricity emails obtained by EPI show. In one instance in June Xcel pitched its Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition at a gathering of Twin Cities mayors. The utility has also appeared at City Council meetings and met privately with public officials and civic groups. Xcel’s lobbying strategy however has met resistance at the local level. With ambitious climate plans of their own many city officials have balked at the utility’s invitation.

A staffer in one Twin Cities suburb questioned whether Xcel created the coalition to subvert the Walz administration’s 2040 carbon-free electricity goal emails show. In another a staffer said in an email that the group seemed more like a way to provide Xcel political cover than a benefit to their city. In an October memo to the City Council in the suburb of Hopkins staff there noted that “many cities have chosen not to support the program as it does not align with their local climate goals.”

Emails to various public officials also show Xcel expected to reach a “critical mass” of 50 coalition members by late summer at which point it planned to list them on the Carbon-Free Future MN website and step up its campaign. That unveiling still has yet to happen.

EPI sent a series of specific questions to Xcel about its Carbon-Free Future MN coalition. Xcel responded with a 450-word comment which largely did not answer them. The questions and Xcel’s statement are published in full at the bottom of this article.

Coalition promotes fossil gas despite net zero pledge

A promotional video linked on the Carbon-Free Future MN website features gas stoves which emit greenhouse gasses and cancer-causing pollutants. The website also contends there’s a need for high-emission fossil gas plants a theory contested in recent Xcel regulatory proceedings.

A staffer in a third Twin Cities suburb said in an email that one of their colleagues had received a Carbon-Free Future MN flyer at a Chamber of Commerce meeting over the summer. The staffer suggested that the coalition would align with an Xcel public relations campaign to continue investing in fossil gas plants.

In a fourth suburb emails show a staffer felt that the coalition’s website indicated the group was formed to oppose efforts to accelerate Xcel’s 2050 carbon-free electricity goal – not to simply support the utility’s planned transition.

The Carbon-Free Future MN website takes specific aim at “some interest groups” that “are urging Minnesota legislators and regulators to mandate the elimination of carbon emissions as soon as 2030.” Clean energy and environmental justice advocates pushing for accelerated emissions reductions have frequently questioned Xcel’s ongoing investment in fossil gas.

The coalition’s website claims that speeding up the transition to carbon-free electricity wouldn’t “meet the needs of most Minnesotans who expect our system of universal access to safe reliable and affordable electricity to continue.” The messaging draws from an increasingly familiar playbook used by utilities to justify investment in fossil gas despite the major disruptions it’s caused in recent years.

Fossil gas price volatility has sent customers’ bills skyward – a trend expected to worsen this winter. In addition Xcel customers are already shouldering millions of dollars in extra charges after the utility bungled gas operations during a February 2021 winter storm. Regulators at the PUC blasted Xcel and other utilities for mismanaging its gas infrastructure and racking up avoidable costs.

In a presentation about the Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition made to the City Council in Burnsville the suburban home of Xcel’s Black Dog coal-turned-fossil-gas plant Xcel lobbyist Michelle Swanson said Xcel is “counting on using natural gas” and that the Black Dog plant will run on gas “well into the 2040s.” She admitted however that technologies needed to meaningfully reduce emissions from gas plants do not exist today. Swanson listed “renewable natural gas” hydrogen and carbon capture as strategies to reduce or offset emissions – but all of those are costly unproven at scale and used by the utility industry to justify ongoing investment in fossil fuel infrastructure.

Burnsville officials ultimately agreed to join the coalition passing a resolution whose first draft was written by Swanson. In an internal email to Burnsville City Manager Gregg Lindberg Public Works Director Ryan Peterson noted that “the City could be as involved as we’d like but Xcel really wants us to join to be able to put us on their website as part of the coalition. Once they receive a certain number of partners they will start more outreach and publication of this including a robust website.”

Xcel offers to ‘assist with engagement’ of regulators lawmakers

Xcel appears ready to use cities as a bulwark against criticism from clean energy and environmental justice advocates – and the decision-makers receptive to those advocates’ messages. The coalition website states that the group’s purpose is to “actively engage lawmakers regulators and others in the carbon-free conversation” and promises “one-click access to your elected officials and regulators to make your voice heard.”

Privately Xcel has offered to coordinate coalition members’ communications with policymakers including its regulators at the PUC. In an April email promoting the group to the Metropolitan Airports Commission an Xcel account manager outlined the utility’s plans:

“We are asking customers to be part of this coalition at a level of engagement that aligns with your priorities. At a minimum Xcel Energy would provide information about issues being considered by [the] Minnesota legislature the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and other entities and how this could impact you. Customers may want to take additional actions such as letters of support or other engagement with political leadership and Xcel Energy can assist with that engagement. This coalition really offers you the opportunity to be a part of the conversation we are having with key regulators/policy makers in Minnesota.” (Emphasis added)

In her June presentation to the Burnsville City Council Swanson appealed for the city to engage with Xcel’s regulators.

“We’re regulated by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and policy is shaped at the Minnesota Legislature and both of those bodies hear regularly from activists who want us to go faster for example to get to carbon-free” Swanson said specifically referencing “advocacy groups” that oppose fossil gas. She also referred to “groups that think we are going too fast” though coalition marketing materials do not meaningfully address such groups.

Xcel wants customer money to promote the Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition

Xcel lobbyist Sara Barrow lists herself as the project manager for the Carbon-Free Future MN effort and also notes she has “developed and implemented outreach strategies to assist in achieving company goals.” But Xcel has also apparently enlisted Rapp Strategies a public affairs firm run by Todd Rapp a former lobbyist for the utility who before that was an operative at the state legislature. Rapp’s group registered the Carbon-Free Future MN website domain in September 2021 – concurrent with Clark’s participation in efforts to shape the state’s climate goals. Rapp Strategies has since prepared slides and other recruitment materials to pitch the coalition to local leaders document metadata shows.

As part of its latest request to increase gas rates Xcel asked to charge Minnesota customers $900000 for “community relations” consulting by Rapp Strategies. Xcel only briefly mentioned the expense in its filing and did not specify whether that cost is tied to the Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition. EPI asked Xcel whether it was charging customers for those or other funds paid to Rapp Strategies for work on the coalition. The company did not directly answer the question in its statement saying only that “The consulting contract you referenced is using their research and coalition-building expertise to advance this effort by educating customers and communities and the dollars you mentioned support this work.”

Xcel keeping coalition’s aims under wraps

Despite framing the coalition’s objectives on its website as “responsible” “careful” and “the right way” Xcel has tried to conceal information about it. After Swanson the Xcel lobbyist pitched the coalition to city officials in Hopkins she sent a follow-up email urging staff to “please delete the presentation Sara sent you or at least do not distribute whatever works for you.”

The presentation provided by the City of Hopkins through a public data request echoes other recruitment materials. On one slide – titled “We need your voice” – Xcel wrote that “it’s important for policymakers to hear from you” and that sealing its 2050 goal “will require us to work through a complicated regulatory and legislative process.”

Requests for emails with city leaders in Minneapolis and Saint Paul – two of Xcel’s biggest customers and two of the state’s staunchest pro-climate municipalities – did not turn up any communication from Xcel about the coalition as recently as September. This is despite the fact that Xcel often characterizes both cities as strong partners – particularly Minneapolis where the two have a formalized Clean Energy Partnership to promote the city’s clean energy goals.

A presentation to Twin Cities mayors in June revealed that a majority of Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition members were corporations and business groups. Those listed include Target Allina Health Red Wing Shoes and several chambers of commerce. Online agendas for local business groups’ meetings show Xcel has continued to promote the coalition across its Minnesota service territory.

Xcel has history of delaying climate action

Xcel is considered a leader in reducing emissions in a utility sector mostly made up of laggards. Still it has also joined efforts to oppose decarbonization strategies like electrification.

Earlier this year EPI revealed that Xcel was part of a gas industry group that spread false information to undermine electrification in Colorado where it also provides electric and gas service. In addition Xcel CEO Bob Frenzel sits on the board of the American Gas Association the gas utility trade group leading national efforts to subvert key consumer and climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that promote electrification.

Beyond that the utility has been part of the Consumer Energy Alliance a front group that advocates for fossil fuels. Xcel executives also attended a weeklong boot camp organized by the Edison Electric Institute – the trade group for investor-owned electric utilities that counts Xcel as a member – on how to run advocacy campaigns many of which opposed clean energy policy.

In Minnesota Xcel is a lobbying powerhouse. The utility has 67 lobbyists registered in the state and is routinely among the biggest spenders on lobbying. In 2021 Xcel spent $1.1 million on efforts to influence legislators and regulators – the fifth-most of any lobbying group in Minnesota according to state disclosures. Over the past half-decade Xcel has made substantial campaign contributions to Republican state legislators and affiliated funds as Republicans consistently stalled climate and clean energy bills. Republicans have received far more from Xcel than Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers pushing a pro-climate agenda.

Xcel’s support both tacit and explicit for a longer timeline to reduce emissions fits into a broader trend in the utility industry. After many electric utilities drove efforts to undermine climate science for decades they have more recently shifted their focus to delaying climate action according to a study by University of California Santa Barbara researchers that was published in September.

The electric utility industry is among those that have “argued that they should delay taking action on reducing pollution for example because solutions are too expensive infeasible or because others should be acting” the study found. EPI has also found that large investor-owned utilities with climate goals have generally back-loaded their carbon reductions. Utilities’ messaging also began to focus on unproven strategies like carbon capture – one of the dubious technologies Xcel promoted when it presented on the Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition to the Burnsville City Council.

Even as mounting research shows delayed climate action is a threat to lives and the economy a cornerstone of Xcel’s initiative is raising doubts about the cost and reliability of more rapid decarbonization. Still the utility stands by its push. On the group’s website Xcel says it is “proud to sponsor the Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition.”

Questions EPI submitted to Xcel

1. Gov. Tim Walz has set a goal to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity in Minnesota by 2040 as indicated in the Minnesota Climate Action Framework (page 20 of this document). Does Xcel oppose this goal?

2. Will Xcel oppose legislation to codify a 2040 carbon-free electricity standard for Minnesota?

3. Chris Clark participated in state-led discussions on carbon-free electricity goals at least as far back as fall 2020 as a member of the Governor’s Advisory Council on Climate Change. These discussions included a focus on the Walz administration’s Climate Action Framework which identifies the 2040 carbon-free electricity goal as a priority. Do you have any comment on this?

4. Xcel’s current rate case lists $900000 in “increased consulting spend” for Rapp Strategies’ “community relations” work as noted on page 31 of this filing (Initial Filing — Vol. 5 2 of 2 Budget Summary and Correspondence from 11/1/21). How much of this sum is related to the Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition? Are any other ratepayer funds being used to pay for Rapp Strategies’ work on the Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition?

Xcel’s response to EPI’s questions

“Developing the Carbon-Free Future MN Coalition is a key way we’re engaging educating and encouraging stakeholders to participate in the clean energy future. We have nation-leading clean energy plans to reduce carbon emissions from the electricity we provide to customers 85% by 2030 and a vision to provide 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. But if our customers and communities do not understand our plan and how it can deliver that clean energy future without risking reliability and affordability there is a risk that the clean energy transition will be slowed.

That is why we are building this coalition of customers and stakeholders. One of our primary goals has been to educate them on our plans and address questions about whether such a rapid transition to clean energy is possible without sacrificing the reliability and affordability they depend on. We know our plans can achieve this goal so the work helps position them to advocate for our ambitious clean energy plans if they choose to do so.

In addition to helping companies communities and organizations with sustainability interests or concerns better understand the clean energy transition they can also explore opportunities to participate such as through our Partners in Energy program or through their own sustainability efforts. This outreach also helps educate them on our progress—our system is about 60% carbon-free today—and shares information on how wind solar and new technologies like batteries can contribute to this carbon free energy while saving our customers significant money particularly during the recent commodity increases in natural gas prices while creating good paying local jobs and community benefits.

The consulting contract you referenced is using their research and coalition-building expertise to advance this effort by educating customers and communities and the dollars you mentioned support this work.

Chris Clark’s service on the Governor’s Task Force is one of the many efforts in which we have worked to align our energy leadership with the polices of the states and communities we serve. We look forward to working with the Walz Administration and other policymakers to continue to do so.

The current goal for Minnesota is to be carbon free by 2050 and this outreach helps increase understanding about that goal. Although the technology doesn’t exist today to get to 100% carbon-free while ensuring reliability and affordability for our customers there are many exciting possibilities on the horizon. We’re exploring all technologies that with help us make the transition and would welcome any technology that will help meet the goal reliably and affordably earlier than 2050.

As colder temperatures return to the area Xcel Energy is reminding customers of tips and programs to help them save on their energy bills at the start of the winter heating season so people can stay warm without breaking the bank.

The company is also encouraging customers to reach out if they’re having trouble paying their bills a news release says. Xcel Energy offers payment plans and can connect customers to energy assistance programs in their communities.

Take steps to save

Lower the thermostat a few degrees ideally to 68 degrees or lower.

Install a smart thermostat to automatically lower the temperature when away from home or during overnight hours.

During daylight hours open drapes and blinds to maximize heat from direct sunlight. To retain heat keep them closed when it is dark.

Run ceiling fans in a clockwise direction to push warm air down from the ceiling adding comfort and savings.

Keep interior doors open to help circulate air more freely and maintain constant heating levels.

Additional ways to save can be found on the energy savings tips page at xcelenergy.com. Customers can also learn more about programs incentives and rebates that can help make homes and businesses more energy efficient.

Customers are encouraged to contact Xcel Energy if they’re having trouble paying their bill. Customer agents can provide options such as payment plans and energy assistance programs. More information about energy assistance programs and resources can be found at xcelenergy.com or by calling 1-800-895-4999.

Nationwide increases in natural gas prices

About 30% of the region’s power generation is fueled by natural gas for which commodity prices remain high due to global supply and demand issues Xcel Energy says causing electric bills to be higher. The power company ""purchases natural gas at wholesale and the cost of the natural gas used to generate electricity is passed along to customers without markup"" the release says.

To protect against market fluctuations in the price Xcel Energy provides a diverse energy mix including a large amount of wind energy to minimize the effect of natural gas price increases on electric bills.

In addition a home energy services program allows customers to get some efficiency services from approved contractors at no charge. Customers can select an approved contractor by going to www.xcelenergyefficiency.com.

""It's going to be massive"" forward Tyson Jost said. ""We need to make this a hard building to play in. Our fans are great. It's a hostile environment. So we need to feed off that energy.""

This homestand is kicking off without goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury.

He suffered an upper-body injury Tuesday at Nashville and was placed on injured reserve. The Wild recalled Zane McIntyre from Iowa in the American Hockey League to back up Filip Gustavsson.

""Even if Marc-Andre Fleury was still in the lineup we have a lot of confidence in Gus and we've talked about it that he was going to get some starts"" coach Dean Evason said.

""Not that we projected anything down the road. We're basically playing every second day here so he was going to play regardless. Maybe he'll get a few more; obviously it depends on how long Flower's out. But I know the team feels very good we certainly feel very good that he'll get the job done.""

Gustavsson taking over the crease isn't the only lineup change the Wild will make.

Jost is also penciled in after sitting three games as a healthy scratch. The winger has zero goals and three assists in 11 games.

""I just want to go in and just play my game and just be true to who I am"" Jost said.

Projected lineup:

Kirill Kaprizov-Frederick Gaudreau-Mats Zuccarello

And during the company’s third-quarter earnings presentation on Thursday (Nov. 17) it was no different.

“We are more focused than ever on accelerating our progress towards profitability and have made leadership changes to step up the intensity of execution towards profitability” Jonathan Klein chairman of the Jumia Supervisory Board said in a report released as part of the presentation.

Part of achieving that goal involves a need for leadership to be actively involved in on-the-ground operations Francis Dufay — appointed acting CEO following the recent departure of founders and co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec — told analysts and journalists tuned in to the call.

In fact per Dufay this has meant “significantly reducing” the company’s presence in markets like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and relocating most of the group’s leadership to markets in its core Africa base.

In addition to the executive reshuffle Jumia is drastically dialing back on projects that haven’t demonstrated clear viability and will instead double down on proven revenue streams.

“We need much more focus in terms of scope of projects and the activities that we take. We cannot be sharp in our execution if we are spread too thin across too many projects. We need to stop projects that bring limited value to the platform and focus on what matters” Dufay said.

The first casualty of Jumia’s operational weight loss is its delivery service Jumia Prime a monthly subscription program offering free delivery to consumers that the company has tested over the past couple of years.

As Executive Vice President for Finance and Operations Antoine Maillet-Mezera explained to participants “the results from this experiment in terms of consumer traction and stickiness fell short of our targets as the market is probably not yet mature enough leading us to pause this initiative.”

Maillet-Mezera also announced cuts to Jumia’s free shipping program while increasing the minimum basket size for free delivery and restricting its geographic scope to focus on primary cities.

The company is also suspending its logistics services to non-eCommerce clients in countries where it believes efforts would be better invested in improving the logistics efficiency for its core eCommerce business.

Those markets include Nigeria Morocco and Cote d’Ivoire where the firm’s logistics infrastructure is well developed and where proof of concept for the service has already been established Maillet-Mezera added.

Food Buoys Business Despite FX Challenges

Overall Jumia registered an 18% revenue growth in Q3 and in terms of business categories that could ease its path to profitability food delivery came out on top and will continue to drive development across the largest markets it operates in particularly Nigeria said Maillet-Mezera.

In fact food delivery accounted for 20% of items sold on the Jumia platform in the quarter while emerging the fastest-growing category in order terms with a 38% year-over-year increase in orders in Q3.

On the downside JumiaPay transactions as a percentage of total orders on the platform have steadily declined since last year and currently sit at 31.9% after peaking at 35.7% in Q3 2021.

Suggesting that the market has become more saturated growth in JumiaPay’s total payment volume has also flattened out and increased just 3% year over year to $66.6 million compared to over 30% growth in previous quarters.

With this slowing growth in mind the Q3 report noted that “JumiaPay remains a core priority for us and we will work on making it an even more effective enabler of our eCommerce business focusing on a more targeted number of critical products and ventures.”

That will involve retaining “a disciplined approach to driving on-platform payment penetration with disciplined marketing and consumer incentives spend” the report further stated.

Maillet-Mezera also told investors that foreign exchange (FX) has been a significant headwind for Jumia in the quarter as the Nigerian naira Egyptian pound and West African CFA franc each depreciated by 5% 14% and 13% respectively against the dollar in the nine months to the end of September.

“The combination of food and commodity inflation a stronger dollar and weaker local currencies is weighing on consumer spend and sentiment” he added.

As a result of the highly volatile and challenging macroeconomic environment Jumia has suspended the 2022 GMV growth guidance and Gross Profit guidance it provided earlier in the year.

Lead engineer James Harbison details so...

The Air Force’s Business and Enterprise Systems (BES) Directorate is no stranger to modernization. BES’ Integrated Logistics System — Supply (ILS-S) has been in a state of near constant modernization since the early 1980s when its main component the Standard Business Supply System transitioned from assembly code to COBOL. Since then it’s been through multiple mainframe consolidations two failed efforts to implement an enterprise resource planning system and multiple attempts to better streamline and integrate its various moving parts and processes. More recently BES moved the system into the cloud specifically Amazon Web Services’ Cloud One.

Along the way BES has picked up a number of lessons learned about major system modernizations.

“Whenever you change your entire infrastructure it’s basically a baseline release. I mean it’s not a minor release it’s not a patch” said James Harbison ILS-S lead engineer for BES. “It’s a baseline release. And so we had to basically test our entire code base.”

Harbison said BES had to divide up all of ILS-S’ functionalities write test descriptions and then decide what would be automated and what would be manual. The most critical functions he said were the best candidates for automated testing. They ended up with roughly 10000 automated scripts that ran continually. Harbison credited that continuous testing for why the fielding was almost error free.

Another major takeaway was the need to avoid scope creep; Harbison said trying to do too much at once has been the downfall of Air Force projects in the past. The problem with changing too much at once he said is when you run a test and get a different output you don’t know which change caused it.

Harbison also praised the decision to use open source code rather than a commercial-off-the-shelf solution. He said that 95% of the code in the ILS-S system is open source.

“The only thing we have in our system that’s not open source is the Oracle relational database which is a COTS product” Harbison said. “Because if you’re not careful you’ll get a software stack that you can’t afford. You’ll do all this work and coding but just spend all your money in software licensing.”

BES found that the open source version of Java is a fully functional third generation language that does everything they need it to. ILS-S’ application server and big data solution are both open source as well.

Harbison said one of the advantages for using open source solutions over COTS is the benefits of having a community of thousands of developers that maintain the code as long as you stick to the big products over the niche ones. And if something does go down BES has a sustainment contractor to fall back on because they have access to the source code.

Another advantage to open source solutions is the ability to peel back the code and examine what’s inside of it. Harbison said people often hold up the possibility of vulnerabilities in open source code as a reason to choose COTS products instead but what they don’t consider is those COTS products are just as reliant on open source code as well. It’s just not economical to code every line from scratch. But that same open source community that maintains the code also makes it more likely that if there is a vulnerability someone will discover it and report it before anyone can exploit it.

That combination of community maintenance and built-in threat information sharing is something that many have struggled to foster between the public and private sectors.

“In COTS sometimes you just don’t know that you have a threat because they won’t share the code with you” Harbison said. “But believe me they are full of open source too; they just won’t tell you.”

Harbison did caution however that this approach does require developers to stay on top of the most current release versions in order to stay up to date on security patches. That can be a challenge.

He also cautioned not to overestimate cost savings in moving to the cloud. Some people predicted that cloud would be 10% the cost of using the Defense Information Systems Agency’s mid-tier servers but Harbison said it was closer to half the cost. That said he said BES did save about $22 million getting off of Unisys mainframes. Earlier this year Harbison said they’ve also implemented reserve instances which is on track to reduce costs even further to the tune of somewhere between $2 million and $3 million.

Adopting agile development principles also paid dividends Harbison said. Before making that change BES was delivering around 10 releases a year on the waterfall method. Since switching to agile in 2018 Harbison said BES has increased the rate of releases to one a month.

Harbison said next up BES is looking to reproduce its successes in modernizing ILS-S — which is the Air Force’s retail supply system — on their stock control system which is wholesale supply.

“Basically we’re going to move them off an IBM mainframe we are going to move them to the cloud at the same time because that’s the requirement. And it’s a four to five year effort but we’re going to use the same kind of concept” he said. “We’re doing lots of automated testing. So we’re using the basic same constructs and everything for this parallel effort.”

Benefits like downtime reduction throughput increases labor productivity improvements and more can be seen when leveraged correctly. In fact one survey indicated that 94% of manufacturing companies credited Industry 4.0 with helping keep operations running smoothly during crisis in addition to boosting efficiency and safety.

Much of this efficiency can be attributed to the hallmark of Industry 4.0 – increased communication capabilities. At its core Industry 4.0 allows information to be transmitted like never before relying on foundational infrastructure to connect all the pieces of a completely interconnected manufacturing and supply chain system. When all the components of a business can share data and talk to each other a more holistic view of operations is available and better business decisions are made.

So where does this leave the businesses that haven’t prioritized digital transformation until today? Automation mobilization and interconnectivity are critical components of modern operations and Industry 4.0 promotes the integration of all these pieces. The good news is that operations don’t have to come to a screeching halt to implement Industry 4.0 technologies into a facility.

Here are three steps to consider to bring your operations into the future with Industry 4.0 – and keep your business moving during the process.

1. Create your vision.

It’s essential to first consider your end goal for Industry 4.0. Take stock of your business challenges. Where can automation mobilization and interconnectivity support operations? What parts of your facility and processes could use updating including needs and wants? Where do you have disparate data that needs to connect? Think about where you lack visibility. Make note of any current pain points that must be addressed like repeated failures in a particular workflow.

At the same time think beyond the “need-to-haves” and consider “nice-to-haves” too. For example even if you’re satisfied with your current fulfillment efficiency it’s possible that Industry 4.0 could drive improvements and enable growth.

This contemplation will determine your vision for where Industry 4.0 can be reflected in your unique setting. Once you have a vision for your Industry 4.0 adoption it’s time to evaluate your parameters.

2. Evaluate your parameters.

You can move on to more granular characteristics once you’ve determined the ideal “big picture.” Assess your current systems requirements for new technology and potential challenges. Looking at your existing infrastructure how is power or data transmitted? Are there any gaps in the current infrastructure that would need to be addressed? In many cases there are Wi-Fi dead zones or areas with RF noise which are important factors. Assess your current systems requirements for new technology and potential challenges. Looking at your existing infrastructure how is power or data transmitted? Are there any gaps in the current infrastructure that would need to be addressed? In many cases there are Wi-Fi dead zones or areas with RF noise which are important factors.

Physical parameters come into play as well. If mobile devices are part of your vision would their travel paths be consistent or variable? What about obstacles like workers operating in the same environments? When considering requirements for new technology think about any data and security needs. This step is crucial because it establishes the differences between your vision and current processes systems and capabilities.

3. Determine your infrastructure needs.

After outlining your operation’s future and present in the first two steps infrastructure will bridge the gap. Think about implementing Industry 4.0 like conducting roadwork. If a highway needs to be updated it’s not shut down completely. Traffic continues to flow while an old road is repaired or a new road is built albeit with modified traffic patterns or minor inconveniences. As parts of the project are completed they are opened to traffic. Once the project is finished the benefits ultimately outweigh the disadvantages like obstacles that workers had to overcome or drivers' annoyance during construction.

Both roadwork and Industry 4.0 are gradual necessary processes that involve detailed planning intentional execution and undeniable benefits. In manufacturing and distribution your infrastructure is like a highway allowing information to flow between various sources and destinations. Your pieces of equipment are like cars on the road added to the new highway over time. Establishing the appropriate infrastructure lays the foundation for success.

Expert partners are especially beneficial during this step as they can share options and advise about what is most compatible with your vision current systems logistical considerations and more. It’s common that Industry 4.0 is strongly associated with Wi-Fi infrastructure.

However Wi-Fi can have drawbacks like the potential for outages cybersecurity risks inconsistent coverage and limited range. Depending on your previously defined needs and challenges it might be wise to consider infrastructure options beyond Wi-Fi. Additionally many providers can leverage or expand your current systems to incorporate modern technology more seamlessly reducing the impact on productivity and budget. Educate yourself about infrastructure options and consult a trusted skilled partner to choose the best foundation for your success.

And obviously the third Fortress/VLSi trial resulting in another near-billion-dollar award splashed the headlines. The District of Delaware was busy uncovering the story behind IP Edge/Mavexar LLC and how they run and control their subsidiaries and it’s even more interesting than I thought it was; though of course it hasn’t stopped entities like those run by Jeffrey Gross from continuing to roll out filings. More below.

On Remand from AAPA Decision Qualcomm Claims Confirmed Unpatentable: In a decision following an appeal that drew a concurrence the Board panel again cancelled all challenged claims of Qualcomm’s U.S. 8063674 patent. The Federal Circuit vacated the Board’s underlying decision arguing that they “incorrectly interpreted § 311(b)’s ‘prior art consisting of patents or printed publications’ to encompass [applicant admitted prior art (AAPA)] contained in the challenged patent.” But the Federal Circuit found the use of the AAPA is permissible and remanded and left the door open to consider whether the AAPA formed the “basis” of the challenge. Another non-AAPA ground was affirmed.

In the decision the Board noted that the Director issued updated AAPA guidance on June 9 and considered it as superseding the earlier guidance. It relied on the statements therein to note that as long as the AAPA does not form the “basis” of the challenge it is permissible by the language of the statute. Apple argued it simply supplied additional limitations and details thought conventional and that the rejections were based and relied on another prior art reference not in dispute; Qualcomm argued the opposite. The Board sided with the petitioner and found the additional limitations taught by the AAPA consistent with the Federal Circuit’s and Office’s current interpretation of their rules. The concurring judge tersely noted they did not believe analysis was necessary at all given the clear Director’s Updated Guidance.

IP Edge/Mavexar Hearings Mandamus Request: If you’re not following the IP/DE blog here you should. It detailed a series of hearings last week on disclosure requirements that all seemed to reveal that IP Edge and its three principals have been running a business whereby they cold-call private citizens with little to no Internet presence offer them a passive 5% of any proceeds from a patent assertion campaign and then set them up as the sole owner and controlling party of an LLC—at least legally. Then per testimony from last week IP Edge (or their other alter ego Mavexar) control all litigation decisions. See here for more. Data shows that more than 500 lawsuits are filed annually—as much as a sixth of all U.S. patent suits per annum—by IP Edge entities set up this way. Mavexar has intervened and filed a writ of mandamus to the Federal Circuit to try and stop what it has called a “judicial inquisition.”
