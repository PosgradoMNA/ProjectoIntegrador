Mehaa

Mehaa Amirthalingam of Sugar Land has been named one of the 10 finalists in HP’s Girls Save the World challenge.



Part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Solv[ED] programYouth Challenge HP Girls Save the World is for girls aged 13-18. Participants must propose a sustainable solution to an environmental problem in their community.



Mehaa 17 who graduated from William B Travis High School this year built a device that would save water by using gray water instead of fresh water for flushing the toilet.



Mehaa built an innovative water-saving toilet flushing system. The use of recycled water in the toilet flushing system not only cuts water consumption in households but also helps grapple with water scarcity. Mehaa built and installed the invention named “Arya” in the master bathroom of her own home.



“Grey water” is lightly used water from sinks baths showers and laundry i.e. all domestic flows with the exception of waste water from toilets.



In 2018 the invention first gained recognition when Mehaa was named one of the 10 finalists in the Discovery Education Network’s 3M Young Scientist Challenge.



Mehaa is the daughter of Nappinnai and Raja Amirthalingam.



The Girls Save the World citation on Mehaa’s Arya said: The Texas resident created a simple way to conserve nearly 25% of domestic clean water usage with a dual water toilet flushing system called Arya. It redirects used shower water called gray water for toilet flushing.



Launched last October as part of the MIT Solv[ED] Youth Innovation Challenge the Girls Save the World program invited girls ages 13 to 18 to submit their ideas for solving an environmental or societal challenge in their community by using technology.



Participants would enter for a chance to win part of a $50000 prize pool and technology pack from HP to help them take the next steps in developing and implementing their solutions.



The Challenge received more than 800 applications from 148 countries including many from girl-led teams that have worked tirelessly for months to submit innovative ideas that could make a difference in their communities.



While all solutions were considered the judging criteria included proving the potential impact feasibility and scalability of their solutions. Each team had to demonstrate an innovative approach designed with — and for — underserved communities.



“To garner the best solutions to global issues we must empower girls to dive into technology and innovation and bring more diverse voices to the forefront” says Eliza Berg Lead Learning & Solv[ED] Communities at MIT Solve. “HP’s Girls Save the World prize has enabled us to uplift even more young innovators who want hands-on experience.”



After careful consideration 10 finalists were chosen. Projects range from water conservation to STEM education and were shared at the first-ever Girls Save the World virtual camp this week. Participants were supported in honing their pitches and received mentoring by experts from HP and program partners.



All finalists received a sustainable technology pack from HP including: an Elite Dragonfly the world’s first laptop made with ocean-bound plastics an ENVY Inspire printer with an Instant Ink subscription that contributes to HP Planet Partners through the reuse and recycling of printer cartridges along with a supply of HP brand paper which contributes to forest protection and restoration.



Sixteen-year-old Elizabeth Nyamwange of Byron Illinois was the inaugural winner of this cohort and claimed the top prize of $10000. This funding will enable her to further develop her winning project Etana.



The device created by Nyamwange is a low-cost solar-powered fingerprint scanner which creates biometric templates and uploads them to a public server. The data is recorded on a blockchain making it accessible and secure giving women in developing countries a form of digital proof of identity without access to the internet or electricity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkYXF1YXRpY3MuY29tL25ld3MvMjY0OTUxOC9hcmUtdGhlLXVuaXRlZC1zdGF0ZXMtb2YtYW1lcmljYS13YXRlci1wb2xvLXdvbWVuLXN0aWxsLXVuc3RvcHBhYmxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are the United States of America water polo women still unstoppable?,"Head coach Adam Krikorian who had led the team through the golden era said three weeks ago that his team had just finished its first couple days of training and stated that there was a lot to catch up on and “unfortunately a limited amount of time together before the World Championships. But we will do our best to make the most of it” he said.

“We will undoubtedly have many new faces with at most seven people returning from the Olympic Games and only five of our 11 field players.

“We’re excited to compete in a format that has a new look being in different cities for the group stage. And we are especially thrilled to be back in Budapest for the final few games in a place that embraces the sport of water polo at the highest level.”

The competition

For the first time the competition will be spread over four Hungarian cities — Budapest Debrecen Sopron and Szeged. Being two hours of more from Budapest the outlying cities pose logistical challenges especially with the allocation of referees and delegates let alone the competing teams.

The format starts with Monday’s group stages — Group A in Budapest Group B in Debrecen Group C in Sopron and Group D in Szeged.

The four teams in each group will play their three matches in their respective cities. The group winners earn a day off as the second and third-ranked teams in each group will play crossover matches in Budapest’s famous Alfred Hajos complex on Margaret Island. The fourth-ranked teams will clash in Szeged over two days for classifications 13-16.

The winners of the major crossovers will then enter the top-eight competition through to the finals at Alfred Hajos. The bottom eight teams will play out their 9-12 classification series in Szeged over two days.

Teams have been allocated two “reserve” players which will allow for any Covid difficulties in particular. This is particularly pertinent for Canada Netherlands and a lesser extent New Zealand who have players on the cusp of isolation.

Let’s look at the groups

Group A — Budapest

Hungary as the host nation gets to showcase the best of Hungarian water polo on the biggest stage. Tokyo 2020 bronze medallist Hungary lost out to Australia at Gwangju 2019 and is keen to add to titles in 1994 and 2005 plus a silver and a bronze.

Fellow dual world champion Italy is the biggest threat to Hungary and it is out to show that missing Tokyo 2020 was a blip on the recent radar. Italy has to go back to its golden run in 1998 and 2001 with its most recent success bronze at Kazan 2015.

Canada has done so much in the past 12 months and should provide plenty of resistance. It has two silvers and two bronzes in the cabinet at this level the best result recently being a bronze-medal loss to Russia at Budapest 2017. Its last podium finish was silver at Rome 2009 in an incident-packed match.

Colombia is the newcomer to the international stage and will cherish the experience of playing such illustrious opponents.

Day 1 schedule: 19:30 Canada v Italy; 21:00 Hungary v Colombia.

Group B — Debrecen

Six-time champion United States of America heads the group and even with some relative youngsters and new faces will still be the team to beat. USA has a stranglehold on the event winning the last three editions and is the leading nation with nine medals.

Netherlands who faded at Tokyo 2020 into sixth place has the team to match USA and can rightfully expect to be in the medal hunt in the second week. It’s been a long time since winning gold at the second edition in Perth 1991 but here is an opportunity to add a second gold after appearing in five previous finals.

South Africa’s 14th place in Gwangju 2019 was its best at this level and if it can slip past Argentina the possibility is there for a best result.

Argentina might be bewildered by the attention water polo receives in Hungary but as a first-timer at the FINA Worlds anything goes and FINA World League Intercontinental Cup wins over Colombia and Cuba in March will offer some confidence.

Day 1 schedule: 18:00 South Africa v United States of America; 19:30 Netherlands v Argentina.

Group C — Sopron

Australia is the form team of the group having easily won the FINA World League Intercontinental Cup in March. The Aussie Stingers were underdone at Tokyo 2020 and fell out of the medal round to Russian Olympic Committee who have not been invited to Hungary and then defeated Netherlands for fifth. Australia won the inaugural World Championship crown and been on the podium five times the last as the bronze medallist at Gwangju 2019.

Brazil was 15 goals in arrears of Australia and 10 down on Canada at the Intercontinental Cup but won against Colombia Argentina and Cuba. In 12 appearances eighth in Perth 1991 and ninth in Rome 1994 were the best. Four tenths including Kazan 2015 were the next beat.

Kazakhstan was 10th in Gwangju 2019 its best result since eighth in Fukuoka 2001. The team has its ups and downs on the international stage and will need to produce something to head off New Zealand for one of the runner-up spots.

New Zealand is stacked with players who ply their trade in the United States college system so should be match fit and ready to improve on 12th at the previous three iterations.

Day 1 schedule: 18:00 New Zealand v Brazil; 19:30 Kazakhstan v Australia.

Group D — Szeged

Spain is the Olympic silver medallist and silver medallist from the recent European qualifying final of the FINA World League losing to Netherlands 12-11. Its form will come to fruition in Budapest and thoughts of that lovely summer’s day in Barcelona nine years ago — where it beat Australia for gold — will be reinforced by head coach Miki Oca. Spain will need to wipe thoughts of losing both the previous finals to the USA.

Greece is still living off that wonderful day in Shanghai 2011 when it headed China for the gold medal — its sole visit to the podium at World Championships. Greece has been ravaged by Covid-19 illness this year and had to settle for fifth at the European World League finals downing France 15-10. At full strength Greece will be dangerous.

France as the host for Paris 2024 is improving with every match. France is still 12 goals shy of Netherlands and needs to maintain the upward trend as part of the Paris journey.

Thailand gained its invite to Budapest 2022 thanks to an excellent showing in the FINA Challengers’ Cup in Barranquilla Colombia last November. It lost the gold-medal final to Colombia 14-11 after being 10-10 early in the final quarter. A debut showing in Hungary could be just the filip the team needs.

Day 1 schedule: 18:00 Greece v Thailand; 19:30 France v Spain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGZ0b2RheS5hZS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyMi8wNi8xOC85MS1wZXItY2VudC1vZi11YWUtcmVzaWRlbnRzLXRydXN0LXNjaWVuY2UtZmluZHMtc3VydmV50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,91% of UAE residents trust science finds survey,"Photo used for illustrative purpose.

Ninety one per cent of UAE residents trust science and appreciate the relevance of technology to their everyday lives more so than the rest of the world as revealed in the fifth edition of 3M’s 2022 State of Science Index (SOSI).

The 3M survey further revealed global attitudes toward science and technology in the UAE- 88 per cent trust scientists; 37 per cent of people completely agree that they defend science when it is questioned (vs 23 per cent global average); 76 per cent agreed on the importance of science in their everyday life (vs. 52 per cent global average).

The 3M research also found that today science is more relevant to people in the UAE than a year ago as three-quarters (76 per cent) agree that it is essential to them in their everyday life versus 68 per cent in 2021.

In addition 92 per cent of people surveyed in the UAE want to hear more from scientists about their work – a clear opportunity for more scientists to communicate directly on news and social media platforms.

Regarding the environment and sustainability 92 per cent in the UAE believe people should adopt a scientific approach to help make the world more sustainable (slightly higher than the global average of 88 per cent).

The study also showed that the immediacy of the climate crisis is becoming more apparent with 79 per cent of people in the UAE expressing their concerns about climate change as a critical environmental issue.

“It is promising to see the deep trust held in science and technology in the UAE. The nation’s leadership has successfully placed science technology and sustainability at the core of its transition to a knowledge-based economy with wide support from its citizens and residents. With a firm belief in the power of science and its commitment to global climate change the United Arab Emirates is well placed to host next year’s COP28 UN Climate Change Conference” said Laszlo Svinger Vice-President and Managing Director MEA at 3M.

The UAE is a testbed for futuristic technologies and has built strong public confidence in its scientific initiatives with 91 per cent of the people believing that they will depend more on scientific knowledge in the future.

The 3M research found that in the UAE 41 per cent believe that self-driving cars will become a regular part of life within the next five years and 89 per cent are confident in the prospect of riding in an autonomous or self-driving vehicle where there is no human driver.

There seems to be an edge that identical sisters have when competing as duet partners. However the results today at the Hajos Alfred Swimming Complex on Margaret Island was a first with only twin and triplet sisters taking home the medals.

After finishing second in the last five FINA World Championships China's pair Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi clinched the first gold medal for China in Budapest. During the routine “Gamers” swum to the song “Naval Commandos” by Elliott Leung the 25-year-old twins showcased difficult hybrids and very rapid leg movements throughout the choreography which earned them 93.7536 points.

“It is a great honour to stand on the top of the podium at a World Championships. We think that Budapest is our lucky place we really love to be here and we are really happy right now. We were satisfied with our performance and luckily the judges also appreciated our unique routine.”

In a very close race that was not decided until the very end of the competition Ukraine's Aleksiiva sisters Maryna and Vladyslava claimed the silver with 91.8617 points. Winner of the bronze medal in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games this the first silver medal for Ukraine in the Duet Technical event. The relevant “Royal Blood” routine the Aleksiiva twins performed was an emotional exhibition of the Ukrainian situation and their desire to return home.

“Despite we did not manage to win the gold medal we are really satisfied with the silver as this was our first senior World Championships. We tried to do our best and today it was worth a silver medal. We would like to dedicate this result to our strong country Ukraine.”

Another first happened for the Austrian pair of triplet sisters Anna-Maria Alexandri and Eirini Alexandri who won the first World Championship medal for Austria in Artistic Swimming. The Alexandri sisters performed their “Warriors” choreography to music by the same composer as the Chinese duet Elliott Leung to score 91.2622 points for the bronze medal.

“We are so relieved and empty we can’t think of anything right now. We are so happy and it is a dream that came true. We came here and knew it was going to be difficult. We never expected this only dreamt about it.”

The finalists for the Team Technical event which will be contested on Tuesday June 21 were determined today in the preliminary round. After having finished in second place at the last three FINA World Championships the team representing China leads the way to the gold medal after the preliminary round. Japan with one silver and two bronze medals at previous editions of the FINA World Championships follows right behind. However the podium on Tuesday could feature the teams from Italy France United States or Greece none of which have won a medal in this event at the World Championships.

The program for Monday June 20th includes the preliminary round for the Solo Free event and the Mixed Duet Technical and Free Combination events. Full results of the Championships can be found here as well as information for the live broadcasts."

Quinta Brunson and Adam Scott Explain It All,"Quinta Brunson the creator and star of ABC’s “Abbott Elementary” and Adam Scott of Apple TV+’s mind-bending drama “Severance” have a connection we can’t quite put our finger on. After they speak about their shows — and the fact that both of their mothers were public school teachers — it turns out that their familiar dynamic comes from an established collegial relationship: As Scott accidentally spills on Variety‘s “Actors on Actors” is presented by Apple TV+ Brunson will be guest starring on the upcoming Starz revival of Scott’s brilliant-but-canceled “Party Down.” Thanks for letting us know!

ADAM SCOTT: “Abbott Elementary” is your show. My family and I — we go through phases of watching a show together. And we can’t watch it unless all four of us are there. “Abbott” is our latest. And greatest.

QUINTA BRUNSON: Yay! That’s my favorite thing to hear about it by the way: family appointment viewing.

SCOTT: And they’re teenagers now too so it’s hard to find something that we all want to watch. But it’s also like cool enough for them.

BRUNSON: They can’t all gather and watch “Severance”?

SCOTT: No. We can but it makes me far too nervous. We chatted a couple of months ago and something you mentioned that I thought was really interesting was how much a fan you are of the network sitcom — and the idea of creating something that can be broadly sent out to all households. You’re being credited with reviving the network sitcom.

BRUNSON: That’s too big. I’ve seen that headline and it’s too much.

SCOTT: Yeah.

BRUNSON: I do think that while “Abbott” has been successful which I’m super grateful for people have been doing great work in the network space for a really long time. “Young Sheldon” has been pulling in massive numbers — even their reruns do. There are the shows this season like “Ghosts” on CBS which is just a joyful delightful show to watch and “American Auto” and “Grand Crew” on NBC. It was a combined effort and I think that “Abbott” just feels like a great show for everyone to connect that narrative to. “Parks and Rec” was that for me. I enjoyed having this thing that I could watch with friends and family that was easy. “Parks and Rec” felt like a risk where you almost couldn’t believe you were seeing this on network. “Parks” it was so beautifully written.

SCOTT: And the jokes were so terrific. I didn’t want to screw any of them up; I wanted them to work. I mean I remember going and doing something dramatic for the first time after doing “Parks” for a while and it was like “Oh yeah. Right this is different.” And having to shift a little bit.

Alexi Lubomirski for Variety

BRUNSON: That’s exciting I think as an actor. After doing Janine for months straight on “Abbott” I remember getting so excited to come do another thing in a way that almost felt juvenile. I felt like a little kid like I get to go be someone else today.

SCOTT: But that was announced right? We can say it — you’re guest starring on “Party Down.”

BRUNSON: I don’t think that was announced.

SCOTT: It wasn’t?

BRUNSON: I didn’t see it.

SCOTT: I totally thought it was. You’re in “Party Down.”

BRUNSON: I am and I was so excited to be there.

SCOTT: There’s something about “Abbott” that’s a great mixture of these razorsharp jokes and a little subversion. It’s so deeply funny but also the kindness in the show — my mom was a public school teacher and there’s something that kind of hits me squarely in the heart every week. Because it’s so clear that you have an affection and such a respect for teachers. Where does that come from?

BRUNSON: First I didn’t know your mom was a public school teacher. You talked to me a lot about “Star Trek.”

SCOTT: I did.

BRUNSON: That affection the one you’re talking about is one I’m sure you share. To be a child of a teacher is a unique experience. My experience was also really unique because I went to the school where my mother taught. I was in her kindergarten class and then I was at the school she taught at for the next five years. School would get out at 3 but we’d go home at about 5 or 6. She’d work even more yet somehow still put food on the table. And so naturally I have an insight that most people don’t have. I also have such a respect for the profession and a love that was formed through the love for my mother but through her loving her colleagues. There’s an article in The Wall Street Journal and it was talking about “Severance” and “Abbott” and exploration of the workplace. And I was like “Why are these two together?” I thought that comparison was so interesting. A question I had for you: What was it like from day to day?

SCOTT: It was challenging. I remember getting there in October of 2020 a month before we started shooting and I went straight to the set from the airport. Because I’d seen photos of what [director] Ben Stiller was putting together with his team and I just wanted to see it. I’d been looking at photos on my phone for a long time and so I went there and saw all the sets.

BRUNSON: Yeah where was that?

SCOTT: It was on a stage in Queens.

BRUNSON: What!

SCOTT: Yeah. And they built that main office with the green carpet with low ceilings and stuff. Once I actually stepped onto the set and saw the enormity of it I started getting a little freaked out. Because we had all nine episodes. Amy Poehler used to call starting a new show: You’re at the bottom of show mountain. You’re like at base camp and there is a sheer face in front of you. And you just have to chip away. When it’s a brand-new show all of show mountain is right in front of you. I just have one quick question: When the praise started pouring in were you still shooting or was it all shot?

BRUNSON: Thank God it was all shot. Because that just got to bounce off of me and be like “Cool whether it’s loved or hated there’s nothing I can do about it.” Like with “Severance” that was made before it started airing.

SCOTT: That’s right.

BRUNSON: Did that feel good?

SCOTT: Yeah. Because also we shot the whole thing at once. We just shot all nine at the same time — we’d be shooting like something from Episode 1 and then after lunch we would shoot Episode 8. We did that and it took like 10 months.

BRUNSON: I was talking to a friend who is also a writer about a show having a soul. To me that’s what makes it stand the test of time. I feel like “Severance” has a soul.

Alexi Lubomirski for Variety

SCOTT: “Severance” was unique because we were shooting during pre-vaccine COVID. We started shooting the day after the presidential election in November of 2020 and in New York so everything was really locked down. It started this pattern that felt very isolated and sort of parallel to the show. When we were on set together the actors that was our time during the day to be around people and be able to connect with people. And I think the characters too are yearning for attention. If you were going to find the soul of the show it might be somewhere in there.

BRUNSON: I have rapid-fire questions.

SCOTT: Sure.

BRUNSON: Where was the outside? Was that computer-generated or was that outside of Lumon real?

SCOTT: That’s a real building in New Jersey. It used to be Bell Labs back in the day.

BRUNSON: We still don’t know what Lumon does unless I missed something.

SCOTT: Well Lumon is generally one of those companies that’s been around for a long long time where you’re eating your cereal and you’re like “Wait they make this? And they also make my light bulbs.” I think that it’s hinted at in some conversation early in the show.

BRUNSON: Is Zach Cherry really that funny?

SCOTT: Yeah. He’s the best. Do you not know Zach?

BRUNSON: I don’t know him. But yesterday I said I’m gonna look up this guy. And he follows me on Twitter and I never —

SCOTT: You want me to tell him to stop following you on Twitter?

BRUNSON: No! This is what I did in my brain last night. I was like “It’s gonna be so weird to follow him back now that I saw him on a show. So I’m not gonna follow him back.” But I’ll follow him. He’ll see this and be like “Why not just follow me at this point?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNlbnRlcnNxdWFyZS5jb20vdGV4YXMvYXJ0aWNsZV81OTJkZmY5MC1lZTY2LTExZWMtOTQzZi05ZmQwYTRjYTZmZGYuaHRtbNIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNlbnRlcnNxdWFyZS5jb20vdGV4YXMvYXJ0aWNsZV81OTJkZmY5MC1lZTY2LTExZWMtOTQzZi05ZmQwYTRjYTZmZGYuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas taxpayers pick up $2.9 million tab to bus immigrants to D.C.,Migrants hold Red Cross blankets after arriving at Union Station near the U.S. Capitol from Texas on buses Wednesday April 27 2022 in Washington.

Image Credit: Courtesy of K.C. Bailey/ Amazon Prime Video

In the fourth season of Amazon’s comedy series comedy manager Susie Myerson finds herself having to expand her roster beyond her two main clients Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) and her rival Sophie Lennon (Jane Lynch).

“I love that she finally wants more responsibility and more clients and now is suddenly like ‘Oh fuck how do I do this?’ ” says Alex Borstein. “It’s very similar to me. I get myself into these situations when I say yes to something and then I have to figure out what I’m doing.”

Having now played Susie over four seasons of the series (and winning two Emmys for her performance) Borstein adds that she’s found more in common with her character throughout the years. “I think Susie likes that feeling. She has a gambling problem and this is certainly the biggest gamble of her life. She’s kind of like a duck — it looks like she’s keeping her head above water but underneath she’s paddling like a motherfucker and trying not to drown.”

Her devotion to Midge is also what creates her great conflict in the fourth season as she has gambled away money she owes to the title character and thus has to focus on other people in order to recoup that loss. “Midge is maybe her first love her true love but these other new clients that she starts bringing on become her second third fourth fifth loves” says Borstein. “She’s learning to balance how to split her focus. It’s kind of like a mom going from having an only child to having a second or third child — she’s got to figure out how to spread the love around.”

Other clients in the mix brought new terrain for a character Borstein says she has known quite well over the previous three seasons. “It’s interesting to explore who she is without Midge” she says. “How does this character play opposite other people?”

Having a variety of scene partners was Borstein admits a new challenge for her. “As Rachel’s world opens so does mine. I have to learn how to perform against other people have to see if that timing is different with another actor. Amy [Sherman-Palladino] really started opening Susie up and seeing other sides to her and we get to meet some people from other parts of her life.”

With Susie running a bigger business the show also sees her learning how to be a better boss. “Learning how to delegate is an important skill and it’s very hard for her.

These 5 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks Can Help,"You could be earning money while you sleep. Need I say more?

Retirement doesn't necessarily have to wait until you are in your 60s; working becomes optional as soon as your passive income covers your living expenses.

Buying dividend stocks which make so much money that they give a chunk of their profits on a regular basis to shareholders can eventually build a waterfall of cash that can set you financially free.

So if you're looking to retire as soon as possible consider these ultra-high-yield dividend stocks with solid financials to support their hefty payouts.

1. AT&T: The telecom giant

Dividend yield: 5.7%

AT&T (T 0.53%) is one of only a few wireless carriers in the United States. Its network supports roughly 67.5 million customers who pay their monthly bills like clockwork because smartphones have become a vital part of everyday life for most of them. The company generates more than $160 billion in annual revenue and uses some of that to pay out a quarterly dividend of $0.278 per share that currently yields a whopping 5.7%.

You'll see in the above chart how AT&T recently reduced the dividend a result of AT&T's fresh spinoff of its entertainment assets to form Warner Bros. Discovery. The lower payout also lowers the dividend payout ratio to roughly 40% of free cash flow per management's estimates. That frees up some cash for AT&T to get its debt levels under control as well as giving it the wherewithal to continue raising the dividend going forward. This gives investors plenty of reason to expect those dividend checks to keep coming.

2. Altria: The tobacco king

Dividend yield: 7.9%

Altria Group (MO 0.83%) is the largest tobacco company in the United States. Its history goes back more than 100 years as owner of the best-selling Marlboro brand of cigarettes (at least in the U.S.). It's well known that fewer people are smoking than in previous generations. Still Altria has used its robust pricing power for decades to offset declining cigarette volumes with price increases. That continued profit allows it to consistently grow its dividend to the point where it qualifies as a Dividend King with 52 consecutive annual dividend increases.

Altria spun off its international business as Philip Morris International (the owner of the Marlboro brand outside the U.S.) in 2008 which you can see in the above chart. Still the company has done fine since then steadily growing its operating profits at a mid-single-digit pace over the past 10 years. Investors can enjoy a whopping 7.9% dividend yield covered by Altria's 78% dividend payout ratio.

3. Enbridge: An oil and gas pipeline stalwart

Dividend yield: 6.2%

Enbridge (ENB 0.44%) is one of the largest energy companies in North America. Its primary business is pipelines which carry oil and natural gas from Canada to the Gulf Coast. Pipelines are like toll operators on a highway; they get paid for the traffic or materials that pass through their pipes in Enbridge's case. This has made Enbridge more stable than most oil companies because it's not as dependent on oil and gas prices to profit.

Enbridge's business does nearly $40 billion in annual revenue and the company has paid and raised its dividend in each of the past 26 years. Investors can enjoy a 6.2% yield at the current share price; the payout consumes under 60% of Enbridge's distributable cash flow making the dividend (and its continued growth) sustainable.

4. AbbVie: Pharmaceutical leader

Dividend yield: 4%

AbbVie (ABBV -0.11%) is a pharmaceutical company that was born when it split from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. However you can see how quickly the business has grown in nearly a decade thanks to massive sales from its blockbuster drug Humira which generated more than $20 billion in 2021. Shareholders have enjoyed a 4% dividend yield while management has raised the payout by an average of 17% annually over the past five years.

AbbVie's exclusive rights to Humira in the U.S. expire next year which will likely cause revenue growth to slow as competitors flood the market. AbbVie has moved to develop and acquire assets that could help replace lost business. The dividend payout ratio is just 43% of cash flow so the dividend should be able to endure some short-term turbulence if there is any.

5. Realty Income: The monthly dividend company

Dividend yield: 4.5%

Realty Income (O -0.78%) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) a specific business structure that invests in real estate and shares its cash profits with shareholders as dividends. Realty Income specializes in retail properties; it's a net-lease REIT owning the building and charging its tenants for rent and letting the tenants handle the taxes insurance and maintenance.

Realty Income's tenants are businesses that tend to operate discount services making them recession-proof and reliable tenants. Realty Income's properties generate steady cash flow so much so that it pays shareholders a monthly dividend instead of the quarterly payout that's more common among U.S. companies. It even refers to itself as The Monthly Dividend Company. A Dividend Aristocrat with 28 years of consecutive annual dividend raises investors can take Realty Income's 4.5% yield to the bank.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Corporates are focused on attracting hiring and retaining this talent segment not only because inclusion is a milestone to be achieved but also because these diverse perspectives create more room for innovation and growth. Even so the LGBT+ community in India continues to face societal challenges including mindset barriers and cultural discrimination. Therefore driving sensitisation and creating an equal safe and open work environment is key.

We talk with the industry leaders on why tech companies are increasingly choosing to invest in diverse talent and what is the approach that they need to take to better understand and align policies to their needs.

Lakshmi C Managing Director and Lead – Human Resources Accenture in India

“At Accenture we strongly believe that diverse perspectives are powerful multipliers of innovation and growth. When people feel like they belong and are valued for their unique perspectives they bring their authentic selves to work and are able to grow and flourish.

Our commitment to creating an equal safe and open work environment for all our diverse groups including our LGBTQI+ people has enabled us to be deliberate about how we attract hire and grow them. We leverage strategic external partnerships Pride employment fairs and employee referrals to attract the right LGBTQI+ talent. Where there are skill gaps we invest through a six month long inclusive internship program to help them bridge these gaps.

For us Pride is about being open and committed to supporting each other in a psychologically safe environment. Our sensitization sessions are focused on helping all our people understand the nuances of gender expression and identity. We have a vibrant global ally network of 120000+ people for our LGBTQI+ people who are enabled through training and mentoring programs to become more informed and vocal Pride evangelists. We encourage our diverse people to share their stories and engage in open dialogue on issues that matter to them within safe spaces like our virtual Hues of the Rainbow platform and Employee Resource Groups.

We have been on a journey of inclusion for several years now and periodically review our policies and benefits so as to meet our people’s evolving needs and emerging market trends. For instance in 2016 Accenture was among the first companies in India to introduce medical cover for gender reassignment surgery for our people. In 2021 we modified our parental leave policies such as maternal paternal adoption and surrogacy to focus on the importance of caregiving versus gender binaries to support our LGBTQI+ people in their parenting journeys. Further our people can choose who they nominate as the beneficiary of their life insurance policy including their LGBTQI+ partners. Recently in 2022 we extended our medical insurance benefits to include facial reconstruction surgery for our transgender people and also made enhancements to ensure that the partners of our LGBTIQ+ people and their families are included.”

Sindhu Gangadharan SVP & MD SAP Labs India; Head SAP User Enablement

“At SAP Labs India we marked the Pride Month celebrations with a Pride Parade in support of our LGBTQIA+ colleagues and Allies on the campus on June 15 Wednesday. This is an annual tradition at SAP where we celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community and reflect on our unconscious biases and take corrective actions to become a better and more inclusive workplace. This year German Consul General Achim Burkart-led delegation joined us for the Pride March and extended support to the LGBTQIA+ community worldwide.

At SAP Labs India we believe it shouldn’t be a privilege for anyone to be their true selves at work or anywhere else. Central to our inclusion and diversity agenda is a bias-free hiring process that allows us to attract develop and retain the most talented and creative employees regardless of age gender sexual orientation gender identity and physical/mental abilities. Our hiring processes are agnostic of a candidate’s gender identity or sexual orientation and we’ve been making steady progress in hiring talent from the LGBTQIA+ community and providing them with the necessary support and resources to become the best version of themselves. For example we’ve introduced the “Ask Pride@SAP” tool to allow our LGBTQIA+ employees and allies to ask questions anonymously without coming out. Similarly we conduct regular LGBTQIA+ Inclusion sessions to help raise awareness of the community and also encourage the use of gender-neutral language at work. Some of the benefits offered to our LGBTQIA+ employees are medical coverage for same-sex partners which includes gender-reassignment surgeries family leave extension to same-sex partners and access to gender-neutral restrooms.”

Sankalp Saxena SVP & Managing Director India Operations Nutanix India

A diverse workforce and a culture that celebrates and supports diversity are proven to lead to a better innovation for businesses. This enhances productivity and brings in unique and distinct perspectives that spark creative thinking. Hence it is imperative for organizations to take a prudent approach toward driving inclusion in the workplace. Enterprises need to foster education and awareness on diversity equity and inclusion topics to create an unbiased work environment; this not only attracts more diverse talent but unleashes their full potential. Additionally companies should provide equal opportunities remuneration and benefits for all team members and there should not be any distinction based on one’s sexual orientation.

At Nutanix we strongly value our differences and believe that diverse backgrounds experiences and perspectives make us a more innovative and resilient team. Our goal remains to attract foster and retain a diverse workforce – we promote a culture where all employees can bring their unique experiences and backgrounds together to create a ground-breaking impact. We remain committed to growing awareness and driving inclusivity through educational opportunities unique recruiting opportunities and celebrations of representation throughout our community. Our program ‘Qutants’ (queer Nutanix employees and allies) is a global group that helps connect diverse employees rallying together all members regardless of location to provide professional connections and community worldwide. The group connects through social events group meetings and awareness campaigns where members are encouraged to be involved in giving back to local and global LGBTQ+ communities throughout the year.

Pranali Save CHRO Icertis

“Diversity equity and inclusion is an active and ongoing effort that builds strength and value within an organization and beyond. Thoughtful action that fosters a sense of belonging encourages people to share their diverse perspectives and experiences and drives innovation based on their unique contributions to the workplace is a positive way to create a safe space and celebrate all employees for all that they are. At Icertis we are committed to cultivating a fair open and respectful environment for our Icertians customers suppliers and partners. We build on the foundation of our FORTE values – Fairness Openness Respect Teamwork and Execution – to ensure that Icertians from all backgrounds feel empowered heard and fully supported. We bring this to life through initiatives such as conducting unconscious bias training for all executives and managers expanding our domestic partner definition for insurance benefits in India and improving healthcare access for current and future LGBT+ Icertians. In furtherance of our commitment to creating a culture of equality we recently joined the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative and pledged to advance diversity and inclusion at the workplace.”

Rachel Scheel Senior Vice President of Global Diversity Equity Inclusion and Sustainability.

Diversity brings strength creativity and purpose to an organisation and it should become the norm rather than a one-off initiative. The key first step is having an active and engaged Employee Resource Group for your LGBTQ+ employees and their allies. At Criteo our Pride Community has over 250 active members creating a safe place for LGBTQ+ talent to connect build networks and develop internal relationships with the community and members.

To better align policies to diverse talents needs next step is understanding and establishing a baseline of where a company’s culture is currently. Then the organization should create actions and goals that are tied to what is important to employees and opportunities to strengthen inclusion throughout the employee experience. Keep testing whether these practices are working and employees feel that they are authentic is more important. At Criteo we’ve been activating these initiatives through the direct feedback from our employee in our bi-annual Voices Survey.

To embrace heightened awareness of LGBTQ+ inclusion Criteo will launch a global eLearning on LGBTQ+ inclusion. We’ve also launched multiple activation programs including inviting speakers to share their experiences through our Pride Community introducing an Inclusive Language Guide for internal and external communications which ensures that the way we connect and communicate strengthens inclusion for all. Moreover we have been focused on introducing LGBTQ+ inclusive parental leave practices and family forming support (including financial support for adoption and legal services) that will contribute to a more equitable workplace where family and careers are encouraged to be more balanced.

Jharna Thammaiah K Director and India Site People & Places Leader Intuit

Intuit’s commitment to diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) is foundational to the company as we believe that innovation thrives in a workplace where people can bring their whole selves to work to do the best work of their lives! This is instrumental to our business and an essential component of our ability to execute on our mission to power prosperity for all.

Diverse perspectives backgrounds and opinions help us grow and innovate making DEI critical to the success of our business. The more diverse we are the better we can reflect our approximately 100 million customers build empathy and create products and services that solve their unique problems. From employee representation to ensuring our products are fair and inclusive to our impact on the communities around us DEI is a business imperative and fundamental to our corporate responsibility strategy.

We’re engaging employees throughout the company to listen learn and build capabilities that will enhance the employee experience and create an inclusive working environment. We also encourage leaders to role model in creating an inclusive and safe workplace for our talent.

To support our LGBTQ+ community our employee initiatives and benefits include the below:

World-class inclusive policies: Our teams demonstrated how well-equipped they are at making gender transition seamless for employees who chose to take this path. Intuit provides gender-affirmation surgery reimbursement which is over and above the regular insurance coverage. This is supplemented with hormone replacement therapy reimbursement

Health Care Coverage: To ensure the health and well-being of all our employees’ loved ones we offer Group Medical insurance coverage to same-sex partners of Intuit employees. Same-sex partners are also eligible for OPD dental and vision reimbursement and can receive annual health check-ups.

Gender-Neutral Washrooms: To make sure all employees feel comfortable and supported during their work hours we offer gender-neutral washrooms in all of our India offices.

Safe Space: Intuit provides counselling services to employees who either identify as LGBTQ+ or have loved ones who identify as LGBTQ+. We have ensured employees’ privacy and confidentiality so that employees can feel comfortable having candid conversations with a trained supportive professional.

Practicing diversity equity and inclusion at an org-wide level: We have a range of development resources called ‘Leading inclusively’ to help grow and improve the craft of being an inclusive leader. Additionally through efforts such as ‘The annual Trans Summit’ we continue our mission towards building a foundation of change for employees in and outside of Intuit who identify as transgender or non-binary

Pride Network: We understand that there is a long way to go and while we provide employee benefits we also leverage employee resource groups who help build community and allyship while also providing opportunities for employees to share their diverse perspectives which influence leaders in defining the workplace of the future and support in creating a diverse and inclusive work environment while also making impact externally

Ally training: To truly champion DEI there must be several layers of awareness and evangelism that has to take place. We encourage our employees to take up Ally training to understand how they can practice allyship enhance the work environment and speak up in their own communities and social circles.

The introduction of some of these policies and initiatives helps enhance the benefits we offer to our diverse workforce. In addition to this what also matters is what each of us do every day to create a culture and work environment which is inclusive and safe. With more awareness training accountability and role modelling the sense of belonging in our workforce has really amplified and many people have felt comfortable to come out at work. While there is still much more work to be done in our efforts to foster a safe and inclusive workplace it is a multi-year journey that we want to continue investing in while also celebrating our minor milestones along the way which only helps to raise awareness.

Ruchi Bhalla Country Head – India Delivery Centers and Vice President Human Resources (Asia Pacific) at Pitney Bowes

“In today’s world having an inclusive workplace that protects employees from discrimination is not just the right thing to do – but is also the best business decision. People are always skeptical of things they are not aware of or uncomfortable with. Queerphobia is not a new phenomenon or unique to India it exists everywhere and is many times unconscious because of lack of information and conditioning. As organizations it is our job to give all our employees regardless of their age gender sexual orientation caste religion – an inclusive biasfree and safe work environment that allows them to be themselves.

Educating employees about the LGBTQ+ community to create awareness about our own biases is the first step. Starting from basics such as setting-up gender-neutral restrooms making all policies gender inclusive to creating a community of role models and training leaders to communicate with empathy. At Pitney Bowes our efforts towards the LGBTQ+ community align with our core values and our deep-rooted commitment to diversity. We strive to create an environment where employees can be their authentic selves can learn and grow and can help Pitney Bowes be the best it can be.

Over the past few years Pitney Bowes India has launched several programs such as Blind Applications for candidates applying for roles allowing them to omit their first or last name and details such as gender from applications. Last year we updated our Parental Policy to include 26 weeks paid parental leave for same sex or adopting parents and those who become parents through surrogacy. Our Global Inclusion Network PBPRIDE works towards generating awareness around LGBTQ+ matters through meaningful dialogue support and action. We also run specialized training for managers to highlight bias and include LGBTQ+ sensitive language to make all employees feel welcomed and an equal part of the organization.”

Anjali Byce CHRO STL

“In a workplace with a diverse range of genders ethnicities nationalities sexual orientations and identities it’s critical that we make everyone feel included belonged and supported to unlock their potential and build fulfilling careers. To this effect Pride Month is a very important month where we celebrate and honour this inclusivity. The LBGTQ+ community is a large demographic which is talent rich. Building diverse teams results in a true representation of the society we operate in. The natural by-product is multiple perspectives creative solutions and new ways of problem-solving; which in turn results in creating an innovative efficient effective and customer-centric organisation.

Our constant effort is to inspire nurture and promote our talent by inculcating an inclusive workplace. We believe that at the core of an efficient and happy workforce lies a relationship of trust between employees and their employers- one in which individuals feel heard and cared for without gender biases. We encourage everyone to bring their whole selves to work in an environment where no one is judged and there are equal opportunities for all. At STL for example among the number of virtual activities across our global offices we are hosting a fireside talk to sensitize employees create awareness of the unconscious and implicit bias and build a psychologically safe work environment. Dr Kanan Khatau Psychologist and Emotional Safety Evangelist (TEDx Speaker) will do an interactive and participative interview with Abhina Aher Transgender Activist India (TEDx Speaker).

We strongly believe that true support for the community is more than just a rainbow-hued post on social media. As a part of our people-focused initiatives and culture of CARE we have built a strong ‘listening’ organization. This enables us to create policies that are as global as possible but equally tailored to special needs. At STL for example we are an equal opportunity employer- Our leave policies support surrogacy IVF and adoption; we empower our employees globally through DEI initiatives and provide avenues for better understanding accepting and co-existing with the vibrant LGBT community and also creating a psychologically safe workspace.”

Lynette D’silva Head of Regional HR- India & APAC Amdocs

“LGBTQI+ in organisations is a journey of progressive realisation and adoption and not an overnight change. With a diverse workforce establishing an inclusive mindset of leaders is key to create the right culture in the organization. It is crucial that organisations understand that being recognized identified and respected for who they are is what employees expect from their employers & co-workers. While policy changes are important organisations need to work towards bringing a change in attitudes of existing employees with LGBTQI+ awareness & sensitivity trainings. When employees bring their authentic selves to work it helps to create a safe space for all to contribute and thrive.

Amdocs is a people-centric organization. Our commitment to enrich lives and progress society starts with us which is why we have made it a priority to invest in our employees’ development in innovative and personalized ways.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzLzU1NTMvbWljaGFlbC13aWxsaW5nLWxlYWRzLWFjY2VudHVyZXMtbmF0aW9uYWwtc2VjdXJpdHktcHJhY3RpY2XSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdWx0YW5jeS5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9hbXAvNTU1My9taWNoYWVsLXdpbGxpbmctbGVhZHMtYWNjZW50dXJlcy1uYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS1wcmFjdGljZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Willing leads Accenture’s National Security practice,"Profile Accenture

Accenture has hired New South Wales Police deputy commissioner Michael Willing to lead its National Security practice.

Willing spent more than three decades working in the NSW police force growing the ranks to hold several senior roles during this period.

Commenting on his move Willing said “I am delighted to join Accenture to help public sector clients navigate the increasingly complex threat landscape to build cyber resilience and to grow and reinvent with confidence. I look forward to leading the practice and protecting the security of our nation particularly across organisation boundaries of intelligence policing and borders.”

Prior to serving as deputy commissioner Willing was the assistant commissioner-commander of the metropolitan region assistant commissioner-commander of the Counterterrorism and Special Tactics Command and bushfire disaster and detective superintendent-commander for the homicide squad for around six years.

“Michael’s experience positions him well to work with Accenture’s clients in the public sector as they address their security challenges” said John Vidas a Senior Managing Director at Accenture.

Accenture’s recently launched its National Security practice in order to provide a multidisciplinary security offering to public sector intelligence public safety and border protection organisations. The practice leans heavily on Accenture’s technology expertise (cloud AI biometrics etc) but also brings in capabilities in the area of organisation governance and (international) cooperation.

“Security remains one of the most important priorities of our government clients with threats increasing and evolving rapidly. The National Security practice will help governments to be more secure resilient and innovative across a range of capabilities – from technology to human performance” said Willing.

Willing’s move comes in the footsteps of two other senior Police figures who recently crossed to the consulting industry. In March former NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller joined PwC and last year former Australian Federal Police commissioner Andrew Colvin joined Deloitte.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2FobWVkYWJhZC9ndWphcmF0LWl0LWl0LWVuYWJsZWQtc2VydmljZXMtcG9saWN5LWx1cmVzLXNlY3Rvci1iaWdnaWVzL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkyMjkxNTIwLmNtc9IBigFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2FobWVkYWJhZC9ndWphcmF0LWl0LWl0LWVuYWJsZWQtc2VydmljZXMtcG9saWN5LWx1cmVzLXNlY3Rvci1iaWdnaWVzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjI5MTUyMC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gujarat IT-IT enabled services policy lures sector biggies,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='timesofindia.indiatimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Selvan who had joined TCS as an assistant engineer was sacked from service in 2015 as part of an alleged mass retrenchment.

Selvan had approached the court seeking continuity of service but the TCS representative (legal) had informed the court that the petitioner didn’t fall under the category of ‘workman’.

The legal representative of the company also said that he was in a managerial capacity and that he was discharged from service due to poor performance.

The Forum for IT Employees (FITE) an organisation working for the welfare and rights of the employees supported him in his legal ordeals. Selvam told mediapersons that he had to visit the court more than 100 times.

The FITE is run by a collective of IT professionals from different IT companies in the country including Wipro TCS Infosys Accenture HCL and other major players in this field.

FITE said in a tweet “Justice anywhere is hope and a reminder to all those who are forcing employees to resign. Great work done by FITE Chennai and salute to the TCS employee who fought for justice.”"

When it was built along the Mission Chanel/Zanja there were no citrus groves and there were few other settlers in the area.

The home which is on the California Register of Historical Places now has plenty of neighbors with more houses poised to be built.

The adobe sits fenced off and boarded up its roof covered in plastic sheeting and one wall shored up with timbers.

In 2020 the city sold it and 71 acres of land to a developer with the caveat that the structure be saved.

The City Council on Tuesday June 14 debated whether $370000 should be used to fix up an aging structure which the city does not own. The money would also be used to buy a piece of land next to it that a nonprofit interested in managing the home says is needed to make it a viable educational destination.

A decision was pushed back to the June 28 meeting.

Mayor Phill Dupper said at the meeting he thought nonprofit Two Canyons Conservancy and developer Highpointe Communities should be negotiating with each other and leaving the city which is not swimming in money out of it.

“If you look at our fiduciary responsibility to the residents of this city we’re basically asking the residents of this city to foot regardless of how you move the money around $370000 so that conservancy can get the Frink adobe” Dupper said. “That’s basically using city money to preserve the adobe.”

The property was valued at more than $15 million when it was sold to Highpointe for $1.5 million but the developer was also required to spend $13.8 million to make “community benefitting improvements.”

The city had listed those improvements as in order of importance a community center for $3.95 million a fire station for $2.98 million a park for $6.09 million and an oak woodland preserve for $733000.

Before the council Tuesday was an option to insert adobe upgrades in that list before the oak woodland.

Councilman Bhavin Jindal worried what that would mean for the old oak trees in the area the city wanted to preserve.

City Manager T. Jarb Thaipejr told the council if the money ran out before the preserve was constructed the city could do it itself with developer impact fees for parks.

The money that could be set aside for the adobe includes $87920 for a re-roof and structural reinforcement $20135 for arborist/tree replacement; and $261308 for the additional lot.

The adobe would be a great place to teach about the lives of some of the earliest American settlers in the San Bernardino Valley and of the earliest days of the Inland area’s citrus industry said Joe Frink a Two Canyons Conservancy board member whose family built the structure.

The extra parcel would be used as a parking lot so school buses would have a place to park onsite.

Frink has been working to preserve the home for decades.

It needs a new roof and the southeast side needs a lot of work.

“That wall is tilting a little and it’s sunken a little” Frink said over the phone. “It was an old flood plain at one time so it’s probably the result of that. So that needs to be lifted and pushed in a tad not too far hopefully.”

Once stabilized it will need the plaster to be removed and whitewash or some such to be added to protect the mud bricks. Any additions that were added on over the years might also need to be removed.

Five generations of Frink’s family had lived in the house until Joe Frink’s father sold it to a private party in 1964.

Historian Jim Shipp president of the Loma Linda Area Parks and Historical Society said there is some debate as to whether the adobe or the Van Lueven house both completed in 1874 is the oldest standing building in the city but that doesn’t make it any less important.

“It is at the Frink adobe where there are still living some of the first orange trees planted in the Inland Empire” Shipp said. “… (Horace Frink) could well be called the father of the Inland Empire’s citrus industry.”

Horace Monroe Frink who built the adobe came to the area with Mormons and lived at a San Timoteo Canyon ranch with his brother beginning in 1853.

Horace and his brother made a name freighting and in “hauled silver which was today the equivalent of an armored car service” Shipp said over the phone.

Horace Frink bought 120 acres on Mission Road and began to build the adobe in 1871. He died at the age of 43 before it was completed but his sons took over and finished the home.

“The Frinks were one of the very first American families to settle along Mission Road” Shipp said “and there’s just really nothing left of that community except for the Van Leuven mansion on Mountain View and the Frink adobe.”

Thaipejr the city manager told the council the developer just wants to finish the agreement on the improvements and move forward so they can build houses.

The proposal to build 103 condos and 51 single-family homes off Mission Road could be before the Planning Commission on July 6 and the City Council on July 12.

Funding for adobe improvements is expected to be before the council again Tuesday June 28. Council meetings are held at 7 p.m. in the City Council Chamber 25541 Barton Road Loma Linda. Members of the public are allowed three minutes each to speak. Contact information for councilmembers is available at lomalinda-ca.gov/our_city/board__city_council/city_council.

EDITOR’S NOTE: A previous version of this story included incorrect information about the sale of the adobe. It was sold to a private party in 1964.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb3ZpZGVvY29hbGl0aW9uLmNvbS9pdHMtbm93LXBvc3NpYmxlLXRvLWVkaXQtdmlkZW8taW4tYWRvYmUtbGlnaHRyb29tL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb3ZpZGVvY29hbGl0aW9uLmNvbS9pdHMtbm93LXBvc3NpYmxlLXRvLWVkaXQtdmlkZW8taW4tYWRvYmUtbGlnaHRyb29tL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It’s now possible to edit video in Adobe Lightroom by Jose Antunes - ProVideo Coalition,"Yes it’s true. Now you can edit video in Adobe Lightroom. The new features have been announced this month and are part of the June 2022 photography releases.

Now longer do photographers need to move to another app to edit video. Adobe Lightroom and Lightroom Classic now offer – much more – video support on different platforms for Premium users..

Adobe Lightroom has for a while now – 2015 - offered options to open play and index video files along with the photos it was designed to edit a feature that made sense as so many photographers also shoot video. Now tough Adobe announces that Lightroom take a step forward and it’s a huge step although the photo editor will not compete with Adobe’s NLE Premiere.

Still for those who shoot both photos and video and want to be able to do some light editing in Lightroom… well the good news is that the update is coming and will forever change things for the better. Yes now the Adobe team can say that Lightroom finally supports video. For those afraid that the interface will change and that they will have to learn a whole new workflow the good news is that the same edit controls that you already use to make your photography shine can now be used with your videos as well!

A new Preset Amount slider

It does not end there though! According to Adobe “not only can you use Lightroom’s editing capabilities to make your video clips look their best you can also copy and paste edit settings between photos and videos allowing you to achieve a consistent aesthetic across both your photos and videos. Presets including Premium Presets and Lightroom’s AI-powered Recommended Presets can also be used with videos. Lightroom also allows you to trim off the beginning or end of a video clip to highlight the part of the video that is most important.”

Tristan Zhou Lightroom Ambassador was one of the first to react saying “I absolutely love the new video feature. Since I produce both video and photo content this new feature allows me to do everything in one app instead of jumping back and forth from different apps and software. Such a game changer!”

Lightroom Presets are also getting some love and powerful all new preset features include a Preset Amount slider AI-Powered Adaptive Presets and new Premium Preset packs. The Preset Amount Slider will appear in all versions (ACR Lightroom Classic Lightroom Mac/Win iOS Android Web) meaning you are now able to adjust the intensity of presets that you apply to your photos and videos. Do you wish that the preset was just a little stronger? Or a little more subtle? Now you can easily adjust any preset to your liking.

It’s also for smartphones

Again Adobe requested a photographer to express his opinion and Piyatat Primtongtrakul Lightroom Ambassador said “I love the preset amount slider! This is what I have been waiting for as I do a lot of batch editing this preset slider really helps me save a lot of time for post processing.”

Adaptive Presets are also included in versions for ACR Lightroom Classic Lightroom Mac/Win. Adobe says that “Adaptive presets are an entirely new class of presets. Building on the powerfully advanced Artificial Intelligence capabilities of the Select Sky and Select Subject masks it’s now possible to apply presets which automatically target a particular part of the photo. Our first two sets of Adaptive Presets include presets for making skies dramatic and for making the subject of your photo really pop. These presets allow you to access the power of AI masking with the ease of a single click.”

So video editing is now in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom and it extends to smartphones so both iOS and Android users can explore the same options as those using the computer versions. Trim and edit video clips using your favorite sliders and presets — and give your photos and videos a cohesive look and feel. While others promised to offer photographers a video editing app – and have failed to do so – Adobe has taken a different path and added some of the functionality of a NLE into its popular photo editing tool. It’s an interesting development that may open new horizons for a tool that has now been around since February 2007 that’s 15 years ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Fkb2JlLXBob3Rvc2hvcC13ZWItZnJlZS1mcmVlbWl1bS1wbGFucy03OTc4MDQ2L9IBd2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Fkb2JlLXBob3Rvc2hvcC13ZWItZnJlZS1mcmVlbWl1bS1wbGFucy03OTc4MDQ2L2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe plans to introduce freemium version of Photoshop on the web,"Adobe is reportedly testing a free online version of Photoshop and plans to open up the service to everyone aiming to introduce more users to the industry-standard application. According to The Verge the company is currently testing a “freemium” version of the same in Canada where users can access Photoshop on their browser using a free Adobe account. It eventually plans to remove some features and offer them exclusively to paying subscribers. But even then enough tools will be available for users to perform what Adobe considers to be core Photoshop functions.

The first web version of Photoshop was released in October last year. It was a simplified version of the desktop app that could be used to handle basic edits; this included layers and some core editing tools. But this came nowhere close to the extremely feature-rich and versatile tool that the Adobe Photoshop desktop app is. Instead the company positioned it as a collaboration tool where artists could share images with others and collaborators could leave annotations and small tweaks before handing it over to the artist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9pbnRlbC1jb3JlLWkzLTEyMTAwLTEyMTAwZi1yZXZpZXcvNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i3-12100 Review: The Little Gaming Giant,"Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.

Core i3-12100 Application Benchmarks — The TLDR

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

We can boil down productivity application performance into two broad categories: single- and multi-threaded. These slides show the geometric mean of performance in several of our most important tests in each category but be sure to look at the expanded benchmark results further below.



The Core i3-12100 is surprisingly agile in our cumulative measure of single-threaded performance. The 12100 is 27% and 5% faster than the Core i5-10100 and i5-11600K respectively but the 12400 leads by roughly 2%.



Compared to Ryzen the 12100 dominates in single-threaded applications with its lead stretching between 25% over the Ryzen 5 3600 to 11% over the Ryzen 5 5600G.

Overall the Core i3-12100 offers great performance in single-threaded workloads for its price point but if you're looking for the closest thing to a ""catch"" you'll find it in threaded application workloads.

In multi-threaded work the Core i3-12100 continues to assert its dominance over comparably-priced chips with an 18% lead over the Ryzen 3 3300X and a 30% lead over the Core i3-10100. However the 124100 isn't as impressive in multi-threaded work against the six-core chips as we saw in our gaming benchmarks. The Ryzen 5 3600 and 3600X lead by ~11% while the 5600G leads by 19%.

Those six-core chips obviously lead in threaded productivity applications they do carry much higher price tags after all but they pale in comparison to the Core i5-12400 as it takes a 32% lead over the 12100. Unfortunately unlocking the power limits and tuning the memory didn't yield any performance increases in threaded work for either the 12100 or 12400.

Overall the Core i3-12100 offers a solid blend of performance in both single- and multi-threaded apps given its price point but its single-threaded performance stands out as exceptional. You'll have to look to Intel's own Alder Lake family for faster single-threaded performance. The 12100 also dispatches the comparably-priced Ryzen 3 3300X and Core i3-10100 easily in threaded work.

The Core i3-12100 is impressive in single-threaded rendering work leading all competing Ryzen chips in both Cinebench and POV-Ray benchmarks including those that cost more than twice the price.



The 12100 also easily beats AMD's price-comparable Ryzen 3 3300X throughout the full gamut of threaded rendering benchmarks and shows massive gains over the Core i3-10100. The six-core Ryzen models take the lead in the threaded workloads over the quad-core Core i3-12100 but that isn't a fair comparison because they are in a much higher price class.

The ubiquitous web browser is one of the most frequently used applications. These tests tend to be lightly threaded so a snappy response time is critical. The Core i3-12100 beats the competing Ryzen processors in its price bracket easily.

We've integrated the UL Benchmarks Procyon tests into our suite to replace the aging PCMark 10. This new benchmark runs complex Adobe Premiere Pro Photoshop and Lightroom workflows with the actual software making for a great real-world test suite.

The Core i3-12100 is incredibly impressive as it takes the lead over all the Ryzen chips in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop and trails only the vastly more expensive $299 Ryzen 5 5600X in Adobe Premiere Pro.

Commonly found in woodlands grasslands and hedgerows the small pointy-nosed animal was found to excrete venom through salivary glands.

Previously it was thought that Poland’s only venomous mammals were the northern short-tailed shrew and the Eurasian water shrew.

Publishing their findings in Zoological Letters scientists from the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń and Poznan’s Adam Mickiewicz University said” “It is likely that venom production among shrews and other eulipotyphlans may be more widespread than it has previously been assumed.”

Collecting extracts from salivary glands of the Eurasian water shrew and the common shrew to test the effect of venom on the red blood cells (erythrocytes) of Pelophylax sp. frogs the researchers found that the common shrew caused a strong haemolysis i.e. the transition of haemoglobin to plasma as a result of the destruction of erythrocytes.

Thanks to their venom which allows them to hunt for larger prey (for example small frogs young mice and even other shrews) it is easier for the common shrew to avoid death from hunger.

Weighing between 5 to 15 grams the common shrew feeds around the clock eating almost as much as it weighs. If it can't eat it dies within 10 hours.

The first suggestions that common shrews could be venomous appeared in the literature around 400 years ago (Topsell RE. Historie of Foure-footed Beasts. London: Jaggard; 1607) but later researchers considered them unfounded.

Per Reuters  software Jung Ki-young spent 430000 won (about $330) to design and order a headstone for the web browser ahead of its official end-of-support date. The memorial located on the roof of his brother’s cafe in the South Korean city of Gyeongju features IE’s iconic logo followed by an English epitaph that reads “He was a good tool to download other browsers.”

Jung told Reuters he commissioned the memorial to commemorate a program that had defined his career. Even as apps like Chrome and Firefox went on to replace Internet Explorer in both prominence and popularity many of Jung’s customers kept asking him to ensure their websites looked good in Microsoft’s aging web browser. ""It was a pain in the ass but I would call it a love-hate relationship because Explorer itself once dominated an era” he said.

As funny as the tombstone is it may be premature. Microsoft still plans to support Internet Explorer in some contexts. For instance Edge’s IE Mode will continue to work through 2029 or later.

Investors who seek a quick path to wealth will often fail. Speculators risk reacting too emotionally if a stock drops while they watch its movements like a hawk. Conversely investors who search for stocks to buy and hold for the very long term will have more patience.

Taking the time to research a company’s prospects will lead to better returns. Look for companies that build a strong business plan to carry through over several years. The realistic ones will explain the near-term risks too.

Chosen across several sectors these seven stocks to buy will make you rich by 2030 if management grows revenues at current rates:

Applied Materials Coinbase Global Intel Altria Group Novartis Pfizer StoneCo

Quality value and growth scores vary among the selected stocks.

As shown above all of the companies have a strong quality score. Only the growth and valuation scores vary. For example Intel and Applied Materials are semiconductor companies with vastly different near-term prospects. Meanwhile Altria has the lowest overall scores but the highest dividend yield. StoneCo is trading far below its 52-week high creating a rare entry point for investors. If you are a new investor you should consider to visit a comparison site for the stock market such as InvestoRunner.com before purchasing stocks from this list.

Stocks to Buy: Applied Materials

Applied Materials pays a modest quarterly dividend of 24 cents. Its leadership in the semiconductor capital equipment sector will reward shareholders.

The company has diversified into the advanced display-manufacturing segment. Also it is in a strong position to grow in the advanced packaging market.

AMAT accelerated its growth after embracing 3D NAND production in 2014. With the chip shortage fueling unfilled sales AMAT’s wafer fabbrication equipment (WFE business will outgrow the semiconductor industry.

The digital transformation of the global economy is a big catalyst for AMAT stock. Large companies need to invest more to compete and will need Applied Materials’ products to survive.

In the near term its dynamic random access memory (DRAM tech will perform well. The company will benefit from stronger sales in the second half of the year compared to the first.

Applied Materials’ NAND products which are used in storage saw weaker sales than its DRAM offerings. Still demand next year and beyond for NAND is healthy.

Coinbase Global

Cryptocurrency platform Coinbase will attract a considerable number of customers in the coming decade. Despite rare moments of user dissatisfaction the site genuinely wants to teach the public about cryptocurrency investing. To address the former issue Coinbase acquired Agara an Indian artificial intelligence startup to expand and automate customer service capabilities.

Coinbase has a good problem: it has too much customer growth. It cannot handle the influx and needs to strengthen support levels. As customers deposit more assets and complete more transactions Coinbase’s revenue will grow.

On Oct. 19 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB picked the platform to power crypto custody for Novi its digital wallet. In this pilot study users can acquire Pax Dollar (CCC:USDP-USD and Novi will hold it on deposit with Coinbase Custody. If requested Novi users may transfer USDP between each other in an instant.

Facebook is a social networking giant. Getting its support will convince customers to join Coinbase rather than its competitors.

Wall Street analysts think COIN stock trades with minimal upside ahead. Coinbase may disprove them. As revenue grows over the next decade the stock will reward its shareholders.

Stocks to Buy: Intel

Intel is suffering from low growth as it loses its foothold in the desktop and server markets. However that is changing quickly. Rallying ahead of its quarterly earnings report and then slumping as it always does Intel is a value stock.

The giant lost its way when rivals found growth in mobile processor development. Then Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD took Intel’s desktop market through its Ryzen processor product line. AMD’s Epyc also outperforms Intel’s comparable chip line Xeon.

But Intel’s refreshed 12th generation Alder Lake processor shows promise. Tech review sites are posting very high ratings. Intel’s architecture for Alder Lake is creative featuring a hybrid core design that provides efficiency and solid performance. Its P-cores clock up to 5.2 gigahertz (GHz while its E-cores run at a maximum of 3.9 GHz.

The company needs to solidify support for the new chip and developments of its graphics card. To ensure this CEO Pat Gelsinger noted Intel will communicate better with “a developer-first approach.”

Altria Group (MO)

In the third quarter Altria posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.22. Revenue fell by 2.6% year-over-year (YOY to $5.53 billion.

Markets did not appreciate the company raising the lower end of its full-year 2021 guidance. It expects EPS in the range of $4.58 to $4.62.

The 5% to 6% EPS growth over 2020 does not show an obvious path to wealth by 2030. Yet the dividend of 90 cents per quarter is after a 5% hike. Expect Altria’s strong cash flow to allow management to raise dividends regularly.

Some investors view tobacco as an unattractive investment. But people who smoke still need to buy the company’s products. Plus Altria has a discount segment that is growing. It is careful not to gouge price-sensitive customers especially its premium brands.

Altria is embracing e-vapor an alternative to tobacco that is expected to grow in popularity over the next decade. It estimated the total category volume of these products increased 17% from last year. If the future improves for this segment Altria’s stock will rise and reward investors.

Stocks to Buy: Novartis

In the third quarter Novartis posted sales growing by 6% from last year to $13 billion. For 2021 expectations of net sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentages will not impress investors seeking wealth. Still its Cosentyx and Entresto drugs will add billions in revenue.

Cosentyx is a monoclonal antibody that treats psoriasis ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Peak sales could reach $7 billion for the drug. Meanwhile Entresto is a blood pressure medication that could bring in $5 billion in revenue.

NVS stock is on sale because the company faces pressure in its near-term top-line growth. The lowered expectations hurt the share price creating a better price for value investors.

Eventually Novartis will post positive developments for products like its CAR-T cancer therapy. Investors do not yet now when Novartis will post such great news but when it does the stock will climb abruptly. Instead of timing those events investors should look at the stock now while the market ignores it.

Pfizer

After peaking at more than $50 this summer Pfizer descended for no reason. Then investors bid shares higher by 10% early in November when it announced results for its antiviral Covid pill Paxlovid.

Besides its generous revenue split with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX for sales of the Covid vaccine (it expects at least $65 billion in 2022 the Covid pill shows promise. If taken within three days of symptom onset Paxlovid reduced hospitalization by 89% compared to a placebo.

While lockdowns and business closures have ended in many places the pandemic is not yet over. Even after the worst of it passes the virus will linger in communities for at least the next few years.

If approved Pfizer’s pill gives hospitals and doctors another weapon to fight the virus. CEO Albert Bourla said the study news “is a real game-changer in the global efforts to halt the devastation of this pandemic.”

Pfizer may realize billions in revenue within the next few months. More countries will approve Paxlovid increasing both the addressable market and revenue for Pfizer.

Stocks to Buy: StoneCo

After topping $95 StoneCo fell steadily in 2021. The leading provider of financial technology solutions in Brazil posted an 8.1% YOY decline in revenue.

StoneCo also posted a Q2 2021 loss. Despite a total payment volume of 60.4 billion Brazilian Reals up 58.6% YOY the company faces technology challenges. In the short term its new registry system has experienced technical delays. It also suspended Take Rate which hurt its adjusted net margin outlook for the year.

The uncertainty spooked investors sending the stock to lows. Cautious investors may build a position from here but risk further downside ahead.

Looking beyond the quarter StoneCo is of great importance to the merchant community in Brazil. The company will keep winning market share in the small and midsized business space. StoneCo is accustomed to the competition and will manage new products to sustain growth.

The 35% of clients that are not paying interest is a short-term headwind. Non-performing loans are also on the rise. In its Q2 earnings call company executives stated that under the new regulatory framework it would increase its reserves. Customers will repay their loans as cash flow recovers and from there its income will bounce back.

J.Lo was wearing a long white dress in eyelet fabric with a flounce around the neckline that fluttered over her shoulders.

Over her dress she briefly wore a loose knit beige cardigan that draped past her knees. She had her hair up in a soft bun with pieces of honey blonde hair framing her face. Under her dress peeked a pair of straw espadrilles matching the tone of her cardigan. For accessories J.Lo had on a pair of hoop earrings in gold and of course her engagement ring.

Lopez was accompanied by her 14-year-old daughter Emme one of her twins she shares with ex-husband Marc Anthony. Emme was wearing loose brown cargo pants over a pair of black and white Jordans and a long sleeved black t-shirt. Affleck briefly threw his arm over Emme's shoulders as well. The couple have been making an effort to blend their two families. Affleck has three children with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner.

In a recent appearance on Good Morning America Lopez said how important it was to her to be able to depend on Affleck to commit to them merging into a larger unit.

“I love my career but nothing is more fulfilling to me than being able to build my family with someone who I love deeply and is just as dedicated to family and to each other as we can be” she explained. “I love the idea of the future and what we can create but I really want to savor the moment.”

The Vermont cabin that Lauren and Chris purchased in 2017 for $235000 was supposed to be a vacation home that they occasionally rented on Airbnb to help cover the mortgage.

The Connecticut couple expected to rent it out a few weekends a month and maybe break even — or in the worst case sell it if their aspirations didn't pan out. Instead the property was so successful on Airbnb that the couple had to start blocking off weekends for themselves on the rental calendar.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

It set them on a new career path: creating a New England Airbnb empire that has grown to include 15 properties six they own and nine they manage for clients of the property management and marketing firm they founded.

They didn't anticipate how lucrative short-term rentals could be. At the closing table for the cabin in August 2017 both the seller's agent and their own said the couple could expect to make $15000 in vacation-rental income yearly. In the first year they brought in more than their carrying costs of $2000 a month. In 2018 they brought in $62000 in revenue. In 2021 that figure had nearly doubled to $115000.

""The house could have paid for itself by a year and a half"" Lauren said.

The company's success has allowed both Chris a former CPO for a midsize consumer-credit union and Lauren once a creative director for a global market-research firm to leave their day jobs to work on their Airbnb hustle full time.

""One of our original goals was to employ ourselves. We were really really sick of corporate"" Lauren said. ""I left in March of this year and I will never go back.""

The couple who asked not to use their last names for privacy reasons broke down how they pulled it off.

It started with the search for a vacation home

Lauren 40 had just returned from living on the West Coast in 2016 when she and Chris 39 decided to purchase a weekend home from what Lauren called their life of ""endless lawns"" and ""endless traffic"" in a Connecticut town about 20 miles from New Haven.

""It was kind of a sanity project for me. I was really missing that connection to nature and getting some peace and quiet"" she said.

It was also Lauren's West Coast inclinations that drew them to the property a shock of contemporary architecture that's more Joshua Tree than a cabin nestled in the the woods of southern Vermont.

The property was at the top of their budget at $235000 but its uniqueness convinced them it was a sound investment. The couple was so convinced they liquidated part of their 401(k) to make the $30000 down payment.

Lauren and Chris expected to rent the house on Airbnb for about $300 a night here and there to help cover their $2000 a month carrying costs which included their mortgage payment and maintenance. The house is a 30-minute drive to Stratton Mountain and three hours from Boston. At the very least they thought they'd attract a few winter-sports enthusiasts.

""Airbnb really didn't exist in Vermont in 2017 believe it or not. It was very very very limited"" Lauren said. But the couple decided to give it a shot.

""But as soon as we listed it we were kind of blown away with how much demand there was for it"" she said. ""It was continually booked. We were not finding enough time for ourselves.""

The house now rents for about $442 a night.

'We keep the cash flow going toward expansion'

The demand shocked them into purchasing a second property (and then a third and so on).

Lauren and Chris decided to purchase and rent out a tiny house because it reminded them of experiences on the West Coast.

They purchased the self-contained property a fully furnished floor model from Tiny House Marketplace. It cost $67000 and they financed 100% of the cost minus taxes with a commercial-vehicle loan.

""We've found the more that we talk to people in the industry it's best to pay up as little cash as possible"" Lauren said.

It's situated on a piece of land near the initial cabin that they rent for around $700 a month.

""We keep the cash flow going toward expansion"" Chris said.

And continue to expand they did. The idea to launch a vacation-property marketing and management firm took off with their third purchase in February 2020 a $130000 A-frame in a nearby town.

Over the three previous years the duo had noticed an appetite for properties sold as a self-contained business so after funneling $20000 into upgrading the A-frame Chris listed it for sale as a vacation rental with marketing assets for $330000.

It took a month for the property to find an off-market buyer who ""has become our best and most trusted partner"" in expanding the properties they manage under the collective Lauren said.

The couple now brings in over $100000 in gross bookings a month on the 15 properties it manages. For the nine out of 15 that are client-owned the couple collects 20% for their services in a revenue-sharing model.

They also consult on projects that other aspiring Airbnb entrepreneurs are seeking to launch including scouting unique properties outfitting them with on-trend interiors and creating branding materials.

The Airbnb life does have challenges

Lauren and Chris now face new challenges brought on by the pandemic and perhaps their own success. Home prices are up and the competition for the few houses that are on the market has become more fierce with all-cash buyers often favored over those who rely on financing.

The couple's business thrived as they attained unique properties at lower price points once consistent with the area. Lauren said the pandemic has changed the market in the areas where they operate not only as more travelers seek the kinds of Instagram-friendly accommodations they offer but also as competitors notice their success and want to get into the business.

""It's harder to do this now"" Lauren said. ""The real-estate market is brutal. A lot of people want to do what we've done.""

Competition from other short-term-rental owners isn't the only hurdle. For-sale properties just aren't as plentiful as they once were. ""We have tried to expand as quickly as possible as real estate becomes more scarce. Land is also hard to get now. Land used to sit for years and now it's a week"" Lauren said.

It's become more challenging for the duo to find and invest in the unique properties that are their hallmark and that generate the kinds of returns they saw early in their operation.

""We wouldn't have the same returns if we were lucky enough to beat out the 25 other investors on the modern house if we bought it today"" Lauren said.

All of the properties Lauren and Chris own are financed meaning they're making monthly payments on them. But to compete in the market now they said you need to come with a cash offer.

The business also incurs operating expenses for maintenance and landscaping.

""Let's say you own a property in New Jersey or New York — owning a property in Vermont is completely different. You've never had to deal with septic and well and rural storms and roads that are being washed out"" Lauren said. ""It's a whole new level of upkeeping a property in areas like these.""

They're not in it for the long haul

In October 2021 the couple opened a pet-friendly vacation enclave of two tiny houses in another Vermont town that rent for between $175 and $250 a night.

It is in Lauren's words the hardest project they've worked on to date — but also one of the most rewarding.

It's a concept they're interested in expanding to other states like Maine or New Hampshire though Lauren and Chris also envision retiring from the hustle in five to 10 years by selling their business and moving West.

Lauren said she'd like to flex her hospitality background in a different way by opening a farm-animal sanctuary that would also cater to ethical tourism and education. Chris envisions working in marine-mammal preservation and responsible ecotourism.

That vision of the future may not be so far off considering ""we didn't even have a business five years ago"" Lauren noted.

As for their 401(k) Lauren isn't concerned. Business has been good to them and the recent downturn in the market has made her feel sound in their investments.

""I think I've taken most of it out to do more projects"" Lauren said of their retirement savings. ""This might sound a little overly confident but I feel more comfortable making my own investments with real estate than investing in some magical fund that's going to provide 3% returns.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tLzIwMjIvNi8xOC8yMzE3Mjg2OS9oaWRkZW4tY2FtZXJhcy1haXJibmItdnJiby1yZW50YWxzLWhvdy10by1maW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb: Are there cameras in your rental? Are they allowed?,"This Feb. 22 2018 file photo shows an Airbnb logo during an event in San Francisco. Undisclosed recording devices are not allowed in most vacation rentals. Here is how to detect hidden cameras.

Earlier this week a woman claimed on Twitter that she had found hidden cameras in her Airbnb. After the Philadelphia Police Department conducted an investigation they determined that there were no hidden cameras according to Yahoo.

Are cameras legal in vacation rentals? This scenario raises a question: If there were cameras in a vacation rental would they be allowed?

Airbnb’s policy states that hosts are allowed to place recording devices in their rentals. However there are strict rules.

They only allow “disclosed devices monitoring only public spaces and common spaces.” This includes devices that are only used to monitor a public space such as a front door or a driveway.

They don’t allow cameras in sleeping areas or bathrooms or undisclosed cameras in public spaces. Basically if there is a camera in the rental the host should make you aware of that.

allow cameras in sleeping areas or bathrooms or undisclosed cameras in public spaces. Basically if there is a camera in the rental the host should make you aware of that. Cameras are also not allowed in living rooms with beds to sleep in Airbnb says.

Vrbo another vacation rental site also has a strict policy stating that cameras or recording devices of any kind are not allowed inside of the rental.

However they do allow cameras outside of the property for security purposes and they must be disclosed to the renter.

Still worried about cameras? Here are some ways you can find hidden cameras according to Fox News.

Flash test: Turn off all of the lights in the room. Using the flashlight on your phone scan the room looking for any reflections. Inspect the walls vents or any unusual holes.

RF detector: An RF detector is a device that detects other wireless gadgets. You can purchase one on Amazon for under $50 and it can be used to alert you of any wireless recording devices.

Network watcher: There are also free programs that can tell you all devices hooked up to a Wi-Fi network. If you can connect to the Wi-Fi on the property you can download a program that shows all devices connected to the Wi-Fi which could identify potential cameras.

While I haven’t watched the cartoon Scooby Doo in years I was absolutely delighted when I saw the show pop up in my Instagram feed once more this week. The Scooby news was (thank God) not related to a reboot but rather something far more unexpected: a listing of the legendary Mystery Machine on Airbnb."

History of the most popular search engine,"Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

The company went public in August 2004.

Google renamed its company Alphabet in 2015.

According to tech company EarthWeb Google processes about 8.5 billion searches per day. With Statista’s estimate of 1.88 billion total websites on the internet as of August 2021 the scope of Google is still far from reaching the massive number after which it was named — but it grows larger by the day.

Originally conceptualized as a search engine the company has grown immensely since its founding. Google also owns YouTube and its purchase of Android allowed the company to establish itself in the phone market with products like the Google Pixel smartphone.

How old is Google?

Google Inc. was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin on Sept. 4 1998 following a $100000 investment from Andy Bechtolsheim co-founder of Sun Microsystems.

According to History Page and Brin filed for Google’s initial public stock offering on April 29 2004. The company went public in August 2004.

Google renamed its company Alphabet in 2015 making Google a subsidiary says Investopedia. This move was intended to avoid antitrust violations and unite all the company’s acquisitions and services as a technology conglomerate.

Other Google acquisitions:Who owns Google? The same company that owns Waze and YouTube.

Who is Google’s CEO?

In 2019 Page and Brin stepped down from their respective roles as CEO and President according to Search Engine Journal. The company's current CEO is Sundar Pichai.

When did Google buy YouTube?

In early October 2006 Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion. As of June 2022 Susan Wojcicki Google’s 16th-ever employee is the CEO of YouTube.

When did Google buy Android?

According to Wired Google acquired Android in 2005 for $50 million an investment that is paying off. Statista data reveals that over 80% of smartphones across the globe have run Android operating systems since the year 2014.

A group of U.S. lawmakers is urging Google to stop showing ""fake"" abortion clinics in search results for abortion services or information.

The group of 21 Democratic members of Congress sent a letter Friday June 17 to Sundar Pichai the CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc. The lawmakers cited recent data from The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) which found one in 10 abortion search results led to anti-abortion clinics which often bill themselves as ""pregnancy resource centers"" or ""crisis pregnancy centers.""

The CCDH tested their searches in so-called ""trigger law"" states. These states are where such laws are enacted or where pre-Roe v. Wade abortion bans have been kept on the books that could be ""triggered"" and enforced if the Supreme Court upends the 1973 decision that legalized abortion as a draft opinion suggests it may in the coming weeks.

The anti-abortion clinics in question are often nonprofits that are typically religiously affiliated and counsel clients against having an abortion as part of their free but limited services. The centers have been accused of providing misleading information about abortion and contraception — for example suggesting that abortion leads to mental health problems or breast cancer.

Most centers offer pregnancy tests and pregnancy-related counseling. Some also offer limited medical services such as ultrasounds. Because the centers are not licensed health care facilities they are exempt from certain government regulations such as minimum staffing levels.

Image Clear Ultrasound Mobile who according to their website is a Medical Clinic offering free pregnancy tests ultrasounds and resources to River Region Women as well as information about abortion sits across the street from the Reproductive Hea Expand

An Associated Press tally based on state budget figures revealed earlier this year that nearly $89 million has been allocated to such centers across about a dozen states. A decade ago the annual funding for the programs hovered around $17 million in about eight states.

Estimates of how many abortions have been prevented by such clinics are unknown because many states only require reports of how many clients were served. Similarly as abortion rates have declined across the U.S. for years there is no way to know the extent to which the pregnancy centers have played a role.

The CCDH also found 28% of ads displayed at the top of search result pages were for anti-abortion fake clinics and that 37% of searches on Google Maps led to the clinics.

""Directing women towards fake clinics that traffic in misinformation and don’t provide comprehensive health services is dangerous to women’s health and undermines the integrity of Google’s search results"" the lawmakers wrote. ""If Google must continue showing these misleading results in search results and Google Maps the results should at the very least be appropriately labeled.""

Lawmakers noted that Google does include a disclaimer — ""albeit one that appears in small font and is easily missed"" — for ads from the anti-abortion clinics. ""However no such warning is present on non-sponsored search results on Google Search"" the lawmakers contended.

The group led by Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan noted that with the leaked Supreme Court decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade they found the CCDH report ""especially concerning"" and asked for Alphabet Inc.‘s immediate attention to the matter.

Representatives for Google did not immediately respond to FOX Television Station’s request for comment.

In a statement to Reuters which first reported the letter Pichai said: ""We're always looking at ways to improve our results to help people find what they're looking for or understand if what they're looking for may not be available.""

It says it will protect users there. But digital rights activists say the firm will be putting the lives of government critics at risk. Who's right?

Saudi Arabia doesn't exactly have a positive track record when it comes to digital espionage.

In 2018 the country's government reportedly used the notorious spy software Pegasus on devices belonging to the family of Jamal Khashoggi the Saudi dissident and journalist who was killed that year in a gruesome assassination allegedly orchestrated by the government.

In 2019 two former Saudi employees of Twitter in the US were charged with using the popular social media platform to unmask critics of the Saudi government.

And last year a Saudi aid worker who had used a Twitter account to make jokes about his government was jailed for 20 years. His case is believed to be connected to the government's infiltration of Twitter.

And then there's Google. The online giant has the most popular search engine and most-used web-based email service in the world. Part of US company Alphabet Inc. Google regularly boasts about how carefully it protects users' data. But it has also had some noteworthy run-ins with authoritarian leaders.

Problems in China

When the company first introduced its search engine to the Chinese market in 2006 it was criticized by activists for censoring search results critical of the Chinese government.

Then between 2009 and 2010 Google was targeted by ""a far-­reaching hacking attack known as Operation Aurora that targeted everything from Google's intellectual property to the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists"" science publication MIT Technology Review reported in December 2018.

Google then withdrew from the Chinese market. Despite that it was only in 2019 that the US company publicly confirmed it had abandoned a secret project code-named Dragonfly a search engine created especially for China that would filter out results about human rights democracy religion and political protest.

Now Google says it wants to set up a ""cloud region"" in Saudi Arabia.

Given the two actors involved the reaction from human rights organizations and digital privacy advocates has not been surprising.

""This disturbing new step by Google raises … fears that this cloud center could leverage more power to the government of Saudi Arabia in further facilitating human rights abuses"" said a 2021 letter signed by 31 human rights organizations  including Amnesty International the Oxford Internet Institute and Human Rights Watch.

""A cloud center in Saudi Arabia will risk lives"" Laura Okkonen of Access Now the online rights organization that has been a prime mover behind the campaign told DW.

Activist investors overruled

Most recently a group of activists supported by Access Now filed a resolution so Google's investors could vote on the Saudi controversy at the annual general meeting of Google's parent company Alphabet which was held on June 1.

The proposal asked that Google ""commission a report assessing the siting of Google cloud data centers in countries of significant human rights concern.""

Although just over 57% of independent shareholders at the meeting voted for the resolution to be adopted earlier this month Google's executive management outrank them in voting power and the resolution was rejected.

When responding to DW's inquiries Google did not directly address the topic; the company sent an online link to its blog post from December 2021 announcing the Saudi data center in Dammam would be going ahead.

The political issues around setting up a data center in Saudi Arabia are clear. But what are the technical concerns around what are known as cloud services?

More private and business users now operate their online devices using ""the cloud."" What this basically means is that your data — things like pictures documents music emails and other messages — is stored somewhere other than the computer or phone in front of you. The software that lets you play music or post images is being run on larger computers in another location. You simply access them using the Internet.

A ""cloud region"" is really just a euphemism for the location where all those other computers are in what is known as a data center.

Security concerns

Up until recently Saudi Arabia has lagged behind in cloud services but industry insiders say it is now being seen as a major new opportunity. Of the three biggest cloud operators in the world today Google is likely to be the first to set up a data center there. The other major players are Amazon and Microsoft. China's Alibaba already has two data centers in Saudi Arabia.

In terms of the technology there are a number of ways outsiders could gain access to information inside a data center said Björn Scheuermann a research director at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

Hacking would be one. But as Scheuermann pointed out ""hacking can happen everywhere because by its nature it usually happens remotely."" So it wouldn't matter if a data center was in Saudi Arabia or not.

Saudi Arabia allegedly spied on the family of murdered dissident Jamal Khashoggi Image: Yasin Ozturk/AA/picture alliance

More specific to Saudi Arabia might be a physical breach at a data center. ""If somebody marches in there and gets physical access to the hardware then it becomes very very difficult — in many cases impossible — to guarantee data will be protected"" Scheuermann explained.

Data centers do tend to have tight security. However employees going into the center would need to be vetted or they could be pressured into extracting data critics warned.

A greater concern than a physical breach of a center occurs when authorities ask for the data by legal means. ""For example by a court order that says the data must be handed over"" said Scheuermann. ""The government says these servers are on our territory and subject to our legal system. In an authoritarian system defense against legal orders quickly reaches its limits when your physical assets are in the state's territory.""

According to Saudi laws?

Google has a number of pages on its website about how it deals with requests for user information from governments. It follows several steps and every six months provides reports showing how many requests it received and how many it responded to positively. There are no current statistics for Saudi Arabia.

Google stresses that it also complies with local laws.

That's a problem in Saudi Arabia Marwa Fatafta policy manager for the Middle East at Access Now told DW because ""Saudi Arabia's internet regulation laws are hazy and ripe for exploitation.""

The country's brand new data protection law which comes into force early next year doesn't allow data collectors to disclose personal data except Fatafta pointed out when a government requests it for security purposes among other reasons.

The country's legal system is overseen by the Saudi monarchy. ""In such an authoritarian system it's hard to imagine how Google or any individual would be able to challenge the government"" said Fatafta.

Saudi Arabia's 2007 cybercrime law also comes into it. Google may be asked to block or remove content that violates the law and then tell the Saudi telecommunications regulator about it. ""The Saudi cybercrime law is one of the most repressive laws in the region"" Fatafta noted.

Using ""the cloud"" at all is actually a question of trust research director Scheuermann told DW. After all you're storing your personal or professional data with a company which ostensibly could access it. Most of the time businesses like Google Microsoft and Amazon are careful not to do that because of the potential for serious public backlash or major financial penalties he noted.

""But essentially you're in their hands"" said Scheuermann. ""You have to trust in them to adhere to legal limitations and also that these limitations are not turned against you.""

Workers sometimes have to service a data center’s electrical equipment while it’s being energized. And they can become exposed to chemicals like chlorine which is used as a sterilizing agent for the water circulated through liquid cooling systems for computers and servers. In June 2015 five people had to be taken to a hospital after a chlorine gas leak at an Apple data center in Maiden North Carolina.

Data centers are safer than they used to be. But in search of forward-looking solutions some tech giants say that they’re exploring how AI can be applied to prevent safety issues. For example Microsoft is developing an AI system that analyzes data from a range of sources and generates alerts for data center construction and operations teams to “prevent or mitigate the impact of safety incidents.” A complementary but related system also under development attempts to detect and predict impacts to data center construction schedules.

“These initiatives are both in early testing phases and are expected to begin expanding into our production environments later this year” a Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch via email.

Meta also claims to be investigating ways AI can anticipate how its data centers will operate under “extreme environmental conditions” that might lead to unsafe work environments. The company says that it has been developing physical models to simulate extreme conditions and introducing this data to the AI models responsible for optimizing power consumption cooling and airflow across its servers.

“We have significant operational data from our data centers in some areas at high frequency with built-in sensors in servers racks and in our data halls” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Each server and network device taking on different workloads will consume different amounts of power generate different amounts of heat and make different amounts of airflow in the data centers. Our [infrastructure] team collects all the data from each server and then develops AI models which can allocate our servers and racks in the data centers and send workloads into these servers to optimize [for] performance and efficiency.”

Of course companies have motivations aside from safety to ensure data centers remain in peak condition. Outages are expensive — and are becoming more frequent. According to a 2020 survey by the IT Uptime Institute an IT consulting firm a third of data center owners and operators admitted to experiencing a major outage over the past 12 months. One in six claimed that their outage cost them more than $1 million — up from one in ten in 2019.

Meta has more than 20 data centers in operation around the world including new projects in Texas and Missouri estimated to cost $1.6 billion combined. Microsoft meanwhile manages more than 200 data centers and says it’s on pace to build between 50 to 100 new data centers each year for the foreseeable future.

AI also promises to find opportunities for energy — and therefore cost — savings in the data centers that normally fly under the radar another appealing aspect for corporations. In 2018 Google claimed that AI systems developed by its DeepMind affiliate were able to deliver energy savings of 30% on average compared to its data centers’ historical energy usage.

When reached for comment DeepMind said that it had no updates to share beyond the initial announcement. IBM and Amazon didn’t respond to inquiries. But both Meta and Microsoft say they’re now using AI for similar energy-tuning purposes.

Microsoft launched AI “anomaly detection methods” in late 2021 to gauge and mitigate unusual power and water usage events within the data center using telemetry data from electrical and mechanical devices. The company is also using AI-based approaches to identify and fix issues with power meters in the data center and to identify ideal spots to place servers in order to minimize wasted power network and cooling capacity.

Meta for its part says that it has been leveraging reinforcement learning to reduce the amount of air it pumps into data centers for cooling purposes. (At a high level reinforcement learning is a type of AI system that learns to solve a problem by trial and error.) Most of the company’s data centers use outdoor air and evaporative cooling systems making optimizing airflow a high priority.

The reduced environmental footprint is an added benefit of energy-regulating AI systems. Data centers consumed about 1% of the global electricity demand and contributed to 0.3% of all carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 according to a report from the Environmental Investigation Agency. And the typical data center uses 3 million to 5 million gallons of water per day the same amount of water as a city of 30000 to 50000 people.

Microsoft has previously said that it plans to have all of its data centers running on 100% renewable energy by 2025. Meta claimed to have achieved the feat in 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGJpa2UuY29tL25ld3MvYWxwaGFiZXRzLXdheW1vLXViZXItZnJlaWdodC1pbi1kZWFsLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLXRydWNrcy0zMDgxMDk20gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FyYW5kYmlrZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbHBoYWJldHMtd2F5bW8tdWJlci1mcmVpZ2h0LWluLWRlYWwtZm9yLWZ1dHVyZS1zZWxmLWRyaXZpbmctdHJ1Y2tzLTMwODEwOTY_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alphabet's Waymo Uber Freight In Deal For Future Self-Driving Trucks,"Waymo Via the self-driving trucking unit of Alphabet Inc and Uber Technology Inc's Freight business on Tuesday said they signed a long-term strategic partnership that would allow future customers to deploy autonomous trucks more efficiently.

The companies did not share a timeline for when their partnership could be used by paying customers and Waymo and Uber Freight declined to disclose financial details of the agreement.

Under the partnership future Waymo customers can use Uber Freight to more efficiently plan their automated and human-driven trucking fleets.

Uber Freight's software acts as a middle man connecting truckers with shippers to reduce shipping costs and expensive empty cargo miles. Uber last year made a stronger push into the trucking market by buying logistics company Transplace for $2.25 billion.

The partnership marks the latest in a series of company tie-ups in the autonomous trucking space as technology companies race to commercialize their products.

Companies including Waymo TuSimple Holdings Inc Aurora Innovation Inc and others hope to sell self-driving trucking services to logistics companies and large retailers in coming years. Under those business models customers would purchase and own the self-driving trucks and pay a per-mile usage fee to the tech companies.

Uber at the end of 2020 sold its own self-driving unit to Waymo-competitor Aurora and holds a nearly 43% stake in the company. Aurora in December said it partnered with Uber Freight.

Waymo said it plans to launch its first fully driverless trucks ""in the next few years"" beginning on the Texas I-45 between Dallas and Houston.

A group of U.S. lawmakers is urging Google to stop showing ""fake"" abortion clinics in search results for abortion services or information.

The group of 21 Democratic members of Congress sent a letter Friday June 17 to Sundar Pichai the CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc. The lawmakers cited recent data from The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) which found one in 10 abortion search results led to anti-abortion clinics which often bill themselves as ""pregnancy resource centers"" or ""crisis pregnancy centers.""

The CCDH tested their searches in so-called ""trigger law"" states. These states are where such laws are enacted or where pre-Roe v. Wade abortion bans have been kept on the books that could be ""triggered"" and enforced if the Supreme Court upends the 1973 decision that legalized abortion as a draft opinion suggests it may in the coming weeks.

The anti-abortion clinics in question are often nonprofits that are typically religiously affiliated and counsel clients against having an abortion as part of their free but limited services. The centers have been accused of providing misleading information about abortion and contraception — for example suggesting that abortion leads to mental health problems or breast cancer.

Most centers offer pregnancy tests and pregnancy-related counseling. Some also offer limited medical services such as ultrasounds. Because the centers are not licensed health care facilities they are exempt from certain government regulations such as minimum staffing levels.

An Associated Press tally based on state budget figures revealed earlier this year that nearly $89 million has been allocated to such centers across about a dozen states. A decade ago the annual funding for the programs hovered around $17 million in about eight states.

Estimates of how many abortions have been prevented by such clinics are unknown because many states only require reports of how many clients were served. Similarly as abortion rates have declined across the U.S. for years there is no way to know the extent to which the pregnancy centers have played a role.

The CCDH also found 28% of ads displayed at the top of search result pages were for anti-abortion fake clinics and that 37% of searches on Google Maps led to the clinics.

""Directing women towards fake clinics that traffic in misinformation and don’t provide comprehensive health services is dangerous to women’s health and undermines the integrity of Google’s search results"" the lawmakers wrote. ""If Google must continue showing these misleading results in search results and Google Maps the results should at the very least be appropriately labeled.""

Lawmakers noted that Google does include a disclaimer — ""albeit one that appears in small font and is easily missed"" — for ads from the anti-abortion clinics. ""However no such warning is present on non-sponsored search results on Google Search"" the lawmakers contended.

The group led by Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan noted that with the leaked Supreme Court decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade they found the CCDH report ""especially concerning"" and asked for Alphabet Inc.‘s immediate attention to the matter.

Representatives for Google did not immediately respond to FOX Television Station’s request for comment.

In a statement to Reuters which first reported the letter Pichai said: ""We're always looking at ways to improve our results to help people find what they're looking for or understand if what they're looking for may not be available.""

It says it will protect users there. But digital rights activists say the firm will be putting the lives of government critics at risk. Who's right?

Saudi Arabia doesn't exactly have a positive track record when it comes to digital espionage.

In 2018 the country's government reportedly used the notorious spy software Pegasus on devices belonging to the family of Jamal Khashoggi the Saudi dissident and journalist who was killed that year in a gruesome assassination allegedly orchestrated by the government.

In 2019 two former Saudi employees of Twitter in the US were charged with using the popular social media platform to unmask critics of the Saudi government.

And last year a Saudi aid worker who had used a Twitter account to make jokes about his government was jailed for 20 years. His case is believed to be connected to the government's infiltration of Twitter.

And then there's Google. The online giant has the most popular search engine and most-used web-based email service in the world. Part of US company Alphabet Inc. Google regularly boasts about how carefully it protects users' data. But it has also had some noteworthy run-ins with authoritarian leaders.

Problems in China

When the company first introduced its search engine to the Chinese market in 2006 it was criticized by activists for censoring search results critical of the Chinese government.

Then between 2009 and 2010 Google was targeted by ""a far-­reaching hacking attack known as Operation Aurora that targeted everything from Google's intellectual property to the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists"" science publication MIT Technology Review reported in December 2018.

Google then withdrew from the Chinese market. Despite that it was only in 2019 that the US company publicly confirmed it had abandoned a secret project code-named Dragonfly a search engine created especially for China that would filter out results about human rights democracy religion and political protest.

Now Google says it wants to set up a ""cloud region"" in Saudi Arabia.

Given the two actors involved the reaction from human rights organizations and digital privacy advocates has not been surprising.

""This disturbing new step by Google raises … fears that this cloud center could leverage more power to the government of Saudi Arabia in further facilitating human rights abuses"" said a 2021 letter signed by 31 human rights organizations  including Amnesty International the Oxford Internet Institute and Human Rights Watch.

""A cloud center in Saudi Arabia will risk lives"" Laura Okkonen of Access Now the online rights organization that has been a prime mover behind the campaign told DW.

Activist investors overruled

Most recently a group of activists supported by Access Now filed a resolution so Google's investors could vote on the Saudi controversy at the annual general meeting of Google's parent company Alphabet which was held on June 1.

The proposal asked that Google ""commission a report assessing the siting of Google cloud data centers in countries of significant human rights concern.""

Although just over 57% of independent shareholders at the meeting voted for the resolution to be adopted earlier this month Google's executive management outrank them in voting power and the resolution was rejected.

When responding to DW's inquiries Google did not directly address the topic; the company sent an online link to its blog post from December 2021 announcing the Saudi data center in Dammam would be going ahead.

The political issues around setting up a data center in Saudi Arabia are clear. But what are the technical concerns around what are known as cloud services?

More private and business users now operate their online devices using ""the cloud."" What this basically means is that your data — things like pictures documents music emails and other messages — is stored somewhere other than the computer or phone in front of you. The software that lets you play music or post images is being run on larger computers in another location. You simply access them using the Internet.

A ""cloud region"" is really just a euphemism for the location where all those other computers are in what is known as a data center.

Security concerns

Up until recently Saudi Arabia has lagged behind in cloud services but industry insiders say it is now being seen as a major new opportunity. Of the three biggest cloud operators in the world today Google is likely to be the first to set up a data center there. The other major players are Amazon and Microsoft. China's Alibaba already has two data centers in Saudi Arabia.

In terms of the technology there are a number of ways outsiders could gain access to information inside a data center said Björn Scheuermann a research director at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

Hacking would be one. But as Scheuermann pointed out ""hacking can happen everywhere because by its nature it usually happens remotely."" So it wouldn't matter if a data center was in Saudi Arabia or not.

Saudi Arabia allegedly spied on the family of murdered dissident Jamal Khashoggi Image: Yasin Ozturk/AA/picture alliance

More specific to Saudi Arabia might be a physical breach at a data center. ""If somebody marches in there and gets physical access to the hardware then it becomes very very difficult — in many cases impossible — to guarantee data will be protected"" Scheuermann explained.

Data centers do tend to have tight security. However employees going into the center would need to be vetted or they could be pressured into extracting data critics warned.

A greater concern than a physical breach of a center occurs when authorities ask for the data by legal means. ""For example by a court order that says the data must be handed over"" said Scheuermann. ""The government says these servers are on our territory and subject to our legal system. In an authoritarian system defense against legal orders quickly reaches its limits when your physical assets are in the state's territory.""

According to Saudi laws?

Google has a number of pages on its website about how it deals with requests for user information from governments. It follows several steps and every six months provides reports showing how many requests it received and how many it responded to positively. There are no current statistics for Saudi Arabia.

Google stresses that it also complies with local laws.

That's a problem in Saudi Arabia Marwa Fatafta policy manager for the Middle East at Access Now told DW because ""Saudi Arabia's internet regulation laws are hazy and ripe for exploitation.""

The country's brand new data protection law which comes into force early next year doesn't allow data collectors to disclose personal data except Fatafta pointed out when a government requests it for security purposes among other reasons.

The country's legal system is overseen by the Saudi monarchy. ""In such an authoritarian system it's hard to imagine how Google or any individual would be able to challenge the government"" said Fatafta.

Saudi Arabia's 2007 cybercrime law also comes into it. Google may be asked to block or remove content that violates the law and then tell the Saudi telecommunications regulator about it. ""The Saudi cybercrime law is one of the most repressive laws in the region"" Fatafta noted.

Using ""the cloud"" at all is actually a question of trust research director Scheuermann told DW. After all you're storing your personal or professional data with a company which ostensibly could access it. Most of the time businesses like Google Microsoft and Amazon are careful not to do that because of the potential for serious public backlash or major financial penalties he noted.

""But essentially you're in their hands"" said Scheuermann. ""You have to trust in them to adhere to legal limitations and also that these limitations are not turned against you.""

Workers sometimes have to service a data center’s electrical equipment while it’s being energized. And they can become exposed to chemicals like chlorine which is used as a sterilizing agent for the water circulated through liquid cooling systems for computers and servers. In June 2015 five people had to be taken to a hospital after a chlorine gas leak at an Apple data center in Maiden North Carolina.

Data centers are safer than they used to be. But in search of forward-looking solutions some tech giants say that they’re exploring how AI can be applied to prevent safety issues. For example Microsoft is developing an AI system that analyzes data from a range of sources and generates alerts for data center construction and operations teams to “prevent or mitigate the impact of safety incidents.” A complementary but related system also under development attempts to detect and predict impacts to data center construction schedules.

“These initiatives are both in early testing phases and are expected to begin expanding into our production environments later this year” a Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch via email.

Meta also claims to be investigating ways AI can anticipate how its data centers will operate under “extreme environmental conditions” that might lead to unsafe work environments. The company says that it has been developing physical models to simulate extreme conditions and introducing this data to the AI models responsible for optimizing power consumption cooling and airflow across its servers.

“We have significant operational data from our data centers in some areas at high frequency with built-in sensors in servers racks and in our data halls” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Each server and network device taking on different workloads will consume different amounts of power generate different amounts of heat and make different amounts of airflow in the data centers. Our [infrastructure] team collects all the data from each server and then develops AI models which can allocate our servers and racks in the data centers and send workloads into these servers to optimize [for] performance and efficiency.”

Of course companies have motivations aside from safety to ensure data centers remain in peak condition. Outages are expensive — and are becoming more frequent. According to a 2020 survey by the IT Uptime Institute an IT consulting firm a third of data center owners and operators admitted to experiencing a major outage over the past 12 months. One in six claimed that their outage cost them more than $1 million — up from one in ten in 2019.

Meta has more than 20 data centers in operation around the world including new projects in Texas and Missouri estimated to cost $1.6 billion combined. Microsoft meanwhile manages more than 200 data centers and says it’s on pace to build between 50 to 100 new data centers each year for the foreseeable future.

AI also promises to find opportunities for energy — and therefore cost — savings in the data centers that normally fly under the radar another appealing aspect for corporations. In 2018 Google claimed that AI systems developed by its DeepMind affiliate were able to deliver energy savings of 30% on average compared to its data centers’ historical energy usage.

When reached for comment DeepMind said that it had no updates to share beyond the initial announcement. IBM and Amazon didn’t respond to inquiries. But both Meta and Microsoft say they’re now using AI for similar energy-tuning purposes.

Microsoft launched AI “anomaly detection methods” in late 2021 to gauge and mitigate unusual power and water usage events within the data center using telemetry data from electrical and mechanical devices. The company is also using AI-based approaches to identify and fix issues with power meters in the data center and to identify ideal spots to place servers in order to minimize wasted power network and cooling capacity.

Meta for its part says that it has been leveraging reinforcement learning to reduce the amount of air it pumps into data centers for cooling purposes. (At a high level reinforcement learning is a type of AI system that learns to solve a problem by trial and error.) Most of the company’s data centers use outdoor air and evaporative cooling systems making optimizing airflow a high priority.

The reduced environmental footprint is an added benefit of energy-regulating AI systems. Data centers consumed about 1% of the global electricity demand and contributed to 0.3% of all carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 according to a report from the Environmental Investigation Agency. And the typical data center uses 3 million to 5 million gallons of water per day the same amount of water as a city of 30000 to 50000 people.

Microsoft has previously said that it plans to have all of its data centers running on 100% renewable energy by 2025. Meta claimed to have achieved the feat in 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGJpa2UuY29tL25ld3MvYWxwaGFiZXRzLXdheW1vLXViZXItZnJlaWdodC1pbi1kZWFsLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLXRydWNrcy0zMDgxMDk20gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FyYW5kYmlrZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbHBoYWJldHMtd2F5bW8tdWJlci1mcmVpZ2h0LWluLWRlYWwtZm9yLWZ1dHVyZS1zZWxmLWRyaXZpbmctdHJ1Y2tzLTMwODEwOTY_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alphabet's Waymo Uber Freight In Deal For Future Self-Driving Trucks,"Waymo Via the self-driving trucking unit of Alphabet Inc and Uber Technology Inc's Freight business on Tuesday said they signed a long-term strategic partnership that would allow future customers to deploy autonomous trucks more efficiently.

The companies did not share a timeline for when their partnership could be used by paying customers and Waymo and Uber Freight declined to disclose financial details of the agreement.

Under the partnership future Waymo customers can use Uber Freight to more efficiently plan their automated and human-driven trucking fleets.

Uber Freight's software acts as a middle man connecting truckers with shippers to reduce shipping costs and expensive empty cargo miles. Uber last year made a stronger push into the trucking market by buying logistics company Transplace for $2.25 billion.

The partnership marks the latest in a series of company tie-ups in the autonomous trucking space as technology companies race to commercialize their products.

Companies including Waymo TuSimple Holdings Inc Aurora Innovation Inc and others hope to sell self-driving trucking services to logistics companies and large retailers in coming years. Under those business models customers would purchase and own the self-driving trucks and pay a per-mile usage fee to the tech companies.

Uber at the end of 2020 sold its own self-driving unit to Waymo-competitor Aurora and holds a nearly 43% stake in the company. Aurora in December said it partnered with Uber Freight.

Waymo said it plans to launch its first fully driverless trucks ""in the next few years"" beginning on the Texas I-45 between Dallas and Houston.

These 5 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks Can Help,"You could be earning money while you sleep. Need I say more?

Retirement doesn't necessarily have to wait until you are in your 60s; working becomes optional as soon as your passive income covers your living expenses.

Buying dividend stocks which make so much money that they give a chunk of their profits on a regular basis to shareholders can eventually build a waterfall of cash that can set you financially free.

So if you're looking to retire as soon as possible consider these ultra-high-yield dividend stocks with solid financials to support their hefty payouts.

1. AT&T: The telecom giant

Dividend yield: 5.7%

AT&T (T 0.53%) is one of only a few wireless carriers in the United States. Its network supports roughly 67.5 million customers who pay their monthly bills like clockwork because smartphones have become a vital part of everyday life for most of them. The company generates more than $160 billion in annual revenue and uses some of that to pay out a quarterly dividend of $0.278 per share that currently yields a whopping 5.7%.

You'll see in the above chart how AT&T recently reduced the dividend a result of AT&T's fresh spinoff of its entertainment assets to form Warner Bros. Discovery. The lower payout also lowers the dividend payout ratio to roughly 40% of free cash flow per management's estimates. That frees up some cash for AT&T to get its debt levels under control as well as giving it the wherewithal to continue raising the dividend going forward. This gives investors plenty of reason to expect those dividend checks to keep coming.

2. Altria: The tobacco king

Dividend yield: 7.9%

Altria Group (MO 0.83%) is the largest tobacco company in the United States. Its history goes back more than 100 years as owner of the best-selling Marlboro brand of cigarettes (at least in the U.S.). It's well known that fewer people are smoking than in previous generations. Still Altria has used its robust pricing power for decades to offset declining cigarette volumes with price increases. That continued profit allows it to consistently grow its dividend to the point where it qualifies as a Dividend King with 52 consecutive annual dividend increases.

Altria spun off its international business as Philip Morris International (the owner of the Marlboro brand outside the U.S.) in 2008 which you can see in the above chart. Still the company has done fine since then steadily growing its operating profits at a mid-single-digit pace over the past 10 years. Investors can enjoy a whopping 7.9% dividend yield covered by Altria's 78% dividend payout ratio.

3. Enbridge: An oil and gas pipeline stalwart

Dividend yield: 6.2%

Enbridge (ENB 0.44%) is one of the largest energy companies in North America. Its primary business is pipelines which carry oil and natural gas from Canada to the Gulf Coast. Pipelines are like toll operators on a highway; they get paid for the traffic or materials that pass through their pipes in Enbridge's case. This has made Enbridge more stable than most oil companies because it's not as dependent on oil and gas prices to profit.

Enbridge's business does nearly $40 billion in annual revenue and the company has paid and raised its dividend in each of the past 26 years. Investors can enjoy a 6.2% yield at the current share price; the payout consumes under 60% of Enbridge's distributable cash flow making the dividend (and its continued growth) sustainable.

4. AbbVie: Pharmaceutical leader

Dividend yield: 4%

AbbVie (ABBV -0.11%) is a pharmaceutical company that was born when it split from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. However you can see how quickly the business has grown in nearly a decade thanks to massive sales from its blockbuster drug Humira which generated more than $20 billion in 2021. Shareholders have enjoyed a 4% dividend yield while management has raised the payout by an average of 17% annually over the past five years.

AbbVie's exclusive rights to Humira in the U.S. expire next year which will likely cause revenue growth to slow as competitors flood the market. AbbVie has moved to develop and acquire assets that could help replace lost business. The dividend payout ratio is just 43% of cash flow so the dividend should be able to endure some short-term turbulence if there is any.

5. Realty Income: The monthly dividend company

Dividend yield: 4.5%

Realty Income (O -0.78%) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) a specific business structure that invests in real estate and shares its cash profits with shareholders as dividends. Realty Income specializes in retail properties; it's a net-lease REIT owning the building and charging its tenants for rent and letting the tenants handle the taxes insurance and maintenance.

Realty Income's tenants are businesses that tend to operate discount services making them recession-proof and reliable tenants. Realty Income's properties generate steady cash flow so much so that it pays shareholders a monthly dividend instead of the quarterly payout that's more common among U.S. companies. It even refers to itself as The Monthly Dividend Company. A Dividend Aristocrat with 28 years of consecutive annual dividend raises investors can take Realty Income's 4.5% yield to the bank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vb3Rha3Vtb2RlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzYyYWZlMmEwNzEzNDkzMDAxZDFhN2E2YS9DaGFpbnNhdy1NYW4tQXV0aG9yLVRhdHN1a2ktRnVqaW1vdG8tdG8tRGVidXQtTmV3LU9uZS1TaG90LU1hbmdhIdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chainsaw Man Author Tatsuki Fujimoto to Debut New One-Shot! | Manga News,"Chainsaw Man's Tatsuki Fujimoto is teaming up with To Strip the Flesh's Oto Toda for a new one-shot manga titled Futsu ni Kiitekure!

Investors who seek a quick path to wealth will often fail. Speculators risk reacting too emotionally if a stock drops while they watch its movements like a hawk. Conversely investors who search for stocks to buy and hold for the very long term will have more patience.

Taking the time to research a company’s prospects will lead to better returns. Look for companies that build a strong business plan to carry through over several years. The realistic ones will explain the near-term risks too.

Chosen across several sectors these seven stocks to buy will make you rich by 2030 if management grows revenues at current rates:

Applied Materials Coinbase Global Intel Altria Group Novartis Pfizer StoneCo

Quality value and growth scores vary among the selected stocks.

As shown above all of the companies have a strong quality score. Only the growth and valuation scores vary. For example Intel and Applied Materials are semiconductor companies with vastly different near-term prospects. Meanwhile Altria has the lowest overall scores but the highest dividend yield. StoneCo is trading far below its 52-week high creating a rare entry point for investors. If you are a new investor you should consider to visit a comparison site for the stock market such as InvestoRunner.com before purchasing stocks from this list.

Stocks to Buy: Applied Materials

Applied Materials pays a modest quarterly dividend of 24 cents. Its leadership in the semiconductor capital equipment sector will reward shareholders.

The company has diversified into the advanced display-manufacturing segment. Also it is in a strong position to grow in the advanced packaging market.

AMAT accelerated its growth after embracing 3D NAND production in 2014. With the chip shortage fueling unfilled sales AMAT’s wafer fabbrication equipment (WFE business will outgrow the semiconductor industry.

The digital transformation of the global economy is a big catalyst for AMAT stock. Large companies need to invest more to compete and will need Applied Materials’ products to survive.

In the near term its dynamic random access memory (DRAM tech will perform well. The company will benefit from stronger sales in the second half of the year compared to the first.

Applied Materials’ NAND products which are used in storage saw weaker sales than its DRAM offerings. Still demand next year and beyond for NAND is healthy.

Coinbase Global

Cryptocurrency platform Coinbase will attract a considerable number of customers in the coming decade. Despite rare moments of user dissatisfaction the site genuinely wants to teach the public about cryptocurrency investing. To address the former issue Coinbase acquired Agara an Indian artificial intelligence startup to expand and automate customer service capabilities.

Coinbase has a good problem: it has too much customer growth. It cannot handle the influx and needs to strengthen support levels. As customers deposit more assets and complete more transactions Coinbase’s revenue will grow.

On Oct. 19 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB picked the platform to power crypto custody for Novi its digital wallet. In this pilot study users can acquire Pax Dollar (CCC:USDP-USD and Novi will hold it on deposit with Coinbase Custody. If requested Novi users may transfer USDP between each other in an instant.

Facebook is a social networking giant. Getting its support will convince customers to join Coinbase rather than its competitors.

Wall Street analysts think COIN stock trades with minimal upside ahead. Coinbase may disprove them. As revenue grows over the next decade the stock will reward its shareholders.

Stocks to Buy: Intel

Intel is suffering from low growth as it loses its foothold in the desktop and server markets. However that is changing quickly. Rallying ahead of its quarterly earnings report and then slumping as it always does Intel is a value stock.

The giant lost its way when rivals found growth in mobile processor development. Then Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD took Intel’s desktop market through its Ryzen processor product line. AMD’s Epyc also outperforms Intel’s comparable chip line Xeon.

But Intel’s refreshed 12th generation Alder Lake processor shows promise. Tech review sites are posting very high ratings. Intel’s architecture for Alder Lake is creative featuring a hybrid core design that provides efficiency and solid performance. Its P-cores clock up to 5.2 gigahertz (GHz while its E-cores run at a maximum of 3.9 GHz.

The company needs to solidify support for the new chip and developments of its graphics card. To ensure this CEO Pat Gelsinger noted Intel will communicate better with “a developer-first approach.”

Altria Group (MO)

In the third quarter Altria posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.22. Revenue fell by 2.6% year-over-year (YOY to $5.53 billion.

Markets did not appreciate the company raising the lower end of its full-year 2021 guidance. It expects EPS in the range of $4.58 to $4.62.

The 5% to 6% EPS growth over 2020 does not show an obvious path to wealth by 2030. Yet the dividend of 90 cents per quarter is after a 5% hike. Expect Altria’s strong cash flow to allow management to raise dividends regularly.

Some investors view tobacco as an unattractive investment. But people who smoke still need to buy the company’s products. Plus Altria has a discount segment that is growing. It is careful not to gouge price-sensitive customers especially its premium brands.

Altria is embracing e-vapor an alternative to tobacco that is expected to grow in popularity over the next decade. It estimated the total category volume of these products increased 17% from last year. If the future improves for this segment Altria’s stock will rise and reward investors.

Stocks to Buy: Novartis

In the third quarter Novartis posted sales growing by 6% from last year to $13 billion. For 2021 expectations of net sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentages will not impress investors seeking wealth. Still its Cosentyx and Entresto drugs will add billions in revenue.

Cosentyx is a monoclonal antibody that treats psoriasis ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Peak sales could reach $7 billion for the drug. Meanwhile Entresto is a blood pressure medication that could bring in $5 billion in revenue.

NVS stock is on sale because the company faces pressure in its near-term top-line growth. The lowered expectations hurt the share price creating a better price for value investors.

Eventually Novartis will post positive developments for products like its CAR-T cancer therapy. Investors do not yet now when Novartis will post such great news but when it does the stock will climb abruptly. Instead of timing those events investors should look at the stock now while the market ignores it.

Pfizer

After peaking at more than $50 this summer Pfizer descended for no reason. Then investors bid shares higher by 10% early in November when it announced results for its antiviral Covid pill Paxlovid.

Besides its generous revenue split with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX for sales of the Covid vaccine (it expects at least $65 billion in 2022 the Covid pill shows promise. If taken within three days of symptom onset Paxlovid reduced hospitalization by 89% compared to a placebo.

While lockdowns and business closures have ended in many places the pandemic is not yet over. Even after the worst of it passes the virus will linger in communities for at least the next few years.

If approved Pfizer’s pill gives hospitals and doctors another weapon to fight the virus. CEO Albert Bourla said the study news “is a real game-changer in the global efforts to halt the devastation of this pandemic.”

Pfizer may realize billions in revenue within the next few months. More countries will approve Paxlovid increasing both the addressable market and revenue for Pfizer.

Stocks to Buy: StoneCo

After topping $95 StoneCo fell steadily in 2021. The leading provider of financial technology solutions in Brazil posted an 8.1% YOY decline in revenue.

StoneCo also posted a Q2 2021 loss. Despite a total payment volume of 60.4 billion Brazilian Reals up 58.6% YOY the company faces technology challenges. In the short term its new registry system has experienced technical delays. It also suspended Take Rate which hurt its adjusted net margin outlook for the year.

The uncertainty spooked investors sending the stock to lows. Cautious investors may build a position from here but risk further downside ahead.

Looking beyond the quarter StoneCo is of great importance to the merchant community in Brazil. The company will keep winning market share in the small and midsized business space. StoneCo is accustomed to the competition and will manage new products to sustain growth.

The 35% of clients that are not paying interest is a short-term headwind. Non-performing loans are also on the rise. In its Q2 earnings call company executives stated that under the new regulatory framework it would increase its reserves. Customers will repay their loans as cash flow recovers and from there its income will bounce back.

A US District Court in Seattle convicted Paige Thompson of seven counts of computer and wire fraud on Friday a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

A press release from the Department of Justice (DOJ) states Thompson developed a tool that scanned AWS for misconfigured accounts and then leveraged these accounts to gain access to the systems of Capital One and dozens of other AWS customers. Prosecutors also say Thompson “hijacked” companies’ servers to install cryptocurrency mining software that would transfer any earnings to her personal crypto wallet. She then “bragged” about her misdoings in online forums and over text messages.

“She exploited mistakes to steal valuable data and sought to enrich herself”

At the time there was some debate as to whether Thompson was an ethical hacker or security researcher due to her unusual candidness about her role in the Capital One attack online — she posted customers’ sensitive data on a public GitHub page and shared the details of the breach on Twitter and Slack. Earlier this year the Justice Department made it clear that it wouldn’t prosecute security researchers under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. But US prosecutors obviously weren’t convinced Thompson’s actions fell under this exception.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzIwMjItMDYtMTcvZ3JpbS1lbmRpbmctZm9yLXVrLWpvdXJuYWxpc3QtYW5kLWJyYXppbGlhbi1pbmRpZ2Vub3VzLWV4cGVydC1taXNzaW5nLWluLWFtYXpvbi1yYWluZm9yZXN0Lmh0bWzSAaIBaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC8yMDIyLTA2LTE3L2dyaW0tZW5kaW5nLWZvci11ay1qb3VybmFsaXN0LWFuZC1icmF6aWxpYW4taW5kaWdlbm91cy1leHBlcnQtbWlzc2luZy1pbi1hbWF6b24tcmFpbmZvcmVzdC5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grim ending for UK journalist and Brazilian indigenous expert missing in Amazon rainforest,"Federal police officers carry a body found during the search for Pereira and Phillips; Atalaia do Norte. BRUNO KELLY (REUTERS)

The discovery on June 15 of two bodies buried in a remote area of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest ended the agony of friends and family waiting for news of indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips who had been missing for 11 days. Police were only able to find the bodies after a poacher the first suspect arrested in the case confessed to murdering and burying the two men and then sinking their boat in the Itaquai River. It was the outcome everyone feared after almost two weeks of an intensive search along the stretch of river where the men disappeared on June 5. Their violent death in the Javari Valley–an area the size of Panama where at least 10 uncontacted indigenous groups live–is much more than a tragic incident. A June 16 editorial in the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper said “The tragedy clearly shows that the [Brazilian] Amazon is a region awash in lawlessness that is encouraged by [President] Bolsonaro.”

Eleven days of agony

Wednesday June 15. The indigenous trackers who mobilized a few hours after the two men were reported missing focus their search on a jungle area furrowed by a meandering river. Security forces joined in the search a day after the disappearance was reported. The search centers on a 10-square-kilometer area where the river makes several turns and which is relatively close to the town of Atalaia do Norte. One of the detained suspects Amarildo da Costa a fisherman also known as Pelado confesses to the crime and leads the police to the ditch where he buried the bodies. Hours later the police hold a press conference to report that two bodies had been found and provide some initial details about the circumstances of the disappearance.

10 days earlier—Sunday June 5. Phillips a contributor for The Guardian and Pereira employed for 10 years by FUNAI the Brazilian government agency responsible for protecting the country’s indigenous peoples were returning to Atalaia do Norte after a trip upriver to Jaburu Lake. Phillips went there to interview some local men who manned a guard post to detect illegal invasions of Javari land colleagues of the indigenous trackers who later searched for the missing men. The guards belong to Univaja an association of ethnic groups that have joined forces to defend indigenous lands in the absence of any government protection. Pereira works closely with Univaja. Phillips and Pereira are last seen by residents of a village called São Gabriel.

All this is goingPolice find “organic material that appears to be human” in the river.An indigenous source who knows this remote part of the Javari Valley tells EL PAÍS “Everything indicates that it was not an accident that they were ambushed. A boat with seven empty gasoline drums doesn’t just disappear like that. The men and all the evidence evaporated.”ja members document and submit reports of illegal invasions to the authorities in hopes that they would enforce the law. To do this they used a combination of ancestral knowledge and state-of-the-art technology.

According to the police as Pereira and Phillips were returning from their trip Pelado armed with a shotgun begins pursuing them in his boat at high speed. The fisherman and well-known poacher opens fire. He has four other people on board his boat. A confrontation ensues and Pelado’s group overpowers Pereira and Phillips. Pereira was used to being threatened and was often armed. Just the day before Pereira Phillips and the Univaja team had been threatened by Pelado and other poachers. The poachers sink the men’s boat engine in the river.

When Pereira and Phillips fail to return as scheduled alarms begin sounding throughout Univaja. The indigenous patrol teams experts in jungle tracking start searching but cannot locate the men and find no signs of an accident. Pereira is an experienced jungle traveler and knows how to survive in this hostile environment.

Just days before their trip Pereira provided the police and Ministry of Justice officials with detailed information about a criminal network allegedly involved in illegal fishing and poaching. Also information gathered by the indigenous patrol teams was recently used to confiscate illegal catches.

Monday June 6. Indigenous people report the disappearance to the authorities. The first group of police officers join the search. The government announces the allocation of more resources but they are slow to materialize. The families and colleagues of the two missing men demand a faster response because time is of the essence. They criticize the government’s failure to deploy aircraft. The Ministry of Defense issues a statement that it is ready to assist but that it is awaiting orders from superiors. Indignation about the slow government response spreads among the families and colleagues of the missing men.

Meanwhile the attackers move the bodies and bury them three kilometers inland from the river. Police report that Pelado confessed to sandbagging and sinking the men’s boat. A forensic analyses will confirm the identities of the bodies and the cause of death.

Tuesday June 7. Authorities deploy divers police officers and soldiers in two boats and a jet ski to aid in the search. Relatives again criticize the failure to deploy any aircraft. The police open a criminal investigation. Colleagues of the two men launch an international awareness campaign asking “Where are Bruno and Dom?”

Phillips’ wife Alessandra Sampaio records a video imploring authorities: “Even if the love of my life is dead they must be found. Please accelerate the search.” Pereira’s partner Beatriz Matos says that “every minute counts. Any part of the river or jungle that has not been searched could be the place where they are waiting to be rescued.”

President Jair Bolsonaro who treats NGOs indigenous people and the press as enemies is dismissive and says “Two people on a boat trip in a completely wild area like this– it’s an adventure that’s not at all advisable. Anything can happen. They could have had an accident or been murdered.”

Wednesday June 8. Several people are interrogated and Pelado is arrested after an eyewitness to the June 5 chase testifies. He is initially charged only with illegal possession of restricted-use ammunition but later he is formally named as a suspect in the disappearance of Pereira and Phillips. When the Brazilian news media report that Pelado’s two defense lawyers are government officials not uncommon in remote areas of the country both lawyers resign from the case.

Thursday June 9. Bolsonaro and Biden meet for the first time during the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles (California). The public outcry demanding more government resources to aid in the search reaches the ears of summit delegates.

Friday June 10. Police find “organic material that appears to be human” in the river. An indigenous source who knows this remote part of the Javari Valley tells EL PAÍS “Everything indicates that it was not an accident that they were ambushed. A boat with seven empty gasoline drums doesn’t just disappear like that. The men and all the evidence evaporated.”

Saturday June 11. Pelado’s family claims he was tortured. His brother Oseney da Costa tells an Associated Press reporter “They wanted him to confess but he’s innocent” A few days later Oseney is also arrested.

Sunday June 12. The first solid information in the case comes out. Univaja trackers find a backpack tied to a tree in a flooded area near where the missing men were last seen. Inside the backpack are Pereira’s health card boots belonging to Pereira and Phillips rubber sandals and some clothing.

Monday June 13. Roberto Doring the second in command at the Embassy of Brazil in London notifies Phillips’ brothers that he has some news. Doring communicated with them through “an official Brazilian spokesperson” according to the Phillips family. “He told us that two bodies had been found but had not yet been identified.” Phillips’ wife released this information which was published by many Brazilian and international news outlets including EL PAÍS. The Brazilian police later issued a statement that “The reports that the bodies have been found are not true.” The Brazilian ambassador later apologized to the Phillips family.

President Bolsonaro comments on the case again this time in gruesome detail. “There are indications that something evil was done to them because human entrails were found floating in the river. It has been taken to Brasilia for DNA testing.”

Tuesday June 14. A second suspect is arrested—Pelado’s brother Oseney da Costa.

Wednesday June 15. The federal police chief in Amazonas confirms in a late-night press conference in Manaus that the bodies of Pereira and Phillips have been found. He provides additional information about Pelado’s confession.

“Now we can bring them home and lovingly say our goodbyes” said Phillips’ wife. “And today we will begin seeking justice for them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2dhbmdzLW5vdC1pbXBsaWNhdGVkLWFtYXpvbi1tdXJkZXJzLWJyYXppbC1wb2xpY2Utc2F5LWluZGlnZW5vdXMtZ3JvdXAtcmVqZWN0cy0yMDIyLTA2LTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remains of British journalist found in Amazon police name new suspect,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2dhbmdzLW5vdC1pbXBsaWNhdGVkLWFtYXpvbi1tdXJkZXJzLWJyYXppbC1wb2xpY2Utc2F5LWluZGlnZW5vdXMtZ3JvdXAtcmVqZWN0cy0yMDIyLTA2LTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FA4BC67B20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2dhbmdzLW5vdC1pbXBsaWNhdGVkLWFtYXpvbi1tdXJkZXJzLWJyYXppbC1wb2xpY2Utc2F5LWluZGlnZW5vdXMtZ3JvdXAtcmVqZWN0cy0yMDIyLTA2LTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1hem9uLWN1c3RvbWVyLWZpbmRzLWEtdmlhbC1ibG9vZC13aGVuLXVucGFja2luZy1uZXctY2hhaXItMjAyMi020gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hbWF6b24tY3VzdG9tZXItZmluZHMtYS12aWFsLWJsb29kLXdoZW4tdW5wYWNraW5nLW5ldy1jaGFpci0yMDIyLTY_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon customer found full blood vial while unpacking chair,"The vial of blood that Jen Begakis found in her Amazon delivery. Jen Begakis

An Amazon customer found a vial of blood in a chair she bought on the site.

Jen Begakis shared a video of the vial and an apology from Amazon on social media.

In an email shared by Begakis Amazon offered her a refund and a $100 gift card.

An Amazon customer received an unexpected but very unwelcome bonus when opening the chair she bought from the online retailer: a vial of blood.

In a tweet on Thursday Jen Begakis said: ""If I told you the leather chair I ordered from Amazon was packaged with a blood collection tube that is … full would you believe me? because I'm lost for — words.""

Begakis added: ""I'm as terrified as I am confused.""

In a later tweet Begakis shared an email she received from Amazon apologizing for the delivery and offering a $156.59 refund for the chair and a $100 gift card.

In the email Amazon said: ""First and foremost I'm truly sorry for your experience! I can certainly understand the concern of receiving bodily fluids in your package. I've made sure the seller has been reported and all appropriate actions have been taken to prevent this from happening again in the future.""

Jen Begakis was offered a $100 gift card by Amazon after being sent an unwanted vial of blood with her purchase. Jen Begakis

Begakis a doctoral student at Cornell University told Insider that the tone of the response was ""almost laughable in its attempt at normalcy"".

She remained unsure about how to dispose of the vial: ""Tossing it in the trash seems about as wrong headed as hanging onto it.""

Begakis added: ""A $100 gift card is pretty paltry an apology if you ask me. Say with inflation that's $75 'I'm sorry we shipped you a biohazard'.""

Amazon operates with a range of third-party clients that sell through its website. The email Begakis received from Amazon appeared to confirm it was supplied by one of these vendors.

Amazon didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

That won't change anytime soon,"New York CNN Business —

Americans gained a new federal holiday last year: Juneteenth. This year the holiday which commemorates of the end of slavery in the United States falls on Sunday but it will be observed in many places on Monday June 20.

Given that this long summer weekend also coincides with Father’s Day that means there will be a lot of travel going on.

The Friday before Juneteenth clocked in as the most popular air travel day of 2022 according to statistics from the Transportation Security Administration. Airports haven’t been that crowded since Thanksgiving 2021.

TSA officers said they screened about 2438784 people at airport security checkpoints nationwide on Friday the highest checkpoint volume since November 28 the Sunday after Thanksgiving. That also was about 100000 more travelers than the Friday before Memorial Day weekend.

“Welcome to the Juneteenth Holiday Weekend of travel!” wrote TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein on Twitter.

While Juneteenth became an official holiday last year this is the first year that the US stock market and banks will close in its honor.

The surge in numbers couldn’t have come at a worse time for US airlines. A combination of rough weather staff shortages and infrastructure challenges have left major carriers struggling to keep up with the surge in travel. Nearly 9000 flights were delayed within the US Friday and another 1500 flights were canceled according to the data group FlightAware.

In all more than 3200 flights were canceled between Friday and Sunday per FlightAware including more than 850 flights on Saturday and more than 900 Sunday.

Delta Air Lines alone canceled at least 248 flights on Sunday. United Airlines canceled 90 flights and American Airlines canceled 96 flights.

“A variety of factors continue to impact our operations including challenges with air traffic control weather and unscheduled absences in some work groups” Delta said in a statement to CNN. “Canceling a flight is always our last resort and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience to their travel plans.”

CNN has reached out to United and American for a comment on the flight cancellations.

The increase in delays and cancellations comes just one day after Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with airline CEOs to discuss ways to improve performance and operations ahead of another expected surge in travel over the 4th of July holiday.

About 2700 flights were canceled over Memorial Day weekend. Major airlines already are preemptively canceling more flights just as the busy summer season heats up. Southwest Airlines has cut nearly 20000 flights between June and Labor Day and is struggling to hire the 10000 new workers it says it needs to meet demand.

“I go through the Whataburger drive-thru and I pay and get my bag and stapled to the bag is a job application” Southwest CEO Robert Jordan joked to the Dallas Morning News last year about the difficulty in finding job applicants. “That’s what it’s come to.”

Delta said it will cancel 100 daily flights in the US and Latin America from July 1 to August 7. In an open letter to customers Delta pilots wrote that the labor shortage has put them on pace to fly more overtime hours this year than in all of 2018 and 2019 combined.

“The pilot shortage for the industry is real and most airlines are simply not going to be able to realize their capacity plans because there simply aren’t enough pilots at least not for the next five-plus years” United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said during the airline’s quarterly earnings call in April.

Unions representing pilots at Delta American and Southwest say that airlines got themselves into the current situation by refusing to replace pilots who retired and took leaves of absence during the height of the pandemic when air travel plummeted.

About 8000 new commercial pilots have received certificates in the last year according to pilot unions and they say there shouldn’t be a shortage. The current service cut narrative they claim is being used by companies to justify a cut to training and safety requirements that will boost profit margins.

Some US senators are taking note. “While some flight cancellations are unavoidable the sheer number of delays and cancellations this past weekend raises questions about airline decision-making” wrote Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey in a letter to Buttigieg earlier this month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tL2Jsb2cvc291dGgtYW1lcmljYXMtbGFyZ2VzdC1haXJsaW5lLWxhdGFtLWNsZWFyZWQtdG8tZXhpdC1iYW5rcnVwdGN5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South America's Largest Airline Latam Cleared to Exit Bankruptcy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tL2Jsb2cvc291dGgtYW1lcmljYXMtbGFyZ2VzdC1haXJsaW5lLWxhdGFtLWNsZWFyZWQtdG8tZXhpdC1iYW5rcnVwdGN5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001FA4DD82F80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tL2Jsb2cvc291dGgtYW1lcmljYXMtbGFyZ2VzdC1haXJsaW5lLWxhdGFtLWNsZWFyZWQtdG8tZXhpdC1iYW5rcnVwdGN5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWVsaXRlLWJlbmVmaXRzLWVhcm5pbmctYWFkdmFudGFnZS1taWxlcy1vbi1pbmRpZ28tZmxpZ2h0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Elite Benefits & Earning AAdvantage Miles on IndiGo Flights,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2022/06/18/american-airlines-elite-benefits-earning-aadvantage-miles-on-indigo-flights/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWVsaXRlLWJlbmVmaXRzLWVhcm5pbmctYWFkdmFudGFnZS1taWxlcy1vbi1pbmRpZ28tZmxpZ2h0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2VzcG4vc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNDEwOTM0Ny9wYXJlbnRzLXRleGFzLXRlZW4tc3BlYWstaHVtYW4tdHJhZmZpY2tpbmctY2FzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parents of Texas teenager who left Dallas Mavericks game speak out on human trafficking case,"DALLAS -- The parents of a 15-year-old Texas girl who in April left a Mavericks game with an unidentified man ultimately prompting a human trafficking investigation are speaking out to raise awareness about human trafficking.

Kyle and Brooke Morris in an interview with ESPN and ""Good Morning America"" said they want their daughter's story to be a cautionary one about the dangers of human sex trafficking and how laws governing the crime are applied.

""We just want to make sure people understand ... that something like this can happen to anyone anywhere"" Kyle Morris said. ""Even if you don't think it's possible there's people out there that they want to make it happen.""

Police found the girl as she walked on the side of a road in Oklahoma City 10 days after Morris her stepfather reported her missing from American Airlines Center in Dallas. She had been taken to an Oklahoma City hotel where she was sexually assaulted multiple times starved and not allowed to bathe according to her parents and their lawyer.

The nonprofit Texas Counter-Trafficking Initiative helped find the girl through an online ad soliciting sex.

Three people were arrested in Oklahoma City and charged with human trafficking and other offenses. Their cases are pending.

The parents said their daughter is safe has entered treatment to recover from her trauma and is doing well. The girl has given her parents permission to discuss the case publicly according to the family's lawyer. ESPN is not naming her because she is a minor.

The girl told her mother a couple of days after she was found that she had met ""so many other girls"" in Oklahoma.

""And she said 'I wonder how long they have been in this life but no one looked for them'"" Brooke Morris said.

Kyle Morris a Mavericks season-ticket holder said that on the night of the April 8 game against the Portland Trail Blazers he and his stepdaughter were in the Platinum level of the arena. Just before halftime the girl told him she needed to use the bathroom. He said she did not have her phone and left her ID and debit card at her seat. When she didn't return he alerted security which searched restrooms and inside the arena. Morris said an off-duty police officer working the game told him that surveillance video had shown the girl walking out of the arena and that she was last seen entering a nearby parking garage.

Zeke Fortenberry the family's lawyer who has seen the surveillance video said the girl did not appear to leave by force. Kyle and Brooke Morris said their daughter has a history of leaving home without their permission. In those instances Kyle Morris said she had left with people she knew even leaving a note in at least one instance.

""This time"" he told ESPN ""... everything about it was different.""

Fortenberry said American Airlines Center and the Mavericks have been helpful in trying to determine what happened. Kyle Morris said he found an email address for Mark Cuban and emailed the Mavericks owner who responded within minutes adding people who could help and telling them to use whatever resources they needed.

""What happened to the unnamed teen after she walked away from the American Airlines Center facilities on April 8 2022 is tragic and the American Airlines Center and Dallas Mavericks are glad she is now safe and wish her well on her road to recovery"" said a statement provided to ESPN by lawyer Scott C. Thomas responding on behalf of the American Airlines Center and the Mavericks.

Added Thomas: ""The American Airlines Center has no evidence that any trafficking group has been in the arena at any time including with respect to this incident.""

According to Thomas arena security staff started reviewing video footage shortly after Kyle Morris reported his stepdaughter missing provided video to authorities and let Fortenberry the Morris' attorney look at video too.

Kyle Morris said an off-duty officer suggested he return home -- the family lives in North Richland Hills about 30 miles away -- to report his daughter missing there. North Richland Hills confirmed to ESPN that it took a report from Morris and that an officer entered the information into a national missing persons database early on April 9. North Richland Hills police added an ""endangered"" flag to the report April 11.

A Dallas Police spokesperson declined an interview request but said via email that the department made a report and helped the North Richland Hills Police Department. A bulletin about the missing girl went out April 11. Dallas Police confirmed that an off-duty officer at the game was notified of a missing person and that the event and site were searched that night. The spokesperson referred to a section of the Texas Family Code. Authorities have interpreted the code to mean that cases of missing juveniles should be investigated as runaways unless circumstances indicate an involuntary act such as an abduction or kidnapping.

""Those cases per code are to be filed where the juvenile resides"" Dallas Police said in an email to ESPN.

Said Kyle Morris: ""For this situation I'm just going to say Dallas' interpretation or application of that portion of the family code I think is wrong.""

Morris said he and his wife ended up bouncing back and forth between jurisdictions seeking information about their daughter's disappearance concerned the investigation wasn't making progress. The parents told ESPN they aren't aware of any formal investigation by Dallas Police.

The family contacted the Texas Counter-Trafficking Initiative after the girl had been missing for six days Morris said. They did that on a recommendation from a family friend who had gone through a similar situation. The counter-trafficking group located the girl in a matter of hours and notified the Oklahoma City police.

On April 15 Oklahoma City police searched rooms in an Extended Stay America hotel on West Reno Avenue. They made three initial arrests but didn't find the girl. After an anonymous tip police found her three days later walking with another person 6 miles away from the hotel. How she got to Oklahoma City remains unclear.

Among those arrested are Kenneth Levan Nelson and Sarah Hayes who have been charged with human trafficking and other offenses. They have preliminary hearing conferences scheduled for Aug. 15. Steven Hill who was charged with rape II has a preliminary hearing on July 11. Nelson is being held on $300000 bond while Hayes is being held on a $250000 bond and Hill on a $25000 bond according to court records.

Human trafficking involves the use of force fraud or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act. Millions of people are trafficked worldwide each year including in the United States. Traffickers often use violence manipulation or false promises to lure victims into trafficking situations.

In a June 4 tweet U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas said Texans can blame their higher electric bills on supporters of the Green New Deal a-yet-to-be-passed congressional plan touted as a strategy for tackling climate change.

""The impact of President Biden being beholden to the Green New Deal radicals in his party has electricity costs through the roof in Texas"" Cruz wrote in his tweet.

He included a link to a Dallas Morning News article that tied electricity costs to the price of natural gas which has been on the rise.

Texas accounts for 15% of the U.S. total natural gas consumption and is the country's top natural gas consumer according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration under the Department of Energy. In 2020 the amount of natural gas used for electricity generation was greatest in Texas compared to other states.

So what (or who) exactly is to blame for sky-high electric bills? Cruz says the progressives who champion measures to reduce the impact of climate change are at fault but energy experts say Russia's war on Ukraine is driving up the cost of natural gas which in turn impacts electricity costs. Let's explore.

Biden's campaign promises

Michael Webber University of Texas professor with research specializing in clean energy technology said the article Cruz tweeted undercuts his claim because it attributes rising electricity costs to the price of natural gas with no mention of the Green New Deal.

Webber said the Green New Deal has not passed so it has no influence over the current energy situation. The measure calls for the federal government to take steps to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Webber who responded to Cruz's tweet online called Cruz's claim ""fundamentally flawed.""

But Steve Guest a spokesperson for Cruz said in an email Cruz's tweet ""is completely accurate."" Guest said that Biden's campaign website touts his support for the Green New Deal as ""a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.""

More:Here’s how Joe Biden’s climate plan could affect the oil and gas industry in Texas

Guest pointed to campaign trail and debate stage promises Biden made that aligned with a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Biden paused new oil and gas leases on federal lands but the pause on new leasing did not impact current oil and gas production. In April the Biden administration announced that it would resume selling leases for drilling on public lands — with some limitations on the number of acres available and an increase in fees companies must pay to drill.

Cruz's office noted the jump in natural gas prices between the week Biden took office to the week of May 27 the most recent data at that time through the Energy Information Administration.

Cruz's office attributed this ""in large part because the oil and gas industry cannot access new resources in the natural gas-rich formations in federal lands and offshore areas"" as well as regulatory uncertainty creating a disincentive to invest.

But natural gas extraction was higher in 2021 than in 2020 and the most recent data indicates extraction increased from February to March 2022.

Regardless of the party in power in the White House natural gas extraction has generally been increasing in the past decade except in 2013 2016 and 2020 according to Energy Information Administration data on natural gas gross withdrawals.

""Without a doubt factually production is up"" Webber said. ""It's not that Biden killed production therefore prices are high.""

The Energy Information Administration announced in a June 7 press release it expected high energy prices through 2023 and that the increase in natural gas prices in the upcoming quarter is due to demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas exports and natural gas demand for electricity.

Natural gas prices rising

Carey King assistant director at the University of Texas Energy Institute said North America has been shipping more natural gas abroad over the last few decades. With the U.S. and North America more interconnected in that global trade natural gas prices in Europe and Asia affect prices more in the U.S.

Europe is seeking to import natural gas from countries other than Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Europe is paying more money for natural gas including liquefied natural gas from the United States.

""And if LNG (liquefied natural gas) exporters in the United States can charge a higher price to sell to Europe then they will"" King said. ""Because they're buying at a higher price that affects the price of gas throughout the continent.""

U.S. exporters shipping more to Europe for a higher price puts pressure on natural gas prices in North America King said.

U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to Europe increased this year according to the Energy Information Administration. The U.S. exported 74% of its liquefied natural gas to Europe through April this year compared to the annual average of 34% in 2021. At the same time exports to Asia decreased through April.

While investors could invest in more natural gas infrastructure for production and export King said that could take multiple years — and it's not certain whether natural gas demand from Europe will remain at higher levels.

Our ruling

Cruz tweeted ""The impact of President Biden being beholden to the Green New Deal radicals in his party has electricity costs through the roof in Texas.""

However Green New Deal legislation has not passed. Rising electricity costs are tied to natural gas prices which in turn are impacted by European nations turning away from Russia as a major supplier of natural gas.

We rate this False.

The Obama administration in 2014 had announced a commitment to cut U.S. emissions 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The Trump administration formally withdrew the country from the Paris agreement in late 2020 but the Biden administration upon taking office in January 2021 swiftly reversed that move and subsequently pledged to cut U.S. emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Based on current emissions trends and climate policies however the U.S. is not on track to meet even the Obama administration’s commitment let alone its new and far more ambitious NDC. With two-thirds of the time between 2005 and 2030 having passed national emissions today are only about 15% lower than the 2005 levels. In fact carbon pollution rates had been rising during the Trump administration’s tenure until the COVID pandemic struck.

With eight years remaining before the looming 2030 deadline authors of a new study in the journal Science examine how seven energy system model scenarios envision the U.S.’s ramping up efforts to meet its NDC. In short achieving its commitment would require efforts to dramatically accelerate the deployment of solar panels wind turbines electric vehicles (EVs) trees heat pumps insulation and measures to significantly curb the emissions of other potent greenhouse gases like methane.

What it would take to meet the Biden pledge

The U.S. released 6.6 billion tons (gigatons or Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO 2 )-equivalent greenhouse gases in 2005 about 5.6 Gt in pre-pandemic 2019 and has pledged not to exceed 3.3 Gt of emissions in 2030. That objective means the U.S. needs to reduce its annual emissions a further 2.3 Gt in the next eight years. The Science study incorporated the results of seven separate energy system modeling scenarios that tried to project how the U.S. could achieve that goal:

Consistency among model scenarios

The various model scenarios were fairly consistent in projecting that close to half of the needed reduction – about 1.1 Gt – should come from the electricity sector. That effort would require installing an average of about 60 gigawatts (GW) of combined solar and wind energy per year from now through 2030. For comparison about 33 GW of wind and solar were installed in the U.S. in both 2020 and again in 2021. That’s approximately double the amount of national renewable energy installations in 2015 and the rate would need to approximately double again on average over the subsequent eight years to put the U.S. on track to meet its Paris commitment. At the same time 90 to 100% of American coal power plants would need to retire by 2030.

The models were similarly aggressive in projecting the contribution to the needed emissions cuts from transportation estimating that this sector would have to reduce its annual greenhouse gases by about 600 million tons (Mt) by 2030 (nearly a quarter of the total emissions cuts needed). More than 80% of U.S. transportation sector emissions come from road transport – cars SUVs pickup trucks buses and heavy-duty trucks – all of which could be electrified. Switching to EVs would dramatically reduce transportation emissions especially as the electric grid continues to decarbonize.

Reaching the models’ target would require that EV popularity grow from 4% of U.S. annual new car sales today to 34 to 100% (the model average was 67%) in eight years. Based on current policies EVs are projected to reach around 35 to 40% of new car sales in 2030 and the Biden administration has set a target of boosting that figure to 50%.

The models were consistent in finding that the next-largest emissions cut would likely need to come from potent greenhouse gases like methane and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs which are primarily used for cooling in refrigeration and air conditioning units). Those emissions would need to decrease by around 460 Mt of CO 2 -equivalent by 2030 representing 18% of the reductions required to meet the NDC.

Land sinks would need to sequester about 200 Mt more CO 2 in 2030 than they do today (about 8% of the total cuts needed). Nearly all annual natural carbon sequestration in the U.S. currently comes from tree growth in forests and urban settings. Other approaches to achieve more permanent carbon dioxide removal are being developed but in the near-term reforestation and afforestation are the most promising ways to boost American natural carbon sequestration.

Finally emission reductions from building electrification (primarily transitioning from fossil fuel heating to electric heat pumps) and efficiency (e.g. improving insulation) would need to amount to about 125 Mt per year by 2030 to meet the U.S. NDC according to the average of the model scenarios. Those cuts would represent about 5% of the overall emissions reductions needed.

U.S. Paris commitment technically achievable … with a big BUT

All of the individual sectoral goals outlined above are technically achievable. But based on current policies energy systems models agree that U.S. emissions will decline only modestly between now and 2030 likely falling at least halfway short of its NDC.

The deployment of solar panels wind turbines and EVs could be accelerated through the expansion of existing tax credits such as those included in the House’s Build Back Better legislation last November but since stalemated in the U.S. Senate. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) has been negotiating with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer which could potentially lead to passage of the tax credit expansions sometime this summer.

On the question of potent greenhouse gases the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to soon adopt stricter methane regulations for the oil and gas industry and Manchin says he remains open to the possibility of including a methane pollution fee in a budget reconciliation package. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also recently advanced to the Senate floor the international Kigali Amendment which would phase out HFCs.

The amount of carbon sequestered by U.S. lands has remained steady over the past 15 years but the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law last year included reforestation legislation that could help boost that number. Recent studies from the National Academy of Sciences and published in Science Advances and Global Change Biology conclude that by maximizing its land sinks the U.S. potentially could increase its annual natural CO 2 sequestration by about 1 Gt. The bipartisan infrastructure package also included $3.5 billion for the Weatherization Assistance Program to help low-income households weatherize their homes. That funding could help weatherize about 500000 homes – a good start but only a fraction of a percent of all homes in the U.S.

In short America’s NDC remains within reach but meeting it would require substantial efforts to accelerate the deployment of solar panels wind turbines EVs trees heat pumps and insulation and for the oil and gas industry to reign in its methane leakage problem. Without additional legislative efforts like the tax credits being negotiated by Manchin and Schumer the U.S. will fall well short of its 2030 climate commitment.

As the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded the Paris targets remain technically within reach but political will remains a substantial roadblock in their path.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3JvYWRzaG93L25ld3MvZWxlY3RyaWMtdmFuLWNvbXBhbnktZ29lcy1iYW5rcnVwdC1idXQtdGhlLWlkZWEtYmVoaW5kLWl0LWlzLW5vdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric Van Company Goes Bankrupt but the Idea Behind It Is Solid,"The recent Chapter 7 failure of EV startup ELMS probably encouraged some electric vehicle haters to gloat but electric last-mile delivery trucks remain the strongest immediate bet to my mind in electric vehicles.

The four biggest home delivery fleets in the US -- Amazon UPS FedEx and DHL -- know what the North American Council on Freight Efficiency predicts: An electric last mile van uses about $2000 of energy a year compared to $10000 a year in fuel calculated at $2.98 a gallon. That wasn't enough to save ELMS from its financial ambiguities alleged stock shenanigans and executive departures.

ELMS

The company offered a Class 1 urban delivery van with 110 miles of range at a base price of $28000 and a larger Class 3 chassis that would normally be fitted with a cargo box offering 125 miles of range. Those range numbers would underwhelm any electric car buyer but are actually evidence of why electric delivery vans make sense: They can nail a major work role with easily attained range dovetailing with many other traits of electrification beyond that.

Rewarding grunt

Delivery trucks need ample torque and put it to better use than reaching 60 mph in 2 seconds. Electric motors deliver almost all of their prodigious torque from 1 rpm while gas and even relatively torquey diesel engines have to be coaxed and revved into delivering peak torque.

UPS tapped electric delivery van maker Arrival to start building its fleet of electric last mile trucks at local ""microfactories"" in the US UK and Europe. UPS

Good at going slow

There are few things less efficient than combustion engines which use most of their fuel to generate waste heat rather than move the vehicle they're installed in and slow stop-and-go driving is combustion inefficiency at its worst. But electric powertrains are hardly phased by that driving pattern and remain efficient poking around town. To paraphrase Eric Schmidt the fact that delivery vehicles have been powered by combustion engines is a bug in the course of automotive history.

Routes kill anxiety

There's not much cause for range anxiety if you know exactly where you're going down to the distance number of turns stops traffic conditions and terrain; That kind of knowledge makes it clear if you'll have enough charge and is the kind of planning and analysis that's been part of local trucking for a long time. It's the opposite of the unpredictable driving we do (and imagine we'll do) with our personal cars. And while the charge analysis display on the dash of electric personal cars is just data art to most owners it's highly significant to fleet operators. Electric delivery vans will make it home on a charge or not be sent out in the first place.

Frequent use is key

The high marginal cost of electrification or autonomy are best amortized by using the product as much as possible. Delivery vans work 8 to 12 hours a day rather than sitting parked 95% of their lives their advanced features seldom used. Electric work trucks should return their investment faster than a Tesla Model S Plaid gets out of its own way.

ELMS

Low floors rate high

Remember the last time you moved and how fatiguing it was loading things in and out of that truck? A low flat load floor is a big deal on delivery trucks served well by the flat low-mounted batteries used by most electric vehicles. Dispensing with an engine and its drivetrain also eliminates the ""doghouse"" that often occupies the middle of the cab and can demand a design with an additional step up. Even one step saved getting in and out of the cab when a driver makes a stop can create a more pleasant less fatiguing day and a little more appealing job.

Even when gas was $2.98 a gallon the energy cost difference between electric and gas-engined last mile trucks was stark. NACFE

Delivery fleets get it

Amazon recently announced it would buy up to 100000 electric vans from Rivian though the company will also source them from Ram after Jeff Bezos ribbed Rivian about delivering the vehicles. FedEx will only buy electric delivery vehicles by 2030. UPS has placed an order for 10000 electric delivery vans deploying across the US UK and Europe through 2024. And you might not have even known that a fifth of DHL's delivery van fleet is electric because it uses familiar-looking Ford Transits that are converted by Lightning eMotors.

It's not clear how much Americans will drive as we emerge from the pandemic but local delivery miles have a long way to grow. Doing that work with clean quiet economical last mile vehicles seems like the most obvious priority in the immediate future of electric vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWVldC1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLWluZHVzdHJ5LTMwLXBvd2VyLXBsYXllcnMtMjAyMi020gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the Electric-Vehicle Industry's 30 Power Players,"Insider asked electric-vehicle companies to nominate the industry's most influential leaders.

The automotive industry is barreling toward an electric future with major automakers and startups alike planning to spend some $330 billion on electrification through 2025 alone according to Alix Partners.

It's not just the cars and their propulsion systems that are changing with these massive investments. Every aspect of the automotive ecosystem is morphing from new charging infrastructure and fleet-management operations to changes in the supply chain and recycling pipelines for new materials.

As fuel shortages and US sanctions take their toll and even though electricity generation can be spotty Cubans are turning to smaller cheaper plug-in alternatives.

""Gasoline? Imagine. After 50 years battling to get hold of it I don't even want to smell it anymore!"" taxi driver Sixto Gonzalez 58 told AFP atop the shining electric-blue quadricycle with which he moves through the streets at a top speed of about 40 kilometers (25 miles) per hour.

Gonzalez has abandoned his old combustion-engine car -- one of about 600000 registered on the island of 11.2 million people according to official data.

The last time he tried to fill it up he stood in a queue for eight hours.

By far the majority of cars in circulation in Cuba are American models from the 1950s -- before sanctions started -- and compact Ladas from the Soviet era.

A quadricycle can be bought for between $4000 and $8000 a fraction of the price of a traditional car Yamil LAGE AFP

Newer models are practically impossible to lay one's hands on and come with a hefty price tag of between about $20000 and $100000.

The quadricycle Gonzalez bought by comparison can be obtained for between $4000 and $8000 and though slower can get four or five people from Point A to Point B.

Also increasingly popular are electric motorbikes -- of which there are an estimated 40000 to 50000 in Cuba -- and three-wheelers all the more frequently seen dragging a carriage full of passengers or goods.

'Museum on wheels'

In a once-abandoned Soviet-era truck factory in the central city of Santa Clara about 100 workers of the company Minerva assemble electric vehicles with parts imported from China or Vietnam.

The objective for 2022 is to produce 10000 electric motorbikes Minerva boss Elier Perez told AFP -- double the factory's previous record -- as well as 2000 three-wheelers.

""I had to buy one because the fuel ran out and the queues are endless"" said Raul Suarez a 52-year-old security guard who got himself an electric motorbike.

""I have to be able to get around.""

Not only are cars prohibitively expensive and scarce but public transport in the capital is a daily ordeal for many.

Half of buses are out of service for a lack of tires and batteries that cannot be imported due to US sanctions said transport ministry official Guillermo Gonzalez.

Havanans sometimes wait for hours for a bus to get to work or back home.

At the same time fuel shortages have worsened since the US reinforced its six-decade-old economic blockade of the communist island in 2019 preventing the arrival of fuel tankers from Venezuela a Cuban ally.

Petrol supply plummeted from 100000 barrels a day to about 56000 barrels per day on average in 2021 said Jorge Pinon a Cuban energy policy expert at the University of Texas.

Three years ago the government began to promote the use of electric cars Yamil LAGE AFP

Three years ago the government began to promote the use of electric cars introducing them to state-owned companies to be used by workers.

""Cuba is a museum on wheels"" said Gonzalez of the abundance of decades-old gas guzzlers.

Petrol supply to Cuba plummeted from 100000 barrels a day to about 56000 barrels per day on average in 2021 Yamil LAGE AFP

It is hoped that a rollout of electric cars will lower ""fuel consumption... and at the same time reduce pollution"" he added.

Like a fridge

But electricity supply too is a concern.

For weeks now Cubans have had to deal with regular cuts sometimes lasting hours at a time due to generation failures and maintenance work on thermoelectric plants.

And in a bid to make up some of the shortage the authorities have turned to generators that use up much of the limited diesel stock.

""There has never been a situation as difficult as the one we have now and there are still three months of summer to come"" said Pinon alluding to the annual warm-weather rise in demand for energy to run air conditioners.

Ramses Calzadilla director of strategy at Cuba's energy ministry said he was confident that electricity generation would be restored to full capacity shortly and insisted the situation did not threaten the burgeoning electric vehicle sector.

""An electric motorcycle uses about as much energy as a refrigerator"" he told AFP and can be charged quickly and cheaply between programmed power cuts.

The limited-edition metal cards have been made using materials including 25 per cent airplane metal from Delta Ship #6307.

US-based customers can apply for the special Boeing 747 Delta Skymiles Reserve or Reserve Business cards by August 3 2022 which are available “while stocks last”.

Delta said that the partnership followed “a year of research and development to ensure the airplane metal could work as a functioning credit card that stands up to daily wear and tear”.

A team of metal workers disassembled the jumbo aircraft prepped the aluminium exterior for cleaning and then processed and rolled the metal into thin sheets “to preserve its authenticity”. Layers of polymer print were then added to protect the aluminium.

The carrier said that the retired aircraft “holds special meaning for many Delta customers and employees; this aircraft has provided transport to US service men and women evacuated travellers from Florida during Hurricane Irma united families and friends and transported travellers to bucket-list destinations all over the globe”.

The card also comes with an augmented reality welcome kit enabling cardholders to learn more about the history of the Delta Ship #6307 and the Boeing 747 as well as flight stories and details about the transformation of the airplane metal into a credit card.

Commenting on the news Dwight James SVP of customer engagement and loyalty at Delta and CEO of Delta Vacation said:

“The idea of making a metal credit card out of actual airplane metal began years ago and the creativity and innovation that was required to achieve this is incredibly meaningful.

American Airlines is set to open its largest Admirals Club next week after it shut down for repairs more than six months ago.

The Terminal C Admirals Club at Charlotte will reopen to members on June 24 American Airlines told TPG's Zach Griff on Friday. This comes after it was temporarily closed undergoing what the carrier said were minor repairs.

""Our team in Charlotte is excited to welcome customers back"" airline officials told TPG Friday.

American Airlines first shuttered the Terminal C Admirals Club on Jan. 8 for four to six months to undergo building-mandated updates which included fire safety improvements to meet the latest National Fire Protection Association requirements. The Admirals Club staff in Charlotte told me last month this included sprinkler system updates to the club.

During the closure American planned some additional improvements but not a large-scale overhaul of the Admirals Club which was a club American inherited from US Airways.

Since this lounge is the airport's largest it will not only create immediate additional capacity for travelers but also significantly remove the burden on the only other Admirals Club in Charlotte. In recent months the other much smaller club between gates 3 and 5 in Terminal B has gotten very crowded during peak periods.

During a visit to the Terminal B lounge in May I was among the many travelers who had to wait in line outside the club for several minutes before getting in. Once inside it required a bit of searching to find an empty seat.

Still there's no doubt this club's reopening comes at an ideal time with summer travel season in full swing and airports across the country seeing some of their busiest days. Throw in a day like Friday June 17 when Charlotte saw hundreds of flights canceled or delayed amid operational issues up and down the East Coast – inevitably leading to passengers spending more time in the airport – and there's certainly a need for extra club space.

In addition to being Charlotte's largest Admirals Club it's also far closer than the Terminal B lounge for many travelers moving through the airport. For instance it will mean a much shorter walk to the club for travelers using the airport's E gates many of which connect in Charlotte from a regional flight. Charlotte is also American's second-largest hub so there are a lot of flyers passing through the terminal. It's worth noting that there is a different club closer to that part of the airport – an American Express Centurion Lounge which is an option for travelers who carry The Platinum Card® from American Express.

Bottom line

With more travelers moving through airports than at any other time during the last couple of years the reopening of American Airlines' largest Admirals Club at Charlotte's Terminal C is welcome news for members. Now that the repairs are complete this will help flyers looking to use a lounge between flights and it will relieve congestion at the smaller Terminal B club.

This service extension will allow residents of Vermont’s largest city to travel directly by train to New York City.

Here’s what you need to know!

History of the Ethan Allen Express

Currently the Ethan Allen Express only goes as far north as Rutland Vermont which is approximately 70 miles south of Burlington.

Because Rutland isn’t a major city it’s difficult for customers in Burlington to travel on Amtrak as even its Vermonter route doesn’t serve Burlington directly.

Several years ago Amtrak worked to restore and refurbish the tracks between Rutland and Burlington to allow the Ethan Allen Express to be extended north. This will finally become a reality on July 29 of this year.

Route Timing

The new route was planned to maximize time in New York City during the morning. If you’re in the Big Apple on business you’ll still be able to have a work breakfast or even an early lunch before catching the train home:

Depart New York Penn Station: 2:21 p.m.

Arrive Burlington: 9:55 p.m.

Going the other way you’ll arrive in New York City in the early evening allowing you to check into your hotel and have dinner.

Depart Burlington: 10:10 a.m.

Arrive New York City: 5:45 p.m.

Also as a result of the route extension trains will stop at additional stations — Vergennes and Middlebury — providing additional options for Vermonters.

Once the new route goes into service it’ll stop at the following stations:

New York NY

Yonkers NY

Croton-Harmon NY

Poughkeepsie NY

Rhinecliff NY

Hudson NY

Albany-Rensselaer NY

Schenectady NY

Saratoga Springs NY

Fort Edward-Glens Falls NY

Castleton VT

Rutland VT

Vergennes VT

Middlebury VT

Burlington VT

Onboard Amenities

You can expect the following amenities on your journey between New York and Burlington:

Business Class : Extra legroom and complimentary non-alcoholic beverages in the Cafe Car.

: Extra legroom and complimentary non-alcoholic beverages in the Cafe Car. Cafe Car : Offers to-go style food like sandwiches pizza chips cookies and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.

: Offers to-go style food like sandwiches pizza chips cookies and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Wi-Fi: Complimentary for all passengers.

Fare Sale

While tickets currently aren’t on sale it’s expected that Amtrak will offer 50% off tickets when the train launches within the next several weeks.

Final Thoughts

For Vermonters who have business in New York City — or who simply want to visit — the extension of the Ethan Allen Express will prove to be very valuable.

You’ll be able to travel between the 2 cities in about 8 hours without having to worry about traffic or the expensive airfare we’re seeing across the board.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwb25hcnJpdmluZy5jb20vZXNjYXBlLWxvdW5nZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Escape Lounges Guide: (Cost and Locations) [2022] - UponArriving,"Airport lounges are some of the best places to visit before departing on your journey (or even between flights). They offer great spots to relax and perhaps have a drink or two (or even a meal) amid sometimes hectic traveling times.

There are quite a few different types of airport lounges but one brand of airport lounges you might want to check out are the Escape Lounges.

In this article I will tell you everything you need to know about Escape Lounges including how to get entry what to expect and also provide you a full list of all of the locations in the US and also in the UK.

What are Escape Lounges?

Escape Lounges are airport lounges located around the UK and in certain US states; they are usually found at smaller airports although they are popping up at some larger airports as well.

These lounges offer complimentary food drinks (including alcoholic beverages) high-speed Wi-Fi charging stations and areas to relax and enjoy some comfortable space away from the crowds.

Escape Lounges originated in Manchester in the UK but Escape Lounges expanded to the US in 2015. Since then we have seen more and more popping up and they have even joined the American Express Global Lounge Collection (more on that later).

How do you get access to Escape Lounges ?

American Express Platinum Card

One of the easiest ways to get access is with the American Express Platinum Card. With the Platinum Card you can get access for yourself and for up to two guests. All you have to do is show them your card when you enter and entry will be granted.

The Platinum Card is easily the best credit card for airport lounge access.

In addition to access to Escape Lounges you will get access to the noteworthy Amex Centurion Lounges which are some of the nicest lounges located in the US. More and more of these are popping up around the country so be sure to keep up with the latest lounges in your area.

In addition to Amex Centurion Lounges you will get access to Priority Pass Select lounges. Priority Pass has over 1200 airport lounges located all around the globe.

There has been some overlap with Escape Lounges in the past so that is something to keep an eye out for. For example The BDL and MSP lounges were part of the Priority Pass network but MSP was dropped so now you would gain access to that lounge via your Platinum Card instead of Priority Pass.

The only drawback with the Priority Pass membership is that you don’t get credit for the restaurants that are in the Priority Pass lounge network like you do with other premium cards. So that’s just something to consider.

You can also get access to the Delta Sky Club Lounges whenever you are flying Delta. In addition there are a number of other lounges that you can access with the Platinum and you can read about those here.

Purchasing day passes

Regardless of the airline that you are flying on or the class of your airfare you can purchase a day pass to get admission into an Escape Lounge. There are two different ways you can obtain a day pass. You can purchase a walk up pass or you can book online.

Walk up pass

These lounges allow you to purchase a pass as a walk up guest which basically means you are a guest that did not make prior reservations. If you choose to enter as a walk up guest the entry price will be more expensive. For example in the US you will likely be paying $45 and in the UK you will likely be paying £30.

By the way if you are a AAA member or are a member of the military you should inquire about discounts.

Book online

You can book your passes online and purchase them before you ever arrive at the airport. If you are worried about lounges being at capacity when you visit this is the smartest way to go since you can guarantee yourself a spot at a lounge.

This is also how you can save money.

If you purchase online you will save five US dollars and if you purchase online for a UK lounge you will save £5. Just make sure that you book 24 hours prior to your visit.

It is very easy to go through the booking process. Simply select a date and a time that you plan on entering and then proceed with payment.

If you need to make a change to your booking you may have to pay additional fees.

For example if you needed to make a change to your visit date or perhaps a flight and you made that change at least 48 hours prior to your arrival you may be charged a $10 fee for the change. In that case you would be issued a full refund.

If you make changes outside the 48 hour notice window you will NOT be issued a refund.

Also if for some reason you are not able to attend the booking that you made then you will not be entitled to a refund.

Other forms of membership

You can also get access to the lounges with other types of memberships. For example the following memberships may qualify you for entry: DragonPass Priority Pass Lounge Club Lounge Key Diner’s Club International and TAV.

What type of complimentary food and drinks can you get?

You will receive complimentary food and drinks when you visit Escape Lounges but what type of food can you expect?

When it comes to breakfast you’ll see things like pastries muffins boiled eggs cereals and yogurts. For other parts of the day such as lunch you may find some light snacks sandwiches salads and even pies and soups.

I would advise to check the individual lounge page to see what type of foods are offered at that particular lounge (you can find links to the lounges below). For many lounges you will be able to view both the food and drink menu online.

But to give you an idea of what to expect here’s a look at the food menu at Minneapolis St. Paul.

For the breakfast menu which is served from 4:30 AM to 10:30 AM you will see some common items like muffins grits yogurt but there are also some things like smoked salmon quiche that you don’t always find at other lounges.

The lunch and dinner menu which runs from 10:30 AM to 8 PM has some solid choices like roast beef meatballs and a kale chicken caesar salad. Don’t forget that they also have stations open all day where you can pick up things like boiled eggs hummus cookies and other snacks like trail mix.

Escape Lounge food menu.

In addition to the food you can also get complementary tea coffee soft drinks and even alcoholic drinks at some lounges.

Here’s a look at some of the free drinks you can expect at MSP.

Escape Lounge drink menu.

Notice that you can select from a menu of wines spirits and beer. You’ll find a selection of sparkling wine white wine and red wine including Emerald Bay Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon.

As for spirits you’ll have a broad selection of vodka whiskey tequila gin rum scotch and others. And then for beer you can find both domestic and imported with beers like Coors light and Corona.

There will also be premium drinks available though those will be offered at an additional cost.

Here’s a look at what the premium drink menu might look like. Prices range from about $5 to $9 depending on what you are interested in. You will see more recognizable names under the premium spirits menu like Grey Goose Patron Don Julio Captain Morgan Hennessy and others.

Although I don’t drink myself I’ve heard good things about the specialty cocktails at these lounges.

If you are in need of gluten-free items ask a staff member upon arriving and they may be able to hook you up with something. You can also find out details about the local chefs and get some culinary insight on the lounge’s webpage.

Escape Lounge FAQ

Can you bring in kids? Kids are welcome in the lounges.



Children under the age of 23 months receive complimentary entry to Escape Lounges US locations. Children 24 months and older are required to pay the adult entry price.



Passengers wishing to bring children into the lounge must email the lounge or [email protected] to inform them of the location date time number of children and ages of children. How does group access work? If you are traveling with a large group then you should know that groups larger than six people are not permitted in the lounge without prior authorization. If you would like to request authorization for a large group simply send an email to: [email protected].



Keep in mind that the lounge cannot guarantee that your entire group can sit together and space is often on a first come first serve basis in these lounges.



Just note that the group cancellation policy works a little bit different from the normal cancellation policy. If you have bookings of six or more people you will need to provide seven or more days notice before the date of arrival to get a free refund and you will still be subject to a $10 cancellation fee per guest. You will not receive a refund for group bookings that provide less than seven days notice. Is there a dress code? The lounges state that there is a dress code to adhere to smart casual or business attire at all times and they reserve the right to refuse entry to any person who may be dressed in a way that they deem inappropriate.



Interestingly shorts above the knee and sports jerseys are not permitted or any other clothing that they think will offend other guests. They also state that men’s shoulders should be covered at all times so no tank tops.



Lounges often don’t enforce dress codes too strictly so as long as you look presentable you probably don’t have anything to worry about.



But it never hurts to comply with dress codes so that you don’t have to worry about anything and if you are worried about not getting access then you can always call ahead and inquire about how strictly the dress code is enforced in practice. How long can I stay in the lounge? The amount of time you can spend in the lounge depends on the lounge you were visiting and the location.



For lounges in the US the website states:



Your booking entitles you to a single visit for the entire calendar day booked in the Escape Lounges from the time of booking or walk-in until the closing time of the lounge.



But for lounges in the UK the website states:



Your Booking entitles you to a single visit in the Escape Lounge of up to 3 hours from the booked time of arrival at the Lounge.



So just make sure that you are mindful of the differences between the different locations. Are animals allowed? You are not allowed to bring in animals or pets of any kind. However the exception is if you are bringing in service animals per ADA regulations. Can I get intoxicated? It is okay to let loose a little in the lounge and have a few drinks before your flight. In fact that is sort of the whole point of lounges for a lot of people. They want to create an inviting place to feel relaxed before hopping on board and traveling.



But there is a fine line between having a good time and getting inebriated. The terms state “[a]ny Guest whose behavior is disruptive disrespectful or inappropriate for any other reason in our sole discretion may be removed from the Lounge.” So basically just act with common sense and decency and you will have nothing to worry about.

Final word

Escape Lounges are great airport lounges and they are expanding around the US and the UK. They definitely add some nice value to the Platinum Card lounge access network and can be a great break from the crowds at some of these less trafficked airports."

The insurgent-turned-ruling group seized power last August and installed an all-male interim administration following the end of almost 20 years of U.S.-led foreign military intervention in the war-torn South Asian country.

“As far as recognition by foreign countries is concerned I think the United States is the biggest obstacle” chief Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said when asked to explain whether his group’s policies or any country was responsible for the delay in winning the legitimacy.

“It [America] does not allow other countries to move in this direction and has itself not taken any step on this count either” he said while responding to reporters’ questions via a Taliban-run WhatsApp group for reporters.

Mujahid claimed that the Taliban had met “all the requirements” for their government to be given diplomatic recognition.

He asserted all countries including the United States need to realize that political engagement with the Taliban is in “everyone’s interest.” It would allow the world to formally discuss “the grievances” they have with the Taliban.

Mujahid insisted Taliban leaders “want better” bilateral ties with the U.S. in line with the agreement the two countries signed in Doha Qatar in February 2020. Washington also needs to move toward establishing better ties with Kabul he said.

""We were enemies and fighting the United States so long as it had occupied Afghanistan. That war has ended now.”

No recognition

No country has yet recognized the Taliban as legitimate rulers of the country mainly over their harsh treatment of Afghan women and girls. The group is also being pressed to govern the country through a broad-based political system where all Afghan groups have their representation to ensure long-term national stability.

Since taking control of Afghanistan 10 months ago the Taliban have suspended secondary education for most teenage girls and prevented female staff in certain government departments from returning to their duties.

The Ministry for Vice and Virtue tasked with interpreting and enforcing the Taliban’s version of Islam has ordered women to wear face coverings in public. Women are barred from traveling beyond 70 kilometers unless accompanied by a male relative.

The Taliban have rejected calls for removing the curbs on women and Mujahid also defended them. “The orders… regarding women are in accordance with [Islamic] Shariah and these are the rules of Shariah” he asserted.

The Taliban are “religiously"" obliged to implement Islamic Sharia to counter practices that Islam prohibits Mujahid said without elaborating.

""Hopefully Afghan women will also not make demands for things that are against the principles of Islam.”

Afghanistan’s immediate neighbors and regional countries also have urged Taliban authorities to ease their restrictions on women before they could consider opening formal ties with Kabul.

“[An] inclusive ethnopolitical government should be the first step toward this. We make no secret of this and we say so outright to our Afghan partners” Zamir Kabulov Russian special envoy for Afghanistan said earlier this week when asked whether Moscow was close to giving the Taliban legitimacy.

Additionally scholars in many Islamic countries have disapproved of the Taliban’s ban on female education and other policies limiting women’s access to public life.

Al-Qaida presence

Mujahid claimed neither al-Qaida nor any of its members are present in the country saying they all left Afghanistan for their native countries after the October 2001 U.S.-led military invasion.

Washington blames leaders of the terrorist network for plotting the September 11 2001 attacks on America from the then-Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.

At the time only three countries — Pakistan Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — had recognized the Taliban. During their rule from 1996-2001 the group had completely banned women from public life and girls from receiving an education leading to Afghanistan’s diplomatic isolation.

Mujahid reiterated Kabul’s resolve that it will not allow anyone to threaten the U.S. and its allies by using Afghan soil. “We are ready for this but only if further steps are taken to build mutual trust and strengthen political ties.”

A United Nations report said last month the Taliban continued to maintain close ties with al-Qaida pointing to the reported presence of the network's “core leadership” in eastern Afghanistan including its leader Ayman al-Zawahri.

The report noted however that neither al-Qaida nor the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) “is believed to be capable of mounting international attacks before 2023 at the earliest regardless of their intent or of whether the Taliban acts to restrain them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzE5L3NwYWNleC1wZW50YWdvbi1lbG9uLW11c2stc3BhY2UtZGVmZW5zZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pentagon Studies Use of SpaceX for Rocket-Deployed Forces,"The Pentagon envisions a future in which Elon Musk’s rockets might someday deploy a “quick reaction force” to thwart a future Benghazi-style attack according to documents obtained by The Intercept via Freedom of Information Act request.

In October 2020 U.S. Transportation Command or USTRANSCOM the Pentagon office tasked with shuttling cargo to keep the American global military presence humming announced that it was partnering with Musk’s SpaceX rocketry company to determine the feasibility of quickly blasting supplies into space and back to Earth rather than flying them through the air. The goal according to a presentation by Army Gen. Stephen Lyons would be to fly a “C-17 [cargo plane] equivalent anywhere on the globe in less than 60 minutes” an incredible leap forward in military logistics previously confined to science fiction. A USTRANSCOM press release exclaimed that one day SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket could “quickly move critical logistics during time-sensitive contingencies” and “deliver humanitarian assistance.” While the Pentagon alluded to potentially shuttling unspecified “personnel” through these brief space jaunts the emphasis of the announcement was squarely on moving freight.

But USTRANSCOM has more imaginative uses in mind according to internal documents obtained via FOIA. In a 2021 “Midterm Report” drafted as part of its partnership with SpaceX USTRANSCOM outlined both potential uses and pitfalls for a fleet of militarized Starships. Although SpaceX is already functionally a defense contractor launching American military satellites and bolstering Ukrainian communication links the report provides three examples of potential future “DOD use cases for point to point space transportation.” The first perhaps a nod to American anxieties about Chinese hegemony notes that “space transportation provides an alternative method for logistics delivery” in the Pacific. The second imagines SpaceX rockets delivering an Air Force deployable air base system “a collection of shelters vehicles construction equipment and other gear that can be prepositioned around the globe and moved to any place the USAF needs to stand-up air operations.”

Credit: U.S. Transportation Command

But the third imagined use case is more provocative and less prosaic than the first two titled only “Embassy Support” scenarios in which a “rapid theater direct delivery capability from the U.S. to an African bare base would prove extremely important in supporting the Department of State’s mission in Africa” potentially including the use of a “quick reaction force” a military term for a rapidly deployed armed unit typically used in crisis conditions. The ability to merely “demonstrate” this use of a SpaceX Starship the document notes “could deter non-state actors from aggressive acts toward the United States.” Though the scenario is devoid of details the notion of an African embassy under sudden attack from a “non-state actor” is reminiscent of the infamous 2012 Benghazi incident when armed militants attacked an American diplomatic compound in Libya spurring a quick reaction force later criticized as having arrived too late to help.

As much as American generals may be dreaming of rocket-borne commandos fighting off North African insurgents experts say this scenario is still squarely the stuff of sci-fi stories. Both Musk and the Pentagon have a long history of making stratospherically grand claims that dazzling and entirely implausible technologies whether safe self-driving cars and hyperloop or rail guns and missile-swatting lasers are just around the corner. As noted in another USTRANSCOM document obtained via FOIA request all four Starship high-altitude tests resulted in the craft dramatically exploding though a May 2021 test conducted after the document’s creation landed safely.

“What are they going to do stop the next Benghazi by sending people into space?” said William Hartung a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute who focuses on the U.S. arms industry and defense budget. “It doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense.” Hartung questioned the extent to which a rocket-based quick reaction force would be meaningful even if it were possible. “If a mob’s attacking an embassy and they dial up their handy SpaceX spaceship it’s still going to take a while to get there. … It’s almost like someone thinks it would be really neat to do stuff through space but haven’t thought through the practical ramifications.” Hartung also pointed to the Pentagon’s track record of space-based “fantasy weapons” like “Star Wars” missile defense elaborate projects that soak up massive budgets but amount to nothing.

SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. In an email to The Intercept USTRANSCOM spokesperson John Ross wrote that “interest in PTP deployment is explorative in nature and our quest for understanding what may be feasible is why we’ve entered into cooperative research and development agreements like the one you reference” adding that “the speed of space transportation promises the potential to offer more options and greater decision space for leaders and dilemmas for adversaries.” Asked when USTRANCOM believes a rocket-deployed quick reaction force might actually be feasible Ross said the command is “excited for the future and believe it’s possible within the next 5-10 years.”

“My two cents are that it’s unlikely that they would be able to evacuate anyone quickly via rocket” said Kaitlyn Johnson deputy director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Aerospace Security Project. Johnson pointed out that even if the underlying technology were sound the small question of where to land an enormous 165-foot Starship rocket the world’s largest remains. “If it’s in a city it’s not like they can land [a] Starship next to the embassy.” In the hypothetical embassy rescue mission “you still have logistics issues there about getting forces onto the launch vehicle and then again on where you could land the vehicle and how to get the forces from the landing site to the base/embassy” Johnson added “which has not been tested or proven and in my opinion is a bit sci-fi.”

“What are they going to do stop the next Benghazi by sending people into space? It doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense.”

The document also nods at another potential hitch: Are other countries going to let SpaceX military rockets drop out of space and onto their turf? The unrealized vision of American “Starship Troopers” is not a new one: As far back as the 1950s Nazi rocket scientist turned American space hero Wernher Von Braun pondered transporting U.S. troops via rocket and in the 1960s defense contractor Douglas Aircraft pitched “Project Ithacus” a spacecraft carrying 1200 soldiers to their destination in an hour. More recently according to one 2006 Popular Science report the Pentagon has dreamed of an age in which “Marines could touch down anywhere on the globe in less than two hours without needing to negotiate passage through foreign airspace.” But the USTRANSCOM paper admits that Cold War-era treaties governing the use of space provide little guidance as to whether an American rocket could bypass sovereign airspace concerns by cruising through outer space. “It remains unclear whether and how vehicles are subject to established aviation laws and to what extent if any these laws follow them into space for PTP space transportation” reads one section. “Moreover the lack of a legal definition of the boundary between air and space creates an issue of where the application of aviation law ends and space law begins.” The document does hint that part of SpaceX’s promise could be to leap over these concerns. Following a redacted discussion of a hypothetical military Starship’s legal status while in flight USTRANSCOM noted: “This recovery places the Starship outside of altitudes typically characterized as controlled airspace.”

Brian Weeden director of program planning for the Secure World Foundation a space governance think tank told The Intercept that territorial concerns are just one of many “along with whether or not the countries the rocket/spaceship pass over regard it as a weapon or ballistic missile threat or not.” Hartung argued that SpaceX despite its “Mr. Clean” image as a peaceful enabler for cosmic exploration is contributing to the global militarization of space. And as with drones once an advanced and exclusively American technology begins proliferating the U.S. will have to face its implications from the other side. “The question is what would keep other countries from doing the same thing and how would the U.S. feel about that?” asked Hartung. “This notion that going anywhere without having to get any approval from anybody has appeal from a military point of view but would the U.S. want other countries to have that same capability? Probably not.”",,,,,,,,,

It lies along a highway that saw some of history's most memorable names – Caesar Charlemagne and Napoleon just to name a few. In the 20th Century Hitler's Wehrmacht also used the road to capture the Netherlands and Belgium and bring them into the Nazi Reich.

What rests there now is a memorial and cemetery to those who fought to liberate the country from the grip of the Nazi war machine. The locals have never forgotten who died there and from the looks of things they never will.

The cemetery is meticulously well kept. A memorial tower overlooks a reflecting pool and at the base of the tower is the stature of a mother grieving over her lost son. Elsewhere on the grounds is a list of the battles and operations fought by U.S. servicemen during World War II the names of those 8301 men buried on the grounds and the names of those 1722 who went missing while fighting in the Netherlands.

Among the honored dead are seven Medal of Honor recipients and a Major General. In all it's a remarkable site with historic significance. The most significant thing about the 65-acre Netherlands American Cemetery is who takes care of each American gravestone.

Since 1945 the Dutch people in the area have adopted individual graves keeping the site clean and maintaining the individual memorials. They ensure that flowers adorn their adopted grave and that the name and deeds of the American interred there are never forgotten. They actually research the entire life of their adopted fallen GI. Some of them adopt more than one. ""Ever since the end of WWII people have adopted the graves of these men and women out of a deeply heartfelt gratitude for the sacrifices that they made for our freedom"" local Sebastiaan Vonk told an Ohio newspaper. ""They truly are our liberators and heroes."" The Foundation for Adopting Graves at the American Cemetery Margraten has 300 people waiting to join them.

The American Cemetery is one of the largest in the world. Its upkeep and memory are so important to the locals whose families saw the horrors of Nazi occupation. Even those separated by the 1945 liberation of the Netherlands by a generation or more still hold those names dear and are taking their remembrance project one step further – remembering their face.

A new effort The Faces of Margraten seeks to collect photos of the men who died or went missing in liberating the Netherlands from Nazi occupation. On Dutch Memorial Day the group displays personal photos of more than 3000 of those interred in the cemetery holding an event that ""brings visitors face-to-face with their liberators.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuY2lnYXJhZmljaW9uYWRvLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FtZXJpY2Etcy1jaWdhci1mcmllbmRseS1jYXNpbm9z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's Cigar-Friendly Casinos,"Arizona

AWK,American Water Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2huZXdzL2FydGljbGUvZWY4bjN5NWkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Six reasons why high-tech companies are laying off employees,"It was clear to everyone that this moment would come and yet 2022 caught the high-tech industry by surprise. After several prosperous years of spending money without limits on recruiting employees obtaining real estate in dreamy locations improving conditions and lavish parties technology companies were forced to suddenly slam on the brakes and quickly recalculate their route. The first pressure came from the ""people with the money"" some of whom are veterans with lots of experience with crises such as the giant American fund Sequoia which demanded that companies start making immediate cuts and adjust to the crisis that was occurring. High-tech companies in the United States were quick to respond and fired about 20000 workers in a very short time. Giant companies such as Robinhood and Coinbase which are on the seam between high-tech and the capital market fired thousands in one day. Giant companies such as Meta and Intel whose stability is not feared have also announced a freeze on recruitment.

The layoffs in the U.S. were accompanied by declining investment and growing investor anxiety. Even Alon Musk tweeted that the company he intended to acquire must cut its workforce quickly. Later as usual he hurried to calm everyone down but the message of the crisis had already been received.

In Israel at least for now these concerns have not had the same impact. So far relatively fewer workers have been laid off here and it is estimated that the number of layoffs amounts to a few hundred - and a large part of them have already been absorbed back into an industry that still needs quality workers.

However it is important to examine the reasons that led several Israeli companies to lay off workers quickly. These reasons clarify the pressures that will be exerted on the Israeli technology market and indicate the possible direction of the high-tech industry in the near future.

1. Investors are piling the pressure - and the company wants to show initiative.

Investors like to see that the company in which they invested takes initiative and is not passive in the face of the crisis even if its coffers are full of cash. Israeli company OpenWeb whose executives sit in the U.S. very close to the company's investors is an example of such pressured layoffs. The company which the software it developed allows for dialogue on content sites raised $150 million last November alone. The company did not lack money and yet it laid off 14 research and development workers and reduced its workers' salaries by about 20% while guaranteeing a bonus.

The laying off of 14 employees is a drop in the bucket and will not affect the balance sheet dramatically. If OpenWeb was in real trouble the number of laid off employees would be many dozens. So why is it happening? In this case the main factor was the physical presence in the United States where the level of panic is much higher than that of Israeli funds for example. A quick layoff move is evidence that the company has ""a hand on the pulse"" and has power in reassuring investors.

At the same time OpenWeb has announced that it is preparing for the future and is even hiring new employees to increase its revenue through advertising. How does this make sense? Well here too lies a message directed both inside and outside the company: our employees have nothing to fear and no need to look for opportunities outside and our investors have nothing to worry about. We are moving in the direction of increasing revenue.

The company's CEO Nadav Shoval said: “The changes in the markets require every company even those with cash reserves to make difficult decisions re-examine investments and focus on ensuring growth. We have decided to invest more in the great opportunities we have in advertising and data products at the expense of other investments.""

2. There are excess fats - and this is an opportunity to re-examine the business focus as well

Many companies have accumulated quite a bit of fat in recent years. The marketing departments were filled with employees consultants assistants and content people. Start-ups hired workers even when there was no immediate need for them simply because the demand and competition for quality workers was insane. The development departments felt they were in a battle with all the other companies and hired every employee that could be hired.

The result was that many companies grew from a few dozen employees to hundreds in a very short time. Some of them have as a result encountered difficulty in building an organizational culture or assimilating orderly work processes among the employees of the inflated company.

The atmosphere of the crisis now allows them to think deeply about the hiring of workers that have already happened and to examine whether the current period can be utilized to reduce the workforce without compromising important positions. Elementor for example which is one of the world's leading companies in the development of WordPress sites has laid off about 50 employees which is about 10% of the workforce. In a statement issued by the company it stressed that mainly marketing people and not development people were fired. In the case of Elementor the core business has been maintained and it gave up on rapid expansion.

Yoni Luxenberg CEO of the company and one of the founders: “We made a difficult decision to say goodbye to some talented and good colleagues. The global situation is changing and there is an increase in inflation and an economic slowdown. We have embarked on a process of organizational change to streamline some areas of the company but at the same time continue to increase the supply of products to ensure success and growth for years to come.""

The Israeli cyber company Deep Instinct which laid off about 40 sales people in the United States also turned cutting out the excess fat into an opportunity for a change in business focus: selling technology to large organizations at the expense of small and medium-sized organizations. The company said: ""A strategic decision has been made to focus on huge organizations in which the company is successful. There are no and will not be layoffs in Israel or other departments and we continue to recruit employees.”

3. IPO is on the horizon - and it's time to signal to future investors

Cybereason is one of the most successful cyber companies in Israel. Still earlier this month it decided to lay off 100 employees most of them overseas. Why? Company insiders have made it clear that the layoffs are part of Cybereason’s preparations for a forthcoming IPO. The company submitted documents to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this year en route to a possible IPO in New York. Dismissals on the eve of an IPO are a familiar procedure and a step that signals to future investors that the company will reach them with a suitable workforce and only the best people.

4. The giants are not afraid - but understand that the mood in the markets is changing

In Israel there are about 350 development centers of multinational companies. In fact any notable company in Silicon Valley New York or Europe has an innovation center a development center and even a business center here. These centers are responsible for employing about 50% of the high-tech industry in Israel and in the opinion of many are also responsible for the soaring costs of the workers. Companies like Google Meta Amazon or Intel are able to offer employees salaries that very few young companies can offer and the growing competition has led giants to add thousands of employees in recent years.

But even the giant companies have realized that the coming years will probably not be easy. Intel has announced a temporary halt to staff recruitment in some divisions Meta has announced a halt to staff recruitment and other companies are slowing down the rate of recruitment. Will they also lay off workers? The assessment is that it will not happen so fast. Most of them will have a very difficult time recruiting them anew in the future and the layoffs also have a heavy internal organizational cost. Therefore it is estimated that most large companies will be satisfied with stopping the flow of recruitments in Israel in order to examine in depth the real needs. Small development centers on the other hand that are far from the heart of parent companies' activities can become a burden and eventually close as has happened in quite a few cases in the past.

5. The case of AVO - investors want a path to profitability

In the pre-2022 era many entrepreneurs set up companies with models relying mainly on investor money hoping that in the long run it would pay off. Many companies in the field of mobility for example still lose money on their customers with most of the funding falling on investors. One such company is AVO which has developed a model of fast deliveries to companies and residential buildings. Its model was built on accumulating a mass of customers in each region so that both the cost of shipping and the cost of retail products would result in a profit.

The company arrived at the start of the year after raising too little money from leading investors such as Kleiner Perkins and Insight. Its executives led by Dekel Valtzer realized that without drastic measures the company would not survive so within a short time most of AVO’s hundreds of employees in Israel and New York were fired leaving only about 20 employees who should serve as a future skeleton for the company - on the very optimistic assumption that a profitable model will one day be found.

The case of AVO is a clear indication of a change in investors' perception: they want to see a real revenue-based business model with an outline that leads to profitability. In the crowded worlds of deliveries and mobility only a few companies will be able to present such a model. AVO and the like will probably not be among them.

6. The future is not clear yet - so whoever burns cash becomes redundant

Many times the response in Israel to crises is late. If in the United States employees are fired by email when their personal objects are already waiting at the entrance to the office in Israel the sensitivity to those laid off is higher and many companies see this as a last resort. They will prefer to reduce welfare budgets or temporarily cut the salaries of employees and management. Therefore large waves of layoffs and company closures will come only when companies that try to raise money will run into a wall and realize that they have no choice but to significantly cut the workforce.

And not just difficulty raising money will serve as a pretext. Similar to OpenWeb which chose the not-so-easy step of firing R&D people many companies will prefer in difficult days to focus only on sales which provide revenue. Everything else will be pushed aside. The name of the game in the near future is cash and whoever burns a lot of cash may become redundant. In contrast those who produce cash are of critical importance to the organization.

And yet they continue to recruit - because it is clear to everyone that good workers will remain rare

And even after all this recruitments of tech workers in Israel aren’t expected to stop. Very few quality R&D workers and good sales people will remain unemployed for long. The thirst for development workers is still huge and many companies are indicating that they are looking for workers.

Assaf Rappaport for example CEO of the cyber company Wiz told Calcalist that he is thirsty for development workers and does not even expect a drop in wages.





Yuval Tal one of the top fintech entrepreneurs in the country also does not believe that we will see many high-tech people unemployed. Quite a few companies - for example the American giant KLA - as well as many cyber companies continue to recruit employees even today.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He is a visionary Icelandic doctor and a quarter century ago he had an ambitious idea: to use his native country a volcanic island near the Arctic circle as a giant laboratory to examine the essence of human beings. Since then more than half the population some 180000 volunteers have responded to Stefánsson’s call. His company deCODE has analyzed all of their DNA revealing thousands of genetic variants linked to common illnesses including cancer and Alzheimers. Francis Collins ex-director of the United States’ National Institutes of Health calls Stefánsson’s findings “the language of God.”

Reykjavik’s strange sunlight filters through the window and Stefánsson reflects pensive on the religious metaphor. After 20 long seconds of silence the doctor begins to speak. “I have difficulties with the kind of God Francis Collins believes in. If I were to run into the God Francis Collins believes in on the street today the omnipotent God who can do everything I would probably tell him that he was an unbelievable asshole. Why do you let war happen? Why do you let young children die?” he inquires gazing into space as if he were speaking to a god present in the room.

A few meters below Stefánsson’s feet there is an immense freezer chamber at 24 degrees Celsius below zero in which robot hands handle tubs with blood samples from those 180000 generous Icelanders who have offered their blood and medical history to a for-profit private company. Since 1996 deCODE has discovered thousands of risk factors for illness as well as some genetic keys to the human personality which have been published in the world’s best scientific journals.

Everything is nearby in Reykjavik. A few minutes’ walk from Stefánsson’s office is Iceland’s National Museum. An ancient manuscript recounts that Norwegian vikings settled in the island in the year 874. Near the museum’s entrance below a glass panel in the floor lies the skeleton of one of the island’s first inhabitants: a warrior buried with his imposing sword and his horse. The halls are lined with Viking drinking horns images of fantastic creatures and references to forgotten deities like Thor and Odin who once terrorized humanity and now only demonstrate as Stefánsson says that gods are human inventions.

The Spanish geneticist Carles Lalueza a long-time collaborator of deCODE and director of Barcelona’s Natural Science Museum notes half-joking that “as incredible as it seems all Icelanders are related.” He’s not exaggerating. Some 10000 people–largely Viking men from contemporary Norway and women abducted from the British isles–settled on the island over just six decades after 874. Almost all current-day Icelanders can trace their family tree to one of those pioneers. Stefánsson for example says he is a descendant of Egill Skallagrimsson a man born in 910 who was one of the great Icelandic poets and as the doctor tends to joke one of the island’s ugliest inhabitants. The lack of genetic diversity has made Iceland an ideal place to look for the DNA errors that produce human illnesses.

Stefánsson ruminates on his thoughts about death. One of his company’s most recent advancements is a method to predict a person’s death in five years. The researchers followed 23000 Icelanders for 14 years measuring the blood levels of thousands of proteins. The new tool was able to classify people in their sixties and seventies according to their proximity to death. In the group classified as high-risk 88% of participants died. In the low-risk group only 1% passed away. Stefánsson recognizes that this ability to predict someone’s death is “chilling.”

The doctor receives EL PAÍS after a visit to his facilities organized and paid by Amgen the American pharmaceutical company that bought deCODE for €320 million in 2012. The Icelandic company couldn’t figure out how to convert its scientific discoveries into capital. In 2009 when the entire Nordic country sank in an economic crisis that ended up with dozens of corrupt financiers in prison the company fell into bankruptcy. Stefánsson is a peculiar and controversial entrepreneur: he speaks more about poetry than business. He argues that a good scientist should read at least 50 novels every year. “The equipment you think with is your language. And to be able to think anything new you have to be good at using language. You have to be an acrobat of language” he says.

Stefánsson says that he is sad and depressed. Six months ago his wife of 53 years died. He is still “learning to live without her.” The doctor who usually spends his vacations in Spain and adores poets like Antonio Machado and Octavio Paz writes poetry to move through his pain. He asks himself a question out loud: “What is life?” He responds without lyricism: “Life are all self-assembling systems that contain DNA allow DNA to replicate and on the basis of the replicated DNA form other self-assembly system of the same kind.”

To Stefansson that is all. DNA the molecule with the instructions to form a human being from a fertilized egg just wants to multiply itself. It is a recipe written in carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus that commands every human cell. “It is clear that DNA does not exist to serve the life forms. The life forms exist to serve DNA. They exist to allow DNA to persist on Earth. Preservation of DNA is the purpose of life” he explains with a bitter smile. “That’s not very romantic but there is no God. Which is unfortunate because it would be really convenient to have one” he adds ironically.

Stefansson remembers a poem he wrote one day in 1996 when the birth of Dolly the sheep the first mammal cloned from another animal’s adult cell led him to reframe the meaning of life. “Where do I find lost in the brightness of a sunlit day the happiness of an unhappy man fortunate only to be just one copy of himself. Everything else stinks” he recites gesticulating.

Stefansson’s scientific production is unmatched. He has authored 5% of the studies published in the journal Nature Genetics in the last decade. But humanity is more complex than he had imagined when he founded deCODE. In 2003 Stefansson proclaimed that he hoped to develop “at least 10″ pharmaceuticals through his discoveries of genetic variants associated with illnesses. They still don’t exist. “There are things in development now who I hope will make it to the market sooner or later” the doctor says.

The challenge is massive. The scientific community has known since 1980 that certain DNA mutations in a gene called KRAS cause cancer in millions of people. But the first KRAS inhibitor medication reached hospitals only last year. Sotorasib developed by Amgen inhibits a specific mutation called KRAS G12C that is involved in 13% of non-small-cell lung cancer cases the most common lung tumor. Biochemist Ray Deshaies scientific vice-president of Amgen explained at a Reykjavik press conference that “[the delay of over three decades] wasn’t because we didn’t know what we wanted to do which was inhibit the mutation in KRAS it’s just that we had no idea how to do it.”

Stefansson stretches his arms over the table. -”It’s easier to get a man to the Moon than to make a really good drug. But nevertheless the industry does it” he says. The doctor recalls the case of AIDS caused by a virus detected in 1983 which has killed over 36 million people but now can be controlled with a single daily pill. “Which is beautiful. You have to admit that. So even though the pharmaceutical industry is a little bit annoying it at least stands out” he observes.

Amgen is one of the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world with earnings of €7 billion last year. Its price policy has become controversial in recent years: the drug blinatumomab which fights an aggressive form of leukemia appeared on the US market in 2014 for €145000 per patient becoming one of the most expensive cancer medications in the world.

Biologist Robert Bradway Amgen’s executive director affirmed in a Reyjavik press conference that not even one out of every 10 experimental drugs which seem promising in animals work in human trials. “Mice are wonderful. The problem with mice is that they are mice. They always have been and always will be mice. And mice are not terribly good at predicting what will happen in humans so what might work as a cure for obesity in mice may not work as a cure for obesity in humans” Bradway lamented. The majority of genetic variants discovered by deCODE only barely increase the risk of suffering from an illness: there are 3000 associated with obesity for example. But some of those mutations can reveal the mechanisms behind a pathology. That’s why Amgen decided to buy the Icelandic company in 2012.

Bradway repeats a statistic common in the pharmaceutical industry: developing a drug takes 15 years and €2.3 billion. Those data points are debated by some organizations such as the Swiss Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative which has invested only €55 million to develop an effective drug against sleeping sickness. In 2021 Amgen’s executive director earned over €20 million 166 times as much as the company’s average employee according to public data from the organization.

Kari Stefansson admits the industry has its shadows. “There is certainly a certain conflict between the private or the for-profit companies that are making drugs and the public interest. I can however tell you that there’s much more of common interest than you may think” he says. The doctor remembers that weeks before Covid-19 forced humanity to shelter in their homes he called the directors of Amgen to ask them for permission to research the novel coronavirus. “For heaven’s sake do it” they answered. His data demonstrated early on that half of the people infected were asymptomatic and that children rarely got sick. Iceland resisted the terrifying first wave of Covid much better than other countries.

The Icelandic doctor does however have enemies in high places. Bioethics expert Henry Greely director of Stanford University’s Center for Law and Biosciences has publicly spoken against Stefansson’s “notably abrasive” personality accusing him of taking advantage of Icelanders without sharing the earnings. On the other hand Icelandic economist Svala Gudmundsdottir has praised the deCODE founder’s “well-known generosity” after he donated expensive medical equipment to Rekjavik’s university hospital and for carrying out massive Covid tests free of charge.

The Icelandic company has the DNA of entire families on the island. The data analysis has revealed surprising keys to human personality. Stefansson speaks of “genetic nurture”: a parent’s genes including those that their children do not inherit mark a person’s destiny. The genes that you don’t have affect your grades in school the age when you have your first child your cholesterol levels and the number of cigarettes you smoke. “I think that our free will is extraordinarily limited. You’re genetically programmed to want certain things and you’re genetically programmed not to want other things” Stefansson claims. “So I think free will is an illusion.”

American Bobby Fischer right plays chess with Soviet Boris Spassky in Reykjavik in 1972.

One of the best chess players in history the American Bobby Fischer moved to Iceland in 2005 fleeing from his country’s authorities who sought to punish him for violating sanctions against Yugoslavia after participating in a friendly tournament in 1992. His escape to the Nordic island wasn’t a coincidence. Fischer had been an idol there since 1972 when he defeated the Soviet Boris Spassky in the midst of the Cold War. The encounter was a nuclear battle over a chess board. When he returned to Iceland over three decades later sick and close to death Bobby Fischer became friends with Kari Stefansson.

The 62-year-old master had lost his mind victim of “a sort of paranoid psychosis” as the Icelander recalls obsessed with Jews black people and women. Despite it all the two new friends spent time together in Reykjavik occasionally having “marvelous” conversations. The Icelandic documentary Me and Bobby Fischer (Fridrik Gudmundsson 2010) shows some of those memorable talks. In one of them from a moving car the chess player rants about genetic research and compares it to the work of physicists who brought about the atomic bomb. The discussion a veritable philosophy class ends in shouts even though Stefansson began trying to make amends.

—What we are doing in my company is simply trying to discover what life is about we are not manipulating it in any way.

—Just like the scientists were trying to discover what the atom is all about and look where it has led.

—That has led to deeper understanding…

—It has led to stockpiling hydrogen bombs!

—That’s not the consequence of that.

—Yeeeeeeees.

—That is the consequence of evil exploitation of stupid people.

—The…

—Listen to me! If you are gonna try to put a ban on the discovery of new knowledge you are beginning to control the world in an unpredictable manner because you don’t know what the knowledge is until it has been discovered! So how are you going to control what we can discover?

Stefánsson remembers those discussions now. Since Bobby Fischer’s death in 2008 deCODE has continued to illuminate human beings’ genetic secrets thanks to the 180000 Icelandic volunteers and two million other people from around the world who have participated. Other countries including the United Kingdom have also begun large-scale attempts to read their citizens’ DNA. “Knowledge in and of itself is never an evil” Stefansson insists. After a quarter-century discovering genetic differences among human beings the Icelandic doctor is left with a lesson from his remote volcanic island: “We should have to remember that we are one species we are one kind. And what separates us is so much less than what joins us. We should not use human diversity to discriminate against each other. We should celebrate human diversity.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The new C8 distribution amplifier ($2599) is a class A/B design built to audiophile standards but engineered to fit in a 2U rack space. It can deliver high-fidelity audio in various custom install applications ranging from multi-room audio to home theaters.

Notably this rack-mountable amplifier does not stick a DSP processor in the signal chain. It is an analog device engineered for transparency while any EQ and room correction is taken care of elsewhere earlier in the signal chain. Even the C8+ variant of the amp—which has an integrated DAC—keeps the tone controls in the analog domain.

Features & Specifications

The C8 offers 70 W per channel into 4 ohms at full power 8-channels driven or 50 W per channel into 8 ohms. When running in bridged mode power output doubles to 140 W per channel and 100 W per channel into an 8-ohm load.

Rotel divides the eight channels into four zones (A B C D) each consisting of a stereo channel pair). Two switches on the rear of the unit allow you to selectively bridge zones one and two and/or zones three and four.

Rear view of the C8

This amp provides four stereo inputs (unbalanced RCA) which are matrixed to the zones. There's a switch that lets you select Mono for the input. This provides significant flexibility and you can choose to have one input go to all the zones or assign the inputs discretely based on need.

Total harmonic distortion (THD) is rated as under 0.1% and the frequency response is 10 Hz to 100 kHz ±0.5 dB with a signal-to-noise ratio of 100 dB at the line-level inputs.

With feet attached the amp's dimensions measure 17"" W × 3.9"" H × 16.3"" D but without the feet the amp is 2U/3.5"" high and requires zero clearance on top or bottom. It weighs 36.81 pounds (16.7 kilograms) which feels very dense considering its size. But when you have fans to help with cooling you don't need huge heat sinks or a big chassis to dissipate the heat and you can fit everything inside the smaller space—including a toroidal transformer—nice and tight.

Integrated fan cooling ensures that the amplifier remains properly ventilated when in a rack and allows it to sit within a stack of AV gear— for example underneath an AV receiver—without any thermal issues.

The faceplate of this amp has the Rotel aesthetic so if it is visible it'll stylishly blend in with other gear unlike some rackmount amps that pay no attention to appearances.

Regarding the tone controls this amplifier feeds the analog signal into an analog tone controller IC. It receives digital control signals from the menu system allowing you to adjust settings as if on a digital device. This arrangement enables the amp to change volume levels and balance and either boost or cut bass/treble by ±10 dB in 1 dB steps. The bass tone control is centered around 100 Hz while the treble tone control is centered around 10000 Hz. The output from this IC directly feeds the amplifiers.

One thing to note is that this amplifier does not have the classic speaker cable termination you see on consumer amps. Instead it uses Phoenix-style connectors commonly used by pros/custom installers. Long story short you need a screwdriver to connect speaker cables but once you attach the connector plugging and unplugging them is super easy. Just follow the wiring diagram for where to connect the cable depending on whether the amp is bridged or not.

Inside the C8

Setup

The ability to bridge channels and double the output is intriguing because it makes the C8 a viable option for adding external amplification to an AVR or for use as amplification when paired with a pre/pro.

Given that I don't have a multi-room audio system I used the amp to power my 5.1.2 surround-sound system for this review with a Denon AVR-X8500h AVR acting as the processor. In this system a Chromecast Ultra is the primary source for music and video content but I also have an Xbox Series X and an Apple TV 4K hooked up.

I also used the amp in bridged mode to power a pair of Klipsch Reference Premiere RP-8000F II speakers. For this setup a MOTU M4 USB audio interface served as the DAC and Roon + Tidal running on a PC was the source.

Setting up the amp is easy enough given that the menus are simple and easy to navigate. There's a screen on the front of the amp (which you can have time out and go dark) and there are buttons to navigate. The upshot is that while all of your adjustments are in the analog domain you get a programmable digital interface's ease clarity and precision.

Hands-On

I try to keep amplifier reviews short because in the end they are relatively simple devices with only one job to do: Transparently amplify an audio signal. But I also strongly appreciate the qualities a good amp brings to the table. Power precision and clarity are needed to get the most out of a speaker system.

The Klipsch speakers in my system (at the time of this review) are rated at 8 ohms so when running as a 4-zone 8-channel amp per Rotel's specs the C8 is serving 50 watts to each channel. However the speakers are fairly efficient and don't need a lot of watts to get loud. For my application—home theater with an 80 Hz crossover to the subs—the amp has plenty of headroom so I did not come close to testing its limits.

It seemed to me that the C8 had a very easy time handling home theater duties. In some ways powering a surround-sound system is actually not as tough on an amp as playing music through all eight channels simultaneously. The reason is with the music the dynamic peaks hit all the channels simultaneously which requires a robust power supply like the toroidal transformer Rotel uses in the C8.

With movie sound there may be a lot of channels in the mix but is rare for all the channels to peak concurrently. Instead the dynamic peaks are temporally offset or simply not present in all channels which is how AVRs manage to keep up in terms of power output despite having relatively small power supplies. And all this is my long-winded way of saying the Rotel C8 amplifier had a very easy time handling classic home theater tasks easily providing its full power output to all channels.

The hardest job in a multi-channel system is driving the center channel. In my system that center is the Klipsch RP-504C which is an 8-ohm speaker with 50-25kHz ±3dB response and 150 W power handling. But it's also high sensitivity and therefore gets as loud as I need with just the power provided by the C8. Indeed there seems to be plenty of headroom because when I connected a Kill-A-Watt meter I noticed that the amp's power draw typically stayed under 100W and I had to deliberately push it by using pink noise and driving all channels simultaneously if I wanted to force it into drawing anywhere near the maximum rated current.

What I really like about using the Rotel—instead of the AVR's amps—is how the C8 efficiently and silently disposes of heat through the rear vents. This is a major point of differentiation versus many other ""pro"" rackmount amps I have used in my home system— those all had loud fans that I wound up having to swap out with quieter computer fans. But the C8's cooling is both effective and inaudible (with my AVR I use a dedicated rear-venting top-mounted fan from AC Infinity to keep things cool).

I hardly see the point in describing how an amp ""sounds"" in a system that uses room correction. The amplifier's job is not to stand out and sound like anything in particular. Its job is to disappear and not screw up! But if you are interested in what I'm watching lately in the course of the review I checked Out The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent Spider-Man No Way Home The Batman and Moonfall. The movies had all the clarity impact and envelopment I expect from a high-end rig no signs of petering out when the action gets intense and dialog was always perfectly legible.

While AV receiver specifications typically cite a higher wattage that specification is usually for one or two channels driven. When you measure an AVR with all channels driven the per-channel wattage drops dramatically unlike with this amplifier which meets its specs with all channels driven.

All I'm looking for out of any quality amplifier is transparency and good thermal management. Of course those specific demands could easily lead to an extensive conversation about the qualities of class-A class A/B and class-D amplification—the three amp topologies you are most likely to encounter as a consumer. TO keep it short with its decision to stay analog and pursue a robust class A/B design in such a compact form factor Rotel is making a statement: You can have classic audiophile-quality amplification in a custom install-friendly rackmount format.

But that's the funny thing about the C8; it need not be rack mounted. And to that end the rack mount ears are detachable. For the 2-channel bridged full-range listening I set up the C8 as one would an audiophile amp. I engaged bridge mode for all the zones resulting in a 4-channel amp. I then bi-amped the Klipsch towers by using the menu controls to send each input channel to two output channels. The internal channel routing is quite handy.

And voila! That's all it took for the Rotel C8 to go from serving as a rackmount multi-channel amp to a quite serious stereo amplifier that best I could tell left nothing on the table performance-wise while pushing large powerful tower speakers.

With the 2-channel rig I could appreciate the level of fidelity achieved by Rotel. We're talking about a proper audiophile-quality presentation with all the fixings from rock-solid holographic imaging to micro-dynamics transmitting tangible textures through precise modulation (i.e. yes I like dubstep).

With the Klipsch towers and this amp the resulting stereo sound is arguably as good as you'd expect from dedicated 2-channel amplification as opposed to an 8-channel distribution amp. And that is what the C8 is about in a nutshell. It'll do justice to good speakers and provide an authentic audiophile-quality stereophonic listening experience if you give it a chance.

As for what I'm listening to lately that I thought sounds great through the Rotel/Klipsch/MOTU system? I have yet to grow tired of Binary by Sounds from the Ground an instrumental electronic album that is the essence of chill my morning wakeup album for sure but also a float-away listening experience that shows off the imaging of good speakers. With the Rotel running the show these new Klipsch towers put on a surprisingly sophisticated performance where the soundstage had great depth width and the individual sounds were clearly defined in terms of position and scale.

When I want to stretch a 2-channel rig I reach for the classic highly recognizable ""O Fortuna"" from Carmina Burana particularly the rendition by Herbert Blomstedt with the San Francisco Symphony and Chorus recorded in 1990. I bought that album when it came out and have used it as a point of reference for every system over 3 decades a fact that is true for very few albums.

People complain that dynamic compression sucks the life out of modern music. This is why I had a huge smile on my face when the crescendo arrived and the tympany hits it struck me with visceral impact. Yes! Properly rendered classical music—good enough to create some endorphins—on a system that all-in (Rotel C8 Laptop to run Roon MOTU M4 Klipsch RP-8000 II) costs under $5000. That's brilliant!

Having found no issues with how it sounds I decided to just straight-up torture test the amp. So I launched REW (Room EQ Wizard) and started feeding the Klipsch speakers pure sine wave bass. I was happy to see the amp keep pushing the drivers even when I dropped the frequency down to single-digit Hz. Even at 2 Hz the amp was still moving the woofers in and out quite extensively in what looks like slow-motion.

With a 16 Hz tone I can push the cones to their physical excursion limits without clipping or audible distortion from the amp. What I was not able to do is trigger any audible fan noise from the amp which I would have expected when asking it to output a 16Hz sine wave continuously. Overall the amp stayed remarkably cool while playing the infrasonic bass tones.

Conclusion

The Rotel C8 is (basically) two amps in one. It is a custom install-friendly rack-mountable amp and an audiophile-quality standalone amplifier. In either guise it's an all-analog class-A/B design that can run in a 4-channel 6-channel or 8-channel configuration while offering great sound and ease of use.

Subjectively speaking this Rotel sounds fantastic operates reliably looks sharp and is easy to use. What I do not know is how it performs on a test bench so I make no promises in that regard. Notably if you like the design but need more capability than what the C8 offers there's a C8+ ($3199) that more than doubles the power output specs and adds a built-in DAC with optical-digital and coaxial inputs—but otherwise is the same design.

There's quite a bit of functionality within the C8 amp that's aimed at custom installers and distributed audio applications. But I openly confess that this aspect of AV is not my specialty. My interest is in the bottom line: How does the amp sound and perform in my system? The short answer is that it functions perfectly.

However you use it the C8 is rock-solid cool running great-sounding and just plain a nice-looking piece of kit. It’s a flexible adaptable amp that bridges the gap between the audiophile and custom install worlds and therefore it easily picks up an Editor's Choice award for 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMTE1Ny150gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Neuromorphic object localization using resistive memories and ultrasonic transducers,"Biological background

One of the most striking examples of precise and efficient object localization systems can be found in barn owls353748. At dusk and dawn barn owls (Tyto Alba) actively search for small prey such as voles or mice relying mostly on passive listening. These auditory specialists can locate auditory cues incoming from their prey with astonishing accuracy (about 2°)35 as shown in Fig. 1a. Barn owls infer the localization of a sound source in the azimuthal (horizontal) plane from the difference between the Time-of-Flight incoming from the source on the two ears (ITD). The ITD computation mechanism has been postulated by Jeffress4950 it relies on neural geometry and requires two key ingredients: axons neuron’s nerve fibers that act as delay lines and an array of coincidence detector neurons organized into a computational map as depicted in Fig. 1b. The sound reaches the ears with an azimuth-dependent time delay (ITD). In each ear the sound is then converted into a spike pattern. Axons from the left and right ears act as delay lines and converge at CD neurons. In theory only one neuron of the array of coincidence neurons will receive simultaneous inputs (where the delay is compensated exactly) and will fire maximally (neighboring cells will fire too but at a lower rate). The activation of the particular neuron encodes the position of the target object in space and there is no need to further convert the ITD into an angle. This concept is summarized in Fig. 1c: for example if the sound originates from the right a coincidence will occur when the input signal from the right ear travels a longer path than from the left ear by an amount compensating the ITD e.g. at coincidence neuron 2. In other words each CD responds to a specific ITD (also called Best Delay) because of axonal delays. In this way the brain transforms temporal information into spatial information. Anatomical evidence has been found for this mechanism3751. There are phase-locked neurons of the nucleus magnocellularis who preserve the temporal information of the input sound: as their name indicates they fire at a specific phase of the signal. The coincidence detector neurons of the Jeffress model can be found in the nucleus laminaris. They receive input from neurons of the nucleus magnocellularis whose axons serve as delay lines. The amount of delay provided by delay lines may be explained by axonal lengths but also by differential myelination patterns changing the conduction speeds. Inspired by the auditory system of the barn owl we developed a bio-inspired system for object localization. The two ears are represented by the two pMUT receivers. The sound source is a pMUT emitter located in between (Fig. 1a) and the computational map is formed by a grid of RRAM-based CD circuits (Fig. 1b in green) taking the role of CD neurons whose inputs are delayed by delay line circuits (in blue) which act as the axons in the biological counterpart. The proposed sensory system diverges from that of the owl in terms of operation frequency the barn owl hearing system works in the range 1−8 kHz but this work uses pMUT sensors that work at around 117 kHz. The choice of an ultrasound sensor was pondered around engineering and optimization criteria. The first one is that restricting the band of reception to—ideally—a single frequency improves the accuracy of the measurement and simplifies the post-processing stage. In addition operating in the ultrasound regime has the advantage of making the emitted pulse inaudible and thus not bothersome for humans as their auditory range is ~20–20 kHz.

Fig. 1: Object localization system in barn owls and the proposed bio-inspired technology. a The barn owl receives a sound wave from a target a moving prey in this case. The time-of-flight (ToF) of the sound wave at each ear is different (unless the prey is exactly in front of the owl). The dash-dotted lines represent the path of the sound wave toward the barn owl's ears. Based on the difference in the two sound wave path lengths and the corresponding interaural time difference (ITD) it is possible to locate the prey precisely in the horizontal plane (left figure inspired in ref. 74 Copyright 2002 Society for Neuroscience). In our system the pMUT emitter (in dark blue) produces a sound wave that bounces off the targeted object. The reflected ultrasound wave is sensed by two pMUT receivers (in light-green) and processed by the neuromorphic processor (right). b The ITD computation model (Jeffress model) describes how sounds reaching the barn owl's ears are first encoded into phase-locked spike trains in the nucleus magnocellularis (NM) and then processed using a grid of geometrically arranged coincidence detector neurons in the nucleus laminaris (NL) (left). Illustration of the neural ITD computational map combining delay lines and coincidence detector neurons that can be implemented using RRAM-based neuromorphic circuits to model the owl's biological sensing system (right). c Diagram of the basic Jeffress mechanism where the two ears receive a sound stimulus at different moments due to a difference in the ToF and send axons to detectors from opposite ends. The axons are afferent to an array of coincident detector neurons (CDs) each of which is selective to highly temporally correlated inputs. As a result only the CDs whose inputs arrive with the smallest time difference (the ITD is exactly compensated) will be maximally excited. The CDs will then encode the angular position of the target.

PMUT sensors for time-of-flight measurement

Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers are scalable ultrasound sensors that can be integrated with advanced CMOS technology31323352 and have lower actuating voltage and power consumption than conventional bulk transducers53. In our work the diameter of the membrane is 880 μm and the resonance frequency spreads in the range 110−117 kHz (Fig. 2a see “Methods” for more details). Over a batch of ten tested devices the median quality factor is around 50 (ref. 31). This technology has already reached industrial maturity and it is not bio-inspired per se. Combining the information of different pMUT membranes is a well-known technique to infer angular information from pMUT devices using for instance beamforming techniques3154. However the signal processing required to extract the angular information does not suit low-power sensing. The proposed system coupling a neuromorphic circuit for pre-processing of the pMUT data and a RRAM-based neuromorphic computational map inspired by the Jeffress model (Fig. 2c) offers an alternative energy-efficient and resource-constrained hardware solution. We conducted an experiment locating two pMUT sensors about 10 cm apart from each other thus fully taking advantage of the different ToF of sound being sensed by the two receiving membranes. A single pMUT working as an emitter is located in between the receivers. A 12 cm-wide PVC plate located in front of the pMUT devices at a distance D was used as a target (Fig. 2b). The receivers record the sound reflected from the object and respond maximally at the time-of-flight of the sound wave. The experiment was repeated varying the position of the object defined by its distance D and its angle Θ. Inspired in ref. 55 we propose a neuromorphic pre-processing of the pMUT raw signal to convert the reflected waves into spikes that are the input of the neuromorphic computational map. The ToF corresponding to the wave peak amplitude is extracted from each of the two channels and encoded as the precise timing of a single spike. Figure 2c shows the circuits needed to connect the pMUT sensors to the RRAM-based computational map: for each of the two pMUT receivers the raw signal is band-pass filtered to smooth it out rectified and later passed to a leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron that produces an output event (spike) in case of overcoming a dynamical threshold (Fig. 2d): the timing of the output spike encodes the detected time-of-flight. The threshold of the LIF is calibrated to the pMUT response mitigating the pMUT’s device-to-device variability. Thanks to this approach instead of storing the whole sound wave to memory and process it later we simply generate a spike corresponding to the ToF of the sound wave which constitutes the input of the resistive memory-based computational map. The spikes are directly sent to the delay lines and coincident detector modules organized in parallel into the neuromorphic computational map. Since they are sent to transistor gates no additional amplification circuitry is required (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for additional details). To assess the localization angular precision allowed by the pMUTs and the proposed signal processing technique we measured the ITD (i.e. the time difference between the spike events generated by the two receivers) when varying the distance and angle of the object. The ITD is then analytically converted into an angle (see “Methods”) and plotted as a function of the object position: the uncertainty over the measured ITDs grows with both the object’s distance and angle (Fig. 2e f). The main challenge is the peak-to-noise ratio (PNR) in the pMUT response. The more distant the object is located the lower the acoustic signal thus lowering the PNR (Fig. 2f green line). The decrease in the PNR leads to an increase in the uncertainty over the estimated ITD and consequently on the precision of the localization (Fig. 2f blue line). For an object located 50 cm away from the emitter the system’s angular precision is about 10°. This limit imposed by the sensor’s characteristics can be improved. For example the pressure sent by the emitter can be increased raising up the voltage driving the pMUT’s membrane34. Another solution to strengthen the emitted signal is to couple several emitters56. These solutions would extend the range of detection at the price of an added energy cost. Other improvements can be performed on the receiving side. The noise floor of the pMUT receiver could be drastically reduced improving the connections between the pMUT and the first stage amplifier currently done using wire-bonding and RJ45 cables.

A target object is located at an azimuthal position θ and distance D.

RRAM-based neuromorphic computational map

Resistive memories store information in their nonvolatile conductive states. The basic working principle of this technology is that modifying a material at the atomic level results in changes of its conductance57. Here we use an oxide-based resistive memory composed of a 5 nm hafnium-dioxide layer sandwiched between a top and a bottom electrode of titanium and titanium nitride. The conductivity of an RRAM device can be modified by the application of current/voltage waveforms which create or break a conductive filament composed of Oxygen vacancies between the electrodes. We have co-integrated such devices in a standard 130 nm CMOS process58 to build a fabricated re-configurable neuromorphic circuit implementing coincidence detectors and the delay lines circuits (Fig. 3a). Both the non-volatility and analog nature of the devices perfectly couple with the event-driven nature of the neuromorphic circuits minimizing power consumption. The circuit has an instant on/off feature: it works immediately after being turned on allowing to cut the power supply entirely as soon as the circuit is idle. The basic building block of the proposed circuit is presented in Fig. 3b. It is composed of N parallel one-resistor-one-transistor (1T1R) structures encoding the synaptic weights from which a weighted current is extracted and then injected to a common differential pair integrator (DPI) synapse59 and finally into a leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron60 (see “Methods” for more details). The input spikes are applied at the gates of the 1T1R structures as trains of voltage pulses with a pulse width on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds. The resistive memories can be SET into a high conductance state (HCS) by applying an external positive voltage reference on V top while grounding V bottom  and RESET into a low conductive state (LCS) by applying a positive voltage on V bottom while grounding V top . The mean value of the HCS can be controlled by limiting the SET programming (compliance) current (I CC ) via the gate-source voltage of the series transistor (Fig. 3c). The function of RRAMs in the circuit is dual: they route and weigh input pulses.

Inputs voltage pulses (spikes) V in0 and V in1  draw a current I weight proportional to the conductance states G 0 and G 1  of the 1T1R structures. This current is injected into a DPI synapse that excites a LIF neuron. The RRAMs G 0 and G 1 are set in the HCS and LCS respectively. c Cumulative density function of the conductance of a population of 16 kb RRAM devices as a function of the compliance current I CC  which effectively controls the conductance level. d Measurement of the circuit in (a) showing that G 1 (in LCS) effectively blocks inputs from V in1 (green) in fact the output neuron's membrane voltage only responds to the blue input of V in0 . RRAMs efficiently define the connections in the circuit. e Measurement of the circuit in (b) showing the effect of the conductance value G 0 on the membrane voltage V mem  following the application of a voltage pulse V in0 . The larger the conductance the stronger the response: the RRAM device thus implements the weight of the input-to-output connection. Measurements have been performed on one circuit and demonstrate the dual function of the RRAMs they route and weigh the input pulses. Full size image

First thanks to the two main conductive states (HCS and LCS) the RRAMs can either block or pass the input pulses when they are respectively in the LCS or HCS state. As a result RRAMs efficiently define the connections in the circuit. This is fundamental to allow the architecture to be re-configurable. In order to prove that we characterized a fabricated circuit implementation of the circuit block in Fig. 3b. An RRAM corresponding to G 0 was programmed into the HCS and a second RRAM G 1  was programmed in the LCS. Input pulses were applied to both V in0 and V in1 . The effect of two input trains of pulses was analyzed in the output neuron by collecting the membrane voltage and output of the neuron with an oscilloscope. The experiment is successful when only the pulses connected to the neuron by the HCS device (G 0 ) excite the membrane voltage. This is demonstrated in Fig. 3d where the blue train of pulses makes the membrane voltage accumulate charge on the membrane capacitor whereas the green train of spikes leaves the membrane voltage unperturbed.

The second important function of RRAMs is implementing the weight of the connections. By exploiting the analog adjustment of the RRAMs conductance the input-to-output connection can be appropriately weighted. In a second experiment the device G 0 is programmed in different HCS levels and an input pulse is applied to the input V In0 . The input pulse extracts a current from the device (I weight ) which is proportional to the conductance and the corresponding potential drop V top − V bot . This weighted current is then injected into the DPI synapse and output LIF neuron. The membrane voltage of the output neuron is recorded with an oscilloscope and plotted in Fig. 3e. The peak of the neuron membrane voltage responding to a single input pulse is proportional to the conductance of the resistive memory confirming that RRAMs can be exploited as programmable synaptic weight elements. These two preliminary tests demonstrate that the proposed RRAM-based neuromorphic platform is able to implement the basic elements of the Jeffress basic mechanism namely the delay line and coincidence detector circuits. The circuital platform is constituted by stacking consecutive blocks as the one in Fig. 3b side-by-side and connecting their gates to common input lines. We designed fabricated and tested a neuromorphic platform composed of two output neurons and receiving two inputs (Fig. 4a). The layout of the circuit is shown in Fig. 4b. The upper 2 × 2 RRAM matrix allows to route of the input pulses to the two output neurons while the lower 2 × 2 array allows the two neurons (N 0  N 1 ) to be recurrently connected. We demonstrate that this platform can assume a delay line configuration and two distinct coincidence detector functionalities as summarized by the experimental measurements in Fig. 4c–e.

The four devices on the top of the array define the synaptic connections from inputs to outputs and the four cells on the bottom define the recurrent connections among neurons. Colored RRAMs represent devices set in the HCS on the diagrams to the right: a device in the HCS allows a connection to be formed and expresses a weight while a device in the LCS blocks the input pulse and disables the connection to the output. b Layout of the circuit in (a) with the eight RRAMs highlighted in blue. c A delay line is formed by simply exploiting the dynamics of a DPI Synapse and a LIF Neuron.

The output of the circuit is represented by neuron 1 (N 1 ). Full size image

The delay line (Fig. 4c) simply exploits the dynamical behavior of the DPI synapse and LIF neuron to reproduce the input spike from V in1 to V out1 with a delay T del. Only the RRAM connecting V in1 to V out1  G 3  is programmed into the HCS while the other RRAMs are in the LCS. The G 3 device is programmed to 92.6 μS to ensure that each input spike increases the membrane voltage of the output neuron sufficiently to reach the threshold and to generate a delayed output spike. The delay T del is defined by both the synapse and neuron time constants. A coincidence detector detects the occurrence of temporally correlated but spatially distributed input signals. A direction insensitive CD relies on separate inputs converging to a common output neuron (Fig. 4d). The two RRAMs connecting V in0 and V in1 to V out1  G 2 and G 4  respectively are programmed into the high conductance state. The synchronous arrival of spikes at V in0 and V in1 pushes the membrane voltage of the neuron N 1 over the threshold required to generate an output spike. If the two inputs arrive too far apart in time the charge on the membrane voltage accumulated by the first input may have time to decay away preventing the membrane potential of N 1 to reach the threshold. The G 1 and G 2 are programmed to around 65 μS ensuring that a single input spike does not increase the membrane voltage enough to generate an output spike. Coincidence detection between spatially and temporally distributed events is a basic operation common to a wide range of sensing tasks such as optical flow-based obstacle avoidance61 and sound source localization. Consequently the computation of both direction-sensitive and -insensitive CDs are fundamental building blocks to build for both visual and sound localization systems. The proposed implementation of the circuit fits a range of four orders of magnitude of time scales as shown by the characterization of the time constant (see Supplementary Fig. 2). It can therefore fit with the requirements of both visual and sound systems. The direction-sensitive CD is a circuit sensitive to the spatial order of arrival of impulses: from right to left or vice versa. This is a basic building block in the elementary motion detection network of Drosophila’s visual system to compute the direction of motion and detection of collisions62. To implement a direction-sensitive CD the two inputs have to be routed to two different neurons (N 0  N 1 ) and between those a directional connection has to be established (Fig. 4e). Upon the arrival of the first input N 0 responds by increasing its membrane voltage up to overcoming its threshold and emitting a spike. Thanks to the directional connection in green this output event in turn excites N 1 . If the V in1 input event arrives to excite N 1 when its membrane voltage is still high N 1 will produce an output event signifying the detection of coincidence between the two inputs. The directional connection allows N 1 to emit an output only if input 1 arrives after input 0. The G 0  G 3  and G 7 are respectively programmed to 73.5 μS 67.3 μS and 40.2 μS ensuring that a single input spike at V in0 generates a delayed output spike while the membrane potential of N 1 reaches the threshold only upon the synchronous arrival of two input spikes.

Variability in neuromorphic circuits and RRAM-based calibration procedure

Variability is a source of non-ideality in analog neuromorphic systems636465. It results in heterogeneous behaviors among neurons and synapses. Examples of such imperfections include for example 30% (mean value over standard deviation) of variability on input gain time constants and refractory period to name a few (see “Methods”). This issue is more pronounced when several neuron circuits are connected together as in the case of the direction-sensitive CD which consists of two neurons. To function properly the input gain and decay time constants of the two neurons should be as similar as possible. For example large differences in input gain may result in a neuron responding excessively to an input pulse while the other being almost insensitive. Figure 5a shows that randomly selected neurons respond differently to the same input pulse. This neuron variability has an impact on e.g. the functionality of the direction-sensitive CD. In the circuit characterized in Fig. 5b c neuron 1 presents a much higher input gain than neuron 0. As a result neuron 0 requires three input pulses (instead of 1) to reach the threshold while neuron 1 reaches the threshold with two input events as expected. The implementation of the bio-inspired spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a possible way to mitigate the impact of the imprecise and sluggish neuron and synapse circuits on the system performances43. Here we propose to exploit the plastic behavior of the resistive memory as a mean of acting on the input gain of neurons and reduce the impact of the neuromorphic circuit variability. As demonstrated in Fig. 4e the conductance level associated with an RRAM synaptic weight effectively modulates the response of the associated neuron membrane voltage. We adopt an iterative RRAM programming strategy. For a given input the conductance value of the synaptic weights is re-programmed until the target circuit behavior is obtained (see “Methods”).

Fig. 5: Variability in analog neuromorphic circuits. a Experimental measurements of the response of nine randomly selected individual neurons to the same input spike. The response varies across the population impacting both the input gain and the time constant. b Experimental measurements of the impact of the neuron to neuron variability affecting the direction-sensitive CD. Due to the neuron-to-neuron variability the two output neurons of the direction-sensitive CD respond differently to the input stimuli. Neuron 0 presents a lower input gain than neuron 1 thus requiring three input pulses (instead of 1) to produce an output spike. Neuron 1 reaches the threshold with two input events as expected. If input 1 arrives Δt = 50 μs after neuron 0 has been excited the CD remains silent because Δt is larger than neuron 1's time constant (about 22 μs). c Decreasing the Δt = 20 μs makes input 1's spike to arrive when neuron 1's excitation is still high resulting in the coincidence detection of the two input events. Full size image

The two elements employed in the ITD computational map are the delay lines and direction insensitive CD. Both circuits need to be precisely calibrated to ensure the good performance of the object localization system. The delay line has to precisely deliver a delayed version of the input spike (Fig. 6a) the CD must be activated only when the inputs fall within the target detection range. For the delay line the synaptic weight of the input connection (G 3 in Fig. 4a) is re-programmed until the target delay is obtained. A tolerance around the target delay is set to stop the procedure: the smaller the tolerance the harder it is to successfully tune the delay line. Figure 6b shows the result of the calibration procedure for the delay line: as it can be seen the proposed circuit can precisely provide all the delays required in the computational map (from 10 to 300 μS). The maximum number of calibration iterations affects the quality of the calibration procedure: 200 iterations allow the error to be reduced to less than 5%. One calibration iteration corresponds to a SET/RESET operation of the RRAM cell. The tuning procedure is also crucial to improve the accuracy of the detection of the temporally close events of the CD module. Ten calibration iterations are needed to reach a true positive rate (i.e. rate of events correctly detected as correlated) higher than 95% (blue line in Fig. 6c). However the tuning procedure has no effect on false-positive events (i.e. rate of events incorrectly detected as correlated). Another technique observed in biological systems which solves the time constraint of rapidly activated pathways is redundancy (i.e. many copies of the same entity are used to fulfill a given function). Taking inspiration from biology66 we stacked multiple CD circuits in each CD module between two delay lines to reduce the effect of false-positive detection. As shown in Fig. 6c (green lines) stacking three CD elements in each CD module allows reducing the false-positive rate to less than 10−2.

Fig. 6: Performance of the delay line and direction insensitive CD circuits and impact of the RRAM calibration procedure. a Impact of the neuron variability on the delay line circuit. b The delay line circuit can be scaled up to larger delays setting the time constant of the corresponding LIF neuron and DPI synapse to larger values. Increasing the iterations of the RRAM calibration procedure enabled us to substantially improve the precision on the target delay: 200 iterations allow the error to be reduced to less than 5%. One iteration corresponds to a SET/RESET operation on the RRAM cell. c Each CD module in the Jeffress model can be implemented with N-parallel CD elements to be more resilient to system failures. d More RRAM calibration iterations allow to improve the true positive rate (blue line) while the false-positive rate is independent of the number of iterations (green lines). Stacking more CD elements in parallel enabled us to avoid false coincidence detection from a CD Module. Full size image

System assessment

We now assess the performance and power consumption of the end-to-end integrated object localization system presented in Fig. 2 using the measured results of the acoustical characterization of the pMUT sensors the CD and the delay line circuits composing the neuromorphic computational map inspired by the Jeffress model (Fig. 1a). Regarding the neuromorphic computational map the higher the number of CD modules the better the angular resolution but also the higher the system energy (Fig. 7a). A trade-off is reached by comparing the precision of the single components (both pMUT sensors and neuron and synapse circuits) with that of the whole system. The resolution of delay lines are limited by the time constants of the analog synapses and neurons which are greater than 10 μs in our circuits corresponding to an angular resolution of 4° (see “Methods”). A more advanced CMOS technology node would enable the design of neuron and synapse circuits with lower time constants and consequently higher precision of the delay line element. However in our system the precision is limited by the pMUT uncertainty in the estimation of the angular position that is 10o (dark-blue horizontal line in Fig. 7a). We fixed the number of CD modules to 40 corresponding to an angular resolution of about 4o that is the computational map angular precision (light-blue horizontal line in Fig. 7a). At the system level this results in a 4o resolution and 10o precision for an object located in front of the sensory system at a distance of 50 cm. This value is comparable to the sound localization neuromorphic system reported in ref. 67. A comparison of the proposed system with the state-of-the-art can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Adding extra pMUTs boosting the acoustic signal level and bringing down the electronic noise are possible ways to further improve the localization precision. The single bank power consumption for the neuromorphic pre-processing of the pMUT signal (see Fig. 2) is evaluated at 9.7 nW according to ref. 55. Accounting for the 40 CD modules in the computational map the energy per operation (i.e. energy to localize an object) estimated by SPICE simulations is 21.6 nJ. The neuromorphic system is activated only at the arrival of an input event i.e. when the sound wave reaches any of the pMUT receivers and overcomes the detection threshold and kept idle otherwise. This allows avoiding unnecessary energy consumption when no input signal is present. Considering a rate of localization operations of 100 Hz and an activation period of 300 μs per operation (maximum possible ITD) the power consumption of the neuromorphic computational map results being of 61.7 nW. Accounting for the neuromorphic pre-processing applied to each of the pMUT receivers brings the total system’s power consumption to 81.6 nW. To gain a perspective on the energy efficiency of the proposed neuromorphic approach compared to conventional hardware we benchmark this figure to the energy required for running the same task on a state-of-the-art low-power microcontroller68 using either neuromorphic or conventional beamforming techniques. The neuromorphic method accounts for an analog-digital-converter (ADC) stage followed by a Band-Pass filter and an envelope extraction stage (Teager–Kaiser method). Finally a thresholding operation is performed to extract the ToF. We omit the computation of the ITD based on the ToF and the conversion to the estimated angular position as it happens once per measurement (see “Methods”). Assuming a sampling frequency of 250 kHz on the two channels (pMUT receivers) 18 operations for the band-pass filter 3 operations for the envelope extraction and 1 operation for the thresholding per sample the estimate of the overall power consumption leads to 245 μW. This leverages the microcontroller's low-power mode69 which is enabled when not performing the algorithm reducing the power consumption to 10.8 μW. The power consumption for the beamforming signal processing solution proposed in ref. 31 accounting for 5 pMUT receivers and 11 beams equally distributed in the [−50o +50o] azimuthal plane is 11.71 mW (see “Methods” for the details). Furthermore we report the power consumption of the FPGA-based Temporal-Difference-Encoder (TDE)47 as an alternative to the Jeffress model for object localization evaluated at 1.5 mW. Based on these estimations the proposed neuromorphic approach achieves a reduction of five orders of magnitudes in power consumption relative to a microcontroller adopting a classical beamforming technique for an object localization operation. Adopting a neuromorphic signal processing approach on a classical microcontroller reduces the power consumption of about two orders of magnitude. The efficiency of the proposed system can be attributed to the combination of the asynchronous resistive memory-based analog circuits able to perform in-memory computing along with the absence of analog-to-digital conversion of the sensed signal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hc3VzLXJvZy1jaGFrcmFtLXgtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asus ROG Chakram X review: A joystick on a mouse?,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.

Asus ROG Chakram X MSRP $160.00 Score Details “The Asus ROG Chakram X's built-in joystick feels more like a gimmick than an innovation.” Pros Hot-swap capability for the perfect switch

Joystick is a unique feature

8000Hz polling rate

Slick PTFE feet

Pretty RGB Cons Way too expensive

Frustrating software bugs

The custom logo is just a plastic disk

Battery life isn't the best

The best gaming mouse varies from person to person. One person might opt for better battery life whereas someone else prefers a high polling rate. However what about the person who wants something different like a joystick and the ability to hot-swap switches? That person now has an answer: The Asus ROG Chakram X.

The Asus ROG is an ergonomic mouse that features a silhouette similar to a Logitech G502 but the customization of the Strix Flare II Animate. Oh and it has a joystick a 8000Hz polling rate and a max DPI of 36000.

With so many features though also comes a heavy weight of 127 grams and an even heftier price tag of $160.

Design and comfort

This mouse immediately reminded me of a ghost from Halo — especially when you look at the thumb rest. I got extraterrestrial vibes from this mouse especially with the amount of RGB and smoky shell.

The first thing I noticed with the Asus ROG Chakram X was its bulky ergonomic design that resembles the Logitech G502 with its thumb rest. However the Chakram X has many unique design features like a maximum DPI of 36000 four side buttons a removable magnetic shell an 8000Hz polling rate wireless charging (to a degree) and of course the push-fit switch sockets and the analog stick.

While all of these features are cool don’t expect lightness as this mouse weighs in at 127g. That’s seven grams heavier than the Razer Naga Trinity — and that has dedicated macro keys. However the weight of the Chakram X is balanced out very nicely and lightness was never how this mouse was marketed.

The PTFE feet underneath the mouse helped move the Chakram across my desk too. They’re slick like the ones included on Roccat Burst Pro Air. Also underneath the mouse are two buttons one that adjusts DPI and another to pair the Chakram X with your PC. There’s also a slider that lets you toggle between 2.4 GHz wireless Bluetooth or wired mode.

The neatest feature about the Chakram X is its analog stick on the side.

The Chakram X has everything most wireless gaming mice do nowadays like a small 2.4 GHz dongle a paracord cable quick charge. and a boatload of RGB. However the Chakram X features hot-swap switch sockets and a joystick on the left side. Accessing the switches is very easy — just lift the magnetic shell and left and right buttons.

This isn’t the first time Asus released a mouse with hot-swap sockets as it was available on the previous version of the Chakram and the ROG Gladius III. As a mechanical keyboard enthusiast with close to 20 sets of switches I love the idea of having hot-swap compatibility on a mouse because mice switches are cheap and offer a ton of customization.

The neatest feature about the Chakram X is its analog stick on the side which is said to offer a gamepad-like level of control. The thing is it’s incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to use. The analog stick feels very stiff compared to a normal gamepad stick and even though the Chakram X comes with a taller one that didn’t help things. Fortunately the Chakram X comes with a joystick cover that allows you to shed the stick entirely which was most comfortable for me.

The number of side buttons on the Chakram X are plentiful as you get four to reprogram to your heart’s desire. I’m not a huge fan of the four side buttons on this mouse because the forward and back buttons are too far apart and the other two side buttons are too skinny for my liking.

I’m a big fan of the RGB on the Chakram X because you can actually see it when using the mouse. The front of the Chakram lights up the scroll wheel and the ROG logo but that’s obviously covered by your hand. The ROG logo can be removed in place for your own logo or design if you’re crafty enough. In front of the Chakram is a USB-C connector which not only gives your25 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging but bumps the polling rate up to 8000Hz.

You’ll want to keep your USB-C cable close for battery life.

If you plan on utilizing all of the RGB while going wireless you’ll want to keep your USB-C cable close as you’re only getting 59 hours of use in between charges. However if you have some spare coins in your pocket you can pick up the Asus ROG Balteus Qi RGB mouse pad which enables wireless charging.

Software

I encountered some problems with the included Armoury Crate software. Upon installation it greeted me with a loading screen that seemingly never ended.

When I did finally got into Armoury Crate for the first time I was forced to update the Chakram X’s firmware and restart my PC. Oof. I haven’t run into an application this frustrating to get going in a long time.

Eventually after numerous attempts I was able to get into the software again to set my preferred DPI and RGB.

Despite its flaws Armoury Crate bodes well for the Chakram X as it allows you to adjust the DPI using the scroll wheel. Within Armoury Crate you can toggle digital mode which cuts the joystick’s rotations down to just four allowing for more precise actions like equipment changing in-game. Of course you still get the usual remapping options too.

Sensors and switches

The coolest part about the Chakram X is its push-fit switch socket design which allows you to swap switches with ease. Unlike mechanical keyboards mechanical mice switches are dirt cheap and the push-fit sockets even welcome optical switches so the customization is endless.

While the Chakram X welcomes foreign mouse switches the stock ones are great and will last. The included switches are ROG’s micro switches which are rated for 70-million clicks and have a really satisfying tactile bump and muted sound profile.

Asus has equipped the Chakram X with its new AimPoint optical sensor and it is speedy. The AimPoint optical sensor features a DPI up to 36000 and a polling rate of 8000Hz when connected via USB-C.

Gaming experience

In order to get the best gaming experience with the Chakram X I knew that I needed to use it in wired mode as it enables the 8000Hz polling. I remember a few years ago when ROG first announced the Chakram that one of the things that the company mentioned was the ability to eliminate the need for a controller when flying in a game like Grand Theft Auto.

I thought it’d be fun to load up Rockstar Games’ prized possession and give flying a chance and it was pretty fun. However actually using the thumbstick to fly just didn’t feel natural. Even after a couple of hours of use I kept eyeing my $20 knock-off Xbox controller I got off of Amazon. That’s not a good sign.

The whole purpose of a joystick is to be more precise by offering 360 degrees of rotation. However because the thumbstick is located on the side of the mouse your full range of circulation feels limited. The maneuvers this thumbstick forced my hand into just never felt right.

Even though I didn’t enjoy using the joystick I did enjoy using the Chakram X like any other mouse because it’s still speedy. Let’s not forget that the Chakram X has a polling rate and DPI that are through the roof so it’s still very competitive.

Our take

It’s sad to say that I came away disappointed with the Asus ROG Chakram X. Don’t get me wrong I appreciate how nicely the weight is distributed the hot-swap sockets and wicked-fast sensor. But that’s it. The analog stick feels impractical and niche especially for a mouse of this price.

Are there alternatives?

If you love the idea of a gaming mouse with its own analog stick this is it.

However if you want hot-swap sockets then I’d point you toward the Asus ROG Gladius III Wireless or the Spatha X if you’re looking for a ton of buttons and the switch swapping. Without the joystick and hot-swap sockets this feels like a slightly faster Logitech G502.

How long will it last?

The ROG Chakram X features a warranty of one year however unless you plan on slamming this mouse around I can assure you it’ll last many years — especially given the fact that you can swap the switches out instantly.

Should you buy it?

No not for most people. The Chakram X separates itself from almost any other gaming mouse on the market thanks to the joystick. Unless you’re really excited about that feature though the Chakram X ends up being too expensive for what it is.

Joining her were her three children – Kelley Sabrina and Ricky Jr. – as well as 4000 runners and volunteers on Sunday June 19. The athletes walked and raced in 5K and 10K events as well a young people’s run.

It was the first time in three years the race was held in person. It was canceled in 2019 and operated virtually (runners were on their own) last year.

“To see so many people come out after not being here for two years it really shows how much this race means to people” said Byrdsong. “It’s amazing that it’s been 23 years and people still have the passion to be here to make a statement about how there is power in love and unity. This is a race against hate. They come to demonstrate that. It’s just powerful.”

The YWCA Evanston/North Shore organizes the race. Proceeds go to the YWCA’s Equity Institute which promotes racial equity.

Karen Singer President and Chief Executive Officer of the YWCA which took over the event in 2007 shares Byrdsong’s enthusiasm about the event but worries that the community needs more.

“I’m so aware that we have to accelerate change” said Singer. “So much has happened in the last several years. It reminds us over and over again that we have got to get engaged and create the change we want to see.”

Singer said she thinks back to the night that Byrdsong was shot and worries that nights like that are becoming more and more common. “When Ricky was killed we were horrified” she said. “Now we are becoming inured to it. That is a huge danger.”

Looking around the crowd of runners families and volunteers filling the park on a sunny Sunday morning that was also Father’s Day and the celebration of Juneteenth Singer said “I think it is joyous to see so many people here. I just hope people think about this and get engaged in doing something about it. While this is fabulous this isn’t going to do it. I hope this energizes people and I hope it sparks the willingness and need to act.”

Singer who plans to step down from the YWCA at the end of the year is discouraged at the slow pace of change. She said: “People need to find ways to object to raise their voices to organize to say no to what they see is happening around them. I think they’ve got to teach their children. We’ve been reminded this is happening here in our community. It’s really disturbing. It’s coming from somewhere. And unless we are teaching in our homes and our schools we are just not going to turn it around.”

She said she is worried that hatred and violence and the idea of white supremacy is still deeply rooted. “I think we can’t keep hoping for things to be different. People have got to get engaged in whatever way they can.”

Sherialyn Byrdsong voiced similar feelings.

“It’s always that glass half empty glass half full” she said. “I’m discouraged by what I see going on. But I’m so encouraged by events like this with people who are passionate about being agents for change to make our nation a better place.”

Here is an earlier version of the story:

Ricky Byrdsong Memorial Race Against Hate which fell this year on Juneteenth drew thousands to run walk and support the beloved event that has not been able to be held for two years due to COVID-19.

The race honors the late Ricky Byrdsong former Northwestern University Basketball Coach and Vice President of Affairs at Aon Corporation.

In 1999 Byrdson a Skokie resident was murdered by a white supremacist while walking in his neighborhood with two of his children.

The same shooter in the same day wounded six people in Rogers Park who were Orthodox Jews. Before he took his own life the shooter killed a Korean American graduate student in Indiana and wounded an African American minister in Decatur.

Byrdsong’s wife Sherialyn Byrdsong and her family launched this event in 2000 and turned it over to the YWCA Evanston/North Shore in 2007. Sherialyn was at the event today to speak along with others who emphasized that the Race Against Hate is not just a once a year event but a lifestyle to fight the forces of racial hatred in our society.

Apple Inc workers in the city of Maryland in the United States have voted to join a union becoming the first retail employees of the tech giant to unionize in the country.

More than 100 workers in Towson near Baltimore “have overwhelmingly voted to join” the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) the union said on its website on Saturday.

The local workers forming the Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (CORE) “have the support of a solid majority of our coworkers” they wrote in a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook.

“This is something we do not to go against or create conflict with our management” they wrote stressing that their driving motivation was to seek “rights we do not currently have”.

IAM welcomed CORE’s “historic victory” and urged Cook to let the unionizing employees fast-track efforts to secure a contract at the Towson location.

“I applaud the courage displayed by CORE members at the Apple store in Towson for achieving this historic victory” said IAM International President Robert Martinez Jr. “They made a huge sacrifice for thousands of Apple employees across the nation who had all eyes on this election.”

He added: “This victory shows the growing demand for unions at Apple stores and different industries across our nation.”

An Apple spokesperson responding to the Reuters news agency request for comment said by email that the company had “nothing to add at this time”.

Unionization efforts are gaining momentum at some large US corporations including Amazon.com Inc and Starbucks Corp.

Apple workers in Atlanta who were seeking to unionize withdrew their request last month claiming intimidation.

Some current and former Apple workers last year began criticizing the company’s working conditions online using the hashtag #AppleToo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8xOS90ZWNoL2FwcGxlLXN0b3JlLXVuaW9uLXZvdGUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDYvMTkvdGVjaC9hcHBsZS1zdG9yZS11bmlvbi12b3Rl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Union wins right to represent workers at an Apple store for the first time,"New York CNN Business —

Apple workers in Towson Maryland have voted to form the first-ever labor union at one of the tech giant’s US stores.

The landmark union election concluded on Saturday evening with 65 workers voting for unionization and 33 against it a nearly two-to-one margin in favor of the union according to a preliminary tally from the National Labor Relations Board.

The victory for union organizers at the Apple (AAPL) store in the Towson Town Center a mall near Baltimore comes amid a broader wave of workplace activism that has emerged in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The US labor market has tipped much more strongly in favor of workers over the past two years. There are now roughly twice as many job openings as there are unemployed people looking for work leaving employers scrambling to fill jobs. The number of employees being fired or laid off recently reached a record low. And the number of employees quitting jobs typically because they found better opportunities remains near recently reached record highs. That has made employees who are dissatisfied with their jobs more willing to demand better working conditions including through unionization.

Saturday’s vote marks a major victory for retail workers at Apple which has in recent months experienced a wave of employee activism within its corporate ranks — a movement that’s come to be known as #AppleToo.

Issues beyond wages

The major issue driving the organizing vote was workers wanting to have a say in the way the store is run said Christie Pridgen a technical expert at the store and one of the organizers. Pridgen 34 said she’s worked at the store for more than 8 years.

“Compensation is important considering the cost of living in general and inflation but the bigger thing is having a say” she told CNN Business Saturday night after the vote. “That was the most important thing to me.”

Pridgen said workers having a say in hours and scheduling and being involved in establishing safety protocols during the pandemic were the big issues.

“We wanted a say in the policies that affect our lives” she said adding that she wasn’t surprised by the outcome of the vote but was relieved.

“I knew I wasn’t alone in being frustrated” she said. As to whether she thought about leaving Apple for another job said said she felt as if her co-workers are a kind of family.

“I am not ready to leave here because of the connection I have with teammates” she said.

An Apple (AAPL) spokesperson declined to comment on the vote.

“We are fortunate to have incredible retail team members and we deeply value everything they bring to Apple” the company said in a statement ahead of the vote. “We are pleased to offer very strong compensation and benefits for full time and part time employees including health care tuition reimbursement new parental leave paid family leave annual stock grants and many other benefits.”

The union that won the vote is called the Apple Coalition of Organized Retail Employees or AppleCORE for short. It was backed by the larger International Association of Machinists known for its strength of production workers at Boeing as well as many of the employees in the US airline industry.

“I applaud the courage displayed by CORE members at the Apple store in Towson for achieving this historic victory” said IAM International President Robert Martinez. “They made a huge sacrifice for thousands of Apple employees across the nation who had all eyes on this election.”

The Apple store vote follows an April union victory at an Amazon (AMZN) distribution center in Staten Island New York the first Amazon (AMZN) facility to vote in favor a union. There have also been a string of union victories at Starbucks stores nationwide since late last year.

Winning union votes remains difficult

Still it is an uphill battle for unions to win organizing votes. Even with all the successful votes at Starbucks (SBUX) stores the union has won the right to represent only roughly 5000 of the 235000 employees at Starbucks (SBUX)’ 9000 US company-owned stores. The Amazon distribution center in Staten Island had about 8300 workers while the company has more than 1 million US employees overall.

The win at the Apple store in Maryland came after union supporters at an Apple store in Atlanta withdrew their request to hold a vote. The union win at the Staten Island Amazon location is being challenged by the company. And it followed a failed attempt by a different union to represent an Amazon distribution center in Alabama. There has subsequently been a union loss at a nearby Amazon facility also on Staten Island.

Management often pressures employees to vote against a union arguing that it will be more difficult to address working condition concerns if a union is in place or that employees will be paid less and have to pay union dues if they vote to organize. For example Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced a pay hike for most of the company’s US employees that will not apply to workers at stores that have voted for a union saying that potential wage increase would now be subject to negotiation.

Workers can also be worried that a company might close a location that votes for a union while keeping others open. Workers at an Ithaca New York Starbucks store claim their location is being closed because of a successful unionizing effort. The company denies the union vote is the reason for the closing plans but the union has filed an unfair labor practice complaint.

The advantages that management has in defeating unionization efforts has resulted in the percentage of US workers belonging to a union falling to 10.3% in 2021 down from 20.1% in 1983. Nearly half of union members work for some level of government. Overall only 6.1% of private sector employees are union members including 4.4% of retail employees mostly at grocery stores.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vamFzb24tYXRlbi9hcHBsZS1pcGFkb3MtMTYtc3RhZ2UtbWFuYWdlci1tMS1pcGFkLW9ubHktY29udHJvdmVyc3kuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple's Controversial Decision About One of Its Most Popular Products Is Making People Mad,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/apple-ipados-16-stage-manager-m1-ipad-only-controversy.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vamFzb24tYXRlbi9hcHBsZS1pcGFkb3MtMTYtc3RhZ2UtbWFuYWdlci1tMS1pcGFkLW9ubHktY29udHJvdmVyc3kuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vcmVhc29ucy1wZW9wbGUtbG92ZS1hcHBsZS1wcm9kdWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Reasons People Love Apple Products So Much,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vcmVhc29ucy1wZW9wbGUtbG92ZS1hcHBsZS1wcm9kdWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8xOC9hcHBsZS1zdG9yZS11bmlvbi1tYXJ5bGFuZC13aW4tdm90ZS_SAUpodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTgvYXBwbGUtc3RvcmUtdW5pb24tbWFyeWxhbmQtd2luLXZvdGUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Apple store in Maryland makes history by forming the company’s first recognized union,"As several Apple stores across the country fight to unionize workers in Towson Maryland became the first to win formal recognition. Out of 110 eligible employees the union received 65 yes votes and 33 no votes.

This historic victory comes after concentrated efforts from Apple to discourage its retail workers from unionizing. Last month the trillion-dollar company’s vice president of people and retail Deirdre O’Brien sent a video to 58000 retail staff warning them about the perceived drawbacks of unionizing. O’Brien reiterated anti-union talking points stating that it would be more difficult to enact change in stores with a union standing between Apple and employees — but workers don’t think that meaningful change is possible without having a formally recognized bargaining unit.

A store in Atlanta was supposed to be the first to hold a union election but the organizers withdrew their request claiming that Apple was leveraging illegal union-busting tactics such as holding “captive audience” meetings. At the time that they filed for an election the Cumberland Mall store in Atlanta had 70% out of about 100 employees sign union authorization cards demonstrating their interest in moving forward. Since then Apple has raised retail pay to a minimum of $22 per hour up from $20.

Now the store in Maryland will become unionized through the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) and are calling themselves the Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (CORE). When they first announced their intent to unionize they wrote a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook.

“We have come together as a union because of a deep love of our role as workers within the company and out of care for the company itself” the letter said. “To be clear the decision to form a union is about us as workers gaining access to rights that we do not currently have.”

As the first Apple store to unionize in the country these Towson workers may spark a movement for other retail locations to follow their lead. According to the New York Times over two dozen Apple stores have expressed interest in organizing including the Grand Central Terminal store in New York City.

To suppress the growing push for retail unions Apple is working with Littler Mendelson the same law firm supporting Starbucks’ anti-union push. But Starbucks workers have managed to win a wave of union elections regardless. In December a Starbucks store in Buffalo New York became the first of the company’s coffee shops to unionize. Now about seven months later 158 stores in 30 states have unionized.

Jurassic World Dominion director Colin Trevorrow went to bat Saturday for his Tyrannosaurus rex after a Twitter user argued the dino was no longer getting the respect it deserved in the franchise.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

In Dominion which opened last weekend a Therizinosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus rex team up to kill the ultimate bad dino a Giganotosaurus. In the epic battle scene toward the end of the film it seemed all might be lost after the T. rex appeared to be killed. But in true Jurassic Park fashion her eye popped open and it was on. The T. rex and Therizinosaurus proceed to kill the Giga.

This was an awesome moment for most fans — but clearly not for all.

Actor Angel Rosario Jr. tweeted at Trevorrow that he felt the T. rex had become second banana in the Jurassic Park storytelling which in Rosario’s opinion was wrong.

“Hey @colintrevorrow… ya made the Rex look weak. Again. Come on now! It’s the face of the franchise. Terrible. The Giga might have been strong but science proves the Rex was a better predator and stronger. Very disappointed in your utilization of Rexy. #JurassicWorldDominion” read Rosario’s post.

The director then responded. And it was perfect.

“I understand the feeling. Worth noting the T. Rex had an average lifespan of 28 years so our Rexy would be near the end of her life in Dominion. Even at that age she found the strength to rise up and avenge her own death 65 million years later. Sometimes revenge takes time” Trevorrow said via Twitter.

Rosario appeared thrilled with the back-and-forth.

“Got a response from the great @colintrevorrow about Dominion. Though conflicting arguments about the Rex…as an actor I’d love to work on a project with you sir. Respect and admiration for your work sir. Hope we can talk about it face to face someday! #JurassicWorldDominion” he wrote.

Jurassic World: Dominion is in theaters now.

I understand the feeling. Worth noting the T. Rex had an average lifespan of 28 years so our Rexy would be near the end of her life in Dominion.

The fact that the world’s most famous investor Warren Buffett appreciates shareholder rewards shouldn’t be surprising. After all a sizable and predictable return is the whole point of investing.

Buffett takes this philosophy seriously and seeks out companies with the most generous shareholder rewards program. All five of his biggest holdings pay dividends. But they also have something else in common: buybacks.

Stock buybacks or share repurchases could be considered “hidden dividends.” Here’s why Buffett’s portfolio is dominated by companies buying back their own shares and why the Oracle of Omaha regularly buys back Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) shares too.

Eager to escape the dismal stock market? Unfortunately “cash is not a safe investment” says Ray Dalio founder of the world’s largest hedge fund. “It’s not a safe place because it will be taxed by inflation.” With the consumer price index hitting a 40-year high of 8.6% in May you’ll need to get creative to find strong returns.

The magic of buybacks

In 2004 Buffett described his thesis on buybacks. “When stock can be bought below a business’s value it is probably the best use of cash” he told Berkshire Hathaway investors.

A buyback program reduces the number of outstanding shares. That makes each remaining share more valuable. It also means that the company’s annual earnings belong to a smaller group of investors.

Buybacks have other advantages. They’re more tax-efficient than dividends because shareholders receive some value without the need to receive cash. These buyback programs are also a sign of confidence from the company’s management team.

Put simply a well-executed buyback handsomely rewards shareholders.

These programs have become more popular in recent years. In 2021 S&P 500 companies collectively spent over $1 trillion in buybacks — reducing the stock market’s aggregate share count by 4%. Buybacks could be just as aggressive this year as stocks get cheaper.

Here are some of the most noteworthy buyback programs in 2022.

Union Pacific

North America’s largest railroad operator has been buying back shares longer than any other stock on this list. Union Pacific (UNP) has reduced its share count by half since 2006. The stock price is up 827% since then. If you include dividends over that period the total return is even more impressive.

Story continues

The company’s ongoing buyback program could reduce outstanding shares by 20% over the next five years. Investors can also expect a steady flow of dividends. After all the company has paid consistent annual dividends for 123 years. The current yield is roughly 2.5%.

Apple

In dollar terms Apple’s (AAPL) buyback program is the largest one on the market. The company deployed $81 billion to repurchase its shares last year. This year analysts expect a further $80 to $90 billion program. That would represent 4% of the company's current market value.

The iPhone maker also pays a modest dividend every year. These lucrative and consistent rewards could be the reason why Apple is the largest holding in Warren Buffett’s portfolio.

Exxon Mobil

The ongoing energy crisis has created a windfall for oil and gas producers across North America. Exxon Mobil (XOM) is at the forefront of this trend. This year the company tripled its buyback program from $10 billion to $30 billion.

Cash flows have skyrocketed so rapidly that it’s even caught Washington’s attention. President Joe Biden said “Exxon made more money than God this year.” Perhaps the buyback program could share some of that heavenly windfall.

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Comparing Arthur J. Gallagher's Short Interest Against Its Peers

Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it such as industry size age and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K proxy filing or by doing your own similarity analysis.

What do we alert on? How do we define the KPIs that we care about? Are we setting thresholds too high or too low? What are the best practice alerts?

These questions are often mired in ever-growing amounts of confusion and ambiguity. At IBM we decided to create a revolutionary new approach and make alert configuration intuitive and intelligent with something we call Smart Alerts.

This new IBM Instana™ Smart Alerts feature provides the ability to automatically generate alerting configurations using relevant KPIs and automatic threshold detection for use cases like website slowness or website errors. Combined with the power of Unbonded analytics Smart Alerts is the first alerting mechanism that automatically generates alerts based on use cases designed for the environment at hand.

End the guessing game

The experience of creating and managing alerts has historically been an abysmal experience relegated to a grizzled team of operations engineers who most people have been afraid to speak with. If you’ve ever felt like setting up alerts for your applications which have been a slightly less exciting version of whack-a-mole then hold on because we have redefined the process by which engineers decide why they’re startled out of bed at 2 AM. With our new blueprints configuring meaningful alerts has been distilled into three distinct easy-to-use steps.

Step 1: Choose a blueprint

Blueprints are the curated and contextualized alerting plans that have been generated based on not only our experience with alerting but our clients as well. These plans are designed with specific use cases in mind and will automatically choose the proper KPIs and create baseline performance thresholds from the historical and seasonal patterns present in your environment. The historical and threshold determination is displayed in real-time while defining your new alert. Amazingly you can see exactly when your alert would trigger based on historical data so that you can tune your thresholds just right—not too many alerts not too few. Further customization can be defined in Step 2 where the scope is confirmed.

Step 2: Confirm the scope

Smart Alerts gives your team the ability to quickly and easily refine your alert configuration with our Unbounded analytics filtering. This ability effectively allows you to narrow the alerts down to scenarios that you’re ultimately responsible for. For example it’s trivial to define the scenario where only the performance is analyzed for the users accessing your application while on mobile Safari and your production or test environment. Defining these constraints becomes an interactive and transparent process as each change is graphed and visualized in real-time.

Step 3: Choose the alert channel

The delivery of alerts is simplified by our wide selection of integration partners. After all what good is an alert if it isn’t delivered reliably to your engineering team? The IBM Instana platform integrates directly with the industries’ leading alert management vendor tools (including PagerDuty and Opsgenie) along with open-source monitoring tools (such as Prometheus). Alternatively you can even send an email or post directly to a webhook.

What are blueprints?

You may think of blueprints as a prefabricated design for a house. While not entirely finalized these plans allow for individualized customization to suit your taste. Don’t like those bathroom fixtures? Update them. Prefer to measure on the 99th percentile instead of the 90th? No problem. While the goal of Smart Alerts is to eliminate the difficulty in deriving reliable thresholds for performance metrics we understand that our users may want to customize their alerting expectations.

In addition to being able to modify the aggregation percentile IBM Instana software will calculate baselines from algorithms based on either daily or weekly seasonality. We’ve also included the ability to specify time-based thresholds which enable trigger conditions that require certain requirements to be met including but not limited to the number of violations within a time window or a certain number or percentage of users being impacted.

The future of alerting

We built Smart Alerts because we know that with the increased complexity and size of modern application environments a smarter and more intuitive approach to alert management was a requirement. Today’s application owners deserve a modern and automated approach to alerting and performance monitoring.

With this announcement we’re planning to introduce Smart Alerts and blueprints throughout the entire IBM Instana ecosystem. In addition to incorporating this radical new alerting approach to cover all functional areas within the IBM Instana platform we’ll continuously introduce blueprint capabilities as we analyze how our clients are constructing their own custom alerts.

For simplicity we will use the same dataset for both binomial and multinomial logistic regression. For binary classification we attempt to predict whether the species is Iris virginica vs. not Iris virginica

From this point onwards all operations will take place in PySpark by converting the pandas data frame into a PySpark one

The automatic conversion automatically produced the expected schema.

Preparatory work

PySpark uses transformers and estimators to transform data into machine learning features:

a transformer is an algorithm which can transform one data frame into another data frame

an estimator is an algorithm which can be fitted on a data frame to produce a transformer

The above means that a transformer does not depend on the data. A machine learning model is a transformer that takes a data frame with features and produces a data frame that also contains predictions via its .transform() method. On the other hand an estimator has a .fit() method that accepts a data frame and produces a transformer. A pipeline in PySpark chains multiple transformers and estimators in an ML workflow. Users of scikit-learn will surely feel at home!

Going back to our dataset we construct the first transformer to pack the four features into a vector

The features column looks like an array but it is a vector. Conveniently the vector assembler also populates the metadata property of the features column in the schema

and it is possible to retrieve the column names of the original features although this may be more conveniently done using feature_assembler.getInputCols() .

Although the features are more or less scaled the interpretation of the fitted logistic regression coefficients will be facilitated if we ensure that all features range from 0 to 1. This can be achieved using a min-max scaler estimator

In the code above minMax_scaler_model is a transformer produced by fitting the minMax_scaler estimator to the data. It is convenient to be able to scale all continuous features in one go by using a vector. Incidentally the pyspark.ml.feature module contains the vector_to_array() and array_to_vector() functions to interconvert vectors and arrays so estimators like the minMax_scaler can also be used in data transformations beyond machine learning.

In principle the features_scaled and species columns can now be used to fit a logistic regression model. However before doing so we will introduce one more concept the ML pipeline that can be used to orchestrate ML workflows

The results are identical as before but the code is more succinct. The pipeline is technically an estimator and has a .fit() function that returns a transformer. Behind the scenes fitting a pipeline calls the .transform() function for transformers and the .fit() function for estimators in the order they have been introduced in the pipeline stages. In practice we can build more than one pipeline with different transformers and estimators and experiment with building models to see the effect of our choices.

First modelling attempt

Before tuning the model and assessing its accuracy it is useful to make a first crude attempt to see what are the chances of ending up with a reasonable model. For doing so we do not use cross-validation and we only specify the obligatory model parameters leaving all the rest to their defaults.

The first thing to do is to add one more pipeline stage namely the conversion of the species column from string to numerical using a StringIndexerModel

as this is required later on. Alternatively we could have used the StringIndexer estimator to create the model by using the data and assign the indices based on the frequency of the species names. We opted against this because we wanted to ensure that Iris virginica is mapped to 1.0 and not Iris virginica to 0.0. We then split the data set into training and test set

We specified the seed as a good practice although in the Spark world this does not ensure deterministic behaviour due to underlying partitioning of the data. If you are curious about this mind-boggling topic the following experiment can exemplify the issue

You can read more in this article including ideas on how to avoid this issue e.g. by caching the whole dataset instead of only the training set (as done below). Storing the training and test sets and reading them again for building the model is another way to ensure deterministic behaviour. Note that the training dataset should in any case always be cached given that it is used repeatedly when the model is fitted. This is likely the most typical use case for caching in Spark.

The only thing that remains is to fit the model and evaluate its accuracy. For the sake of completeness the whole code is provided so it is easier to follow along

For convenience we converted the predicted numerical values back to labels using pyspark.ml.feature.IndexToString() . Please note that we only used the sepal width and petal width as independent variables. In addition we only used 20% of the dataset for training. The reason for these strange choices is that this machine learning problem is in fact very easy to tackle and hence we almost always obtain a good model with little effort. By dropping some features and by using a small training set we compute metrics that are not perfect from the outset.

We now have the predictions for the test set and can get a glimpse on how well we did.

Assessing model quality

Perhaps the most common way to obtain an idea about the performance of a binomial classification model is to compute the confusion matrix. In PySpark this is easily done manually with

The confusion matrix can also be easily visualised using an annotated heatmap in seaborn

that produces

Figure 2: Confusion matrix

If you try to follow along you may obtain slightly different results due to the different split into training and test sets.

There are many metrics that can be computed but I list the most important that are also relevant for the ROC curve calculation later on:

Recall sensitivity or true positive rate: It reflects the ability of the model to identify the positives and is defined as TP/(TP+FN)

It reflects the ability of the model to identify the positives and is defined as TP/(TP+FN) Precision or positive predictive value : It shows how often a predicted positive is a true positive and is defined as TP/(TP+FP)

: It shows how often a predicted positive is a true positive and is defined as TP/(TP+FP) Specificity or true negative rate : It reflects the ability of the model to identify the negatives and is defined as TN/(TN+FP)

: It reflects the ability of the model to identify the negatives and is defined as TN/(TN+FP) False positive rate: It reflects the probability of a false positive and is defined as FP/(TN+FP) = 1-specificity

These metrics are easy to calculate manually after the confusion matrix has been computed. Alternatively the PySpark API can also be used for convenience

The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for the test set can be retrieved from metrics.roc but we will also compute it manually using the raw probabilities. We use seaborn to visualise the results of the two approaches

that produces

Figure 3: ROC curve. The curve starts at (0. 0.) that corresponds to a threshold equal to 1. which means that every prediction is negative. The curve ends at (1. 1.) that corresponds to a threshold equal to 0. which means that every prediction is positive.

I would not advise to compute the ROC curve manually for several reasons that includes performance worries. However it is good to be cautious given that the PySpark machine learning API based on data frames is new and the documentation is not yet perfect. Checking that the results make sense is advisable to ensure that the API is used correctly. The PySpark API can also return the precision-recall (PR) curve that is useful when the the classes are very unbalanced. The purpose of the ROC curve is to select the threshold in order to achieve the desired sensitivity and specificity. The threshold can be seen as a parameter of the model and as with all parameters it should not be calculated on the test set but on the training set or even better on the validation set (see next section). The PySpark API provides the ROC and PR curves for the training set curves thought lr_model.summary.roc and lr_model.summary.pr .

The ROC curve is also used in order to compute the area under the ROC curve metric. The ROC curve of a perfect model will approach the top-left corner whilst a random model will approach the diagonal (True positive rate = False positive rate). The area under the ROC curve ranges between 0. and 1 and can be computed via a BinaryClassificationEvaluator object

The result is impressive despite the attempt to hamper the model quality. The area under the ROC curve for the training set can be obtained from the model summary lr_model.summary.areaUnderROC. The BinaryClassificationEvaluator object can also be used to compute the area under the PR curve.

Cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning

The logistic regression model like most other models have parameters that can be fine-tuned in order to optimise the model accuracy and robustness. The previous section describes a first modelling attempt that cut many corners. We used the default value for all parameters of the logistic regression model and we simplified model development by splitting the original dataset into two parts only one for training and one for testing. This is a a good way to start in order to obtain a first idea of what can be achieved. Once we are confident that we are likely to produce a viable model we can use cross-validation to optimise the parameters of the model. This is an expensive operation. First of all for a given set of model parameters we fit and evaluate the model multiple times (that is known as folds). Secondly we try many different sets of model parameters. This section gives the complete code for binomial logistic regression using 4-fold cross-validation and serves as an example on how other machine learning models in PySpark can be trained and optimised.

Figure 4: Splitting the original dataset into training validation and test sets (image by author)

Cross-validation requires three building blocks:

an estimator (model) that is typically packed in a ML pipeline

a grid with the hyper-parameters we are trying to tune

an evaluation metric that is essentially the objective function for the hyper-parameter tuning

In our example we use the earlier set pipeline. We will fine-tune two parameters of the logistic regression model namely

the elastic net mixing parameter alpha (alpha=0 means an L2 penalty and alpha-1 means an L1 penalty) and

the regularization parameter

It may sound strange but we will also use hyper-parameter tuning for selecting features by adjusting the features passed to the vector assembler. This is a bit far fetched for this example but I opted for this to show that all parameters of all pipeline stages can in principle be included in the fine-tuning. The number of parameter combinations grows quickly out of hand and in practice run time constraints curb the enthusiasm.

The evaluator used is the area under the ROC curve computed (correctly) over the validation sets averaged over the different folds.

The grid search examined 165 parameter combinations each of which fitted and evaluated four models. This took ~350 sec despite the fact that the iris dataset is very small compared to the datasets typically handled with Spark. The average area under the ROC curve for each parameter combination can retrieved with cv_model.avgMetrics that shows that several combinations achieved a nearly perfect metric (area under the ROC curve ~=1.). The best model can be retrieved from with cv_model.bestModel (not sure how Spark selects the best model when two sets of parameters perform equally well but this is less likely to happen in real world use cases).

All the fitted models are stored and can be retrieved with cv_model.subModels[k][i] where k is the fold and i the index of the parameter set in the parameter grid. In our example the best results were obtained for i=4 and the 4 models corresponding to the four folds can be obtained with [cv_model.subModels[k][4] for k in range(4)] . We should check the distribution of coefficients for the different folds that is an indication of model stability and even fit the whole training set once more using the optimal hyper-parameters. This goes beyond the scope of this article. We will instead use the best model returned with cv_model.bestModel with no further investigations.

Model interpretation

It is perhaps surprising that by using only the sepal and petal widths without regularisation we obtain a very good model. The coefficients and intercept of the linear model can be easily retrieved

and stored in a pandas Series. Conveniently the vector assembler stores the feature names as schema metadata that can be used to set the series index. The features had been min-max scaled that helps with the interpretation. The petal width has roughly 4 times more impact than the sepal width.

This is a special situation: the hyper-parameter tuning happened to only keep two features whilst no regularisation was necessary. This allows visualising the decision boundary with the only complexity being the handling of the feature scaling

that produces

Figure 5: Decision boundary of best model

Figure 5 displays the training set (meaning all data points other than the test set) and we can see that there is one false negative and two false positives (one almost on the decision boundary) that is consistent with the confusion matrix for the training set. It all looks good.

Multinomial logistic regression

PySpark also supports multinomial logistic regression (softmax) and hence it is possible to predict all classes for the iris dataset in one go. We will not cover all details because the article is already quite long. The complete code with the first attempt to fit a multinomial logistic regression model can be found below

The international Brent benchmark has gained a whopping 64% since the start of 2022 while natural gas had surged by a stunning 105% which has been a boon for a global oil industry beaten down by a prolonged seven-year price slump. There are signs that significantly higher energy prices are here to stay benefiting drillers and hydrocarbon-producing nations alike. This bodes extremely well for Argentina’s nascent shale oil and gas boom which is situated in Neuquen Basin. The Vaca Muerta shale formation is the key geological body for what is shaping up to be an immense hydrocarbon boom. The 7.4-million-acre shale formation spanning the Neuquén Mendoza Río Negro and La Pampa provinces is estimated to contain technically recoverable shale oil resources of 16 billion barrels and 308 trillion cubic feet of natural gas making it the second-largest shale gas resource in the world.

Sharply weaker energy prices were threatening the urgently needed development of the Vaca Muerta. This is because the formation has an average breakeven price of $55 per barrel for new projects and $40 to $50 a barrel for existing operations. In an environment where Brent was trading at less than $50 per barrel as occurred during 2020 it was difficult to attract the required investment to effectively develop the Vaca Muerta. This threatened the national government’s planned economic revival which was to be fueled by hydrocarbon production from the shale formation. As a result Buenos Aires implemented a range of measures including establishing a price floor for crude oil aimed at securing the additional investment required to develop the Vaca Muerta. The shale formation also has the potential to significantly boost global energy supplies making its development crucial to resolving the current crisis which was triggered by a confluence of events notably a lack of investment since the 2015 oil price crash.

Ministry of Economy data shows remarkable hydrocarbon production growth since about the middle of 2021. For April 2022 Argentina pumped an average of 609439 barrels of crude oil daily which despite being 2% lower month over month was an impressive 21% greater than for the same period a year earlier. Natural gas production of 858166 barrels of oil equivalent per day declined 1.8% compared to a month earlier and by 1.5% on a year-over-year basis.

Source: Argentina Ministry of Economy and U.S. EIA.

That saw total national average hydrocarbon output of nearly 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent for April 2022 which while 2% lower than March was a notable 6.8% higher than a year earlier. For April 2022 41% of petroleum and 53% of natural gas production came from non-conventional operations compared to 30% and 37% a year earlier. Those numbers underscore the ongoing development of operations in the Vaca Muerta and the significant expansion of shale oil and natural gas in unconventional play. They also show that Argentina’s hydrocarbon operations and production have returned to pre-pandemic levels.

The strong production growth witnessed over the last two years can be attributed to a significant increase in investment which will be further stimulated by the recent oil and natural gas price rallies. The latest developments which see Brent trading at well over $119 a barrel saw a number of energy companies operating in the Vaca Muerta earlier this year announce plans to fast-track investment in the shale formation. That includes Argentina’s national oil company YPF 51% owned by the Argentine government announcing plans to increase its $3.7 billion 2022 investment plan in response to significantly higher than expected oil prices. This the company stated would likely see greater exploration and development activity with a view to further expanding hydrocarbon production.

Argentina’s rig count is also steadily rising since hitting a low of no active rigs in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Baker Hughes data there were 50 active rigs at the end of May 2022 which despite being four less than April 2022 was higher than the 45 rigs reported for the same month in 2022.

Source: Baker Hughes and U.S. EIA.

That is a clear indicator of activity in Argentina’s oil patch notably the Vaca Muerta shale formation which is ramping up at a steady clip. YPF in early June 2022 announced that it intended to widen its drilling program. This will see the national oil company drill two wildcat wells in Mendoza the first such wells in the northern section of the Vaca Muerta and if they are successful a further 150 wells on two blocks in the area will be drilled. These developments indicate that Argentina’s oil and natural gas output will keep growing at an impressive rate.

Rising investment improved drilling techniques and the building out of critical infrastructure in the Vaca Muerta such as the 563km or 350mile natural gas pipeline connecting the formation to Buenos Aires will cause breakeven prices to fall. YPF believes that a combination of technology improved infrastructure and drilling expertise will see breakeven prices fall to as low as $30 per barrel making the formation competitive with U.S. shale oil and other Latin American jurisdictions. This will attract further investment especially when it is considered that it is light and sweet with API gravity of 40 to 45 degrees with less than 0.5% low sulfur content. That makes it easier and cheaper to refine while giving it a low carbon footprint compared to many other oil grades produced in Latin America. Those qualities have seen Argentina’s key crude oil blend Medanito becoming popular among global energy markets with cargoes being shipped to the U.S. West Coast and Europe. In late May 2022 Buenos Aires announced it was easing foreign exchange controls for the oil industry in a bid to attract further investment and bolster production.

Industry analysts estimate that Argentina could be pumping one million and 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent of petroleum and natural gas respectively by 2026. That would see the economically crisis-riven country emerge as a world-class petroleum producer capable of exporting around half of the crude oil and natural gas it produces. Such a development if it occurs will give the economy a solid boost. It will also make up for any supply shortfalls caused by a lack of drilling activity in North America while expanding global natural gas supplies at a crucial time with the gaseous hydrocarbon mix a crucial fuel for the clean energy transition.

Yes it was with the intention of maintaining their speed from the morning but it's fairly standard for golfers in the afternoon wave to have to combat changing conditions and the greens didn't appear to need it. The organisation's micro-management of scoring is a habit which is hard to shift and in this case it provided us with a small but not insignificant draw bias.

But it's about 1/2 that the winner is among those four elite names mentioned a group which covers three of the last four major winners plus McIlroy. Morikawa ranked seventh in the world lets the side down somehow: the others are first second and third. The Country Club has so far provided an ideal test upon which the very best players in this sport have excelled.

The uber-talented Aaron Wise might have other ideas and so will Sam Burns and Matt Fitzpatrick while there's a fairy tale of sorts very much possible if co-leader Joel Dahmen were to triumph. Whether it's one of those Jedi mind tricks I keep reading about or the sincere view of an honest man Dahmen has said before that he simply cannot win a tournament like this against players like these and almost didn't bother with qualifying. So far he's doing a good job of proving himself wrong on the first point and right to have turned up for the latter.

Strange things can happen in major championships and it's just one month since we were one par away from the world number one hundred getting the better of some of the world's best players. And yet at the halfway stage of the US Open the overwhelming likelihood appears to be this: either Collin Morikawa Jon Rahm Rory McIlroy or Scottie Scheffler will win the third men's major of the season.

Scheffler had to battle against it and having been two-over early in his round to finish three-under was an extraordinary effort. He'd been among those undone by the draw in the PGA Championship and it got the better of him but this extremely quick learner put that right as a chip-in eagle at the 14th ignited his bid. Had conditions been fairer if fairer is the right word in a sport like this one then he might have been the man they all have to beat.

Instead the market can't split the other three but I'd make Rahm favourite based on what I've seen. He's driven the ball superbly for the most part the brief issues he suffered with his approaches on Thursday appear to have been ironed out and something that can never be covered in the stats he has brushed the hole with a number of putts from range. Throw in a series of Torrey-style par saves during the middle of round two and he is narrowly preferred.

I'd be less confident about Morikawa who has putted very well but then wobbled on a short one for eagle which would've earned him the outright lead. In the words of Brad Faxon he's 'wiped' a few drives and got away with them at times and while virtually flawless from this sort of start in majors there have been hints that his game isn't exactly where he'd like it. Clearly though he could win regardless.

For those yet to invest my advice would be to consider Rahm and Scheffler most strongly but with two of the three co-favourites onside from the start now is not the time to go back in on the outright market. Nor do I feel inclined to back Sebastian Soderberg at 13/8 to be the top Scandinavian thus ensuring a profit on that market with only he and David Lingmerth still standing. For now let's let it all ride.

Best two-ball bets for round three

It's been a good two days across the board with all five three-ball suggestions winning but a note of caution is advised regarding two-balls. For starters we now have no dead-heat safety net (if two players tie in a two-ball the vast majority of bookmakers pay out on the tie instead) and we are also assessing players who've played very similarly for 36 holes. Separating them over the next 18 isn't always easy.

One way into the coupon is to look for those who played on opposing sides of the draw which means one of the two will have had better scoring conditions to the tune of around 1.5 strokes. Nick Hardy (v Beau Hossler) Cameron Tringale (v Mackenzie Hughes) and Thomas Pieters (v Will Zalatoris) can all effectively be marked up but Tringale has relied on his short-game and taking on Zalatoris is similarly unappealing.

The fourth player who has overcome the handicap to match his partner's score is in fact SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER and though he's a short price that's merited against Matthew NeSmith a nervy sort who was close to tears when contending in the Valspar Championship earlier in the season.

NeSmith battled hard and this country-club ball-striker has a good game for a US Open like this one where power isn't everything but he's got a job on his hands here. Scheffler's form is hugely superior and with that handicap perhaps hiding the fact he's played the better golf this week I'm happy to include him in multiples.

My strongest fancy at the prices is BRIAN HARMAN who can put his experience and nous to use and get the better of Patrick Rodgers.

These two played from the same AM-PM draw and they've been remarkably similar in terms of scoring make-up so far which is to say each has been strong through the bag to set themselves up inside the top 10.

But for all Rodgers' talent there have to be serious concerns that he'll back-pedal today. That's what he did in the third round of last year's US Open (77) and it's what he did on his previous appearance in 2018 (83). Twice he's entered the weekend of his national championship with an each-way chance and both times he's played poorly.

That's consistent with the bigger picture. Rodgers fell from eighth to 35th during round three of the Canadian Open and first to 24th in Boise last August when dropping down to Korn Ferry Tour finals. Last May a halfway lead in the Wells Fargo ended in 54th place with a round to go.

All told Rodgers has been inside the top 10 at this stage of a tournament eight times since the start of 2022 and on each occasion he dropped down the leaderboard. Over the course of his career he's been in this sort of situation 28 times and only twice has he edged closer to the lead. It's a pretty damning return however eye-catching his performances have been of late however much potential he still retains.

Harman who stuck around for second place when leading the 2017 US Open at this stage has a far superior record. Ten times he's got closer that's from 41 tries so one in four versus one in 14. What's more this includes when he went from co-leading to the solo lead in that US Open five years ago while he also has experience of teeing off late in the Masters and the PLAYERS Championship.

Given that he's also the better player on PGA Tour form the left-hander looks really solid at 10/11. He did well to fight back from a messy double-bogey midway through the back nine on Friday and should stick around in a way we've become accustomed to.

I did consider putting up 273-277 inclusive in bet365's winning score market which is three-under to seven-under in simpler terms. At odds-against (eight-under or better is odds-on) I think it underestimates the likelihood of a tougher weekend and the simple fact that there are only seven players who would reach eight-under by repeating their scores of the first two rounds anyway.

To my mind six-under seems a really good target from here but there are two reasons for leaving out the selection: one is that I prefer not to advise bets in markets available with only one bookmaker for obvious reasons but the other is the USGA. Ultimately they have a large amount of control over what the score is and I can't quite trust them to let the course dry out and show its teeth.

Instead then I'll sign off with GRAYSON MURRAY to beat Guido Migliozzi which helps make for a 5/1 treble. The justification for this one is very simple: there's a vast chasm between the way these two have struck their balls over the first two rounds with Murray's ball-striking superior by around five and a half strokes.

He's been playing much better of late whereas Migliozzi's long-game has been in disarray for many months. If that continues for another 18 holes it seems likely to me that the Italian finds himself dropping down the leaderboard.

BAC,Bank of America,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2p1bi8xOS9ob3Blcy1oaWdoLWZvci1kb3dudG93bi10b3dlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With new owners hopes high for downtown Little Rock towers,"



Two of downtown Little Rock's signature buildings -- aging towers at least a half-century old -- are taking on new owners and inspiring hope that the city's central business district could be in for a resurgence.

New buyers have gained control of the Bank of America and Regions Center office towers that have been entangled in legal knots and fell into disrepair that led to disgruntled tenants. The new investments are energizing other commercial developers who operate downtown and the officials charged with promoting the city's core corridor.

Bank of America Plaza and Regions Center rest squat on Capitol Avenue just two blocks apart and dominate the city's silhouette along with Simmons Tower and the Stephens Inc. building.

""That's our city skyline"" said Gabe Holmstrom executive director of the Downtown Little Rock Partnership a key marketing and promotion arm for the city center. ""When you're crossing I-30 and coming into the city that's what you see.""

Regions Center is now owned by Taconic Capital Advisers a New York hedge fund that says it plans to invest in revitalizing the tower. Bank of America Plaza was purchased by Keith Richardson a Central Arkansas-based investor most noted for developing and managing multifamily properties through his company Richardson Development. Richardson did not respond to inquiries for comment on his plans for the facility.

""What's interesting in what's now happening is that you have local investments coming back into an area that was created by local investment but over the years changed hands to absentee owners who had different reasons for making that investment not all of which was for the betterment of downtown Little Rock"" says Jay Chesshir president and chief executive officer of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce.

""It's really exciting to us that local ownership and control is coming back into that central core of the financial district and even outside owners that are pledging to revitalize the area.""

Even competing commercial real estate developers and management companies heavily invested in downtown are looking forward to a potential infusion of new ideas and approaches to reinvigorate the downtown core.

""This is clearly an opportunity for downtown to come back commercially"" said John Flake who has been involved in downtown development for nearly 50 years and is managing partner for the Simmons Tower across the street from Regions Center. ""It can be a real bright spot again for the city – I'm very bullish on downtown.""

Little Rock's central business district like most urban downtown areas in state capital cities has historically been home to banks law firms government agencies and professional-service firms that cater to state and county governments. West Little Rock and suburban markets have lured tenants from the central hub putting pressure on building owners and their leasing partners.

""Little Rock's CBD has kind of languished in occupancies and in static rents for quite some time"" said Greg Joslin a senior broker with Colliers of Arkansas who has been involved in the downtown commercial leasing market for more than a decade. ""It's been a challenging environment.""

Dallas-based CBRE Group will lease and manage the Regions facility through its Little Rock office which has been housed in the tower since 2016. The new owners are planning to feature the building's multiple amenities including an event center on the 30th-floor with a full-service kitchen and bar that was formerly the Little Rock Club and will be open to tenants and the public.

In addition Cromwell Architect Engineers of Little Rock has been hired to develop a mixed-use plan to generate foot traffic and attract downtown workers to the 20000 square feet of ground-floor space Callahan said noting the reconfiguration could include restaurants other food-service operations a grocery concept and specialty services.

""That space is front and center right on Capital and Spring Street"" he added. ""We want to re-engage that space and figure out what is the right mix for it. The space is ideal because it is in the core of the financial district and we have thousands of people just within a few blocks. We want to make that space more of a people attractor.""

There is no set budget for updating the facility though Callahan said work will start immediately to install new elevator banks.

""We finally have an ownership that wants to make 400 West Capitol the premier downtown address"" Callahan said. ""We recognize that it's going to be a big investment and we're definitely prepared to make it.

""It's a good time to invest and to make something that stands out. We don't want to be plain office space"" he added. ""We want to be a building that has a high level of amenities and a high level of tenant services.""

Downtown's woes were exacerbated three years ago when the state of Arkansas purchased the former Alltel Corp. headquarters in Riverdale. The Commerce Department and other state agencies marched out of downtown to occupy the campus on the Arkansas River.

""That left a lot of big holes to try to fill in properties that were already just trying to maintain their occupancies"" Joslin added. ""Getting a new injection of capital and investors for downtown can only be a great thing for the area.""

Flake now commercial real estate advisor with Flake & Co. also is investing in the future of downtown Little Rock and advocates a repositioning for development of the area.

In November Flake and other partners plan to open a mixed-use technology center in the former home of Arkansas Power & Light's headquarters at 900 S. Louisiana St. on the southern border of downtown. Flake and his partners James Hendren and David Payne paid $2.8 million for the historic structure and have invested another $3.5 million to update it for tenants that will include a technology company on the top floor and a restaurant on the bottom.

""We looked at that as an opportunity to give a boost to downtown and to invest in a building that has been part of the area's history and development"" Flake said. ""We wanted to be a vote of confidence for real-estate development downtown.""

Downtown rejuvenation also is being invigorated by a new generation of leadership at another firm that has been a key to development of the urban district for nearly 40 years Moses Tucker. The firm was instrumental in developing the Little Rock River Market and condominiums in the area. Today it manages and leases the Mann on Main building along with anchors on Capitol Avenue: Union Tower and the Lyon building.

Chief Executive Officer and President Chris Moses is part of a group that purchased the Arkansas Capital Commerce Center at 200 River Market Ave. last year. ""We're not selling our office products in the area"" Moses says. ""We're doubling down.""

Pumping new investments into downtown is vital but the area also needs campaigns that promote the walkability and livability of the area according to Moses. ""We're not just selling a space it's a package of a 24-hour lifestyle that attracts millennials"" Moses said. ""If you're not selling that in the high-rise world you're really just another floor plan. For our city to be successful we've got to fix the riddle of the CBD.""

Likewise Holmstrom of the downtown partnership advocates that the City of Little Rock commit to a master plan strategy especially for the Capitol Avenue corridor. He notes such an outline hasn't been undertaken for more than 25 years. The Bank of America and Regions towers are ideal structures that could be animated with a new vision for their ground floors which were developed to house bank lobbies.

""There are opportunities there for these new owners to add amenities and entice restaurateurs to come to that space"" Holmstrom said. ""It's time for something new.""

Chesshir one of the city's top economic development salesmen also says downtown could use a novel approach to bolster its future. ""It's about attracting new people and creating new uses ... and reimagining what a space could be rather than what it's always been"" he said. ""And if we get that piece right we can grow what we already have here and attract other talent to this core area to grow with us.""

Worryingly there is growing evidence that the public is starting to expect consistently high inflation. Figures suggesting that Americans’ medium-term expectations of inflation had risen helped set off the market turmoil in early June which culminated in the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point. Central banks urgently need to convince people that they are serious about getting inflation down. But a range of evidence suggests that changing the public’s mind could be extraordinarily difficult.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWlzLW5ldHRpbmctYmV0d2Vlbi1hLTUtYW5kLTI4LXlpZWxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Is Netting Between a 5% and 28% Yield Annually From These Stocks,"Dividend stocks have been a great source of returns for the Oracle of Omaha.

It's no secret that Warren Buffett is one of the best investors alive delivering investors returns of 20% compounded annually since becoming chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965.

Numerous factors can explain Buffett's success and an important one is his love of dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are a great source of returns in the market and according to Fidelity have accounted for 40% of the S&P 500's total returns since 1930. When inflation is high as it was in the 1940s and 1970s dividend stocks accounted for as much as 71% of the market's returns.

Dividend-paying companies tend to have strong businesses that generate consistent cash flows making them stellar long-term investments. Here are three Buffett stocks that net the Oracle of Omaha high dividend yields relative to what Berkshire Hathaway paid for the stock.

1. Moody's: 27.9% yield relative to cost basis

Moody's (MCO 1.62%) provides credit ratings to companies across the globe and is an essential player in the fixed-income market. The credit ratings business has huge barriers to entry making it difficult for new companies to enter the space. As a result a few companies dominate the industry with Moody's and S&P Global as the leaders with a 40% market share each.

Last year Moody's benefited as $2.3 trillion in corporate debt was issued a record amount. Moody's gains from low interest rates which encourage businesses to issue more debt as they expand.

Rising interest rates will put a damper on this business which saw revenue decline 20% in the first quarter compared with the previous year. Management at Moody's expects its ratings business revenue growth to decline to the low-double digit percentages but sees revenue from its analytics business increasing in the high teens. In the first quarter analytics business revenue increased 23% marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth from the segment.

Moody's is a longtime holding of Berkshire's which has an ultra-low average cost of about $10 per share giving it an impressive 27.9% dividend yield relative to its cost basis.

2. Bank of America: 5.9% yield relative to cost basis

Bank of America (BAC 0.40%) provides banking services across the globe and is the second-largest bank in the U.S. with $2 trillion in deposits behind only JPMorgan Chase. It's also Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest holding.

The Federal Reserve is aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation which can benefit bank stocks. Banks traditionally make money from net interest income the difference between interest paid on deposits and interest collected from loans.

The Federal Reserve recently raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.75% as it tries to reel in inflation. The benchmark interest rate now sits between 1.5% and 1.75% and will continue to rise through the year as Fed officials forecast the rate to be around 3.4% by year-end.

One factor investors must consider is that if interest rates rise too quickly they could stifle consumer demand which could lead to reduced economic growth and slower loan growth for banks.

While there are fears of a recession on the horizon Bank of America is well positioned to benefit from rising interest rates in the long run which is why Buffett likes the stock so much. In its March 31 filing Bank of America noted that a 1% increase in interest rates would cause net interest income to grow by $5.4 billion or a 12% increase from 2021.

Berkshire Hathaway has an average cost of $14.17 on its Bank of America stock giving it a 5.9% dividend yield relative to its cost basis.

3. U.S. Bancorp: 4.9% yield relative to cost basis

U.S. Bancorp (USB -0.57%) provides banking services through its 2200 branches across the Midwest and West regions of the U.S. and is one of Berkshire Hathaway's top 10 largest holdings.

The bank also benefits from rising interest rates more than other banks because it doesn't have an investment banking division to boost earnings. Instead it focuses on traditional banking activities of lending money and growing deposits.

U.S. Bancorp is laser-focused on increasing loans and is selective about the loans it is willing to make concentrating only on high-quality credits. As a result the bank has a return on equity (ROE) that has outpaced its banking peers for years.

Last year the bank sacrificed short-term profits so that it could have the financial flexibility to take advantage of higher interest rates this year and beyond. The bank's net interest income grew by 3.6% in the first quarter. In its March 31 filing it projected a 2% increase in interest rates would increase its net interest income by another 3.3%.

Berkshire Hathaway has an average cost of $37.51 in U.S. Bancorp stock giving it a 4.9% dividend yield relative to its cost basis."

This comes after a two-year trial that resulted in the rehoming of more than 260 canines above the height of 50cm and 16 K9 sniffer dogs between March 2020 and March this year.

The expanded criteria under Project Adore - an initiative led by the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) to reduce the number of strays on the street - has helped more dogs find new homes.

AVS' animal welfare group partners rehomed an average of about 200 dogs per year before 2019. This went up to more than 300 mixed-breed dogs annually in 2020 and 2021 said AVS on Saturday (June 18).

Under the pilot that began in March 2020 AVS increased the height limit for dogs that can be adopted under Project Adore from 50cm to 55cm and removed the weight restriction of 15kg.

The adoption scheme for retired sniffer dogs was also extended to the public. Previously only existing and recent K9 officers were allowed to adopt them.

Launched in 2012 Project Adore is supported by HDB and animal welfare groups such as Action for Singapore Dogs (ASD) and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How who attended an AVS event at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park on Saturday said that when Project Adore first started some HDB residents had reservations about their neighbours keeping larger dog breeds.

""However our animal welfare group partners ensured that stringent adoption conditions were met to minimise inconveniences to the community"" he said.

Under Project Adore animal welfare groups will screen potential adopters and assess dogs' temperaments to determine their suitability to be rehomed.

Adopters have to complete a mandatory obedience training programme of six sessions with their dogs.

Mr Wayne Gui director of AVS said that feedback from the public has shown that the number of complaints about such larger adopted dogs has been low.

""It shows that the training programmes undergone by the dogs are working.""

He added that during the pilot complaints were mostly about dogs barking and not being leashed which could be easily solved with training.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video . ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

It's no secret that celebrities spend a lot of time preparing for the Met Gala whether it's going through hair and makeup trials or eating a specialized diet . Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone.

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms."

Look for lane closures starting June 20 on Highway 371 by Brainerd International Raceway,"BAXTER — Highway 371 travelers north of Brainerd-Baxter can expect weekday lane closures with reduced speeds in both directions starting Monday June 20 from south of Gull Lake Dam Road (just south of Brainerd International Raceway) to north of Green Gables Road (by Dunmire's on the Lake).

This is for a $6.8 million access and safety improvement project.

Construction will end Nov 1.

The Minnesota Department of Transportation will reconstruct three intersections with a reduced conflict intersection design also known as a J-turn at Gull Lake Dam Road Birchdale Road (Brainerd International Raceway main entrance) and Green Gables Road.

The two-year project will also reconstruct and extend both frontage roads along Highway 371; replace underground pipes and repair ditch drainage; and resurface work areas which includes shoulders and entrances.

In a reduced conflict intersection drivers always make a right turn followed by a U-turn. This reduces potential conflict points and improves safety MnDOT said in a news release. These intersections decrease fatalities and injuries caused by broadside crashes on four-lane divided highways.

Access will be open to those who live work or visit areas within the work zones; however expect changes MnDOT said. Highway 371 will always be open to BIR at Birchdale Road or Landmark Drive.

Later this summer Green Gables Road will be detoured to reconstruct the entrance to Highway 371. More details will be released later.

In June 2023 crews will return to complete Theatre Road and pave any remaining gravel areas along Highway 371.

A Stewart Island pupil crossed Foveaux Strait to have a taste of the South Pole.

Ryan McRitchie-Kin from Halfmoon Bay School was among 20 pupils selected to attend the Young Inspiring Explorers Summit in Christchurch last weekend.

The event hosted by the Antarctic Heritage Trust in partnership with William Pike Challenge offers a range of immersive experiences which included a ride in a Hagglund an encounter with huskies and a backstage visit with the penguins at the International Antarctic Centre.

Pupils also camped overnight phoned in to the South Pole heard from representatives from the US Embassy and learned how explorers of the heroic age dressed for freezing temperatures.

Ryan’s mum Letitia said her son loved to explore and get outdoors so the event was a natural fit for him.

""It’s part of the psyche down here.""

She said Ryan now hoped to follow in her footsteps and travel to the sub-Antarctic islands.

Since the event Ryan had been asking if he was old enough to join the next Inspiring Explorers Expedition she said.

The expedition will see three young people traverse close to 1000km from the Ronne Ice Shelf to the South Pole a route inspired by Reinhold Messner and Arved Fuchs’ Antarctic crossing. The duo crossed the frozen continent without snowmobiles or dog sleds.",,,,,,,,,

(AP) — An anonymous bidder has shelled out a record $19 million for a private lunch with billionaire Warren Buffet at a steakhouse in New York City.

The meal with the Berkshire Hathaway CEO was offered on an eBay auction to benefit the San-Francisco-based charity GLIDE which helps homeless people and those in poverty. The winner can bring up to seven guests.

Buffett has raised $53 million for GLIDE since the auction began in 2000. The charity earned the philanthropist billionaire’s support when his first wife Susie introduced him to it after she started volunteering there. She died in 2004.

This year’s event will be the first private lunch offered with the 91-year-old billionaire since the previous record-setting bid of $4.5 million by cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun in 2019. The past two auctions were called off due to COVID-19 concerns and Buffett has said this will be the last.

“It’s been nothing but good” Buffett said of the charity lunch in a news release. “I’ve met a lot of interesting people from all over the world. The one universal characteristic is that they feel the money is going to be put to very good uses.”

Like the winner this year some other past winners have chosen to remain anonymous. One past winner Ted Weschler received a job offer from Buffett’s company after he spent nearly $5.3 million on two auctions in 2010 and 2011. Weschler now works as an investment manager for the Omaha Nebraska conglomerate Berkshire.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8xOS9idXNpbmVzcy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0LWx1bmNoLTE5LW1pbGxpb24tdHJuZC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wNi8xOS9idXNpbmVzcy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0LWx1bmNoLTE5LW1pbGxpb24tdHJuZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Someone paid $19 million for a steak lunch with Warren Buffett,"CNN —

There really is no such thing as a free lunch.

An anonymous bidder paid a record-breaking $19 million for a private steak lunch with legendary investor Warren Buffett. The sale was part of the 21st annual auction for a lunch with Buffett produced in collaboration with eBay and the Glide Foundation a San Francisco-based non-profit working on combating poverty hunger and homelessness.

The bidding started with $25000 on June 12 and ended with $19000100 from an anonymous bidder on Friday according to a news release from eBay.

This year’s huge sum is more than four times the winning bid of $4567888 in 2019 — the last auction before a hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 2019’s winner was cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun.

The mystery winner will enjoy a private lunch with Buffett and up to seven guests at Smith & Wollensky Steakhouse in New York City says eBay.

Unfortunately for aspiring investors hoping to top this year’s record this is the last year of the “power lunch” with Buffett. The annual auction has raised over $53 million for Glide.

“On behalf of GLIDE and those we serve I thank Warren Buffett for his unwavering generosity partnership and dedication and for his incredible contribution to our mission” said the organization’s president and CEO Karen Hanrahan in the news release.

The auction was first started by the late Susie Buffett in 2000. Since 2003 eBay has managed the auction.

“We are incredibly proud that Warren Buffett’s final Power Lunch has broken our all-time record of funds raised with all proceeds supporting GLIDE’s efforts to create pathways out of crisis and transform lives” said eBay CEO Jamie Iannone in the release.

It's no secret that Warren Buffett is one of the best investors alive delivering investors returns of 20% compounded annually since becoming chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965.

Numerous factors can explain Buffett's success and an important one is his love of dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are a great source of returns in the market and according to Fidelity have accounted for 40% of the S&P 500's total returns since 1930. When inflation is high as it was in the 1940s and 1970s dividend stocks accounted for as much as 71% of the market's returns.

Dividend-paying companies tend to have strong businesses that generate consistent cash flows making them stellar long-term investments. Here are three Buffett stocks that net the Oracle of Omaha high dividend yields relative to what Berkshire Hathaway paid for the stock.

1. Moody's: 27.9% yield relative to cost basis

Moody's (MCO 1.62%) provides credit ratings to companies across the globe and is an essential player in the fixed-income market. The credit ratings business has huge barriers to entry making it difficult for new companies to enter the space. As a result a few companies dominate the industry with Moody's and S&P Global as the leaders with a 40% market share each.

Last year Moody's benefited as $2.3 trillion in corporate debt was issued a record amount. Moody's gains from low interest rates which encourage businesses to issue more debt as they expand.

Rising interest rates will put a damper on this business which saw revenue decline 20% in the first quarter compared with the previous year. Management at Moody's expects its ratings business revenue growth to decline to the low-double digit percentages but sees revenue from its analytics business increasing in the high teens. In the first quarter analytics business revenue increased 23% marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth from the segment.

Moody's is a longtime holding of Berkshire's which has an ultra-low average cost of about $10 per share giving it an impressive 27.9% dividend yield relative to its cost basis.

2. Bank of America: 5.9% yield relative to cost basis

Bank of America (BAC 0.40%) provides banking services across the globe and is the second-largest bank in the U.S. with $2 trillion in deposits behind only JPMorgan Chase. It's also Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest holding.

The Federal Reserve is aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation which can benefit bank stocks. Banks traditionally make money from net interest income the difference between interest paid on deposits and interest collected from loans.

The Federal Reserve recently raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.75% as it tries to reel in inflation. The benchmark interest rate now sits between 1.5% and 1.75% and will continue to rise through the year as Fed officials forecast the rate to be around 3.4% by year-end.

One factor investors must consider is that if interest rates rise too quickly they could stifle consumer demand which could lead to reduced economic growth and slower loan growth for banks.

While there are fears of a recession on the horizon Bank of America is well positioned to benefit from rising interest rates in the long run which is why Buffett likes the stock so much. In its March 31 filing Bank of America noted that a 1% increase in interest rates would cause net interest income to grow by $5.4 billion or a 12% increase from 2021.

Berkshire Hathaway has an average cost of $14.17 on its Bank of America stock giving it a 5.9% dividend yield relative to its cost basis.

3. U.S. Bancorp: 4.9% yield relative to cost basis

U.S. Bancorp (USB -0.57%) provides banking services through its 2200 branches across the Midwest and West regions of the U.S. and is one of Berkshire Hathaway's top 10 largest holdings.

The bank also benefits from rising interest rates more than other banks because it doesn't have an investment banking division to boost earnings. Instead it focuses on traditional banking activities of lending money and growing deposits.

U.S. Bancorp is laser-focused on increasing loans and is selective about the loans it is willing to make concentrating only on high-quality credits. As a result the bank has a return on equity (ROE) that has outpaced its banking peers for years.

Last year the bank sacrificed short-term profits so that it could have the financial flexibility to take advantage of higher interest rates this year and beyond. The bank's net interest income grew by 3.6% in the first quarter. In its March 31 filing it projected a 2% increase in interest rates would increase its net interest income by another 3.3%.

Berkshire Hathaway has an average cost of $37.51 in U.S. Bancorp stock giving it a 4.9% dividend yield relative to its cost basis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dHMtcG9ydGZvbGlvLWZ1bGwtYnV5YmFjay0xMjAwMDAzMjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's portfolio is full of buyback opportunities which he calls 'the best use of cash'.

The fact that the world’s most famous investor Warren Buffett appreciates shareholder rewards shouldn’t be surprising. After all a sizable and predictable return is the whole point of investing.

Buffett takes this philosophy seriously and seeks out companies with the most generous shareholder rewards program. All five of his biggest holdings pay dividends. But they also have something else in common: buybacks.

Stock buybacks or share repurchases could be considered “hidden dividends.” Here’s why Buffett’s portfolio is dominated by companies buying back their own shares and why the Oracle of Omaha regularly buys back Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) shares too.

Eager to escape the dismal stock market? Unfortunately “cash is not a safe investment” says Ray Dalio founder of the world’s largest hedge fund. “It’s not a safe place because it will be taxed by inflation.” With the consumer price index hitting a 40-year high of 8.6% in May you’ll need to get creative to find strong returns.

The magic of buybacks

In 2004 Buffett described his thesis on buybacks. “When stock can be bought below a business’s value it is probably the best use of cash” he told Berkshire Hathaway investors.

A buyback program reduces the number of outstanding shares. That makes each remaining share more valuable. It also means that the company’s annual earnings belong to a smaller group of investors.

Buybacks have other advantages. They’re more tax-efficient than dividends because shareholders receive some value without the need to receive cash. These buyback programs are also a sign of confidence from the company’s management team.

Put simply a well-executed buyback handsomely rewards shareholders.

These programs have become more popular in recent years. In 2021 S&P 500 companies collectively spent over $1 trillion in buybacks — reducing the stock market’s aggregate share count by 4%. Buybacks could be just as aggressive this year as stocks get cheaper.

Here are some of the most noteworthy buyback programs in 2022.

Union Pacific

North America’s largest railroad operator has been buying back shares longer than any other stock on this list. Union Pacific (UNP) has reduced its share count by half since 2006. The stock price is up 827% since then. If you include dividends over that period the total return is even more impressive.

Story continues

The company’s ongoing buyback program could reduce outstanding shares by 20% over the next five years. Investors can also expect a steady flow of dividends. After all the company has paid consistent annual dividends for 123 years. The current yield is roughly 2.5%.

Apple

In dollar terms Apple’s (AAPL) buyback program is the largest one on the market. The company deployed $81 billion to repurchase its shares last year. This year analysts expect a further $80 to $90 billion program. That would represent 4% of the company's current market value.

The iPhone maker also pays a modest dividend every year. These lucrative and consistent rewards could be the reason why Apple is the largest holding in Warren Buffett’s portfolio.

Exxon Mobil

The ongoing energy crisis has created a windfall for oil and gas producers across North America. Exxon Mobil (XOM) is at the forefront of this trend. This year the company tripled its buyback program from $10 billion to $30 billion.

Cash flows have skyrocketed so rapidly that it’s even caught Washington’s attention. President Joe Biden said “Exxon made more money than God this year.” Perhaps the buyback program could share some of that heavenly windfall.

These are easily the best prices we've seen for an RTX 3080 video card since launch. At this price point the RTX 3080 is a better value than the 3080 Ti which costs at least $250 more at reputable vendors. The performance gap between the 3080 and 3080 Ti is about 3% hardly noticeable. The 3080 is significantly more powerful than the previous generation's flagship RTX 2080 SUPER. This is the card you want to get if you plan to game at 4K.

Full-size luxury sedans are flagship models that people turn to for regal comfort and opulent interiors. In this market segment the German automakers lead the way by a mile over the competition.

The Winner

For 2022 the Porsche Panamera repeats as our Best Buy award winner. Exceptional selection is the main reason why starting with gasoline V6 and V8 engines in addition to plug-in hybrid powertrains. Don’t worry about performance: even the base Panamera packs 325 horsepower. At the top of the range is the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid which combines a turbocharged V8 with an electric drive unit for a total of 690 horsepower.

The sedan is joined by a wagon called Sport Turismo so if you hate SUVs that particular body style could be tempting. Inside top-notch materials abound and build quality is superb. The rear seats might be a little too tight for family duties mind you.

Other Finalists

The BMW 7 Series is our runner-up for 2022. Remember how it debuted years ago with a large front grille that rubbed people the wrong way? That’s nothing compared to the massive nostrils on the brand’s new electric vehicles as well as the 4 Series coupe. Similar to Porsche BMW offers a plug-in hybrid variant although with just 389 horsepower on tap the focus of this one is more about comfort and efficiency than all-out performance. Both competitors can travel up to 27 km on battery power alone.

Photo: Daniel Krause

Purists and big-displacement enthusiasts can still turn to the 6.0-litre V12 engine producing an impressive 600 horsepower. Identical potency in a different flavour can be found in the BMW Alpina B7 model which houses a turbocharged 4.4-litre V8.

As for third place we picked the Audi A8 arguably the most conventionally styled of the bunch. The large sedan from Ingolstadt may not revolutionize the segment but it continues to stand out with impeccable road manners an exquisite cabin and lively performance especially in S8 trim.

Note: We had not yet tested the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class when the time came to make our picks for the 2022 Best Buy awards.

We know it’s a little confusing but if you’re a candle fanatic (like most of the Good Good Good team) we want you to know that we see you.

You’re the kind of person who practices good candle etiquette (always trim the wick and let the candle burn for long periods of time so it doesn’t tunnel — bonus points if you use an electric lighter) and you may be known to pop a candle container in the freezer so you can clean it out and reuse it.

Maybe you have an allegiance to a certain candle brand or maybe you love to shop around to find just the right scent for each room in your home. Either way if you’re anything like us you want to make thoughtful decisions and shop sustainably in your pursuit of the perfect candle(s).

We’ve compiled a list of some of our favorite eco-friendly sustainable candles for this very purpose. Some of them were personally reviewed by members of our team and the others were researched and vetted by other candle lovers across the Internet.

First some facts about candles and sustainability.

Are candles bad for the environment?

As much as a candle might smell like it’s good for you a lot of times factory-made grocery store or department store candles can be made with harmful products such as paraffin.

Paraffin wax creates toxic benzene and toluene chemicals as it burns and breathing them in can be harmful to your health as well as the environment. Paraffin is also a by-product of petroleum refinement therefore contributing to global reliance and burning of fossil fuels.

Many of these candles also contain artificial dyes and fragrances which can also release harmful particles and small amounts of carbon dioxide into your home and therefore the environment.

Another polluter from candles are the containers they come in. Most times when a candle finishes its life cycle folks will chuck the whole container in the trash along with the small well of leftover wax and metal pieces.

‍

What makes a candle eco-friendly?

So what kind of candles are good for the environment?

We recommend sourcing candles made with natural and organic waxes like soy wax beeswax coconut wax and rapeseed wax — rather than mass-manufactured candles which are often made with paraffin wax. Wicks are also important so look for cotton hemp or wooden wicks.

As far as candle containers go keep your eyes out for containers you know you could reuse or recycle after cleaning them out.

The Refillable Plant-Based Candle from Grow Fragrance

Photo by Good Good Good

Where to buy: Grow Fragrance

What’s good: According to Grow they were the first to create a 100% plant-based candle — which ensures your candle is better for the environment and smells better than traditional petro-chemical candles.

Details: Your first candle order from Grow will come with a gorgeous white vessel and a separate candle “insert” in a recyclable aluminum container. The vessel will then be infinitely reusable as you continue to use their refillable candle inserts — eliminating waste and saving you money.

Each candle is toxin-free and they have full ingredient transparency on their site. (You can read through a list of everything inside your candle.) They also thoughtfully source the wick and vessel.

These candles offer a complex scent and are toxin-free and safe for your home.

Price: $34 for the vessel and insert — and then refills are just $20

Branden’s Thoughts:

Packaging: There was no plastic to be found in my shipment. Grow uses paper-based tape on a cardboard box — and instead of using bubble wrap they wrapped each candle in a recyclable corrugated paper packaging for padding. My candles arrived safely and sustainably.

There was no plastic to be found in my shipment. Grow uses paper-based tape on a cardboard box — and instead of using bubble wrap they wrapped each candle in a recyclable corrugated paper packaging for padding. My candles arrived safely and sustainably. Scent: So far I’ve tested the Lavender and Bamboo scents and love them. I’m already looking forward to ordering their limited edition ​​Sea Salt Neroli insert refill soon.

So far I’ve tested the Lavender and Bamboo scents and love them. I’m already looking forward to ordering their limited edition ​​Sea Salt Neroli insert refill soon. Burn time: 40-45 hours

40-45 hours Why it’s special: I love burning candles but I struggle with the leftover container at the end.

This candle finally solves that problem for me. I can continue to reuse the candle’s vessel forever — and the only “waste” is the recycled and recyclable aluminum insert that slides into the vessel.

Aluminum is among the most infinitely recyclable materials — and recycling aluminum saves roughly 90% of the energy used to create virgin aluminum.

Plus the vessel has a small hole in the bottom — which means that if I ever decide to retire it it can perfectly transition into a small planter with a drainage hole.

Other Notes: Grow Fragrance is a member of 1% for the Planet (just like Good Good Good!) and is a certified B Corporation. Their products are manufactured in the United States and are all Leaping Bunny certified. They pay their employees a living wage — and only partner with manufacturers that do the same.

“The launch of [ranibizumab-nuna] in the US marks an important moment for patients health care providers payers and the entire health care system. Patients suffering from retinal vascular disorders now have a more affordable treatment option” Ian Henshaw senior vice president and global head of Biosimilars at Biogen said in a statement.

“Our research with physicians shows cost is cited as a leading barrier to patients initiating treatment with one-third of patients unable to afford medication. [Ranibizumab-nuna] has the potential to expand access to patients suffering from retinal disorders that can result in permanent vision loss while also saving the [US] health care system billions of dollars” Henshaw said.

Ranibizumab-nuna will be commercially available on July 1 2022 through major distributors across the United States with a list price of $1130 per single-use vial to administer 0.5 mg via intravitreal injection.

This list price is approximately 40% lower than the list price of Lucentris.

The FDA approved ranibizumab-nuna in September 2021 for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) macular edema following retinal vein occlusion and myopic choroidal neovascularization.

Neovascular AMD though less common than dry AMD is responsible for the majority of the blindness or severe vision loss associated with AMD according to the statement.

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have become the standard of care treatment for neovascular AMD. However in real-world settings the costs related to neovascular AMD treatment make achieving optimal clinical conditions challenging.

“The launch of BYOOVIZ the first ophthalmology biosimilar in the [United States] marks a key step toward increasing options and reducing the financial burden associated with current anti-VEGF treatments” Christopher Hansung Ko president and CEO at Samsung Bioepis said in the statement. “The priority of Samsung Bioepis is ensuring patients’ access to the medicines they need and we will continue to advance our pipeline to bring better access to biologic treatments by leveraging our decade of experience in developing manufacturing and commercializing these important biologics.”

Ranibizumab-nuna is the first biosimilar launched in the United States under the Biogen and Samsung Bioepis’ partnership. In addition to the United States ranibizumab-nuna was also approved as the first ophthalmology biosimilar in Canada Europe and the United Kingdom.

The commercialization agreement of both companies includes 2 ophthalmology candidates ranibizumab-nuna and SB15 a biosimilar candidate referencing aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron).

Ranibizumab-nuna a VEGF inhibitor is indicated for intravitreal use and as a biosimilar to ranibizumab injection for individuals with neovascular AMD macular edema following myopic choroidal neovascularization and retinal vein occlusion.

Patients should be monitored following the injection according to the statement.

Additionally there is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors.

Asset management in recent decades has been a story of extraordinary growth — but also of increasing competition and concentration as active managers contend with the rise of passively-run exchange traded funds and new ideas about shareholder capitalism.

But views on the asset manager owner ownership structure that is best placed to meet these challenges varies widely. Managers are still sharply divided over the benefits of remaining private to shield investors from quarterly targets versus the business growth they can achieve by listing shares as a public company.

“Never has it been more important to be owned by an owner . . . who has a long-term outlook and an ability to offer support throughout the market cycle” says David Hunt chief executive of PGIM a top-10 asset manager.

Three US firms — BlackRock Vanguard and State Street — have grown to dominate not only a fifth of the $100tn in assets managed by the industry globally but also 80 per cent of the passive fund market in the US according to research by Common Wealth.

This has created huge pressure on other businesses to differentiate themselves and cope with the pressure on their margins as they are forced to cut fees to compete with passively-managed fund rivals.

For PGIM’s Hunt being part of insurer parent Prudential is key to aligning the firm with longer term thinking. “Stable long-term insurance assets are wonderful backers to long-term investment managers” he says. “We’ve kept our culture of an investment house not an asset gatherer because of the alignment of interests with our owner.”

Not everyone takes the same view though. Many experts argue that insurer-owned managers need to separate from their parent company and from their focus on managing the insurer’s assets in order to thrive in a highly competitive market.

While many asset managers are publicly listed — from giants like BlackRock and Amundi to smaller specialist boutiques — some believe that staying private can shield fund managers from short-term shareholder demands and the vagaries of market cycles.

“Investment management starts with extraordinarily long fiduciary commitments” says Hamish Forsyth president of Europe and Asia at US-based Capital Group which has over $2.6tn in assets under management. “When you launch a mutual fund you should expect to be running that mutual fund 10 50 or 100 years from now. There’s also the reality that ours is an industry where you have very little control over your revenues in the short run.”

The firm which was founded in Los Angeles in 1931 has responded to these opposing challenges by developing an employee ownership model that has allowed the organisation to remain private while favouring a conservative long-term investment style.

The company is privately owned by around 400 or so of the firm’s most senior employees while a team of fund managers look after portfolios instead of one individual.

“I think the employee ownership model is a very good way of getting that rather conservative long-term thinking baked into your decision-making. If you have a third-party owner do they really feel that way during the good times or do they just say ‘Well where’s my dividend?’” Forsyth says.

Some smaller firms have also found it an advantage to stay private. Active equity specialist Redwheel which has $22.6bn under management believes that remaining private while maintaining a multi-boutique structure allows the company more flexibility to ride out downturns.

“The fact that we are a private business that is majority controlled by the people in the business means that we can be patient [and] we can make long-term decisions in a market” says chief executive Tord Stallvik.

He does not believe this is necessarily the case at some peers where under-pressure management teams have started to have conversations about what expenses to start to cut as revenues fall in more challenging markets. “For smaller firms that are specialist investors I find it very difficult to see how [being public] doesn’t somehow influence the way you run the business in a way that is counter to being long term” Stallvik says.

For others however being public companies has been essential to growth.

Australia-based Pinnacle Investment Management which has $93.6bn under management across an array of investment styles and philosophies decided to list six years ago. Its original owners and managers had been wary of the influence of public markets but decided there was more to be gained.

“The listing was a big decision” says founder and managing director Ian Macoun. “We had been wanting to stay private to avoid short-term pressure from shareholders. But we convinced ourselves that the benefit of access to capital outweighed those concerns — and if [shareholders] do put that kind of short-term pressure on us we tell them to get stuffed.”

“Staying private can limit you; we wanted to grow” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Byb3BlcnR5L3Jlc2lkZW50aWFsL2FyaWQtNDA4OTg2OTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No it's not €3.45 million...try this €345K townhouse for size on Cork's Blackrock Road,"Don’t even try keeping up with the neighbours at 7 Carrig Dubh — the c 40-year-old townhouse hidden off the main Blackrock Road in Cork has some of the city’s best homes almost on its doorstep.

A 2013 aerial view of Cork city's Marina and Blackrock. Picture: Denis Scannell

Some might even be worth close to satirist and humorist Reggie’s notional “€5.2m mansion on the Blackrock Road” (he upped the value from €4.8m some time back unperturbed by minutiae like local property tax bands).

Carrig Dubh has short terraces.

Called after the Blackrock setting the Carrig Dubh niche scheme of nine homes — compact easily kept and utterly pitched now at traders down in a block of five another block of three and one on its own — was built on the grounds of a period house Carrigduve as evidenced by the quite grand limestone entrance gates topped with carved Georgian decorative motifs opposite the entrance to Menloe Gardens.

Within walking distance of these lovely gates are the likes of Dundanion House (by architect Thomas Deane) and the former Church of Ireland Rectory (by architect William H Hill) now both after considerable and expensive upgrades while the former Drumcora House is just on the city side part-slate hung and bow fronted is now being converted to luxury apartments for the trade-down market.

Back at Carrig Dubh the original period property Carrigduve House is still to the back of its original grounds utterly out of sight (except in glimpses from the Marina greenway through trees where its multi-sided central bay window is a literal standout) and dates to 1830s designed in an Italianate style by Thomas and Kearns Deane sons of a Cork architectural dynasty.

And immediately to the east are the 1960s-designed Dundanion Court flat-roofed houses around two courtyards much loved today by architects and design fiends done by former city architect Neil Hegarty during his early practise years and a winner of an RIAI Gold Medal.

The main bedroom

So pretty intimidating territory to be buying into it might appear.

Listed for sale this month is 7 Carrig Dubh the centre townhouse in a block of three linked to a slightly longer block of five facing a communal green.

No 7's interior is in very good shape

It’s of a similar design to comparable c 1000 sq ft niche infill schemes by Crab Lane and several in Douglas (eg the Cross Douglas Road Ballincurrig and Rosebank) and is priced at €345000 by auctioneer Jeremy Murphy.

As there’s only a handful here resales are pretty uncommon and the Price Register shows the last No 1 Carrig Dubh a decade ago making €165000 in 2013.

Not only has the market moved on considerably since 2013 Blackrock’s appeal has never been so high... Well not since the 1830s anyway so Mr Murphy can expect very considerable interest.

The immediate response to its listing was from traders-down and while it’s within the reach of first-time buyers they are likely to be outgunned by older buyers.

Step in

In excellent order throughout just needing a decorative update for modernity’s sake this 45-year-old home has 11050 sq ft inside with two double bedrooms with older-style built-ins has an already updated main bathroom neutrally tiled with shower a guest WC stairs to the side with an open-plan living/dining room front-to-back with fireplace and slender corniced ceiling with a compact kitchen.

It has gas central heating PVC double-glazed windows and a C3 BER and as it has neighbours either side it is sure to be kept cosy.

Finally its best pitch to traders-down – apart from the obvious location draw and the 200-year-old posh limestone entrance pillars and gates – is the accessible rear enclosed courtyard garden with a private car port and storage bins accessed via a roller shutter door and/or a side timber pedestrian gate.

Todays’ final stage 5 of the 2022 edition of an Rás took the riders on a 135.3km route from Kinnegad to Blackrock Dundalk. After 96km of racing the race took in 4 laps of a testing technical finishing circuit of just under 10km in length.





In spectacular race around Blackrock this afternoon an adrenaline fueled and furiously fast final approach to the line for final stage honors of the 67th edition of an Rás Tailteann saw Kevin McCambridge of Team Trinity Racing run out todays FBD Insurance sponsored stage winner from Matthew Teggart of Team Ireland in 2nd and with Matteo Cigala of Carlow Dan Morrissey again making the podium in 3rd place.





Matteo Cigala also pocketed the Bective Stud sponsored County rider stage jersey and the Festina watch sponsored daily county rider prize for his efforts.





In the overall Roscommon man Daire Feeley of the Cork - All Human Velo Revolution Team ran out an impressive winner retaining his yellow jersey of overall leader and his advantage of 51 seconds over second placed Louis David Sutton of Team Spain Brocar Ale. Adam Ward of Team Ireland rounded out the final podium in third place 1’06 in arrears.

The Spin11 sponsored U23 classification was won by Louis David Sutton (Team Spain Brocar Ale) and Rory Townsend (Team Ireland) consolidated his lead to win the City Break Apartments sponsored green points jersey. Finally









How it unfolded.





The final stage was a relatively short route featuring two categorised climbs at Slane and Collon before the race would enter Blackrock @ 95km for four laps of a 10km circuit which would finish the 2022 edition of the Rás Tailteann.





After the flag dropped the race took off at a ferocious pace averaging 50 km/hr over the first 30 minutes of racing on the roads out of Kinnegad. The peloton wasn’t letting any breaks go in the early phase of the stage with the lined-out peloton entering Navan at 60 km/hr.





There was plenty of hard racing over the next 30km as the peloton passed over the two categorized climbs in Slane and Collon. Dean Harvey of Team Ireland who started stage 5 second in the KOH classification took full points on both climbs and as a result was confirmed as winner of the Cycling Ireland KOH classification.





Although a number of break attempts were made as the race approached the finish circuit in Blackrock nothing was sticking as the bunch entered the spectator filled roads of Blackrock Co. Louth. Action packed racing followed over the next hour including a dangerous group of 4 riders going clear building a gap of 30s over the peloton. They included Ryan - Team Ireland Watson - Embark- Bikestrong Perrett - Dublin: Spellman and race leader Feeley - Cork: Velo Revolution. The break worked well together however the peloton weren’t letting the gap grow too big. With 10km remaining the race was all back together with the pace holding at 50 km/hr as the race approached the finish in Blackrock town.





Kevin McCambridge took advantage of a brief stall in the peloton and attacked with 5km remaining. He built an advantage of 10s with the peloton hot on his heels passing through the flamme rouge of 1km to go. McCambridge held on for victory by a small margin with Matthew Teggart of Cycling Ulster winning the bunch sprint for second followed by Matteo Cigala of Carlow: Dan Morrissey in third.













Finishing safely in the peloton Daire Feeley retained the race lead through stage 5 and was presented with the race winners George Plant Trophy and the cycling Ireland yellow jersey. His performance throughout the race was extremely consistent and his time gain on stage 3 into Lisdoonvarna proved critical in sealing victory.





David Louis Sutton of Brocar-Ale (winner of stage 2) held on for second overall with stage 3 victor Adam Ward of Team Ireland rounding up the podium.





Cáirde Rás Tailteann would like to thank everyone who contributed to the success of this the 67th edition of an Rás Tailteann and look forward to seeing you all in 2023 for the 68th edition.

The resignation of the head of Germany’s largest asset manager following a police raid over claims it had misled investors on its environmental record is fuelling an intense debate over so-called ‘greenwashing’ in the investment industry.

Asoka Wöhrmann’s decision to step down as chief executive of DWS earlier this month demonstrates the risks involved in marrying environmental social and governance (ESG) goals with financial returns. It also shows that accountability now extends to the very top of an asset manager — a development that rival investment chiefs will have noted.

Financial regulators appear determined to ensure that asset managers cannot exploit rapidly growing demand for ESG strategies by enticing investors with misleading or unrealistic claims.

Verena Ross the chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority the EU watchdog said last month that asset managers should make more efforts to “avoid misleading disclosures to investors about the greenness of a [financial] product”.

Esma has also released new advice about combating greenwashing to national regulators across Europe urging them to ensure that investors are not misled by the use of terms such as “sustainable” “ESG” and “green” in funds documents and strategies.

However this task has been made more complicated by the fact that the rules covering ESG products are still evolving on both sides of the Atlantic.

Key details have yet to be finalised for the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation which could affect how a fund is classified and sold to investors.

Meanwhile the US Securities and Exchange Commission recently launched a consultation to determine which disclosures should be made by funds that carry terms such as “ESG” “sustainable” or “low-carbon” in their names but Hester Peirce one of the SEC’s commissioners has objected to the proposals. She says that the SEC’s aim of helping investors to compare greenhouse gas exposure across funds will not work as managers will pick and choose the data points and models that suits their interests best. That Peirce believes will not lead to more efficient capital allocation or greater wealth accumulation.

Similar criticisms about data cherry picking have also been directed at bold claims by leading asset managers that carbon emissions will be reduced to net zero across their investment portfolios by 2050.

A total of 273 asset managers who together oversee investments worth $61.3tn have now signed up to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative an industry coalition.

NZAM’s members have agreed to set interim targets for emissions reductions by the end of this decade that are consistent with the 50 per cent reduction in CO₂ output needed to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial times.

But asset managers have some flexibility in interpreting how the NZAM framework is applied to their businesses which makes comparisons between them more difficult.

BlackRock estimates that a quarter of its assets invested in corporate and sovereign issuers are currently aligned with next zero and this should increase to “at least 75 per cent” by 2030.

Rival Vanguard says that it cannot attach net zero targets to its index trackers as this goal was not built into the original objectives of these funds. Vanguard expects that about $145bn of its $1.7tn in actively managed assets will be net zero aligned by 2030.

State Street Global Advisors has chosen to attach net zero targets to index trackers that already have a climate component or that “may be reasonably expected” to adopt a climate objective.

Sasja Beslik chief investment officer at NextGen ESG Japan a sustainable investment specialist says: “The NZAM commitments are purely aspirational and lack any detail explaining how the objective of decarbonising their investment portfolios will be achieved.”

He dismisses the NZAM initiative as “just a beauty parade”.

Environmental campaigners have also been dismayed by the refusal of BlackRock Vanguard and State Street to commit to ending new investments in fossil fuel projects.

Together the three managers own stocks and bonds worth close to $350bn issued by 12 of the world’s largest oil and gas companies — including Saudi Aramco ExxonMobil Chevron BP Shell and TotalEnergies — according to Reclaim Finance a campaign group.

“These managers are still investing billions into companies whose fossil fuel expansion plans make the objective of carbon neutrality by 2050 impossible to achieve” says Lara Cuvelier from Reclaim Finance.

Most of these fossil fuel investments are held in indexing tracking funds which mimic broad market benchmarks. Any attempt to change to the terms and conditions of indexing tracking funds would need to be accepted by existing investors and could be subject to legal challenges.

However Diana Best senior finance strategist at the Sunrise Project campaign group says that the swift removal of Russian companies from index trackers following the invasion of Ukraine demonstrates that asset managers do have some flexibility in determining which companies are included in their benchmarks.

Some senior US republicans are voicing pointed criticisms of ESG approaches though. Former US vice-president Mike Pence has described ESG as a “pernicious strategy” that distorts free market competition. In a Wall Street Journal article in May he called for US public pension plans to “rein in” BlackRock Vanguard and State Street for “pushing a radical ESG agenda.”

Under attack from politicians and environmentalists the problems facing asset management chiefs in balancing their ESG pledges to clients while not provoking regulators look set to increase in difficulty.

Wöhrmann’s departure from DWS represents a warning."

Over the past two centuries this place has been transformed time and again by its residents. From a quiet rural village to a prosperous commune to a booming factory town Hopedale has undergone great changes—and is in the process of transformation once again. Statue of Adin Ballou in Ballou Park NPS/Horrocks Commune Era In March 1842 the “first religious meeting” for Fraternal Community Number One was held in an aging farmhouse. From that day forward a group of radical Christians sought to build their own ideal society in a Dale of Hope. They were led by Reverend Adin Ballou who believed an ideal Christian society could be created from the ground up. On 600 acres of land Ballou and his fellow believers made Hopedale a reality. They constructed dozens of homes a place for worship a school and print shop. Industry ran under joint stock initiatives; many had their own businesses but all worked to support the Community as a whole. “All of our residents were busy people” Ballou wrote and “idlers and dawdlers not being encouraged or even tolerated.” Members of the Community agreed to a pledge. They sought to promote equality between the sexes voting rights abolition of slavery temperance and non-resistance. Education was also an important part of life in the community. Abbie Ballou Heywood trained to be a teacher and resided in Hopedale. Unlike in most nearby communities attendence at school was the norm in Hopedale. Abbie taught local children (as well as those of prominent activists). She carried on her father's legacy of furthering various social causes. Draper Era One of the early Community members was Ebenezer Draper. He ran a small machine shop that made parts for mechanical looms. Draper's business was very successful and he kept buying more shares of the commune. By the early 1850s he and his more business-minded brother George technically owned most of Hopedale. George Draper urged his brother to dissolve the Community. In 1856 Ebenezer withdrew his investments. The Community could not survive without their support and backing. George was a successful businessman and inventor who had different ambitions for Hopedale. Within a few decades the Draper Company would become the nation’s leading manufacturer of looms. At its height the Draper Corporation had over 4000 workers. This era of prosperity did not last. The Draper family gradually sold most of their properties and by 1978 the mill was closed.

A modest house on a leafy street with a collection of intriguing domestic architecture is a refreshing change from the over-optioned grossly expensive dwellings that are being developed across the East Side. Architect Christopher Royer’s new home at 19 Boylston Avenue is important on several levels. Despite–or because of–its 2100-square-feet size the uncomplicated gable-roofed house is an environmental triumph wrapped in a mantle of understatement.

After a career in Cambridge Royer and his wife Barbara Nathan a graphic designer have followed children and a grandchild to Providence. Plus as Nathan says “We like the spirit of this town and this neighborhood.” In addition to building right and for his needs rather than his ego perhaps most significant is the designer’s respect for the scale and character of the neighborhood. (Royer’s mentor at the University of California Berkeley was Christopher Alexander the guru of meaningful and accessible architecture.)

In an increasingly dispiriting even mean fashion older houses on the East Side are bought as tear downs so better built and more attractive properties are often lost and replaced by conspicuous nouveau riche displays of multi-car garages multi-pitched roofs and aesthetically puffed-up designs more suited to a suburban golfing community than to the tightly-knit fabric of an historic neighborhood.

Royer is one of those architects who would rather not raze a house that stood here for decades but the tiny house at 19 Boylston was unsalvageable. Yet he kept the existing footprint for the foundation of the new home. There is no concrete slab underneath just gravel; no structural steel was used. These are examples of minimizing carbon and greenhouse emissions during construction. Royer had worked with the Providence contractor Halmac Construction before and along with Rhode Island Energy they all brainstormed to achieve a Zero Energy dwelling.

Given the design’s incredibly tight envelope along with various heat pumps dense-pack cellulose insulation and reinforced windows 19 Boylston will use half the energy of a similar-sized conventionally-built house. The new owners will live in the house for a year to assess its energy usage and to gauge how many if any photovoltaic roof panels will be needed to fully achieve a net zero-rating.

Royer and his builders explored many possible ways to build somewhere between Rhode Island’s low bar of code compliance and the prohibitively expensive passive house standards. The architect-patron’s goal was a house that is durable comfortable and healthy. What was important for Chris and Barbara are all the things you cannot see.

Royer’s achievement here is a satisfying and sensible cottage-like home on this attractive street between the Quaker Meeting and Hope Street. It demonstrates more than the saving of energy and being environmentally responsible. It shows how more sensible domestic architecture that can be inserted into smaller lots with less bombast. Royer’s new Providence home shows the benefits of a more unassuming presence designing for the long term rather than sounding brass or tinkling of cymbal.

GoLocal architecture critic Morgan has an undergraduate degree from Dartmouth and two graduate degrees from Columbia. He has taught at Princeton and at Brown. He likes to remind people that the Ivy League is merely a collegiate athletic conference.

Javier Ghersi/Getty Images

In ""Two and Twenty"" a former partner at Apollo Global gives an insider's analysis of private equity.

The author aims to defend the highly-criticized industry but fails to support his argument with data.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the writer.

The title of a new book by a private equity insider left me anticipating a juicy tell-all about the inner workings of the industry.

""Two and Twenty: How the Masters of Private Equity Always Win"" is the work of Sachin Khajuria a former partner at Apollo Global one of the handful of largest private equity firms in the world.

The title however — like much else in Khajuria's perplexing tome — is profoundly misleading.

The term ""Two and Twenty"" refers to the mechanism by which the partners of private equity firms make their money. It comprises a 2% ongoing management fee payable on the total capital invested in the funds and a 20% performance fee tied to the value appreciation in the companies purchased by the fund. Those entrusting their wealth to the private equity funds get what is left over: namely 80% of the gains from the fund investments after the management fees.

Anyone with a passing familiarity with these economics knows the answer to the almost rhetorical question of

""Two and Twenty: How the Masters of Private Equity Always Win"" by Sachin Khajuria. Penguin Random House

how ""the masters of private equity"" are able to always win: for the larger firms the ""Two"" of the ""Two and Twenty"" ensures truly extraordinary wealth for the partners even if the investment performance is poor. Any firm with $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) will generate $1 billion in management fees each year to share among the general partners once expenses are covered regardless of whether there are any performance fees at all. The largest private equity firm Blackstone expects to reach a trillion dollars of AUM this year.

It turns out however that Khajuria has a very different answer in mind

Instead the author wants to convince readers that the reason the masters of private equity always win is that they are awesome.

Two and Twenty argues that the winning mindset of the best and brightest drawn to private equity allows them to ""always beat the market."" In addition as the largest firms amass more and more assets it makes them even more effective. This Khajuria claims is good for society because the massive resulting returns accrue ""to a substantial extent … to the retirees of tomorrow.""

With the explosion in the size of the sector over the past decade — managing almost $10 trillion in assets as of last year and growing — private equity has increasingly drawn the ire of legislators regulators and crusading journalists. The time is right for a book to provide a thoughtful counternarrative defending the industry that puts private equity in proper context.

Unfortunately 'Two and Twenty' is not that book

Khajuria's approach is to make a number of assertions regarding the private equity industry and demonstrate their validity through case studies drawn from his personal experiences. But many of the book's key claims lend themselves to a more direct methodology: looking at the data.

One of the core strengths of the biggest private equity firms according to Khajuria is their access to huge caches of proprietary data. Yet he fails to make reference to any of the voluminous data on private equity publicly available. That data does not support his many sweeping claims — on consistently superior performance on the advantages of fund size and more.

At times Khajuria focuses only on the subset of private equity firms that are able to consistently generate investment returns above the market rather than the entire industry. But the data still does not support this narrower approach as research that the fact that a firm's last fund is a winner does not tell you anything about whether the next fund will be.







The failure to ground the book in actual data would not be the end of the world if Khajuria delivered a revealing insider account that supported his perspective.

And here is where 'Two and Twenty' gets really strange

In lieu of convincing anecdotes from his actual experience we are treated to ""fictitious sketches"" and told that at least some but not all of these ""are inspired by real-life deals and events."" Where so inspired ""certain details"" have been masked or changed.

Some of these changes are just bizarre. The location of an unnamed private equity firm's 2021 annual meeting is identified as the Four Seasons Hotel on Fifth Avenue. The Four Seasons is on 57th Street and has been closed since March 2020. The hotel reappears later in the book at its correct address.

More confounding is that the facts included in the fictional sketches whether inspired or just made up often contradict the broader portrait that Khajuria is trying to paint. On the one hand he wants to correct misconceptions about this industry promoted by ""some in the press"" emphasizing for instance the ""serious and visible progress"" being made in areas like diversity sustainability and disclosure.

On the other hand the sketches often reinforce many of the more negative preconceptions about private equity practices. A company founder facing a crisis is romanced by the firm but once he takes their money ""the old man will be left on the side of the road if he is not on board"" with their plans. The game plan for another buyout is to ""cut out the fat by negotiating hard with trade unions and suppliers"" and quickly ""flip it to an Asian conglomerate"" at the first bullish window of opportunity.

Khajuria seems to justify some of the more questionable practices by emphasizing that the spoils — after taking out the two and twenty along with a long list of other fees that he only mentions in passing — accrue to retirees through the investments of their pension funds.

While repeatedly emphasizing the benefits to ""the financial security of our loved ones"" he fails to mention that the less sympathetic sovereign wealth funds dwarf the largest US pensions as private equity investors. Teachers and firefighters are mentioned repeatedly; China and the UAE the two largest sovereign wealth investors in private equity who together account for more than all US pension funds combined not at all.

It's hard to disagree with Khajuria that given the already huge and growing influence of all forms of private capital greater public understanding about private capital is ""essential.""

Despite its ambitions Two and Twenty makes a rather modest contribution towards achieving that laudable objective.

Engineer and aeronautics enthusiast Bruce Campbell knows all about that thanks to his iconic airplane home conversion the Boeing 727 widely known as “the home in the woods” or the Airplane Home.

Current spiking prices the housing crisis the international health crisis and overall more alarming environmental concerns have – or should have – encouraged a novel lifestyle approach. “We simply can’t go on like before” seems to have been the wake-up call for many people over the past decade and more poignantly so over the last couple of years. Bruce Campbell for his part has been saying this for more than two decades.Campbell lives in the Airplane Home or the home in the woods a Portland Oregon-based home unlike few others. It’s an old Boeing 727-200 that Campbell himself converted into a living space which also happens to be an iconic (now-grounded) aircraft and one of the finest examples of upcycling of modern times. The conversion itself though rudimentary by the standards of similar homes  pales in comparison with the story it tells.Campbell bought the 1969 aircraft in 1999 for $100000 after it was retired by a Greek airline. He spent another $120000 on transporting it to his privately-owned piece of land in Portland (which he bought when he was still in his twenties and hadn’t used for anything yet) and the conversion which he mostly did on his own.The idea was not to turn this gigantic aircraft into a space that would mimic a brick-and-mortar or wood home but into a space that would retain the aircraft vibe while offering the minimum in terms of creature comforts . Think of it as an aviation enthusiast’s playground with the possibility of living in it.The 153-foot (47-meter) aircraft was moved to the woods with its wings and tails sawed off and was then reassembled again. Its nose rests on an elevated platform and from the outside it almost looks as if it landed there by accident. The interior is surprising to say the least: Campbell removed most of the seats and the original floor which he replaced with see-through panels but kept many original elements. He improvised a bedroom area which consists of a futon a kitchen area with just a sink microwave and toaster and a shower and restored two original bathrooms.The interior space is very generous and that’s the highest selling point of the conversion. Campbell has 99 square meters (1066 square feet) of space to do whatever he wants to whether that’s tinkering with the original elements to restore them or further exploring the hidden structures of the former jetliner. A playground  indeed.As he puts it in the video below when so many jetliners are scrapped it makes no sense to spend money on a typical home. Jetliners are perfect as living solutions because they’re more durable more resistant to the elements since they’re storm- earthquake- fire- and insect-proof more efficient and definitely more fun. “They're among the finest structures that mankind has ever built” Campbell writes on his website AirplaneHome.com (republished with permission). “Jetliners are masterful works of aerospace science and their superlative engineering grace is unmatched by any other structures people can live within.”Campbell’s home uses the existing 727 water system but is hooked to a private well and to the grid for electricity. It offers incredible storage space and customizable living space; Campbell chose to keep his as close to the original as possible which might not suit all tastes but anyone could do whatever they wanted with this space.That’s his proposition: don’t let jetliners go to the junkyard when you could turn them into the most unique and personalized home  turning junk into something useful – and beautiful. To that end via his website Campbell is offering tips and words of advice as well as a list of things to look out for when starting your own project.

Founder Lyme Properties

Age: 72

Industry experience: 50 years

Cambridge’s Kendall Square might never have become the world’s life science capital if a New Hampshire timber company hadn’t decided to diversify some of its investments into commercial real estate.

David Clem’s classmate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology was a member of a family that was an investor in the Lyme Timber Co. and the connection resulted in his selection to lead its new development affiliate Lyme Properties. Clem was already active in the intertwined worlds of Cambridge politics and real estate as a former city councilor and partner at The Athenaeum Group which developed the first private life science project in Kendall Square outside of the urban renewal zone.

When The Athenaeum Group bought the One Kendall site we went to every major bank in the cities of Boston and Cambridge and we were turned down.

The Texas native saw opportunities to reactivate former factories near MIT as biotech research labs. Between 1993 and 2006 he built Lyme Properties into the third largest life science developer in the U.S. and attracted a who’s who of global biotech firms to Cambridge. The firm sold its Cambridge portfolio in 2008 and Clem turned his attention to projects near his home in the Upper Valley of New Hampshire.

Q: What’s the history of your first lab project One Kendall and the origin of the idea that it would be a good site for life science startups?

A: The One Kendall parcel was originally the Boston Woven Hose division of American Biltrite. They manufactured Mason-lid jars and hoses for the automotive industry and expanded to 23 buildings on the 12-acre site. Many of the buildings were 4 stories tall and they reached the point where they wanted to go to the suburbs in a more horizontal environment for manufacturing. The property is directly across the street from Tech Square and a short walking distance from MIT and that was one of the reasons it was so successful for startup lab space. The other feature of that building that was unique is it had been built as manufacturing space so it had unusually high floor-to-floor heights and unusually heavy floor loads.

Q: Why did you focus on life science rather than traditional tech offices?

A: The market dictated that. Our competition effectively was Boston Properties which had been awarded the development rights for Kendall Square and MIT had partnered with a private company to do University Park. Those were all new buildings and the Boston Properties site was closer to the T stop and immediately adjacent to the MIT East campus where most of the life science departments were: biology chemistry etc. David Barrett of Boston Properties actually referred our first lab tenant to us. He had been approached by Ciba Corning. They wanted a small lab and Boston Properties did not believe in putting animal rooms in a first-class office building. We were looking for tenants period. It was just that simple.

Q: How did Lyme Properties’ business plan take shape?

A: After One Kendall The Athenaeum Group was bought out and that’s when I attempted to retire the first time. I moved my family back to the Upper Valley in New Hampshire where Dartmouth is located and where I had been an undergrad. My wife and I had been married junior year and we had a farmhouse in Norwich Vermont. I was going to take a year off and decide what I wanted to do but within a month I had formed Lyme Properties and was back in Cambridge this time with a group that was better capitalized. That really launched our activity in Cambridgeport and then we bought the Kendall Square site from Commonwealth Energy.

Q: What made you rethink retirement?

A: The partners of Lyme Timber Co. which was a parent of Lyme Properties had just recapitalized and I was familiar with that company through my best friend at MIT whose family had been one of the initial investors. They asked to meet with me and they wanted to diversify into commercial real estate as opposed to timber and conservation projects. I told them I thought there was growing demand in Cambridge for life science and research space. They invited me to join and I created Lyme Properties and that launched the larger projects. We continued to develop for 15 years and at that point the founding partners of Lyme Timber wanted to retire and we made the decision to liquidate the Lyme Properties portfolio and we did that in three separate tranches.

Q: How would you compare the political climates in Boston and Cambridge in how they review and approve commercial development?

A: It honestly relates to the tenure of the chief executive. If you have a strong mayor with a long tenure and they were reelected numerous times that provides the same amount of stability as a city manager who is not constantly worried about being fired at the next [city] council meeting. When I was elected to the Cambridge City Council in the mid-1970s there had been a series of city managers and political volatility. [Former Cambridge Mayor] Al Vellucci hired James Leo Sullivan and he negotiated a longer-term contract. Bob Healey his assistant took over after that and they were both strongly in favor of economic development because the city needed the expanded tax base as the universities expanded. In Boston obviously the Boston Redevelopment Authority at the time had a significant role in moderating economic development so that everything didn’t come online at the same time. The mayor was always effectively in control of the BRA so a mayor elected for multiple terms could control the process and that’s why the skyline of Boston has changed so dramatically over the past 40 years.

It’s been a 25-year conversation about needing to separate planning and permitting in Boston. There’s kind of an inherent philosophical conflict there. It’s really about land use and how you want your city to evolve. But I don’t see the distinction based upon my experiences. When I wanted to do something in Boston I went to the mayor. When I wanted to do something in Cambridge I went to the city manager. In both cases they would typically say: “You need to manage the City Council and the neighborhood process.” I didn’t view that as a problem or an obstacle. I’ve never lost a permit in 50 years of development.

Q: How difficult was it to raise financing for life science projects initially?

A: When The Athenaeum Group bought the Boston Woven Hose property we went to every major bank in the cities of Boston and Cambridge and we were turned down for acquisition financing. The feeling at the time was you should tear all those buildings down and build new just like Boston Properties had started to do in the Kendall Square redevelopment area. Our response was: Boston Properties was the designated developer and they had effectively no land cost because the redevelopment authority cleaned up the environmental hazards. We told banks “We can’t compete with them.”

We bought the Boston Woven Hose property for under $5 a square foot and we said we wanted to position ourselves as a cheaper alternative because we thought we could renovate those buildings and be competitive. Even though it’s older space we think it’s interesting. We’d be the lowest-cost alternative. And everyone turned us down. Eventually the loan was made by Winter Hill Federal Savings. The president said “I don’t know if you’re going to succeed but I’m going to give you enough money to acquire the property and pay me interest for 18 months. If you don’t have anything in 18 months I’m going to foreclose. And you’re going to pay 6 points for the closing and pay 6 points above prime as the interest rate.”

And this was the Jimmy Carter years but we pulled it off. We were approached by Draper Labs to buy a portion of the site and we were able to lease the first phase pretty quickly.

Q: Utility sites can be difficult to acquire so how were you able to get the Commonwealth Energy property north of the Broad Street Canal under Lyme Properties’ ownership?

A: They wanted to build a 1 million-square-foot office building but there was a constant effort to downzone them. The Athenaeum Group owned property nearby and they approached me because I’d been on the Cambridge City Council. Whenever a downzoning petition was filed I would help them organize opposition so it required a two-thirds majority. If 20 percent of the affected landowners are opposed it requires a supermajority. I had done that probably three separate times for them. And then when Dukakis was governor his cabinet said utilities could not hold land for speculative purposes only ones directly related to energy production. A Commonwealth Energy real estate officer called us and said “You helped us protect our value would you be interested?” That’s how Lyme Properties became the owner of it.

Q: What projects are in Lyme Properties’ current development pipeline?

A: When I left in 2008 I negotiated the rights for the use of the name and we call ourselves Lyme Properties. Lyme Properties is run by my son who took over at the end of last year. River Park is my biggest current project and my quote-unquote “retirement project.”

It’s a very interesting site in West Lebanon about five minutes from Dartmouth College and Dartmouth Health Medical Center. I permitted that for over 1 million square feet of mixed uses. The first building was designed by [late Elkus Manfredi Architects Founding Principal] Howard Elkus. We were scheduled to begin in April [2020] and had to pull the plug on it. We had two-thirds of it leased and we’re trying to start again. Hopefully it’ll get under way this year.

We had some single-family house lots and sold all of those so the infrastructure’s phase one is complete. It has over a half-mile of frontage on the Connecticut River and we spent a year-and-a-half getting to know the neighborhood and running a series of charrettes. We had a letter of intent for the third floor with a life science user who is still in the Upper Valley and we had an LOI with a major institution for the entire second floor.

This problem has captured the attention of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu who formed a Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee to address the rental market.

“If we aren’t willing to take on the rent increases that are driving families out of Boston then we aren’t meeting the needs of our neighborhoods” the mayor said in a statement announcing the committee back in March.

While escalating costs are certainly troublesome in Boston where the majority of residents and families are renters there are other issues that need to be exposed and addressed. Among them is the “lottery” system for affordable housing which city officials developers and leasing agents need to improve with greater fairness and transparency.

This issue was made all the more real for me when young professional I know told me her story. “Chantise” as I’ll call her here has “won” no less than 15 lotteries for affordable units in new developments in neighborhoods across Boston. Out of those opportunities how many apartments has Chantise been able to rent? Zero.

3000 Applications for 62 Units

As Chantise discovered leasing agents sometimes had as many as 20 lottery winners for one apartment. At times she was told she was “close” but that actually meant five potential renters ahead of her.

Her story is all too common. As Emilio Dorcely CEO of nonprofit developer Urban Edge in Roxbury told WGBH News “At the rate we’re going we’re not going to really meet the housing needs of both people who are already here but also the projected new residents that would be moving to Boston for the next several years.”

Competition is fierce for affordable housing options. One project Emilo was working on received 3000 applications for 62 units.

Bias runs rampant such as the leasing agent who pointedly asked Chantise (not once but twice) whether she was “Section 8.”

Lotteries allows renters to take a look at the properties (although as Chantise discovered the units shown may not be the ones that ultimately get rented). In one building she toured Chantise asked the leasing agent “How diverse is this building?” The agent immediately responded “It’s not about diversity it’s about who can afford it.”

Assuming he misunderstood the question Chantise rephrased it “Are there any people of color in this building?” The agent replied “Like I said this is not about diversity – it’s about who can afford the rent.” Immediately a Hispanic couple who happened to be touring the property at the same time exchanged a knowing look with Chantise.

Sadly this does not surprise me. Gentrification across Boston including in the Roxbury neighborhood where I live is all about raising rents. Affordable housing gets little more than lip service creating a housing crisis for people of color who feel unwelcome and excluded in these developments. Bias runs rampant such as the leasing agent who pointedly asked Chantise (not once but twice) whether she was “Section 8” referring to government subsidies for low-income housing. And twice Chantise confirmed that she was not; rather this working professional with a full-time job needs affordable housing like so many others.

Agents Developers: Step Up

It’s a national crisis compounded by skyrocketing housing prices across the U.S. In metro areas high costs and low supply are nearly insurmountable obstacles for professionals looking to rent a decent apartment. As for the lowest-income renters their problem is most acute with a coast-to-coast shortage of supply. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition “No state has an adequate supply for affordable rental housing for the lowest-income renters.”

The Brookings Institution recently examined the Boston market where zoning laws have limited housing development. As the institute wrote: “First high housing costs impede the regional labor market making it harder for employers to hire and retain workers. Second limiting housing development near job centers and public transit leads more workers to undertake long-distance solo car commutes worsening traffic and creating harmful environmental impacts.”

Third “exclusionary zoning” within affluent white communities “exacerbates racial and economic segregation … limiting Black and Latino or Hispanic families’ access to high-opportunity communities.”

To say such practices must stop is to state the obvious but once again we need to shine a harsh spotlight on unfair exclusionary practices. Developers and leasing agents must pledge to increase fairness and transparency in the rental process particularly where affordable units are part of a development. To do anything less is to violate the principles of inclusive development – and perhaps cross a legal line as well.

As for Chantise she recently found a place to rent; however it is not in one of the new buildings she had hoped to occupy. But she could no longer endure the emotional roller coaster of “winning” the lottery to view an apartment she would never be able to rent. As she told me “If that wasn’t bad enough every time I applied for an apartment they pulled my credit. That happened 15 times – and I know that impacts my credit score.”

Come on Boston. We can do better than this.

Stock Market Predictions for 2022

Dr. Michael J. Burry who accurately predicted the 2008 subprime crisis and was the central figure in the book and film The Big Short has been one of the biggest bears on the financial markets and the American economy over the past 18 months. He has forecasted another market crash in 2022 based on underlying economic fundamentals debt and monetary policy.

Based on his tweets he believes that the 2020 rebound was too fast and that the fundamental values of stocks are far too high based on fundamental P/E ratios. It appears he believes the stock market could drop 50% from the highs to return to a normal historical valuation based on earnings.

He believes late 2022 will be a crash similar to the end of the dotcom bubble housing bubble crises and Covid year plunge.

On May 17 1954 the nine justices unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that schools segregated by race did not provide an equal education. Students could no longer be barred from a school because of the color of their skin. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Brown decision I wanted to look at how far we’ve come in integrating our schools and how far we still have to go.

Two sociologists Sean Reardon at Stanford University and Ann Owens at the University of Southern California have teamed up to analyze both historical and recent trends. Reardon and Owens were slated to present their analysis at a Stanford University conference on May 6 and they shared their presentation with me in advance. They also expect to launch a new website to display segregation trends for individual school districts around the country.

Here are five takeaways from their work:

The long view shows progress but a worrying uptick especially in big cities

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

Not much changed for almost 15 years after the Brown decision. Although Black students had the right to attend another school the onus was on their families to demand a seat and figure out how to get their child to the school. Many schools remained entirely Black or entirely white.

Desegregation began in earnest in 1968 with a series of court orders beginning with Virginia’s New Kent County schools. That year the Supreme Court required the county to abolish its separate Black and white schools and students were reassigned to different schools to integrate them.

This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenburg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90 percent of his peers were white and only 10 percent were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76 percent of his peers were Black and 24 percent were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90 percent white classmates while Black students had 24 percent white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76 percent Black classmates while white students had 10 percent Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69 percent white and 31 percent Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34 percent Black and 66 percent white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25 percent between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

Detailed view of the red line segment in the chart above “Average White-Black Segregation 1968-2022.” Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25 percent increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64 percent from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches 30 percent and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent 85 percent of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35 percent students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70 percent students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40 percent Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90 percent or more Black fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90 percent or more white fell from 44 percent to 14 percent during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90 percent of students are not white grew from 37 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60 percent of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: people live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40 percent of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.

Appearing on Jason Whitlock’s Fearless podcast Tuesday afternoon Brown reflected on what Tomlin meant to him on and off the field.

“Mike Tomlin…that dude was like my pops to be honest” an emotional Brown told Whitlock. “Ever since I met Mike Tomlin I always knew I’ll have success. I feel like when I went to the Steelers Mike Tomlin once I saw him and talked with him I knew I was going to the Steelers. Mike Tomlin was that father figure for me. Outside of coach. Obviously as a coach and the minutia as a coach he was always challenging me at the utmost to make sure I was better.”

Brown had a winding journey to the NFL. A Florida kid who played his college ball in the MAC at Central Michigan becoming a sixth round pick of the 2010 NFL Draft. Scouts questioned his level of competition his slight frame his 4.57 40-yard Combine time.

Pittsburgh took the chance on him late in the draft. He found the end zone on his first regular season touch taking a reverse for a touchdown on a kickoff against the Tennessee Titans. His role as a receiver was limited in the early goings but he made his name known in his debut playoff game. Tied 24-apiece against the Baltimore Ravens Brown made a 58-yard helmet catch down the right sideline on a 3rd and 19 heave from Ben Roethlisberger setting up the game-winning touchdown.

From there his career took off. He finished second on the team in receptions yards and touchdowns in 2011. His breakout year came in 2013 leading the team with 110 receptions for 1499 yards and eight touchdowns. His numbers became video-game like in 2014 leading the NFL in receptions (129) and yards (1698) and in his prime was essentially uncoverable. For six straight seasons he posted at least 100 receptions 1200 yards and eight touchdowns. In NFL history no one else has done it more than four times consecutive or not.

In his now famous interview with The Pivot in 2022 Mike Tomlin acknowledged Brown would never play for the Steelers again but spoke well of him.

“We had nine great years” Tomlin told Ryan Clark Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder. “I appreciate that dude in ways that I can’t explain to y’all that I won’t even bother to attempt to explain to y’all because it sounds like I’m defending him in some way…the nature of our relationship and what we all did together requires no defense.”

The feeling seems mutual.

“That guy Mike Tomlin always had my back always believed in me” Brown said. “So I’m always indebted to Mike Tomlin. He was one of those guys that’s stood in the foxhole for me. And that meant a lot to me.”

But Brown eventually felt like his time was up in Pittsburgh and he made a loud exit forcing the team to trade him. Brown hasn’t said he regrets the move telling Whitlock he was chasing a Super Bowl ring he eventually received with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But had Brown stayed with Tomlin he might’ve gone down as the greatest receiver in NFL history. Instead he’ll be remembered for as much what he did off the field than on it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcmFjaW5nbmV3czM2NS5jb20vd29sZmYtc2lkZXMtd2l0aC1icm93bi1pbmRlZWQtd2Utc2VlLXJlZC1idWxsLWN2cy1ldmVyeXdoZXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wolff offers full support to Brown over Red Bull CV saga,"Toto Wolff has voiced his agreement with Zak Brown over comments the McLaren Racing CEO made about CVs ""flying everywhere"" following Adrian Newey's shock resignation from Red Bull.

The American suggested his team had seen in influx of CVs being sent to it from employees of the Milton Keynes-based outfit in the wake of the news that the 65-year-old Red Bull chief technical officer would leave his post in early 2025.

Now the Mercedes team principal has concurred with Brown whilst also implying that some of those applying for roles are from senior positions.

""Zak is absolutely correct we are seeing Red Bull CVs through all the levels"" Wolff told media including RacingNews365.



Whilst Brown has not traditionally had an as fierce an adversarial relationship with the Red Bull boss Wolff and Horner's rivalry dates back years.

It reached a climax during the tense championship showdown at the end of the controversial 2021 F1 season but had become relatively peripheral after Mercedes fell well behind Red Bull the following year at the start of the contemporary ground-effects era.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

This weekend both the parade and festival were back in Louisville and organizers saw one of their biggest turn outs yet.

What You Need To Know Kentuckiana Pride Festival/Parade took place Saturday from 12pm-10pm



Donna Mulkins has been walking in the Pride Parade since 2015



Kentuckiana Pride Foundation organizers saw the biggest event in history

Supporters and allies of the LGBTQ community like Donna Mulkins come together for the annual Kentucky Pride Festival.

“I actually had a really accepting community I came out and I was accepted and I want everybody else to feel that way to have that sort of support” Mulkins said.

Since 2015 Mulkins has been walking with her workplace Brown- Forman in the Pride Parade. This year’s parade is a little different as organizers saw their biggest crowd yet with nearly 10000 people walking just in the parade.

“Oh my gosh it feels incredible” Mulkins said. “Everyone has just come together and it’s amazing to see all this energy.”

Speaking of energy Mulkins makes sure she brings her most authentic self every year.

“I’m unapologetic about who I am and it’s okay to be yourself and it’s okay to be just who you are and know that there are people out there that accept you just as you are” Mulkins said.

Something she hopes to inspire in others.

“It means having the freedom to be who I am no hiding no apologies just accepting who I am and knowing that those people around me at work at home all around accept me for who I am” Mulkins said.

Today the ...,"""I wish I had more brilliant forethought"" Fawn Weaver founder and CEO of Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey says of the company's founding ""but it was more serendipitous.""

The stars began to align for Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey with the June 25 2016 publication of a New York Times article by Clay Risen who delves into the history of Jack Daniel's one of the world's best-selling whiskeys in honor of the distillery's 150th anniversary. Risen recounts a tale familiar to many whiskey aficionados: A young Daniel comes to work on preacher Dan Call's farm in Lynchburg Tennessee where the preacher who also happens to be a grocer and distiller teaches him the tricks of the whiskey trade.

But that's not the whole story — not even close. Today the Brown-Forman Corporation which has owned Jack Daniel Distillery since 1956 acknowledges that the preacher didn't teach Daniel how to distill at all. A formerly enslaved Black man by the name of Nathan ""Nearest"" Green who also worked on Call's farm did. In his 2016 piece Risen writes that although ""the story was never a secret"" it ""may never be definitively proved.""

That wasn't good enough for Weaver who upon reading the article was immediately fascinated by Green's story. ""One because I'm African American"" Weaver says ""and two because at the time it was right before my 40th birthday and up until that point I'd never known of another ubiquitous brand that we all know and love that could pinpoint an African American was there at the beginning although we know that for a lot of our brands African Americans were there at the beginning.""

Weaver set out to find the definitive proof of Green's involvement. ""The only way that the story was actually going to hold up in the history books was if it was proven not just speculated about"" she says. ""It couldn't just be oral history. So I took on the project just looking at it as a book as a movie as something that's really interesting in terms of African American contributions and history and America.

""I happen to be one of those people that absolutely loves America and wants to see it its best self"" Weaver continues. ""And so just being able to represent that portion of it kind of rewriting if you will at least a story during that period of time was very intriguing to me.""

""If that doesn't scream of serendipity and that this was meant to happen I don't know what does.""

But Weaver's project soon took on an even greater scope. She traveled to Lynchburg Tennessee where it all began to speak to Green's descendants who wished to see their ancestor receive the credit he so deserved. It was there that Weaver also visited Call's farm — which happened to be for sale. ""It had been on the market for 15 months"" Weaver explains. ""So if that doesn't scream of serendipity and that this was meant to happen I don't know what does. My husband and I immediately bought the farm not knowing what we would do with it just knowing that it was a great piece of American history and we'd be crazy not to.""

Ultimately Weaver's ambitious 12-month-long research project would uncover more than 5000 artifacts and documents from five different states and with the help of more than 20 historians archivists archeologists conservators and genealogists who together conducted more than 2500 hours of research confirm four indisputable truths: Jack Daniel never owned any slaves and Green was the first African American distiller on record in the U.S. the first master distiller for Jack Daniel Distillery and the wealthiest African American in Lynchburg.

The wheels continued to turn and it wasn't long before Weaver realized she was on the fast track to founding a whiskey company that would honor the man who taught Daniel everything he knew. ""Really truly the only thing I didn't do was say 'no' to any opportunity or any lead"" she says ""and that's really how this came to be.""

In July 2017 Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey launched under the umbrella of private family-owned investment company Grant Sidney Inc. which Weaver founded in 2010 and for which she serves as CEO. Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey was the most awarded American whiskey or Bourbon for 2019 2020 and 2021 and its three ultra-premium whiskeys have won more than 470 awards and accolades worldwide.

""When we released the brand almost no one knew the name Nearest Green"" Weaver says. ""Right now I'm on a 100 cities in 100 days tour and visiting all the different cities across this country and his name is known everywhere I'm going and that is remarkable for a turnaround in less than five years. This is a country that has a lot of stories to be told so to have millions of people telling one person's story is pretty extraordinary and it's pretty amazing to be able to be a part of that.""

""It's a process that continues to be passed down from generation to generation in West Africa to this day.""

Kentucky bourbon and Tennessee whiskey are both straight bourbon whiskey and follow the same rules Weaver says. ""The only thing that gives us a Tennessee whiskey designation versus Kentucky bourbon is one the states geography"" she laughs ""and the second is what Nearest Green taught. It is taking a traditional bourbon distillate and running it very slowly through sugar maple charcoal to purify it before it goes into the barrels to age.""

The process arrived in the U.S. with West African enslaved people Weaver explains. ""And it's a process that continues to be passed on from generation to generation in West Africa to this day"" she says. ""More than 90% of the trees that are cut down are for two things — for charcoal and for fuel. And it's because they continue to purify their food and to filter their water using charcoal to this day.""

It's unclear exactly who taught Green the special distilling process but records reveal it was used in Kentucky for more than 60 years before Green was born Weaver says and it eventually made its way to Lincoln County Tennessee not far from Moore County where Lynchburg sits. Despite its prevalence at one point the process was costlier and took longer than others and some distillers began to move away from it.

""But Jack Daniel did not"" Weaver explains. ""And because he never went away from it and really staked his claim in it we still have Tennessee whiskey to this day because of the process that Nearest taught Jack and the process that Jack made sure continued to be a part of his company and really the most important part of his company.""

Weaver's favorite way to enjoy Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey is neat though she also loves to try different cocktails that incorporate the spirit. ""If I'm out I want to see the mixologist do what only they can do"" she says. ""And so generally my call at the bar is always dealer's choice and I give them the three ingredients I don't like mixed with Uncle Nearest: campari amaro and aperol. I just let them go wild with every other ingredient they have.

""On this tour I taste probably eight different Uncle Nearest cocktails a day"" she adds. ""Because everywhere I go they're making me different cocktails and they're unbelievably delicious."" Some of Weaver's recommendations include a classic daiquiri made with Uncle Nearest instead of rum an espresso martini that subs the whiskey in for vodka or gin and a piña colada that features the spirit.

""I wanted to make sure that Uncle Nearest wasn't the only one.""

Although Green had been the wealthiest African American in Lynchburg Tennessee Weaver found that that family wealth hadn't carried through to the current generation — part of the discrepancy can be attributed to Tennessee's lengthy period of prohibition Weaver explains which began a decade before federal prohibition and lasted 30 years. As a result almost two full generations of Green's descendents were completely separated from that family legacy built on the whiskey business.

Weaver and her husband Keith Weaver who serves as co-founder and board member of Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey wanted to help set Green's descendants up for success. To that end the Weavers have established the Nearest Green Foundation and the Nearest Green Legacy Scholarship which covers the cost of college tuition for Green's direct descendants.

""I didn't care where they went to college how expensive it was"" Weaver says. ""All they had to do was get in and they immediately got a scholarship and the only thing they had to do to maintain that scholarship was get a B average. Every semester we put a new round of Green's descendants through college.""

But the scholarship doesn't necessarily end with college graduation; it also covers continuing secondary education. ""I'd love to see as many get PhDs as possible"" Weaver says ""and we'll continue paying for it all the way through.""

Weaver's commitment to lifting others up doesn't stop with Green's direct descendents; Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey is the first BIPOC-founded and led independent spirit brand that has found such extraordinary success in the industry and Weaver's on a mission to ensure it's not the last. ""I wanted to make sure that Uncle Nearest wasn't the only one and that I didn't get to the end of this journey in 40 more years and then write a book that's no longer really relevant"" she says.

So Weaver launched the Black Business Booster program to help BIPOC specifically Black-owned businesses that are at the same level of excellence as Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey. The Black Business Booster program shares connections with these business owners helps them obtain distributors puts them in touch with potential investors and more — anything they might need in the way of support.

Weaver also helped get the Nearest and Jack Initiative off the ground in 2020. The initiative aims to diversify the American whiskey industry both in terms of entrepreneurship and executive leadership with its Nearest Green School of Distilling Leadership Acceleration Program and Business Incubation Program.

Additionally Weaver created the Uncle Nearest Venture Fund to invest in the most promising BIPOC- and women-founded owned and led brands. ""We wanted to make sure that as we were coming up as we were making money we were taking that money and recycling it back into the opportunities of others to become the next Uncle Nearest"" Weaver explains.

The $50 million fund's announcement was timed to mark the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre in which a white mob destroyed an affluent Black neighborhood in Tulsa Oklahoma and killed hundreds of its residents. To date the fund has invested $2 million in Jack From Brooklyn's sorel liqueur; $2 million in Ian Burrell's Equiano Rum Company; and most recently $5 million in mixology company Hella Cocktail Co.

""Do it with excellence or don't do it at all because this country is not set up for you to succeed.""

Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey launched the second and main phase of its 323-acre Uncle Nearest Distillery in Shelbyville Tennessee last year on Juneteenth. Weaver calls the distillery's second-phase opening a ""forever marker"" of the holiday. Today thousands of people visit the distillery every weekend and its 90-minute tours are sold out all week long. For this year's Juneteenth celebrations the company's master blender Victoria Eady Butler Green's great-great-granddaughter will host a series of events to recognize the occasion.

Weaver is always on the lookout for the next challenge; in fact her drive to tackle the seemingly impossible is what inspired her current 100 Cities in 100 Days tour. ""Last year when bars and restaurants were opening up people were still afraid to go"" Weaver says. ""I knew that a lot of people followed what I did on social media so I used it as an opportunity to begin going to our restaurants and bars that support us in all the different states. And I think I went to 38 different states — every day I woke up in a different state.

""By the time I got to maybe the 21st state or so"" she continues ""I started getting direct messages from people going 'At this point we're just watching to see if you could finish.'"" Of course Weaver did finish and she decided to up the ante — to 100 cities in as many days.

Over the course of her journey Weaver has met people from all different walks of life who are united in their appreciation for Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey. ""We're all embracing the story of Uncle Nearest and the need to share that legacy"" she says. ""And so to have people from every background literally every socioeconomic background every religion straight gay everything across the board I am meeting on this tour and there is a point of connection — and that's the legacy of Nearest Green. That is my favorite part hands down of what's happening on this tour.""

Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey might bring all manner of people together but of course the playing field in life and in business is still far from equal and the systemic issues that kept Green's legacy hidden for so long persist in the U.S. today.

To aspiring BIPOC and women founders Weaver says ""Do it with excellence or don't do it at all because this country is not set up for you to succeed. This country although I love it is set up for you to fail. And so if you're not going to do it with excellence and with consistency bow out and get a job. Period. If you are going to do it with excellence and with consistency over time don't let anybody slow you down — no one. Just keep going after it because the only people that fail doing it with excellence and with consistency are those who give up before they succeed.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pc2xhbmRlcm5ld3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9qYWNrLWFuZC1jb2tlLWluLWEtY2FuLWJ1dC13aGF0LXMtdGhlLWNhdGNoL2FydGljbGVfZDZkOTYxNDItZWVmNi0xMWVjLThkYzItNDc2MWRhY2NhYTIxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jack and Coke… in a can but what's the catch?,"Some drink combinations are classics even legendary like a Cuba Libre the rum and Coke drink which is favorite to many on the island and South Florida. Others are gin and tonic scotch and soda and the popular Jack and Coke.

Well now you can enjoy a Coke and Jack in a convenient can.

“Cheers to our new relationship with Coca Cola Company! Together we are excited to announce the debut of JackDaniels_US and Coca Cola” Tweeted Brown Forman the makers of Jack Daniel’s.

And for those counting calories a zero-sugar version of the beverage will also be available according to a statement posted in Brown-Forman’s website.

Jack and Coke has remained incredibly popular through generations likely why Coca-Cola has chosen it as the drink that will help to launch the company into the fast growing ready-made canned cocktail market.

“This relationship brings together two classic American icons to deliver consumers a taste experience they love in a way that is consistent convenient and portable” said Lawson Whiting CEO and President of Brown‑Forman Corporation.

Brown-Forman is the largest American-owned spirit and wine company.

“We keep consumers at the center of everything we do as we continue to develop our portfolio as a total beverage company and that includes new products with our iconic Coca-Cola brand” said James Quincey Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company in the statement.

But if you want a Jack-and-Coke now in the heat of summer you will either have to make it the old-fashioned way or you will have to travel across the border as the Jack and Coke canned version will only be available in Mexico in late 2022.

Despite his larger-than-life persona Colonel Tom Parker rarely gave interviews and largely remained out of the spotlight following the death of his star client Elvis Presley.

That doesn’t mean he didn’t keep a hand in the Las Vegas entertainment scene.

Like the time he landed George Strait whom he’d see during his frequent performances at the Las Vegas Hilton the starring role in 1992’s “Pure Country” through his longtime friend producer Jerry Weintraub.

Or when he tried to bring a young Celine Dion to the Strip nearly a decade before she’d open the Colosseum in 2003.

Rene Angelil Dion’s late husband and manager came to Las Vegas in 1987 to see Wayne Newton’s tribute to Presley and met Parker during one of the tours of the Hilton’s Elvis suite. Flash-forward to 1994 when Dion started closing her shows with a new take on Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” Parker called as soon as he heard it.

“He says ‘I’ve heard that song so many times since Elvis died and I never heard it like that’ ” Angelil told Time magazine. “ ‘I’m a consultant for the Hilton and she’s never played Las Vegas. I want her at the Hilton.’ ”

Angelil had to demur saying his client was still new to American audiences and wasn’t yet ready. Dion did however dedicate the song to Parker when he was in the audience that summer during her Las Vegas debut opening for Michael Bolton at the Thomas & Mack Center.

Parker’s efforts didn’t stop there. In the 2002 documentary “The Definitive Elvis: Elvis and the Colonel” Steve Wynn says Parker routinely called him with advice including that he should sign the young Dion.

“ ‘Now this girl’s from Canada. She’s got a voice the size of the Empire State Building. She’s gonna be a giant star’ ” Wynn recalls Parker advising him. “ ‘You figure out how to make a connection and get this girl to work at The Mirage.’

“I never could quite convince him” Wynn says “that I had Siegfried & Roy there that I couldn’t just push them out.”

ST. LOUIS — The parent company of the downtown Horseshoe St. Louis casino has purchased the closed restaurant Big Daddy’s on the Landing as its leader says it hopes to see more residential and office uses in the area.

An entity tied to the casino in January purchased two adjoining properties 118 Morgan St. and 718 N. 2nd St. for a combined $1.2 million. Together the two properties including restaurant and patio space measure about 10000 square feet according to city records.

New owner Tropicana St. Louis LLC is linked to Caesars Entertainment Inc. (Nasdaq: CZR) the Las Vegas-based casino firm that operates the Horseshoe rebranded in May from Lumière Place. A different company real estate investment trust Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. (Nasdaq: GLPI) owns the Horseshoe property.

Big Daddy’s owner Ryan Loeffler said he shuttered the bar in January 2021 and sold it a year later because plans to revive the district as a residential area would not come soon enough to bring sufficient patrons to ensure the location was as successful as other locations he could open. He operates four other restaurants: Big Daddy's Soulard Big Daddy's 618 in Belleville Big Daddy's Edwardsville and Silver Creek Saloon in Belleville. And Loeffler is now looking at options for a fourth Big Daddy’s site.

“I think they’re going to do really well with (the Landing) but it's not enough for a Big Daddy’s to be down there right now or a Wheelhouse or a Paddy O’s for somebody to want to go down there and tough it out for a couple years until they bring 3000 residents. It just takes time” Loeffler said.",,,,,,,,,

Paige Thompson who worked for the software giant as an engineer until 2016 was found guilty on Friday of seven federal crimes including wire fraud which carries up to 20 years in prison. The other charges illegally accessing a protected computer and damaging a protected computer are punishable by up to five years in prison. A jury found Thompson not guilty of aggravated identity theft and access device fraud after 10 hours of deliberations a release said.

Prosecutors argued that Thompson who worked under the name ""erratic"" created a tool to search for misconfigured accounts on AWS. That allowed her to hack into accounts from more than 30 Amazon clients including Capital One  and mine that data. Prosecutors argued Thompson also used her access to some of the servers to mine cryptocurrency that went to her own wallet.

""She wanted data she wanted money and she wanted to brag"" Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Friedman said of Thompson in closing arguments during the week-long trial.

Capital One in December agreed to pay $190 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over the breach in addition to an earlier agreement to pay $80 million in regulatory fines. The data stolen included about 120000 social security numbers and roughly 77000 bank account numbers according to the complaint.

An attorney representing Thompson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik set Thompson's sentencing for Sept. 15.

The Capital One hack one of the largest-ever breaches of a financial services company affected more than 100 million US customers and involved the theft of sensitive data including Social Security and bank account numbers.

The hacker Paige A. Thompson a former systems engineer at Amazon Web Services used a self-made tool to detect misconfigured AWS accounts and then use those accounts to hack into the systems of more than 30 organizations including Capital One the US Department of Justice said in a release. In addition to downloading data she planted cryptocurrency mining software on servers and directed crypto to her online wallet the Justice Department said.

""She wanted data she wanted money and she wanted to brag"" Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Friedman said in closing arguments according to the release. The Justice Department didn't identify the other organizations affected by Thompson's activity.

Following Thompson's arrest Amazon said she'd left the company three years before the hack took place. Last year Capital One agreed to pay $190 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by customers. Both Capital One and Amazon Web Services denied liability but said they'd settle to avoid the time expense and uncertainty of litigation.

The year before Capital One agreed to pay $80 million to settle claims by federal bank regulators that its cybersecurity measures fell short and that it failed to put proper risk assessment steps in place when it started using cloud storage services. The regulators gave Capital One credit for how it notified customers after the hack and how it took steps to remedy problems. And the company said safeguards it had put in place before the breach helped it secure data before any customer information could be disseminated or used.

In addition to wire fraud Thompson was found guilty of five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer and damaging a protected computer the Justice Department said. She was found not guilty of aggravated identity theft and access device fraud.

Thompson is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 15 the Justice Department said and faces up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud. Illegally accessing a protected computer and damaging a protected computer are punishable by up to five years in prison the agency said.

Paige Thompson 36 a former Amazon software engineer who used the online handle “erratic” obtained the personal information of more than 100 million people — a data breach that prompted Capital One to reach a tentative $190 million settlement with affected customers. The Treasury Department also fined the company $80 million for failing to protect the data.

Following a seven-day trial the Seattle jury found her guilty of wire fraud unauthorized access to a protected computer and damaging a protected computer. The jury acquitted her of other charges including access device fraud and aggravated identity theft.

Thompson’s attorneys argued that she struggled with mental health issues never intended to profit from the data she obtained and said in court papers “there is no credible or direct evidence that a single person’s identity was misused.”

Federal prosecutors said she didn’t just steal the data but also planted software on servers she unlawfully accessed to steal computing power to mine cryptocurrency.

“Far from being an ethical hacker trying to help companies with their computer security she exploited mistakes to steal valuable data and sought to enrich herself” Seattle U.S. Attorney Nick Brown said in a news release.

Wire fraud is punishable by up to 20 years in prison while the other charges can bring a five-year maximum. U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik is scheduled to sentence Thompson in September.

In interviews with The Associated Press following her arrest friends and associates described Thompson as a skilled programmer and software architect whose career and behavior — oversharing in chat groups frequent profanity expressions of gender-identity distress and emotional ups and downs — mirrored her online handle.

At one point two former roommates obtained a protection order against her saying she had been stalking and harassing them.

A press release from the Department of Justice (DOJ) states Thompson developed a tool that scanned AWS for misconfigured accounts and then leveraged these accounts to gain access to the systems of Capital One and dozens of other AWS customers. Prosecutors also say Thompson “hijacked” companies’ servers to install cryptocurrency mining software that would transfer any earnings to her personal crypto wallet. She then “bragged” about her misdoings in online forums and over text messages.

“She exploited mistakes to steal valuable data and sought to enrich herself”

At the time there was some debate as to whether Thompson was an ethical hacker or security researcher due to her unusual candidness about her role in the Capital One attack online — she posted customers’ sensitive data on a public GitHub page and shared the details of the breach on Twitter and Slack. Earlier this year the Justice Department made it clear that it wouldn’t prosecute security researchers under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

With two adult children — Jerome a senior vice president at Cardinal Health and Nicole Revish Curtain owner of a Clintonville hair salon — the retired WBNS-TV (Channel 10) news anchor has taken on a new role: surrogate father to the South Side community where his church Unity Temple Church of God in Christ is located.

""Here at the church I've got a lot of young men and young girls and I try to be sort of a father image to some of them"" said Revish 73 of Dublin. ""Some of them don't know their fathers which in some ways you think 'How could that be?'""

Revish has seen triumph and tragedy having covered events such as the 1979 desegregation of Columbus City Schools; Operation Desert Storm in 1991; the Lucasville prison riot in 1993; and the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks.

But he says his toughest assignment was learning how to be ""Dad.""

""I had to learn how to be a father"" he said. ""It was pretty frustrating in some ways because I didn't have the wherewithal all the time to do the things I wanted to do for my kids or with my kids.

""But I stuck with it. I let them know 'I love you and this home is going to be your home and we're going to make things happen here.'""

Jerry Revish: Congregants respect his devotion to church family community

Revish regularly makes things happen at his church where along with a Sunday sermon he provides counseling; connections to resources such as food clothing and school supplies; and his parishioners say hope.

Rose Bush 66 of the West Side who attends Unity Temple Church of God in Christ said Revish regularly provides a hand up to others.

""We had gentlemen from the Salvation Army that came every Sunday because it was a part of their rehab. He interacted with them personally and he didn't treat them any different than anybody else"" Bush said. ""If they had a need — housing clothes food — he always made sure to see that they got what they needed.""

Bush said Revish serves as a mentor to many who need him the most.

People like Andre Harper.

""He really makes it a point to get to know the men in the church in particular and we've had a great relationship"" said Harper 45 of Lewis Center. ""I know that he cares for me.""

Harper grew up without a father in his life a void he said Revish has filled.

""He became that figure organically and when I first got to the church I felt a deep sense of connection with him"" Harper said. ""I asked him to go out to breakfast and we just really hit it off.""

Harper says he didn't see a news anchor in Revish — who joined WBNS-AM/FM in 1974 before moving to WBNS-TV in 1980 — only a father figure. He said he strives daily to live by the example Revish set not only as a pastor but also as a family man.

""His emphasis on males and men being committed to not only our Christian walk but (also) to making sure that we protect and be good fathers and husbands in our home"" Harper said. ""He provides a great example of that and I aspire to be like him to be the family man that he is. He helps me and talks to me and always makes time for me. He's never too busy to help to talk or to listen.""

A childhood surrounded by strong men

Hailing from Youngstown Revish describes himself as a ""union brat"" with his father having worked at Youngstown Sheet & Tube.

He says being surrounded by strong men throughout his childhood influenced his views on fatherhood.

""I saw nothing but strong men in my neighborhood coming up. They were all steelworkers — pretty much blue-collar guys"" Revish said. ""But I watched them in the mornings climb into their cars or wait at the bus stop with their black lunchboxes going to work and I thought 'They were taking care of their families taking care of their wives if they have them and their kids.""

His father Dewey had a quiet humility that still sticks with him.

As an adult Revish who established his church in 2011 with his wife Danielle said he's seen many Black fathers come through feeling tormented in that they are sometimes unable to care for their children properly.

""You're asking somebody who has never had a positive role model or very few to do these heroic feats of success without giving them the wherewithal — the tools the building blocks to get there"" he said. ""It's important they understand what it takes.""

Revish counsels men young and old on a variety of topics. Some are practical such as how to dress for an interview groom themselves speak properly and strive to be their best. He started an initiative at the church ""Top Dog"" to teach youngsters from 10 to 18.

There are more serious topics too like how to be a father and what he called ""the talk"" on how Black families should interact with police.

""Nowadays for our Black boys and girls you've got to have that talk with them about how to handle yourself around law enforcement"" he said. ""Unfortunately that's still something that has to be … that there is a certain way to engage with a person that is a police officer.""

Balancing work family always a challenging task

Early in his career Revish had to balance his duties between dad and anchorman which he says was not an easy task. But he said he worked hard to make time to be with his children.

""When I wasn't working I was with them"" he said. ""I was giving them my time.""

Saturdays often meant books and bagels with trips to the Columbus Metropolitan Library and a stop for bagels afterward.

""A lot of times it's not about money"" he said. ""It's just about experiences just taking them to a gathering Red White & Boom! or Labor Day parade or a lot of church activities where you meet other people and you're exposed to them.""

His children recall a father who emphasized education and wouldn't accept ""good"" as an answer for the age-old question ""How was school today?""

""We had to literally write a journal to him like write it out tell me what that means"" his daughter recalled. ""Explain to me what your day was and what happened — he would even take the time to spellcheck it back and say 'Well I think you should write it like this' or 'Is this what you meant when you said that?'""

His son said having a local celebrity as a father was hard sometimes but it got easier over time.

""As a small child it was cool to see your father on television. There's a little bit of local celebrity that plays in. Then it goes into increased scrutiny because of that celebrity and making sure and understanding that when you leave the house when you're in school or when you work you're representing something bigger than yourself"" he said. ""My father was and is a tremendous father role model protector counselor friend — all of the above.""

One of the biggest pieces of advice Revish said he often imparts whenever he counsels men on how to be fathers is simple: Understand they are not some sort of super hero.

""Be a loving man don't be afraid to express love and don't be afraid to show some vulnerability"" he said. ""You're not Superman and if they don't know that your kids are going to find out one day.""

The carrier called the Type 003 and christened Fujian left its drydock at a shipyard outside Shanghai Friday morning and tied up at a nearby pier state media reports said.

A third aircraft carrier would place China in a group of just 16 countries worldwide with the massive seaborne military airports. Around the Pacific India Japan and the United States operate carriers or are developing them.

China is after the same thing others are experts say which is proving to themselves and foreign governments that its carriers can someday work well together alongside older military units if needed as Western-backed rivals gain their own strength at sea.

The People’s Liberation Army Navy China received its first carrier named the Liaoning in 2012. It’s an overhauled former Soviet vessel bought from Ukraine. In December 2019 the navy got the Shandong its second carrier and the first one built domestically.

“To develop aircraft carriers and enhance the ability to safeguard world peace is a necessary requirement for China to fulfill its international obligations” said Liu Pengyu spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington D.C. “China is committed to the path of peaceful development and firmly pursues a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. The possession of aircraft carriers will never change that.”

Slow uptake

The latest Chinese carrier must train for another two to three years before making any formal deployments analysts believe.

Huang Chung-ting associate research fellow with the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei suggested the Type 003 may have been rushed into production to satisfy Chinese officials and some of its parts might not work as designed or as well as peers from other countries.

“Whether China’s technology can reach its ideal capabilities we need to monitor their training and sea trial results and see” Huang said.

“I think these PLA’s aircraft carriers have no way to do long-term activities outside the first-island chain” he added. “Their power is actually for the most part in the near seas inside the first-island chain.”

The first-island chain runs south from Japan through Taiwan and the Philippines to Indonesia. Japanese and U.S. forces have traditionally had more strength than China in the wider Pacific Ocean to the east. Japan has two carriers under construction and the U.S. Navy operates 11.

Type 003’s aircraft-carrying technology is energy consumptive and some of it might do poorly in a battle outside the first-island chain – far from Chinese ports — Huang said.

Eventually Type 003 will put to use technology that’s better than many foreign peers said Chen Yi-fan assistant professor of diplomacy and international relations at Tamkang University in Taiwan.

He pointed to a “very advanced” domestically made electronic magnetic catapult. “It was jumping at least two generations ahead of other aircraft carriers” he said.

But Type 003 would struggle outside the first-island chain for lack of bases where it could resupply Chen said. The United States in contrast has bases in Hawaii Guam and Japan.

Future battlefields?

Type 003 is expected to report back to Fujian province in China’s southeast near Taiwan Chen said. The Liaoning and Shandong are assigned to other nearby seas he added.

China has claimed self-ruled Taiwan as its territory since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists lost to Mao Zedong’s Communists and rebased in Taipei. Beijing says it will use force if needed to unite the two sides. Since mid-2020 it has flown land-based military planes over part of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone almost daily.

The Shandong has done at least one exercise in the South China Sea according to the Chinese state-monitored Global Times news website. The first carrier Liaoning is believed to cover the East China Sea.

Beijing claims about 90% of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer South China Sea as its own clashing with the claims of Brunei Malaysia the Philippines Vietnam and Taiwan.

Japan and the United States have urged China to leave the sea open for international use and both have voiced support for Taiwan. Washington periodically passes its own carriers near the island as a warning to Beijing.

PLA see their aircraft power as “weakening” now as Vietnam and the Philippines acquire missiles that could attack back Huang said.

The Philippines was moving earlier this year to buy BrahMos anti-ship missiles from an Indian-Russian joint venture. Vietnam has expressed interest in the same missiles.

“I think it is very risky for the regional security in the future when China can have like three aircraft carriers not only the South China Sea but also the East China Sea” said Nguyen Thanh Trung a faculty member at Fulbright University Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtcGV0LXBvbGljeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines pet policy: Here’s how to fly with your cat or dog,"Many pet owners view their pets as family. And leaving your pet at home while traveling isn't always an option. So you may be researching the Southwest Airlines pet policy including approved Southwest pet carriers and the Southwest dog policy.

Fortunately flying with a dog on Southwest is possible if your pet route and carrier meet specific requirements. Likewise it's also possible to fly with a cat on Southwest. But before you plan on bringing your pet with you you'll want to ensure your pet will be allowed on board.

So before you bring your pet to the airport here's everything you'll need to know when flying with a dog or cat on Southwest.

Southwest pet policy

With the Southwest pet policy small domestic cats and dogs of at least 8 weeks old can travel with you in the cabin. In particular your cat or dog can fly under the seat in front of you.

Pet carriers are only allowed to travel with a paid customer and unaccompanied minors aren't allowed to bring a pet on board. While only one pet carrier is allowed per ticketed passenger you can carry up to two pets of the same species in your carrier.

Your pet must stay within its carrier at the gate area during boarding and deplaning and throughout the entire flight. Additionally if your pet presents disruptive behavior — such as scratching excessive whining or barking growling biting lunging or urinating — Southwest may not allow you to board with your pet.

Unfortunately you can't bring your pet on international Southwest flights. Additionally when traveling to or from Hawaii you can't bring a pet with you. However Southwest will allow you to bring your pet on flights between Hawaiian islands.

Additionally even though Southwest has an open seating policy customers can't occupy an exit row seat or a seat with no under-seat space in front of it (typically the first row).

Booking your pet on your Southwest flight

(Photo by Capuski/Getty Images)

For flights within the U.S. you must add your pet to your reservation in advance by calling Southwest directly.

Then passengers traveling with a pet must check in on the day of travel with their pet at the ticket counter. By doing so Southwest personnel can approve the pet and pet carrier.

Southwest charges a fee of $95 per pet carrier each way but this fee is fully refundable if you end up not traveling.

You'll want to book your pet as soon as possible before each flight since only six pets are allowed per flight. And pet reservations are taken on a first-come first-served basis. However Southwest makes it clear that there might be special circumstances where more or fewer than six pet carriers will be allowed on a flight. For example Southwest will sometimes waive this cap on flights out of a region expecting a hurricane.

Now if you also are bringing a trained service dog with you on your Southwest flight — along with a pet in their carrier — and your trained service dog is larger than a child under the age of 2 you must purchase an additional seat on your Southwest flight. Then you'll need to place the carrier under the seat in front of the extra purchased seat.

Southwest pet carrier requirements

When flying Southwest you must carry your pet in a carrier no larger than 18 1/2 inches long by 8 1/2 inches high by 13 1/2 inches wide. The pet carrier must be leakproof and well ventilated although both hard-sided and soft-sided carriers are allowed. All pets must be able to fit completely inside the carrier and also be able to stand up and move around.

You can also purchase a Southwest pet carrier at the ticket counter or online. This Southwest-branded pet carrier is 17 inches long by 9 1/2 inches high by 10 inches wide — which is slightly smaller than the maximum size allowed.

Remember even though Southwest has an incredibly generous baggage policy pet carriers count as your one personal item. When bringing a pet carrier on board you are still allowed to bring another personal item or a regular-size carry-on bag.

Southwest cargo pet policy

(Photo by Tobias Titz/Getty Images)

Southwest Airlines doesn't carry any pets — including cats and dogs — as cargo. So the only way to take your cat or dog with you on a Southwest flight is in the cabin in a pet carrier.

Bottom line

With the Southwest pet policy dogs and cats are allowed to fly in the cabin as long as they fit in a carrier of the aforementioned size. Of course this doesn't help if you have another type of pet — or a larger cat or dog — since Southwest doesn't allow any animals to fly as cargo.

But if your pet fits the requirements you can bring your beloved cat or dog with you on your next vacation. Best of all flying with a dog or cat on Southwest is relatively inexpensive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ldXJvYXRsYW50aWMtYWlyd2F5cy1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Short History of Portugal's EuroAtlantic Airways,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ldXJvYXRsYW50aWMtYWlyd2F5cy1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYWZyaWNhLmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbG9jYWwvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RvcC0xMC1iZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWluLWFmcmljYS85ZWhueXd50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 best airlines in Africa,"Branded as the Passenger's Choice Awards over 13 million travelers worldwide nominated their favorite airline in a survey and ranked specific aspects of the customer experience on a scale of one to five including cabin service COVID-19 response ground/airport services and the onboard product.

But what about other nations that have large amounts of missiles in their military arsenal like Iran?""

The report added that the Islamic Republic of Iran frequently demonstrates its willingness to strike US assets in the Middle East including a naval aircraft carrier.

It also said that Iran's IRGC has greatly expanded its weapons arsenal making these threats more meaningful. Iran has practiced destroying US military assets including a naval aircraft carrier in its semi-regular wargame exercises.

In answering the question ""What Could Iran Really Do?"" the author writes that ""In 2015 the IRGC fired rockets close to the Nimitz-class carrier USS Harry S. Truman while it was transiting the Strait of Hormuz. Denouncing Iran’s assault as “highly provocative” the US Central Command (CENTCOM) reported that the IRGC’s motive to fire drills less than 1500 yards away from the carrier was to threaten America’s presence in the region.

The piece further points out that the Gulf of Oman links the Arabian Sea with the Strait of Hormuz- the gateway to the Persian Gulf. Almost a fifth of the world’s oil consumption passes through the strait making it a strategic waterway. Iran is capable and can interrupt the flow of oil and upset the global economy.

The writer goes on to conclude that ""Although Iran’s torpedoes and rockets alone do not pose a significant threat to the survivability of a US naval aircraft carrier it could possess weapons that do. As the IRGC has ramped up its efforts to expand and advance its weapons arsenals in recent years Iran’s increased capabilities pose a greater threat to its adversaries including America. The Iranian Navy’s fleet of Kilo-class submarines are equipped with torpedoes that could severely impact the structure of a carrier. Additionally Iran has been able to develop longer-range ballistic missiles that will ultimately be capable of hitting US assets.

Shane Brooks 31 is her “all-American kid.” He has three daughters is clean cut enjoys grilling loves attending soccer matches and works for a pharmaceutical company in Bloomington.

Kyle Brooks 29 is her “rebel.” He raised a daughter by himself until a couple of years ago a son who has distal arthrogryposis and two stepchildren. He is tattooed and pierced has long hair enjoys attending PopCon and similar events and works as a machinist in Columbus.

Seavy found one thing they have in common: They are “two of the best daddies I know and love.”

“I’m very proud of both my boys their ways of parenting and becoming men” she said.

1 of 6

The brothers grew up in Lebanon before moving to Seymour where Shane graduated from high school in 2009 and Kyle the next year.

Shane’s eldest daughter Shalei was born when he and his wife Shawnee were in high school.

After graduation he worked at Walmart and became a supervisor before entering the pharmaceutical realm starting with Lannett in Seymour and then moving to Catalent Pharma Solutions in Bloomington a couple of years ago. He was just promoted to quality assurance supervisor.

“It took some time but I’m in a really good spot” he said of his promotion.

Along with Shalei 14 Shane and Shawnee have two other daughters Sharlet 8 and Shylar 3.

Raising three daughters has been interesting Shane said. He and Kyle grew up with a sister Holli who is several years younger than them.

“I didn’t have that super close sibling relationship with my sister but I kind of parented her if you would being the older brother” he said. “I grew up with little boys doing little boy stuff and having girls has been a complete 180 from that. It has been interesting to get your nails painted or playing mermaids instead of GI Joes that kind of stuff things you never thought you’d do on a Saturday morning watching Barbie cartoons.”

But he said he wouldn’t have it any other way.

“Absolutely not” Shane said. “I have friends with little boys and they are a ball of energy so I think I got fairly lucky.”

Shane admits at first being a dad was very scary.

“I was very young and I didn’t know exactly how to be a parent” he said. “That’s something I’ve really figured out and I’ve grown to be a better parent with time. It has been a challenge but it has shown me who I am and who I want to be exemplifying that for my daughters as to the kind of spouse that they should strive to have and the kind of relationship that they would want.”

Kyle said he worked in factories after graduation and then got into machining and has been doing that ever since. He moved from a CNC machinist to a CNC technician at Sterling Industries in Columbus and he’s now working on learning to program and trying to go to school for that.

He raised his daughter Harmony Rose who is now 7 by himself for five years. Then he started dating Chastity Terry and they had a son Jersey more than a year ago. Since Jersey was diagnosed with the disorder characterized by joint deformities that restrict movement in the hands and feet Chastity has stayed home with him.

“When he was born he looked like he was standing in the cross-legged position. He could not bend his legs” Kyle said. “It was at 24 weeks we had been going to Seymour and they weren’t seeing his arms move. They were raised above his head in ultrasounds. They sent us up to Indy just to get a second opinion and then they were like ‘He’s got arthrogryposis.’”

Jersey started treatments after he was born.

“It’s therapy for the rest of his life” Kyle said. “We are extremely lucky with how he is affected and how he has progressed.”

Kyle also enjoys being a stepfather to two of Chastity’s kids Jaxton Terry 10 and Gram Mitchell 7.

“Jaxton’s dad died. He didn’t know his dad. I’m the first father figure that he has had and it has been an experience” Kyle said. “He’s also at the age now he’s trying to figure out who he is. His younger siblings are so young compared to a 10- almost 11-year-old. We have a lot of the same interests. I try to push him into my interests of course just ‘Hey I’m into this. Do you want to be into this too?’”

Gram still goes to see his father and Kyle said they have a really good relationship.

“I don’t treat the kid different” Kyle said. “It doesn’t matter who the kid is from. They are in my house they are taken care of as it should be.”

Kyle and Chastity are engaged but no wedding date has been set.

Both being fathers the brothers often talk about their kids and are able to help each other. Plus their sister has three sons.

As for advice for other fathers Kyle said it’s important to know it’s OK to ask for help or seek help and not fall into the standards of men.

“Get up help the family be a team player and work with your kids” he said. “Show them interest. Don’t push them. Let kids be kids.”

Shane agreed with that last statement.

“They are going to make a mess. They are going to track mud through your house. It’s definitely going to happen and you can get upset about it all you want but it’s not going to change anything” he said. “That’s something I’ve learned and just let them be kids. They will show you who to be and what they need. You just have to listen.”

It’s also key to be involved Shane said.

“I think that’s a super important thing as far as whatever they want to join — basketball or dance or cheerleading whatever” he said. “My daughters have done dance and cheer now for several years. I don’t understand a thing about what I’m watching but I’m there to support. I think that’s important.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

You've got a good handle on how to keep pests and wildlife out of your raised beds and what methods to use to keep insects at bay.

One family of plants - the allium group - has remained relatively pest-free until recently. And now your garlic onions shallots and leeks might need you as the first defense against the leek moth.

Migrating from Canada a couple of decades ago the leek moth has made its way to upstate New York nearly all of Vermont and northern New Hampshire now too.

If you've planted garlic for instance the bulbs underground are just beginning to send up their whorl of leaves. That's where the leek moth lays its egg.

From the tiny moth egg a small green caterpillar hatches and begins to eat the garlic leaves. So if you have leek moths this is where you will begin to notice damage on your garlic and garlic scapes.

Right about now garlic plants are up and growing. They still need more time to grow before harvesting.

You might not think leaf damage from the leek moth caterpillar will affect your garlic bulbs. But in that time between now and harvesting them the leek moth caterpillar can burrow down and cause damage to the garlic bulbs as well.

So in this interim growing time before harvesting your garlic bulbs try spraying an organic pesticide like Bacillus thuringiensisor BT on the plants.

This pesticide even though its organic kills all caterpillars including the swallowtail butterfly caterpillar. Do take care that you're not spraying indiscriminately.

To eradicate the leek moth caterpillar on your garlic plants just spray the BT directly into the center of the leaves. The best time to spray is in the evening with calm to no wind.

If you've added onions and leeks to your gardens and raised beds they need to grow a lot longer before harvesting.

In the case of these allium plants combatting the leek moth becomes a bit more complicated.

The leek moth hatches two or three generations each year. That would require a lot of spraying to keep up.

Instead try to prevent the leek moth from getting into your garden in the first place.

You can do this with micro mesh. Micro mesh is similar to a floating row cover. It's made out of a window screen material that's really tough and flexible. Sun and rain will still get through but not not the leek moth.

First push some metal hoops into the soil then drape the micro mesh over that. Your onions and leeks will have a better shot of growing to maturity underneath that.

Q: I did notice fewer conventional tulips this year compared to last year when they were freshly planted. Are conventional tulips annual or perennial? And is there anything we can do to make them last longer in the garden? - Emily in Montpelier

A: Conventional hybrid tulips that we plant are indeed perennials. They do come back year after year but they have been so hybridized that they don't do very well in our climate and they are not made for growing in gardens.

Read up on tulip varieties from All Things Gardening: Double or single fringed or twisted the species tulip comes back year after year

These varieties are highly hybridized and are intended for the cut flower industry in Holland more than growing in gardens.

The cycle is pretty similar: the first year you plant the tulip bulbs they look great! The second year maybe you get a few flowers by the third year you're just getting foliage.

You don't have to give up on these traditional hybridized tulips though! After they're done blooming around this time of year and the foliage has yellowed dig them up.

Take a look at the individual tulip bulbs. If you see little baby ""bulblets"" all the way around them knock or peel those off from the mother bulb. You can then replant the mother bulb and add some bulb-boosting fertilizer.

Or you could dig up the bulbs and dry them and then plant them again in the fall when we normally plant tulip bulbs.

These are techniques for giving hybridized tulips new life and hopefully get them to flower again.

Andspecies tulips don't really have this issue. They tend to come back year after year regardless of whether they've been hybridized or not.

That was just one of the many largely unknown facts shared by Paul Smith College’s Professor of Biology Janet Mihuc at a recent meeting of the Adirondack Garden Club held at the Ausable Club in St. Huberts in the High Peaks.

Moths like butterflies progress through four stages in their life cycle: egg caterpillar pupa and adult. Gardeners are probably most aware of the caterpillar stage because of the damage they frequently cause to plants with their voracious appetites as they gorge and store up food. Dr. Mihuc pointed out the integral role caterpillars play in transferring the sun’s energy flow: the sun to plants that then feed the caterpillars who are in turn eaten by woodland birds and animals.

In addition herbivores like caterpillars drive plants to evolve by developing protective chemicals that we humans use such as tannins spices and blessedly caffeine. On balance she pointed out moths are a benefit including the heavily-feeding albeit destructive caterpillar stage.

Even given the unsightly damage spongy moths do in this area as they decimate oak and other trees those trees fully refoliate and the waste from the caterpillars provides valuable nutrients to the soil (although it was duly noted that being in the woods when that kind of a shower is falling is less than pleasant).

Dr. Mihuc also pointed out that the main reason that spongy moth caterpillars don’t provide a bountiful feast for birds and other predators in this area is that they are an invasive nonnative species. They were introduced over 150 years ago near Boston with the hope of breeding a silk-spinning caterpillar that was more resistant to disease than the domesticated silkworm.

As an add-on to her lecture Dr. Mihuc shared some of her collection of moth specimens with the group and noted that she has to date collected 497 distinct moth species on the Paul Smith’s College campus — and aims to hit 500 this year.

More information about the Adirondack Garden Club is available on the club’s website.

With the supermarkets coming to a settlement earlier this year after a lengthy copyright battle brought by M&S it was time to give Colin and Cuthbert the taste-test treatment.

The background here is important: M&S accused budget supermarket Aldi of copying their Colin cake - launched over 30 years ago - with their cheaper version called Cuthbert which hit shelves in 2019.

Though the two cakes look very much alike is there really a big difference in how they taste? That is the question I set out to answer and perhaps the most important one for consumers (cake aesthetics aside).

READ MORE: Mayo taste test: should you be holding out for Hellmanns?

To answer that question I headed out to pick up a Colin and a Cuthbert. Upon searching for a Colin at M&S it was clear he was a popular addition to people's shopping baskets as the shelves he used to lay on were bare.

A shop assistant told me that the cake had sold out ""within hours"" and that ""people just love him they really do."" I had not expected this and was pleased when she showed me the mini versions of Colin which were ""the same but smaller"".

Meanwhile Aldi had no shortage of Cuthberts on the shelves. Thank goodness he hadn't sold out I thought but why not? Was there something wrong with the budget caterpillar?

Two caterpillars safely home I got straight to the tasting...

Colorado State University’s Energy Institute is revving up its hydrogen and natural gas research capabilities with the recent arrival of an industrial turbine generator slated to be installed at the Powerhouse Energy Campus. The acquisition positions CSU among just a handful of academic institutions across the U.S. that have similar engines for conducting large-scale research and testing.

San Diego-based manufacturer Solar Turbines donated the turbine which will be stationed in the Powerhouse’s Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory. Solar Turbines is a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. the world’s leading manufacturer of diesel and natural gas engines.

The turbine’s arrival at the Powerhouse this past spring marked the beginning of its new life in higher education research.

Capable of producing 4700 horsepower and 3.5 megawatts of electricity the massive turbine will dwarf the existing research engines at CSU – and at nearly any other academic institution – by a long shot: In just one hour of runtime the generator could produce enough energy to power the average U.S. household for more than three months.

“We have a track record of working with Caterpillar on large-scale energy solutions over several decades and now this collaboration with Solar Turbines and the equipment they’ve provided will allow us to expand our work on clean turbine technology even further” said Bryan Willson Executive Director of the CSU Energy Institute.

The Energy Institute’s 30-year history partnering with Caterpillar on engine research projects has resulted in numerous applied solutions for improving engines and decreasing emissions across industries he said.

“This new turbine will provide truly unparalleled access for faculty and students to advance their research on these critical greenhouse gas emission reduction technologies and develop solutions around combined hydrogen and natural gas power generation” Willson said. “It will be an incredible addition to the facility and our research capabilities.”

Hydrogen combustion research

Bret Windom associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering is leading CSU’s team of researchers developing kinetic models of hydrogen combustion. This work is part of a larger four-year $4.5 million U.S. Department of Energy project led by Solar Turbines to develop a retrofittable dry low-emissions gas turbine combustion system that can run on 100% hydrogen as well as blends of hydrogen and natural gas. Researchers from University of California-Irvine Energy Research Consultants Ltd. and the Southwest Research Institute are also contributors to the project.

“We’re currently in phase one of this project where we’re developing combustion models and supporting computer-aided engineering of the combustor design” Windom said.

In collaboration with Solar Turbines Windom’s team will also be studying the turbine’s potential to run on varying fuel blends of natural gas and hydrogen and what if any modifications need to be made to the equipment to account for the enhanced reactivity of hydrogen and its unique combustion behaviors. This research could play a key role in advancing hydrogen-powered turbine technology work that could have scalable impacts on decarbonization in the industrial and power generation sectors he said.

“We have a track record of taking solutions from the laboratory and getting them into the field at-scale and the addition of the turbine in our lab facility is going to allow us to do that now” Windom said.

For CSU student Miguel Valles Castro the addition of the turbine will bring more than just new equipment into the lab; it will broaden opportunities for students to develop and apply their research skills in a real-world setting. Valles Castro is a mechanical engineering doctoral student graduate research assistant and Cogen Renewable Energy Fellow working with Windom on internal combustion engine modeling.

“The Energy Institute at CSU has many years of experience in internal combustion engines and other renewable energy devices to reduce emissions” Valles Castro said. “The arrival of the turbine is exciting because it expands our areas of expertise.”"

Two of downtown Little Rock's signature buildings -- aging towers at least a half-century old -- are taking on new owners and inspiring hope that the city's central business district could be in for a resurgence.

New buyers have gained control of the Bank of America and Regions Center office towers that have been entangled in legal knots and fell into disrepair that led to disgruntled tenants. The new investments are energizing other commercial developers who operate downtown and the officials charged with promoting the city's core corridor.

Bank of America Plaza and Regions Center rest squat on Capitol Avenue just two blocks apart and dominate the city's silhouette along with Simmons Tower and the Stephens Inc. building.

""That's our city skyline"" said Gabe Holmstrom executive director of the Downtown Little Rock Partnership a key marketing and promotion arm for the city center. ""When you're crossing I-30 and coming into the city that's what you see.""

Regions Center is now owned by Taconic Capital Advisers a New York hedge fund that says it plans to invest in revitalizing the tower. Bank of America Plaza was purchased by Keith Richardson a Central Arkansas-based investor most noted for developing and managing multifamily properties through his company Richardson Development. Richardson did not respond to inquiries for comment on his plans for the facility.

""What's interesting in what's now happening is that you have local investments coming back into an area that was created by local investment but over the years changed hands to absentee owners who had different reasons for making that investment not all of which was for the betterment of downtown Little Rock"" says Jay Chesshir president and chief executive officer of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce.

""It's really exciting to us that local ownership and control is coming back into that central core of the financial district and even outside owners that are pledging to revitalize the area.""

Even competing commercial real estate developers and management companies heavily invested in downtown are looking forward to a potential infusion of new ideas and approaches to reinvigorate the downtown core.

""This is clearly an opportunity for downtown to come back commercially"" said John Flake who has been involved in downtown development for nearly 50 years and is managing partner for the Simmons Tower across the street from Regions Center. ""It can be a real bright spot again for the city – I'm very bullish on downtown.""

Little Rock's central business district like most urban downtown areas in state capital cities has historically been home to banks law firms government agencies and professional-service firms that cater to state and county governments. West Little Rock and suburban markets have lured tenants from the central hub putting pressure on building owners and their leasing partners.

""Little Rock's CBD has kind of languished in occupancies and in static rents for quite some time"" said Greg Joslin a senior broker with Colliers of Arkansas who has been involved in the downtown commercial leasing market for more than a decade. ""It's been a challenging environment.""

Dallas-based CBRE Group will lease and manage the Regions facility through its Little Rock office which has been housed in the tower since 2016. The new owners are planning to feature the building's multiple amenities including an event center on the 30th-floor with a full-service kitchen and bar that was formerly the Little Rock Club and will be open to tenants and the public.

In addition Cromwell Architect Engineers of Little Rock has been hired to develop a mixed-use plan to generate foot traffic and attract downtown workers to the 20000 square feet of ground-floor space Callahan said noting the reconfiguration could include restaurants other food-service operations a grocery concept and specialty services.

""That space is front and center right on Capital and Spring Street"" he added. ""We want to re-engage that space and figure out what is the right mix for it. The space is ideal because it is in the core of the financial district and we have thousands of people just within a few blocks. We want to make that space more of a people attractor.""

There is no set budget for updating the facility though Callahan said work will start immediately to install new elevator banks.

""We finally have an ownership that wants to make 400 West Capitol the premier downtown address"" Callahan said. ""We recognize that it's going to be a big investment and we're definitely prepared to make it.

""It's a good time to invest and to make something that stands out. We don't want to be plain office space"" he added. ""We want to be a building that has a high level of amenities and a high level of tenant services.""

Downtown's woes were exacerbated three years ago when the state of Arkansas purchased the former Alltel Corp. headquarters in Riverdale. The Commerce Department and other state agencies marched out of downtown to occupy the campus on the Arkansas River.

""That left a lot of big holes to try to fill in properties that were already just trying to maintain their occupancies"" Joslin added. ""Getting a new injection of capital and investors for downtown can only be a great thing for the area.""

Flake now commercial real estate advisor with Flake & Co. also is investing in the future of downtown Little Rock and advocates a repositioning for development of the area.

In November Flake and other partners plan to open a mixed-use technology center in the former home of Arkansas Power & Light's headquarters at 900 S. Louisiana St. on the southern border of downtown. Flake and his partners James Hendren and David Payne paid $2.8 million for the historic structure and have invested another $3.5 million to update it for tenants that will include a technology company on the top floor and a restaurant on the bottom.

""We looked at that as an opportunity to give a boost to downtown and to invest in a building that has been part of the area's history and development"" Flake said. ""We wanted to be a vote of confidence for real-estate development downtown.""

Downtown rejuvenation also is being invigorated by a new generation of leadership at another firm that has been a key to development of the urban district for nearly 40 years Moses Tucker. The firm was instrumental in developing the Little Rock River Market and condominiums in the area. Today it manages and leases the Mann on Main building along with anchors on Capitol Avenue: Union Tower and the Lyon building.

Chief Executive Officer and President Chris Moses is part of a group that purchased the Arkansas Capital Commerce Center at 200 River Market Ave. last year. ""We're not selling our office products in the area"" Moses says. ""We're doubling down.""

Pumping new investments into downtown is vital but the area also needs campaigns that promote the walkability and livability of the area according to Moses. ""We're not just selling a space it's a package of a 24-hour lifestyle that attracts millennials"" Moses said. ""If you're not selling that in the high-rise world you're really just another floor plan. For our city to be successful we've got to fix the riddle of the CBD.""

Likewise Holmstrom of the downtown partnership advocates that the City of Little Rock commit to a master plan strategy especially for the Capitol Avenue corridor. He notes such an outline hasn't been undertaken for more than 25 years. The Bank of America and Regions towers are ideal structures that could be animated with a new vision for their ground floors which were developed to house bank lobbies.

""There are opportunities there for these new owners to add amenities and entice restaurateurs to come to that space"" Holmstrom said. ""It's time for something new.""

Chesshir one of the city's top economic development salesmen also says downtown could use a novel approach to bolster its future. ""It's about attracting new people and creating new uses ... and reimagining what a space could be rather than what it's always been"" he said. ""And if we get that piece right we can grow what we already have here and attract other talent to this core area to grow with us.""

Sarawak came in third after Selangor at an average of RM492061 followed by Kuala Lumpur at RM763234. Ranking fourth Sabah’s average housing prices were just slightly lower than Sarawak’s at an average of RM464907 in 2021.

Sarawak’s average residential property price only came down a fraction from RM485622 in fourth quarter of 2020 (4Q20) to RM482592 the report stated sourcing preliminary data from the National Property Information Centre (NAPIC) and Valuation and Property Services Department (JPPH).

In a joint Market Outlook Report for 2022 prepared by CBRE-WTW Malaysia Research Team it noted in Kuching which according to the Department of Statistics holds the highest average population in Sarawak at 790600 residential property prices are expected to hold stead.

Most landed residential projects launched in Kuching were in the sub-urban areas while urban areas are building mainly high-rise residential integrated with some retail property. “High-rise residential units in Kuching maintained an average price of RM500 per square foot. The supply glut of stratified residential units in the last two years has not eased off making it a buyers’/tenants’ market.

“Sales and leasing are still slow especially those in the higher-priced category” it explained.

In 2022 it is expected that property prices might improve in Sarawak as the economy begins to reopen. It also noted that the extension of the HOC up to December 2021 attractive government incentives such as stamp duty exemption RPGT exemption after the fifth year uplifting of the 70 per cent margin financing discounts by developers and lower interest rates could provide better opportunities for home purchase",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcHJhZ2F0aXZhZGkuY29tL29wc2MtY2hhaXJtYW4tcHJlc2VudHMtYW5udWFsLXJlcG9ydC0yMDIxLTIyLXRvLW9kaXNoYS1nb3Zlcm5vci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OPSC Chairman Presents Annual Report 2021-22 to Odisha Governor,"Bhubaneswar: The Chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission (OPSC) Dr Satyajit Mohanty called on the Odisha Governor Prof Ganeshi Lal today at Raj Bhavan and presented the Annual Report 2021-22.

The year 2021-22 will be regarded as path-breaking for OPSC in the sense that the Commission published the Recruitment Calendar for the first time since its inception in spite of the apprehension whether it could stick to the deadlines. OPSC completed all the recruitment commitments as notified in the calendar in spite of the dislocation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period 2277 candidates have been recommended for appointment in Group-A and Group-B Services  1563 promotions have been concurred for 22 government departments and 224 disciplinary proceedings have been disposed of.

This has not only boosted the confidence of the Commission but has enhanced its credentials among the candidates. This has encouraged the Commission to come out with Recruitment Calendar for the year 2022-23 for more than 5000 posts in twenty-six government department.

One of the key focus areas of the Commission will be to ensure more transparency in the recruitment process and faster publication of results. We will continue to leverage on technology for maintaining integrity of the system and adopt objective criteria in every step of the selection process.

Upgrading the existing online portal Integrated Recruitment Management System to make it more user-friendly conducting more and more Computer Based Recruitment Examinations (CBRE) masking the identity of the candidates during evaluation of papers and interviews etc. will continue to get the focused attention.

As part of faster publication of results the Commission will introduce “on-screen” evaluation of descriptive papers for the current year.

OPSC aims at recommending highest number of candidates in the recruitment year 2022-23  as transpired during the courtesy call.",,,,,,

The decision should trigger the company’s forfeiture of a local property tax break that was set to save it $75 million over 20 years.

Executives did not explain why they’re abandoning plans though they had previously said they were pausing expansion here.

“A civic auditorium is no longer in Centene’s plans regardless of any incentives to proceed” the company said in a statement to the Post-Dispatch. “Centene highly values our relationship with the city of Clayton and is proud to call St. Louis our home.”

Clayton City Manager David Gipson said it would be premature to comment until the Board of Aldermen could discuss the matter.

Mayor Michelle Harris did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment.

But she said earlier in the week that “Clayton is fortunate to be home to Centene headquarters auditorium or no auditorium.” She said the company had not communicated with the city over its plans for the civic auditorium.

Centene in 2016 unveiled plans for a $770 million campus expansion that included nearly 1 million square feet of office space hundreds of apartments or condos retail shops a 1000-seat civic auditorium and a hotel near South Hanley Road and Forsyth Boulevard.

“We could have nighttime events and jazz quartets” said Clayco chief Bob Clark the point man on the project for Centene while pitching the designs then. “And Centene is committed to a world-class facility where right now I think we all know there is a dirt path.”

“We see this as a huge huge public benefit to the community” he continued. “This is going to be a great facility.”

But Centene said then that it could not build the project without public subsidies. Clayton officials negotiated a development agreement that said all tax abatement would cease if the civic auditorium estimated then to cost about $100 million was not completed by Dec. 31 2024.

Since then Centene has built just one office building and a parking garage which opened in early 2020. It bought The Ritz-Carlton in 2018 instead of building a new hotel — cloaking the deal in a nondescript limited liability company — and later blamed the coronavirus pandemic and crime in the St. Louis region for not moving forward with later phases of the project.

The company is now building an East Coast campus in Charlotte North Carolina and is expected to net some $450 million in tax incentives there. Centene began working out those details with North Carolina officials months before announcing it would pause development in Clayton.

So far the value of the abatement in Clayton is just $158473.75 for 2021 the first year of the incentives.

The state of Missouri has also provided Centene $96 million in incentives largely for jobs created with its Clayton expansion.

Centene employment in Clayton grew from 1288 workers in 2016 to 2879 last year — well more than the 1000 Centene told Clayton the expansion would bring.",,,,,,,,,,,,

However UPL was quick to dismiss the reports stating “promoters — the Shroff family — are completely aligned and committed to the company’s future growth.”

“We are a beautiful company and people have many aspirations when they see beautiful things” says Jai Shroff Global CEO UPL the second-generation promoter. Established in 1969 UPL has done over 40 acquisitions in the past 25 years expanding its presence to over 138 countries.

“UPL is a shopoholic company and we like to shop” says Shroff  adding that it is currently in talks with 70 different start-ups for testing technologies and in discussions with another 50 firms for collaboration.

After acquiring Arysta LifeScience from Platform Specialty Products Corporation for $4.2 billion in 2019 UPL has kept up with its shopoholic image with the latest being the buyout of OptiCHOS a bio-solutions product platform from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.

The Arysta deal catapulted UPL to the fifth slot among the top ten global agrochem firms with annual revenue exceeding $5.2 billion. A large player in the post-patent crop-protection market UPL has a robust portfolio consisting of biologicals seeds traditional crop protection solutions bio solutions pre- and post-harvest solutions soil and water technologies with more than 14000 registrations. In fact the company doubled its share in the global crop protection market over the past five years to around 8 per cent in FY 2022 from 4 per cent in FY 17. The company expects to increase it further to 9-11 per cent by FY27.

Robust growth

For FY22 UPL registered a 19 per cent revenue growth at ₹46240 crore and 26 per cent profit growth at ₹3626 crore. The robust growth was driven by strong demand for herbicides and insecticides in Latin America North America and India among other markets. In the current year UPL is eyeing over 10 per cent revenue growth which it believes will be driven by factors such as strong commodity prices and the higher cost and reduced availability of fertilisers favouring the use of bio-solutions a key focus area for the company.

“The integration of Arysta is complete and the company has reorganised itself to focus on growth” says Shroff adding that UPL has got better ability to price the products. With significant investments in manufacturing marketing and distribution UPL is probably the most backward integrated player in the industry worldwide.

The company has diversified its raw material sourcing strategy by reducing dependence on China while increasing from other geographies including India where it has an expanding supplier base of over 15 major companies like Deepak Fertilisers Aarti Industries and Laxmi Organics which are being encouraged to expand their capacities. Sourcing of raw materials from China has reduced from 37 per cent in FY17 to 31 per cent in FY22. At the same time sourcing from India has improved from 34 per cent to 38 per cent and rest of the world from 29 per cent to 31 per cent during this period.

UPL has been gaining market share in the past 10 years and expects to grow at thrice the industry average. It expects to sustain the trend of doubling revenue every five years.

""UPL has consistently gained market share through a combination of low-cost manufacturing and portfolio expansion and gaining scale through inorganic play. With food inflation rising on account of geopolitical tensions and supply disruption we expect demand for crop protection products to remain robust"" says Anil R Sr. Research analyst at Geojit Financial Services.

Collaborate to grow

UPL which strongly believes in collaboration to drive growth has entered into a string of partnerships through its OpenAg platform to expand its product portfolio and geographical footprint besides setting up a new global business unit Natural Plant Protection that comprises both natural and biologically derived inputs to tap the fast-growing bio-solutions business. In fact the company is the largest player in the bio solutions space. UPL saw encouraging volume-led growth in its differentiated and sustainable (D&S) solutions portfolio which grew 19 per cent during FY 22.

“We believe UPL’s strategy to expand its D&S solutions and focus on increasing penetration in the high-growth crops segments and markets is expected to drive sustainable growth and margin expansion” said analysts Rohit Nagaraj and Ayush Chaturvedi of Emkay Global in a note.

Notable partnerships include the likes of the one with Chr Hansen a bio-product company in Denmark; with FMC Corp for manufacture and supply of chloratraniliprole (CTPR) an insecticide in India; with Mitsui Chemicals Agro Inc (Meiji) of Japan for introducing Flyupyrimin an insecticide in the Indian market among others.

Through OpenAg UPL is focused on accelerating progress for the food system and building a network that’s reimagining sustainability. At the same time the company has been trying something new — assuring an outcome to the farmers for using the company’s services or solutions. “We are transforming the industry from a ‘selling products business’ to an outcomes business” says Shroff.

Such outcome-based offerings to farmers are being implemented through its agri-technology platform Nurture.Farm and by selling crop specific solutions under the ProNutiva package. UPL’s ProNutiva integrates bio-solutions with conventional crop protection products to reduce the use of inputs while enabling better crop growth and climate resilience. Through ProNutiva UPL is assuring increase in yields and better prices for growers of crops such as groundnut and sugarcane among others. The area serviced with ProNutiva package of solutions has increased to 1.7 million acres in FY22 from 0.1 m acre in FY20. Besides helping increase farmers income by an average of 15 per cent ProNutiva has pushed up yields by 35-40 per cent in crops like groundnut in Gujarat.

Fetching better prices

“Farmers have signed up in over 4500 villages where they use our platform from the beginning to the end. Farmers are not just buying for the sake of buying products but want to get better quality produce and fetch better prices. The concept is working well and over the next five to six years it will have a huge impact” Shroff adds.

UPL’s ProNutiva has generated a lot of interest not only among the farmers but also among the food companies. “A lot of food companies are partnering with us because they want traceability” Shroff adds.

With focus on expanding bio-solutions and sustainability high on agenda the CEO of the world’s fifth largest agrochemical firm believes farmers should be rewarded for following sustainable practices. Last year he announced a gigaton challenge to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide equivalent 1 gigaton by 2040 leveraging sustainable methods. The Gigaton Challenge will create a new carbon credit to incentivise and support farmers for adopting sustainable and regenerative practices.

“If adoption of electric vehicles can be incentivised why not reward the farmers” asks Shroff while stating that Nurture.Farm platform it is exactly doing that. Nurture which has been instrumental in preventing the stubble burning in north India has also been able to generate and forward sell about 20000 agri-related carbon credits from its dry seeded rice project for methane reduction. Nurture which has taken up widespread spraying IARI’s Pusa bio-decomposer on paddy straw in about 4.2 lakh acres has not only prevented air pollution but also helped increase the carbon content in soil while maintaining soil health. The UPL investee company is targetting to help Indian farmers generate one million carbon credits by 2023.

Interestingly UPL completed a ₹1100 crore share buyback programme recently. Besides the buyback the promoters have also been increasing their stakes in the company through open market purchases. The promoters' stake has increased to 28.4 per cent at the end of March 2022 from 27.9 per cent in September 2021. It remains to be seen whether there’s any correlation between the company’s buyback the promoters increasing their shareholding and the reports of the company being a take-over target.",,,,,,,,,

• Blaze Pizza opened its doors this month at Tanglewood Mall. The California-based pizza chain joins a passel of new restaurants moving into a freshly built outparcel of the Electric Road shopping center. Other eateries that opened include Chipotle Mexican Grill Jersey Mike’s Subs and Panda Express. Nearby construction has kicked off for a much-anticipated Chili’s Grill & Bar. Crews are also set to start work soon on a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. Permit approvals for that Tanglewood Mall addition were just finalized according to Roanoke County. The new Blaze Pizza located at 4464 Electric Road is open daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.

• The new owners of Mr. Bill’s Wine Cellar are debuting a new name for the shop. Longtime friends Philip Hatter and Jayson Anuszkiewicz who bought the specialty store in March said they had been reflecting on the business’s mission to help customers celebrate the happy moments in life. That brought them to a new name: Gladheart Wine & Brews. The moniker was inspired by a line of scripture Psalm 104:15 which speaks of “wine to gladden the heart of man.” The rebranding which was announced this month comes as the store is also expanding its line of wares. It now offers a “Cocktail Corner” with craft-made bitters aperitifs and more — including packages of the popular Cube made by Lucky Restaurant. The team also plans to start stocking small batch specialty coffees later this summer. Gladheart located at 2825 Brambleton Ave. SW is open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays.

• Honestly Vegan announced online that it was closing after a year in business offering a menu of plant-based dishes.

• Quick Way a convenience store found at 2702 Colonial Ave. SW is expanding its services to offer U-Haul rentals. The store will be an independent neighborhood dealership equipped with trucks trailers towing equipment boxes and other support supplies according to U-Haul Company of Virginia. The neighborhood dealership model has been an effective way for small locally owned businesses to generate a side income in a difficult economic climate U-Haul said. The partnerships also cut down on customer travel times by creating more pickup locations convenient to residential corridors. Quick Way is the moving company’s 14th neighborhood dealership in the Roanoke Valley.

(2023 Updated),"If you’re a fan of Chipotle then you’re probably a rewards member.

Not only does it give you a way to score free Chipotle but you can also earn other rewards.

If you haven’t eaten at Chipotle in a while however you may wonder if the points you’ve accumulated have expired.

Here’s what you need to know about whether Chipotle points expire or not.

Do Chipotle Points Expire?

Yes Chipotle reward points do expire.

According to Chipotle’s terms and conditions your points will expire if you do not make a qualifying purchase to earn more reward points in six months.

Essentially you have six months between your orders to earn more points.

Keep in mind that these have to be qualifying orders.

To earn reward points you have to spend at least $1 on your order.

There may also be specific menu items that don’t qualify.

As long as you continue to order qualifying meals at Chipotle within six months then you hold onto your reward points.

Another way that you can lose your points is if you cease to be a member.

Since the rewards program is free to join the only way that you can stop being a member is if you deactivate your account.

If you choose to do so but then return later you won’t have any of your points.

Finally Chipotle can choose to terminate your account if they deem that you have violated their terms and conditions.

In this instance your reward points will also expire because they terminated your account.

Chipotle points do expire but it’s relatively easy to keep your account active.

What Are The Benefits Of Using Chipotle Rewards?

If you’re not a fan of a rewards program that has its rewards points expire after a set time then you may wonder if the Chipotle rewards program is right for you.

While the fact that their points expire might be a deal-breaker for you there are plenty of benefits that you can enjoy as a rewards member.

Here are some of the benefits of being a Chipotle rewards member.

1. You Can Earn Points Anywhere

Some rewards programs only allow you to earn points in their store or online.

At Chipotle they make it easy to earn points anywhere.

It doesn’t matter if you go into a store and order food if you use their mobile app to order food or if you use some other means to order food from them.

As long as you’re ordering food from Chipotle and it’s a qualifying meal you can earn reward points.

This helps more people earn points since not everyone wants to go to the store.

Those who prefer to stay at home can simply order food have it delivered to their home and still earn rewards for their order.

Chipotle has a great rewards program because they have expanded earning points beyond their physical stores.

2. Free Chips And Guacamole

Another great benefit of being a rewards member with Chipotle is the fact that you get a free order of chips and guacamole.

When you first become a rewards member you automatically earn free chips and guacamole.

You can use the Chipotle mobile app to navigate to your rewards.

In your redeemable rewards section you’ll see an option to unlock or select your free meal.

You can use it any time but you only get it one time.

It’s only available to members who sign up for the rewards program for the first time.

After that you have to start earning points to unlock more free food.

However for new members you’re able to get that free menu item right off the bat.

The fact that you get an immediate reward for joining the rewards program is quite the incentive to sign up.

3. Free Birthday Points

When you sign up for a rewards account on Chipotle one of the pieces of information that you need to provide is your birthday.

While companies often use this information for data analysis Chipotle also uses it for a different reason.

Each time your birthday arrives if you’re a rewards member you’ll get some sort of reward.

It might be some free points.

It might be a free meal.

Whatever Chipotle decides to do you can expect a small birthday present from the company.

This is something that you only receive if you’re a rewards member.

If you’re not a rewards member then you shouldn’t expect anything free from the shop when you visit.

Being a rewards member at Chipotle is fun since they recognize your birthday and give you a small gift.

4. Achievement Badges

If you’re someone who’s competitive or likes to turn things into games then you’re going to love the achievement portion of Chipotle’s rewards program.

Chipotle has several achievements listed in the rewards section of the program.

It might be to order a certain dish.

It might be to spend a certain amount of money within a certain timeframe.

It could be anything.

When you unlock an achievement you get a badge.

You also get extra rewards points.

This is a great way to reward you for choosing to eat at Chipotle perhaps a bit more than you might have done otherwise.

It also makes earning rewards more fun.

Any shop can just give you reward points when you buy an item at their store.

Since Chipotle has achievements that you can unlock and badges and extra points that you can earn it makes the experience just a bit more fun and enjoyable.

The fact that you get extra points is also ideal since it brings you that much closer to earning free meals.

It makes earning rewards feel more like a game.

5. Early Access

Another benefit of being a reward member of Chipotle is that you get early access to certain things.

In particular you’re able to see and buy new menu items before they’re released to the general public.

When Chipotle releases one of their limited-edition special menu items you get it a little bit sooner than everyone else.

If the restaurant is releasing a new dish then you’re one of the lucky few to try it out before anyone else.

Chipotle releases new and certain menu items early to its reward members as a reward but also to test out certain items.

You can review the item and tell Chipotle what you think about it.

If the reviews are poor down the line then your review might keep a menu item from becoming official.

That’s a lot of power.

Besides getting early access to menu items you also get early access to new merchandise that Chipotle releases.

If you want to score some apparel or other merchandise early then becoming a rewards member is a great choice for you.

You can preview the new line of merchandise before anyone else.

If you’re a big Chipotle fan then this type of benefit is exactly up your alley.

Chipotle’s rewards program is great because it gets you early access to new releases.

6. Get Insider Information

If you’re someone who wants to know the direction that Chipotle is taking then you’ll find the rewards program worth joining.

As a rewards member you’re able to get insider information that Chipotle releases.

This might be information regarding upcoming sales deals promotions or special events that they’re throwing.

It might contain information about new menu items new ideas that the company is browsing or even stock information.

When you become a rewards member you can learn more about the company than you ever would as a mere customer.

Chipotle’s rewards program is great because it gives you an inside look into the company and the direction it’s taking.

7. Free Food

A final benefit that you receive as a Chipotle rewards member is free food.

This is the benefit that most rewards members are likely going to have an interest in.

Each time your order food at Chipotle you have a chance of earning reward points.

When you have enough rewards points you’re able to redeem them for certain menu items.

Obviously the more reward points you hold onto the bigger the rewards.

Depending on how often you eat at Chipotle you could easily be earning free meals every few weeks.

Who Is Eligible For Chipotle’s Rewards Program?

Not everyone is eligible to sign up for their rewards program but Chipotle does what it can to make it accessible to almost everyone.

One of the conditions that you need to satisfy is to be a legal resident of the United States.

That includes all 50 states and Washington D.C.

The second condition that you need to satisfy is to be 13 years or older.

There’s also a stipulation for those who are between the ages of 13 and 18.

If you fall within this age bracket then you cannot be a Chipotle rewards member without the supervision of a parent or guardian.

If you have that supervision then you can become a rewards member.

For those who are older than 18 you automatically satisfy this condition for becoming a rewards member.

As long as you satisfy those two conditions you can become a Chipotle rewards member.

How Do Chipotle Rewards Work?

The Chipotle rewards program works similarly to many other rewards programs.

After you’ve signed up for the rewards program you will unlock a digital rewards account.

You can start accumulating points as soon as you make your first qualifying purchase with your rewards account activated.

Accumulating points is relatively easy.

You simply need to order menu items that qualify.

In most cases qualifying orders are any menu item or order that is more than $1.

That said there are some limitations.

Some menu items usually those that are below $1 to buy don’t qualify.

There are also cases when Chipotle is running a promotion or sale on some of its menu items.

In most cases you won’t get to earn rewards on certain menu items under the sale or promotion.

This isn’t always the case however.

To determine if the specific menu items qualify or not you need to read the specific promotion’s terms and conditions.

It will tell you whether you can earn reward points or not.

Once you earn enough points you can unlock a free menu item based on the rewards section of the mobile app.

When you click on the item your reward points will subtract from your total based on how many points it takes to unlock that specific reward.

Then you can redeem your points at any participating Chipotle restaurant.

Just as you can’t earn reward points while a promotion is running you also cannot redeem certain menu items when a promotion is running.

For example if there’s a promotion running that lets you buy one menu item and get one free there’s a good chance that you can’t use your rewards to get the menu item for free and then also get the bonus item for free.

You’ll want to read the terms and conditions of the sale or promotion to determine whether you can redeem your rewards for that particular item or not.

In most cases redeeming rewards is easy and simple.

You get free food after collecting a certain number of points.

How Do You Enroll In Chipotle Rewards?

Enrolling in Chipolte’s rewards program is incredibly easy.

Follow these steps to enroll and start earning your Chipotle points.

1. Make A Chipotle Account

The first thing you need to do is make an account on Chipotle.

You can do this either on their website or on their mobile app.

When signing up for your account you’ll need to provide them with your email create a password submit your phone number and give them your birthday.

2. Click Join Now

Once you’ve made your account you’ll want to navigate to the Chipotle’s Rewards Program section.

You’ll see an option to “Join Now.”

Click that and it will automatically enroll you into the rewards program.

From there you can essentially start buying food at Chipotle and earning reward points.

3. Opt-In Marketing

One final step that you may notice is that Chipotle will ask if you want to opt-in to receiving marketing emails from them.

These emails give you information about upcoming promotions that the stores will be hosting.

If you like to keep a heads-up on upcoming sales then opting in is an ideal choice.

However you don’t need to opt into the information to become a rewards member.

It’s completely optional.

How Do You Track How Many Chipotle Points You Have?

If you’re unsure how many points you have with Chipotle there’s an easy way to tell.

All you need to do is log onto your Chipotle account.

You can do so either on their website or through their mobile app.

From there you’ll want to go to the Rewards section of the site or app.

Immediately you should see how many points you’ve accumulated thus far.

If you want to redeem your points then you can click on the Redeem section of the site or app.

What Is A Guac Mode Bonus?

One aspect that you might notice on your rewards account is a guac mode bonus.

This bonus unlocks the chance to get a side dish containing guacamole.

Chipotle gives a Guac Mode Bonus at random.

It can show up in your redeemable section at any point.

It can also expire at any point.

For example you may only have one day to redeem it.

Because of that it’s worth checking your redeemable section frequently to see if you get a Guac Mode Bonus.

Conclusion

Chipotle reward points expire after six months of inactivity.

Chipotle classifies inactivity as not earning reward points within six months.

Joining their rewards programs unlocks several benefits with the most important being free food.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

“We love having our space open almost recklessly open for the neighborhood” the Rev. Kevin Deal St. John’s vicar told Episcopal News Service. Serving its community “has been part of the DNA of St. John’s almost since its inception 164 years ago.”

St. John’s provides space for more than just sleeping through its partnership with the Gubbio Project a nonprofit organization that serves unhoused people with “safe compassionate respite during the day” according to its website.

The project takes its name from an Italian town where according to legend St. Francis of Assisi brokered a truce between a hungry wolf and frightened townspeople. The nonprofit was founded in 2004 and moved into space at St. John’s in 2017.

Lydia Bransten Gubbio’s executive director since 2021 told ENS that the legend embodies what her organization is about. “When people come together with mutual need we find commonality and can work together” she said.

Their response shines a light not only on homelessness in general but on how communities across the country seek to address it. Homelessness has been on the rise across the United States since 2017 and cities have grappled with how where and even if to provide shelters or housing. A lawsuit against Grants Pass Oregon for its decision to fine homeless people for sleeping outside on public property made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments on April 22.

According to the Associated Press one-third of the country’s unhoused population live in western states like Oregon and California. The San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing’s 2022 Point-in-Time count found more than 7700 unhoused people in the city with more than 4000 of them unsheltered. The 2024 count is due out this summer.

While unhoused people have existed in America since the 17th century their needs have grown more acute than ever since the COVID-19 pandemic Bransten said. Homeless people in San Francisco who weren’t gravely disabled or seniors “were basically left out on the street” and with shelters closed encampments sprang up so people could find some safety in being together. There were few services available and many people watched others die of an overdose. “There was a lot of trauma in those years” she said.

“The result is a community of people who are distrusting who are more ill and fentanyl addiction collided with COVID in a way that has been debilitating for that community” she said.

A recent assessment of homeless people living in the Mission District found that before COVID 68% of them were employed and had housing she said. Immigrants make up a large portion of the area’s population and many lost their jobs as office building cleaners or restaurant workers during the pandemic. Loss of a job often meant loss of housing.

Now when St. John’s opens its doors each weekday about 35 people come to sleep and over 100 more arrive for the supportive services Gubbio offers. With no pews in the nave it’s easy to set up cots with blankets and people are welcome to bring their belongings and their dogs inside with them. Couples can arrange their cots to be near each other which usually isn’t permitted in shelters Bransten said. “The only rule is to just stay peaceful” she said.

In other parts of the building people can get a cup of coffee or see one of the nurses who provide foot and wound care. The city’s Department of Public Health’s street medicine team provides health screenings and follow-up appointments. Gubbio’s harm reduction specialist who also is a treatment counselor provides clean needles and other paraphernalia so those using drugs can do so safely.

“That provides an entrée to a conversation with a person who is struggling with drug use” Bransten said. Recovery from addiction always is the end goal but “we need to keep them alive long enough and love them enough until they are ready to love themselves into recovery.”

Bransten said that St. John’s offers a space for Gubbio’s clients that is both sacred and safe. “Not all sacred spaces feel safe” she added. “A lot of people have experienced a level of spiritual violence and St. John’s is an incredibly healing community.”

Deal and some of his parishioners provide pastoral care to those who come to the church for Gubbio’s services and many of them now attend worship services at St. John’s something Deal says he loves. “We don’t think of them as people from Gubbio” he said “they are just folks in the St. John’s community.” He said that because people are familiar with the church and think of it as their space they feel comfortable coming back on Sunday.

Bransten said St. John’s building itself helps the people Gubbio serves. “The beauty of the space is key to the way we’re able to create an environment where people feel welcomed where they feel like it’s peaceful it’s beautiful and it’s for them.”

“This is exactly who the beauty of God’s house is intended” Deal said. “It’s not for the people who have everything. The beauty of God’s house is for the people who are down and out.”

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

One Liberty Place and Two Liberty Place addressed at 1650 Market Street and 50 South 16th Street are located two blocks away from City Hall. The complex which also includes a shopping center and a hotel was designed by Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn (recently renamed to Jahn/) and developed by Willard G. Rouse III of Rouse and Associates which had eventually evolved into Liberty Property Trust and developed both of the Comcast towers. In this feature Philadelphia YIMBY presents detailed skyline massings of the 1987 Liberty Place iteration.

The history of Liberty Place dates back to 1983 when Rouse had acquired the site; Helmut Jahn had the designs finalized by late 1984. The project was unveiled at the groundbreaking ceremony on May 13 1985 featuring a 708-foot tall 47-story Two Liberty Place and a 20-story hotel. However during the last phases of construction on One Liberty Place Rouse was able to sign Cigna as the anchor tenant for “phase two.” Changes were to come as Cigna specifically requested additional office space and an adjusted design was produced. Two years and seven months later the tenant was revealed as a new model of Liberty Place was unveiled.

After Cigna signed on as the anchor tenant and requested an expansion Two Liberty Place was drastically modified when compared to the shorter 910000-square-foot design; with the extension the design was updated to 1.27 million square feet. Though the tower seems bulkier than its counterpart it has nearly the same amount of square footage as One Liberty Place. Originally all four faces between the 49th floor and the 56th floor were to feature the same stone pattern seen on between the 48th and 56th floors of One Liberty Place along with two floors similarly outlined by the stone cladding on the corners of the crown. The former Ritz Carlton hotel would have featured a different design with darker brown shades of cladding and a light gray roof. The entrances to the mall and to Two Liberty Place were also different compared to what has been built today but the rotunda and the cladding around the mall remained in the final design.

Share this obituary

Peggy Scherer 72 passed away June 19 2022 at Hospice of Cincinnati after a brief illness. A memorial service will be held Saturday July 9 2022 at the First Unitarian Church of Cincinnati 536 Linton Street Cincinnati OH 45219. Visitation is at 11 AM service at 12 noon and reception at 1 PM.

Peggy is survived by her sister Courtney Petersen two nieces: Kerry Petersen and Lindsey Petersen (Michael Burgoon) and two great-nephews Roger and Theodore Burgoon. Her family also includes step-siblings from the Tarbell family – Kate Powers (Jim) Jim Tarbell (Brenda) Nancy Tarbell Mary Tarbell-Green (Barry Green) Patti Mott and Tom Tarbell (Kim) and many nieces and nephews.

Peggy attended St. Ursula Academy and the University of Cincinnati. She began her life of service at the Bible Center in Over the Rhine followed by the Peacemakers also in Cincinnati. It was during a Peacemakers conference in New York City which she helped to organize that she discovered the Catholic Worker. Peggy moved to New York in 1974 to join the Catholic Worker where she worked for twelve years. She was co-editor of The Catholic Worker newspaper and was an early advocate for LGBTQ rights. Peggy took a sabbatical from the Catholic Worker in the early 1980s to volunteer in Nicaragua with the Witness for Peace Program. Following the Catholic Worker she worked as Deputy Administrator of Bailey House NYC a housing program for homeless people dying from AIDS. She said these experiences changed her life.

The remainder of her life was spent working with local and international non-profits primarily in areas of homelessness and HIV/AIDS. She worked in Washington D.C. with the National Coalition on Homelessness and in Little Rock with Heifer International. In Cincinnati she worked as Chief Financial Officer at Caracole. Most recently Peggy worked at Found House Interfaith Housing Network (IHN).

Peggy was supremely talented organized and fearless. If there was something she didn’t know she taught herself. A self-taught accountant she rose to the level of CFO.

Other new Nexus models include the 9400 and 9300 and all Nexus models support the 400G technology.

Cisco Nexus took center stage at Cisco Live in Las Vegas by introducing several new products and 400G technology with an option to migrate to 800G on the new Nexus 9800. Other new Nexus models include the 9400 and 9300 and all Nexus models support the 400G technology.

Cisco introduced the Nexus 9500 in 2013 as part of the Nexus 9000 family of data center switches. Considered innovative at the time the Nexus 9500 was a high-performance scalable and programmable switch featuring the first backplane-free modular switch. The Nexus 9508 was the top-of-the-line model offering high-density aggregation layer capabilities in a chassis delivering eight slots of 40G performance.

Fast forward to Cisco Live 2022 and the performance standard for Gigabit Ethernet has increased ten-fold to 400G with customers already planning for an 800G migration options.

The new Nexus 9000 switches aren’t just for aggregation; many new servers require these higher-bandwidth connectivity options. Advancements in PCIe technologies drive these higher speeds while GPU adoption for modern workloads pushes server vendors to increase interface speeds. DPU-based offerings can also take advantage of faster networking.

Diversity in workload deployment models such as on-premises virtual machines containers bare metal and serverless has contributed to the explosion of traffic within and between data centers and clouds ultimately requiring fatter pipes to carry that data. According to a survey by the Dell’Oro group these trends are enabled by the speed and scale of bandwidth evolution including 400G which is expected to increase 224-fold by 2026 and 800G will see an 84-fold uptick.

New Nexus 9000 400G Performance Options

Nexus 9800

The 9800 is the new flagship modular data center switch with 14.4Tbps fully encrypted bandwidth per slot. With a highly scalable architecture and backplane the Nexus 9800 will enable customers to migrate to 800G performance seamlessly as their performance requirements grow over time.

Nexus 9400

A compact modular chassis offering up to 64 ports of 400G line-rate performance (or up to 128 ports of 100/200G performance). The Nexus 9400 solution is a fit for customers who want the flexibility of modular line cards in a 4U compact form factor leveraging a single 25.6Tbps Cisco ASIC. Use cases include compact spine designs and efficient multi-plane scale-out fabric designs enabling the gradual transition from 100G to 200G to 400G links.

Nexus 9300

Cisco is adding two new high-performance fixed data center switches to its existing 400G switch lineup. The Nexus 9364D is a 2U 64 port 400G switch supporting line rate 400G encryption on 16ports. The Nexus 9348D is a 2U 48 port 400G switch supporting line rate 400G encryption on all 48 ports. These switches are a fit for both leaf and spine roles in customer fabric designs. The integrated line-rate encryption supports a broad range of multi-layer security architectures. The Nexus 9332D is shipping today. The Nexus 9348D and Nexus 9364D will be available in June 2022.

With these additions the Nexus 9000 family now offers a full breadth of 400G options that can meet the data center and hybrid cloud needs of enterprises and service providers of all sizes. With the new additions to the Nexus 9000 family there are models with density and form factors that fit the space-constrained edge data centers with performance and low latency to run most data-intensive applications including AI/ML storage over IP rich media and advanced analytics.

The Willowick-based human services agency that finds homes for adults with developmental disabilities recently was recognized as a Small Business Community Champion and awarded $10000 by Citizens Bank.

Maria Vokic initiated BloomMore Services in 2019. She maintains that after learning about shared living situations and how they could change an individual’s life in positive ways she knew that all her work and sacrifices required to create the agency were well worth it.

Shared living arrangements agreed upon by the caregiver and the special needs person allow the individual to become part of a family unit and avoid group homes while experiencing more independence.

Because of the special structure BloomMore’s individuals are cared for on a one-on-one basis and are given more opportunities to do what they want and/or like to do.

For example the developmentally disabled woman mentioned above has become part of her caregiver’s family attending family functions amusement parks vacations and movies while making new friends.

“Under different circumstances these opportunities would either not be there or be limited” Vokic said adding that the woman now has the chance to live a life like everyone else.

Currently BloomMore provides homes for five developmentally disabled individuals in Lyndhurst Olmsted Falls Olmsted Township Parma Heights and Willoughby.

Vokic plans to use the awarded money to take her services to another level by purchasing a non-medical transportation vehicle and providing rides to the adults to help give caregiving families a break and assist the individuals in becoming a part of the community according to Nancy Lesic of Lesic & Camper Communications.

I want to help give them some more autonomy and be able to provide rides to take these individuals to the grocery store to their jobs to go bowling the bank or other places” Vokic said.

“I am very grateful to the generosity of Citizens Bank for this program and for their willingness to help small business achieve their mission. This is a tremendous help. The financial support will truly be put to a much-needed cause.”

She’s also hoping to hire a driver by the end of summer to add to her current six member staff.

BloomMore Services LLC is one of 30 businesses chosen in a 14-state competition by Citizens Bank and selected from nearly 11000 contest entries according to Lesic.

Sarah Lindstrom head of business banking at Citizens said the number of Champions program entries was “nearly triple that of last year. We’re pleased to support and strengthen small business success and congratulate all the winners on their achievements.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW50b25pYW4uY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTkvYnVybGluZ3Rvbi1iYXNlYmFsbC1rbm9ja3MtbWVyY2VyLW91dC1vZi1jYXJwZW50ZXItY3VwLWNsYXNzaWMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJlbnRvbmlhbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8xOS9idXJsaW5ndG9uLWJhc2ViYWxsLWtub2Nrcy1tZXJjZXItb3V0LW9mLWNhcnBlbnRlci1jdXAtY2xhc3NpYy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burlington baseball knocks Mercer out of Carpenter Cup Classic,"Burlington shortstop Luke Guire right turns throws the ball to turn a doubleplay as Mercer's Carl Birge left slides into second base during a Carpenter Cup baseball semifinal game on Sunday afternoon at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.

PHILADELPHIA — After not meeting for eight years before last season’s opening-round get-together the Burlington County and Mercer County all-star baseball teams met in the Carpenter Cup Classic in consecutive years for just the second time in tournament history Sunday when they played at Citizens Bank Park in the 2022 semifinal round.

The teams had only gone head-to-head in the home of the Phillies one other time back in 2004 (CBP’s first season of existence) when Mercer won in extra innings in the semifinals then went on to win the title.

That led to a nine-year separation before the teams met again in the 2013 Cup. After that they did not play again until 2021 following the only season the Carpenter Cup was not played since 1986 because of COVID-19.

Burlington remembered being eliminated in the first round last year and got its revenge by doing to Mercer County what the Central Jersey squad had been doing to teams throughout the tournament.

By scoring more in the middle innings the boys from South Jersey earned themselves a championship game spot with a 10–1 win over last year’s Cup runner-up.

Monday’s 1 p.m. final at Major League Baseball’s Urban Youth Academy Showcase Field in Philadelphia’s Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park will feature the last two Carpenter Cup champs going head-to-head with Burlington County meeting New Jersey’s Tri-Cape the defending champion.

The all-stars from the Tri-County and Cape-Atlantic League advanced with an 11-inning 6-5 win over Pennsylvania’s Inter-Ac/Independents club.

The tri-state single-elimination event put on by the Phillies and presented by Nike over the course of the last 36 years brings together some of the top high school baseball all-star teams from Delaware Pennsylvania and New Jersey year after year to determine who will take home the top prize.

After Princeton High right-hander Kenny Schiavone threw three innings of one-hit ball for Mercer County Burlington which has won the Cup four times took a 4-0 lead in the top of the fourth when Delran’s Jake Baumann walked and Seneca’s Brayden Davis singled off new pitcher Caleb Kasof of West Windsor-Plainsboro South.

Delran’s Danny Murphy hit a fly ball to right field on which both runners tagged so that Baumann was able to score on an ensuing ground out by Pemberton’s Kai Hutchins.

A two-out single by Delran’s Nicholas Merunka made it 2-0 before a pair of errors when Bordentown’s Luke Guire was batting opened the door for Burlington County to score two more runs (one after a balk by Kasof).

Mercer which has won the Cup twice got one run back in the bottom of the frame when Allentown’s Joe Butera walked with the bases loaded after singles by his high school teammate Jack Sweeney and Notre Dame’s Jackson Wargo around a walk to the Lawrenceville School’s Shaun McMillan by pitcher Brett Gable.

“They had some good pitchers but we made a lot of mistakes” said Allentown sophomore Jack Sweeney who had one of Mercer County’s seven hits and scored its only run. “This was an awesome experience but we couldn’t get a big inning going today.”

But the 2019 Carpenter Cup champions extended their lead with three more runs in the sixth inning on RBI singles from Cherokee’s Brandon Petrick and Shawnee’s Oskar Heino around a sacrifice fly by Shawnee’s Drew Ucccello.

Cherokee junior Evan Brown had the biggest hit of the day when he followed Mercer’s fourth error of the day with a home run into the left field seats for an 8-1 lead.

“That was kind of fun because the guy dropped the foul ball I hit before I hit it” said Brown whose older brother is a Carpenter Cup champion. “I had a feeling I had hit it well. It felt smooth off the bat but I was thinking maybe a triple. Then I saw it keep going. It was awesome.”

Except for the fourth inning Burlington got strong pitching on the day with Cherokee’s Jeremy Cheeseman striking out six and only allowing one hit over the first three innings before Rancocas Valley’s Tim Hartman pitched a scoreless fifth sixth and seventh innings limiting Mercer County to two hits.

One of the lone offensive bright spots for Mercer County was Notre Dame junior Logan Eilbacher who went 2-for-2 as one of manager Dave Angebranndt’s mid-game replacements.

While Burlington County added two more runs off Hightstown’s Aaron Winzinger in the top of the ninth Burlington Township’s Jacob Dorety kept Mercer scoreless for two more innings to cap the victory.

Private fuel marketing companies such as Jio-bp and Nayara Energy have advised their retailers to keep their pumps open and not display a dry out sign board and also increased fuel prices to discourage sales retailers told ET.The move comes after the government on Friday brought all petrol pumps under the universal service obligation (USO) mandating that they must maintain supplies at reasonable prices during their specified working hours. Petrol pump operators ET spoke with said Jio-bp and Nayara have increased fuel prices between Rs 2 and 7 per litre.Fuel marketers have been making a loss on each litre of petrol and diesel they sell as state-run companies have not increased retail prices for almost two months despite rising crude prices in international markets. To minimise their losses private players cut supplies to dealers and kept prices higher to discourage customers industry insiders said.On Friday the government brought all private fuel operators under USO amid reports of long queues outside several state-owned companies’ pumps in some states.Pump operators however said this will only increase their costs – for keeping pumps operational – while sales will remain low due to higher prices.“This move by the government helps little. The company has increased diesel price by Rs 5 a litre and petrol price by 7 a litre. Who will come to buy fuel from us at this price?” a Jio-bp retailer said on the condition of anonymity. “Whatever little fuel supplies we get from the company now that may also be not sold.”Jio-bp did not respond to an email sent on Saturday till press time Sunday.Nayara Energy spokesperson said the company has been compelled to absorb the difference between rising crude prices and retail selling price since February 2022. Despite the price revision in April 22 the extent of losses due to under recoveries remain huge. In the month of June alone Nayara Energy's loss would be close to Rs.700 crores.""""We have been absorbing losses to a similar extent since February as we are committed to servicing domestic demand. This financial pain is being further exacerbated as the institutional demand due to higher prices has shifted to retail thereby threatening/ impacting the viability of our retail business. We are hopeful that the Government will intervene and help mitigate the growing losses of Industry and enable companies to work towards a sustainable model and strengthen India’s energy security"" Nayara Energy spokesperson added.“We have been asked not to barricade our outlets and that company officials will be visiting our outlets to keep a check. We have also been asked to sell less and maintain stock of fuel so they can show the government that we are maintaining fuel stock ” another retailer of a private fuel marketer said.Nayara retailers have been selling fuel at a premium of Rs 2 per litre over state-owned marketers’ prices.On June 10 industry body Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry (FIPI) had sent a letter to the petroleum ministry seeking support in matters related to retail selling pricing of petrol and diesel.“Crude oil product prices have risen sharply and rallying more than $100 a barrel since the last four months” FIPI director-general Gurmeet Singh said in the letter. “Under-recoveries continue to be very high in the range of Rs 20-25 per litre for diesel and Rs 14-18 per litre for petrol.”Crude oil and product prices have risen to their decadal highs over the past few months but state-run oil marketing companies have frozen petrol and diesel price increases in tandem with the cost leading to under-recoveries.COMPENSATION PLANS:Both Jio-bp and Nayara Energy have charted out a compensation plans for their dealers.While Jio-bp will support the dealers through a monthly rental scheme for the next four months beginning 1 June Nayara Energy said it will waive penalty levied for not meeting the fuel sales target.Both companies have cut fuel supply by 50% to their retailers and have not yet resumed full supplies."

As Insider's Pocharapon Neammanee previously reported there's a new viral trend on TikTok where users are mixing balsamic vinegar with any sparkling beverage to recreate a ""healthy"" version of Coca-Cola.

It started when creator Amanda Jones who goes by @mandyvjones on TikTok and has over 50o00 followers posted a video on June 6 showing a recipe her pilates instructor shared with her for ""healthy Coke."" As of Saturday the clip has amassed over 6.4 million views.

I'm no stranger to a TikTok trend relating to Coca-Cola. I previously tried the Diet Coke and creamer trend a popular drink in Utah that caught my attention in May. I ended up being a fan so I was curious to see whether I'd have a positive review of this new drink.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pc2xhbmRlcm5ld3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9qYWNrLWFuZC1jb2tlLWluLWEtY2FuLWJ1dC13aGF0LXMtdGhlLWNhdGNoL2FydGljbGVfZDZkOTYxNDItZWVmNi0xMWVjLThkYzItNDc2MWRhY2NhYTIxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jack and Coke… in a can but what's the catch?,"Some drink combinations are classics even legendary like a Cuba Libre the rum and Coke drink which is favorite to many on the island and South Florida. Others are gin and tonic scotch and soda and the popular Jack and Coke.

Well now you can enjoy a Coke and Jack in a convenient can.

“Cheers to our new relationship with Coca Cola Company! Together we are excited to announce the debut of JackDaniels_US and Coca Cola” Tweeted Brown Forman the makers of Jack Daniel’s.

And for those counting calories a zero-sugar version of the beverage will also be available according to a statement posted in Brown-Forman’s website.

Jack and Coke has remained incredibly popular through generations likely why Coca-Cola has chosen it as the drink that will help to launch the company into the fast growing ready-made canned cocktail market.

“This relationship brings together two classic American icons to deliver consumers a taste experience they love in a way that is consistent convenient and portable” said Lawson Whiting CEO and President of Brown‑Forman Corporation.

Brown-Forman is the largest American-owned spirit and wine company.

“We keep consumers at the center of everything we do as we continue to develop our portfolio as a total beverage company and that includes new products with our iconic Coca-Cola brand” said James Quincey Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company in the statement.

But if you want a Jack-and-Coke now in the heat of summer you will either have to make it the old-fashioned way or you will have to travel across the border as the Jack and Coke canned version will only be available in Mexico in late 2022.

""Anything over 90 decibels on Woodward Avenue is against state law"" Sergeant Robert Ried told 7 Action News.

Loud exhausts drag racing and reckless driving are some of what officers will be ticketing he says. Ried who's with the Pleasant Ridge Police Department said all of this creates a 'quality of life' issue for locals.

""We get residents that are complaining constantly that are just trying to sit in their backyards. They're in the Woodward corridor and they can't enjoy an evening sitting on their back porch"" he said.

This summer Reid said the nuisances won't be tolerated.

""Our officers will be out on Woodward with a decibel meter. It is calibrated from the factory and once it reads over 90 decibels and we know that it's a certain vehicle making that sound then our officers will take enforcement"" Ried explained.

Seven departments are part of ""Operation Decrescendo"" including Pleasant Ridge Berkeley Huntington Woods Birmingham Royal Oak Bloomfield Hills and the Oakland County Sheriff's Office.

""We're just trying to get people to be cognizant of their driving cognizant of the noise that they're creating and keep everybody safe"" Ried said.

Authorities said the only exception to ""Operation Decrescendo"" is the Woodward Dream Cruise on August 20th.

Enforcement will take place until September.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xmL21hdHQtZml0enBhdHJpY2staGFuZ3Mtb24td2lucy11cy1vcGVuLWJ5LTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jupiter's Matt Fitzpatrick hangs on to win US Open,"BROOKLINE Mass. — Englishman and Jupiter Florida resident Matt Fitzpatrick won the U.S. Open on Sunday winning his first major on the same course where he took the U.S. Amateur title nine years earlier.

Fitzpatrick shot a 2-under 68 at the Country Club to finish the tournament at 6-under 274 and beat Will Zalatoris and Scottie Scheffler by one.

Leading by one shot Fitzpatrick hooked his drive on No. 18 into a bunker to the left of the fairway. But he hit the middle of the green and two-putted from 18 feet for par. Zalatoris had a 14-foot birdie putt to tie but missed it by a fraction.

Fitzpatrick hit 17 greens in regulation. He becomes the first Englishman to win the U.S. Open since Justin Rose at Merion in 2013 the same year Fitzpatrick won the U.S. Amateur at The Country Club.

Several developments at the federal level have created a potential pitfall that did not materially exist until recently i.e. a non-compete agreement violating antitrust law. Further several recent state laws have heightened the bar for an employer seeking to enforce a non-compete. Finally the new landscape of union organizing has created another key consideration for healthcare organizations that wish to protect against unfair competition while at the same time maintaining high morale and avoiding unwanted union organizing.

Antitrust Developments

Until recently it was rare for a party to challenge a non-compete on the basis that it violated antitrust law. Several executive branch actions in the last year have significantly changed the landscape however. Last summer President Biden issued an executive order that “encouraged” the Federal Trade Commission to consider new regulations that would curtail the “unfair” use of non-compete agreements. Although the FTC has not yet issued such a rule the executive branch has taken several steps that show a new strategy of pursuing challenges to certain types of non-compete agreements. The FTC has held public workshops for the purpose of gathering information that will help it assess how to limit non-competes. The Department of Justice also has brought several legal actions challenging non-competes that it deems to have violated antitrust laws.

In one recent case which involved a challenge to a medical group’s non-competes with anesthesiologists the DOJ provided important guidance about when it deems antitrust issues to exist. In this case the medical group entered into non-competes that barred anesthesiologists from providing services anywhere within 25 miles of their work location with the medical group. The DOJ submitted a filing that requested the court to deem the non-competes to violate antitrust law. The DOJ appeared motivated in large part by the fact that the medical group allegedly employed most of the anesthesiologists in the northern part of the state and purportedly was the sole entity that provided several types of healthcare services in the region. The DOJ claimed that the non-competes constituted a “horizontal agreement” between competing healthcare providers (i.e. the medical group and the anesthesiologists) and that they accordingly violated federal antitrust law (unless the medical group established that they were simply “ancillary” to employment agreements that otherwise were not anti-competitive and survived under a less stringent rule of reason). The DOJ appeared to rely also on the fact that the anesthesiologists effectively could have provided the services unilaterally if they ceased doing so under their relationship with the medical group. In other words in the DOJ’s view this relationship was largely akin to a relationship between two organizations than a traditional relationship between an employer and an employee unable to provide the services at issue independently.

Other recent DOJ actions show that the DOJ will scrutinize non-competes far more closely when they exist between two organizations or between an organization and a group of employees who could independently provide the services at issue (e.g. a group of doctors). The DOJ and other government agencies have brought several actions recently to challenge “no poach” agreements i.e. where one organization agrees not to solicit or hire another organization’s employees. The DOJ also has made filings recently that show it will scrutinize non-competes more closely when the applicable non-competes impose unique limits on employee mobility such as when the employees have specialized knowledge that they can use at relatively few organizations in an area or when the employer categorically enters into non-competes with employees in a way that indicates it is seeking to limit their movement rather than truly prevent unfair competition (such as when the employer enters into non-competes with lower paid employees or with virtually all employees).

Although the DOJ’s analysis does not differ in some ways from the analyses that state courts typically apply (where they also assess whether non-competes are narrowly tailored and reasonably necessary) this new approach by the executive branch creates an additional layer of pitfalls for organizations that maintain non-competes. For now healthcare organizations should proceed with caution when entering into non-competes with other organizations (or with groups of doctors or other employees who could practice independently if they wished to do so) and should avoid taking broad or categorical approaches to non-competes for large groups of employees but instead tailor its approach to the circumstances of the employees at issue. It also will be important to continue monitoring this area as the executive branch should continue providing more guidance about how it will be approaching this area.

New State Developments

Major changes also have occurred recently at the state and local level. Many states have modified their laws to impose more onerous obligations upon employers that seek to use non-competes.

In late 2021 Illinois enacted its Freedom to Work Act which prohibits non-competes against Illinois employees who earn less than $75000 per year bars other types of restrictive covenants and requires employers to take specific steps when delivering a proposed non-compete to an employee in order to make it effective (including by giving the employee 14 days to review it). In Colorado which already barred non-competes and non-solicits which did not fall within specific statutory exceptions the state increased the penalties for those who violate its non-compete statute. Nevada recently amended its own statute to prohibit most non-competes with employees who are paid via an hourly wage. Washington D.C. recently enacted an ordinance that would ban most types of non-competes in the District although its effective date has been delayed and its status is uncertain. At the same time courts in several states have issued decisions that show they are changing their analysis for scrutinizing non-competes and several other jurisdictions have been considering laws that would impose further hurdles (including New York). These developments reiterate the need for employers to tailor any non-competes to the circumstances at issue rather than using a “one size fits all” form or making categorical decisions about broad groups of employees.

Impact of Union Organizing on Non-Competes

Recent events clearly show that employees’ perceptions have shifted regarding labor unions. The National Labor Relations Board recently reported that union organizing petitions increased 57% in the first half of FY 2022. At the same time several recent high profile union organizing wins show that even sophisticated employers are facing a new landscape.

This is particularly notable for healthcare employers who frequently have nurses maintenance custodial and other employees seek to become unionized. Furthermore this is especially true where employees are becoming more educated about their legal rights and options and are becoming more cognizant of the impact of employment actions such as non-competes. For a healthcare organization who has employees that are considering unionization an onerous noncompete should be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.

This presents yet another area for healthcare organizations to continue to monitor as they seek to strike a balance between minimizing liability while at the same time presenting the major resources that they expend to protect their investments and good will.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy45bmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvZ29sZi9qZW5uaWZlci1rdXBjaG8td2lucy1scGdhLW1laWplci1jbGFzc2ljLW9uLXNlY29uZC1wbGF5b2ZmLWhvbGUvNzMtYmU2MDg5YTktYjFhOC00ODZjLThmMjAtMjlmNDk3M2M5NGJj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Kupcho wins LPGA Meijer Classic on second playoff hole | 9news.com,"The Colorado native has picked up her second career LPGA win this season.

MICHIGAN USA — After missing a 2-foot eagle putt on the first hole of a playoff Jennifer Kupcho won the LPGA Meijer Classic on Sunday when Leona Maguire's 3-foot birdie try lipped out on the second extra hole.

Kupcho closed with a 1-under 71 to match playing partner Nelly Korda and Maguire at 18-under 270 at Blythefield Country Club. Maguire finished with a 65 and birdied both playoff holes.

“It’s really special” Kupcho said. “I’ve been really close but this leaderboard was stacked. I think that’s what I’m most proud of is the players that were up there with me. It was a very close battle to the end and I’m proud of it.”

Korda the winner last year had a 72 after taking a one-stroke lead over Kupcho into the final round. Korda dropped out of the playoff with a three-putt par on first extra trip down the par-5 18th.

Kupcho won for the second time on the LPGA Tour following her major victory in early April at Mission Hills in the California desert. The 25-year-old former Wake Forest star from Colorado won the inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur in 2019.

A champion once again 🏆

Kupcho got off to a slow start with a double bogey on the par-4 third and a bogey on the par-4 sixth. She rebounded with an eagle on the par-5 eighth and birdie on the par-4 ninth. On the back nine she birdied the par-4 12th and par-5 14th and bogeyed the par-4 16th.

“I struggled a little bit at the beginning so it tells me I can really come back from it” Kupcho said. “I’ve always known I’m a back-nine player and that definitely came into effect today.”

Maguire won the LPGA Drive On Championship at Crown Colony in early February to become the first Irish winner in LPGA Tour history.

The second-ranked Korda made her second start since returning from a four-month break because of a blood clot in her left arm. She tied for eighth two weeks ago in the U.S. Women’s Open in her first event since early February.

“Unfortunately sometimes you have it and sometimes you don’t” Korda said. “If you told me I think three four months ago when I was in the ER that I would be here I would being extremely happy.”

Korda also is the defending champion next week in the KPGA Women’s PGA at Congressional.

Lydia Ko was fourth at 17 under after a 68.

Lexi Thompson the 2015 winner closed with a 70 to tie for fifth at 16 under with Jessica Korda (67) Nelly's older sister and Carlota Ciganda (67) and Atthaya Thitikul (68).

“Of course it’s not the outcome that I wanted but I felt strong the whole week and played great golf and nothing but positives to take into a major next week” Thompson said.

Unable to obtain a regular job she applied for membership in a direct selling firm that requires no educational qualification or degree. ""All we need is good marketing skills and my neighbour has already managed to buy a car by selling products to her connections. You see the commission is good if you can manage regular sales"" she quips.

However she is not alone as thousands of people especially women sign up for direct selling companies every year. While some people have made a fortune from this industry others have become prey to fraudulent schemes. In the past company such as Ebiz.com has duped thousands of gullible savers by running a pyramid fraud in the guise of direct selling.

But there are several companies that work on a direct selling model and Amway is the most renowned example of it with the brand existing in Indian markets for almost 25 years now. The other direct selling companies include Modicare Avon Tupperware Oriflame and Herbalife Nutrition among others.

Recently the Enforcement Directorate (ED) froze assets worth over ₹757.77 crore of Amway India for running a pyramid fraud in the guise of direct selling. But Amway said that ""The action of the authorities is with regards to the investigation dating back to 2011 and since then we have been cooperating with the department and have shared all the information sought from time to time"".

How do you differentiate between a genuine direct selling firm and Ponzi schemes?

According to the Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA) Director Rajat Banerji ""Direct selling is an operation or sales of a product through a network of sellers"". Calling it a chain of human networks Banerji said the industry's sole motive is to provide a livelihood to people from their homes. ""Direct selling companies are almost similar to FMCG firms like Colgate-Palmolive Unilever and ITC having common departments like manufacturing account finance sales marketing legal and communication). What differentiates the two is the delivery process to the consumers"" he said.

Explaining about the pyramid scheme Banerji said it is a Ponzi scheme that focuses on the enrollment of new people and collecting money from them. ""In a pyramid scheme an initial entrant may earn a good amount of money but as the distributors' network increases it becomes harder for late entrants to recover their initial amount and the marketing model collapses"" Banerji added.

On the other hand a direct selling firm's focus is on sale of products and does not provide any reward for recruitment the IDSA Director said.

Prominent direct selling companies in India such as Amway and Modicare explained to Mint their working model. Amway claimed ""We do not have any joining fee and we never pay on recruitment"" and added ""bonuses are paid only on the sales of the product"". Besides Amway said that they also have an exit policy under which ""the participants can cancel the agreement without resulting in any breach of contract or levy of penalty"".

When asked about the practice of luring people to join the membership programme Amway said they take strict actions against grifters including termination of the contract.

According to a report released by IDSA the direct selling industry grew 7.7% to cross the ₹18000 crore mark during the Financial Year 2021. Besides employment in the industry also increased during the Covid times. In FY21 the total number of direct sellers grew 6.32% to almost eight million as compared to FY 2019-20 when around 7.4 million had joined direct selling schemes. Globally the direct selling industry is $190 billion and in India it is close to $3 billion.

Anamika Mehra a top-ranked distributor in a direct selling company claims that she has recruited several unemployed women a widow who lost her husband due to coronavirus and several housewives who wanted to support their families after their income sources were impacted due to the pandemic. Currently Mehra has a network of more than 5000 people under her. Backing the direct selling industry Mehra said ""The industry is a boon for the vulnerable population as there is no investment involved and it is all right if you do not have formal education. All you need is marketing techniques and an ability to make new people join the business"". She claims that she has managed to buy three cars and build her own house in Chandigarh by working in a multi-level marketing (MLM) company for more than 22 years. However she denied commenting on the quality and market response of products her company sells"".

On the other hand Renuka Joshi from Dehradun who has worked in Modicare India expressed disappointment with the business model of this industry. Teaching in a Convent school Joshi said that the industry is gradually penetrating educational institutes. She said her colleagues are selling products to parents despite their disagreement. ""Parents say that we care about our children so sometimes we unwillingly purchase those pricey products"" she said.

According to Joshi the exorbitant prices of products the recruitment of an uneducated workforce in the industry and the selling of low-quality products are some of the practices by the direct selling companies that she finds exasperating.

""Sometimes companies give us products which may not be of good quality so I don't give such products in my tiny network"". Citing Modicare's Noni tablets Joshi claimed that the supplement has caused sugar problems in three of her colleagues. Joshi is now planning to leave the industry.

Mint spoke to Modicare and the company in its response said ""Noni is extracted from the fruit of the Morinda citrifolia tree and according to various research reports Noni provides multiple health benefits and helps maintain overall health"". The company added that all its products are formulated after ""extensive research at world-class facilities and are of high quality. All our products come with a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee and can be returned within 30 days"".

Direct selling via e-commerce

Direct selling companies have cautioned customers not to buy products from e-commerce platforms due to fraudulent offers. The company recommended buying products directly from a distributor or their website. IDSA's Banerji said ""In India close to 80 lakh people are involved in this industry. If we enter into e-commerce the income of direct sellers will get destroyed"". The direct selling companies' products that are available on e-commerce sites are unauthorized sales he added.

Modicare shared the same sentiments regarding the sale and purchase of its company's products on online platforms. In a written statement the company said “We do not support listing and selling our products on the online marketplaces as it directly impacts the earning opportunity of our consultants. Besides there is no way for us to keep a track of the products that are being sold online wherein safeguarding consumers against spurious or expired products becomes a challenge"".

How to protect yourself from a Ponzi schemes?

To shield yourself from a Ponzi scheme fraud analyze the marketing strategy view online if there are any reports of scams about that company and take people's reviews about the product. Direct selling consultancy Strategyindia.com is also creating a distinction through its scam alerts which list pyramid operations after an investigation. It has blacklisted 3565 companies on its website at present.

What is the government doing to curb malpractices?

The Centre last year brought amendments to the Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules 2021 to protect consumers from the direct selling companies from promoting pyramid or money circulation schemes. The government explicitly said ""Direct selling entities and direct sellers are prohibited from promoting a pyramid scheme or enrolling any person to such scheme or participating in such arrangement in any manner whatsoever in the garb of doing direct selling business"". The rules direct that every direct selling company must ensure that goods and services offered by their direct sellers conform to applicable laws.

Now it remains to be seen whether the Centre's guidelines will have any bigger impact on Ponzi schemes that operate with impunity.

Music GPS and calls just won’t go through. Here’s a quick guide to boosting your service no matter where the road takes you.

What about a travel pro tip if you prefer to fly to your destination? You can see which flights include the most legroom with the right tools. I tell all my tall friends about this trick. Tap or click here for the secret — it’s No. 5 on the list.

If you’re heading off for a long trip spending time in a seasonal home or otherwise away here’s a smart way to save money: Pause your cable and internet. Yes you can do this and keep many of your service’s perks.

Here’s why canceling isn’t your best option

When you’re going on an extended trip there’s no reason to pay for internet service back home. You might think canceling and reactivating is the way to go. That’s a bad idea.

● You’ll often face a cancellation fee.

● Canceling your service is frustrating and takes time. You’ll likely be bombarded with questions about why you’re canceling and offers to keep you. And once you’re through with everything you’ll have to take time to return equipment to your provider.

● You’ll often pay an activation fee to reactivate your previous service or sign up with a new one.

● Resuming service takes time too. You’ll need to set up your plan payment and equipment.

The good news is many ISPs and cable/satellite providers allow you to pause your service which is much more convenient.

Below I gathered info on some of the biggest providers in the country. If you don’t see yours check its website or give them a call.

Comcast Xfinity

Xfinity’s Seasonal Convenience Plan lets you put your TV internet and voice services on hold while you’re away. You keep your equipment phone number and Comcast.net email address which you can still access during the hold.

If you upgrade to Seasonal Internet Access you’ll still be able to control your smart devices at home while you’re away too. There’s no reconnection charge and you won’t need a service call when you return.

Xfinity charges $8 per month to pause your TV internet or voice services. If you want to keep your internet it’s $29.95 for Seasonal Internet Access. The amount of time you can activate the Seasonal Convenience Plan varies by region from three to nine months.

Charter Spectrum

If you use Spectrum use the Seasonal Status option to put TV internet and voice services on hold for a monthly fee. You can do this for two to nine months.

You keep your phone number email address voicemail Spectrum receiver and other TV internet or voice equipment.

From creator and executive producers Andrea Lewis (Degrassi: The Next Generation) Emmy-nominee CJ Faison (Giants & Junebug) Jackie Aina Kahlana Barfield Brown and Keesha Boyd of Comcast the docuseries will closely examine the social change past and present within the beauty industry through the lens of the successful Black women who have led the charge.

The Black Beauty Effect is a three-part docuseries that captures the current evolution revolution and disruption taking place within the beauty industry. Black beauty influencers celebrities and entrepreneurs have taken up the torch passed down from their pioneering predecessors. Each hour-long episode examines a different aspect of beauty – hair skin and makeup – through the lens of some of the beauty industry’s most iconic game-changers. The Black Beauty Effect peels back the gorgeous glow we see in advertisements to tell the ugly truths that have plagued the beauty industry for far too long.

“The Black Beauty Effect is one of my dream projects” said series creator Andrea Lewis. “As someone who grew up in the television and film industry I’ve sat in more makeup chairs than I can count and I have experienced the good the bad and the ugly of what it’s like being a Black woman and navigating the beauty space. I’ve always wanted to create a story that captured the fullness of our impact in the beauty industry from the celebrity makeup artists the Black beauty editors and the countless beauty content creators. They’ve all been a part of bringing light to our impact. Comcast Xfinity has been amazing and we couldn’t have asked for a better partner who not only believes in our story but also put their full support behind Black filmmakers.”

“We’re thrilled to work with creator Andrea Lewis and FaceForward Productions to bring the exclusive premiere of The Black Beauty Effect to the Black Experience on Xfinity channel furthering our company-wide mission of investing in authentic Black stories and amplifying voices that deserve to be heard” said Keesha Boyd Executive Director Multicultural Video & Entertainment Xfinity Consumer Services and Executive Producer of The Black Beauty Effect. “Through this partnership we hope to highlight and celebrate the contributions of the Black community to the beauty industry while also shine a light on the stories of the women who pushed for necessary change.”

The Black Beauty Effect is directed by Kwanza Nicole Gooden and produced by FaceForward Productions. The series was created by Andrea Lewis who serves as Executive Producer along with CJ Faison Jackie Aina and Kahlana Barfield Brown. Emmy-nominated Takara Joseph and Summer Griffiths serve as producers alongside Andrena Hale as showrunner.

“The FaceForward Productions team jumped at the opportunity to executive produce and bring The Black Beauty Effect series to life to continue uplifting and amplifying the majesty and ingenuity of Black women. This series sets the stage to create a cultural movement worldwide honoring Black women’s contributions and deeply embedded influence in the beauty industry. In the spirit of our company’s mission to capture the shared human experience through one forward-facing culturally-nuanced lens we knew joining forces with Andrea Lewis and Comcast would offer the perfect partnership” said CJ Faison Founder/ CEO FaceForward Productions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3Nwb3J0cy1iZXR0aW5nLXN0YXJ0LXVwLWVwb3h5LWNvbWNhc3QtMjAyMjA2MTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Epoxy.ai a Philadelphia tech startup aims to sync TV watching with sports betting,"The Epoxy.ai team outside of their office at the Berwyn train station.

Chris Reynolds and Jason Angelides developed the gizmo on the TV remote that brought deep-dive sports stats — tracking game momentum and player statistics — to millions of Xfinity subscribers.

Now less than two years after leaving executive jobs at Comcast Corp. they want a piece of the online sports betting action.

Reynolds and Angelides have launched a start-up Epoxy.ai in Berwyn that aims to personalize the betting experience for 75 million sports fans who experts say could place more than $20 billion a year in wagers as more states legalize online sports betting.

Epoxy’s first idea: to use the microphone on a mobile phone to determine what game a sports fan is watching and to synchronize the game on the television with a recommended bet. Reynolds said that a sports bettor would agree to the synchronization through the terms of service of the company that licenses Epoxy’s technology. Epoxy’s first customer is betParx which is a sister company to Parx Casino.

“Amazon Instagram Spotify those businesses are built on knowing who you are and putting the right things in front of you” Angelides said. “It’s an expectation and the sports media and gaming industry while they recognize the need for that type of experience they struggle to support that for a variety of reasons. One because they’re extremely thinly spread technologically because they’re rolling out across states. Number two they’re not technology companies.”

Too early for innovation?

In May 2018 the U.S. Supreme Court repealed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act paving the way for the gold rush of online sports betting. Pennsylvania New Jersey and 21 other states have legalized online sports betting. Pennsylvania sports fans placed more than $6 billion in online wagers in the last year.

Experts believe that the national volume of online sports betting or the “handle” will grow to $25 billion to $30 billion a year as more states legalize online sports wagering.

Chris Grove a co-founding partner at Acies Investments a venture fund for sports gambling and technology start-ups in Las Vegas called Epoxy’s founders “very talented.”

But Grove believes that sports books have more immediate issues to resolve before they think about the innovation that Epoxy offers including launching sports books in new states registering sports bettors more efficiently and handling deposits.

“It’s easy to be overly optimistic about the pace of innovation in regulated sports betting” Grove said. “It’s kind of like talking about putting solar panels on the roof before you put the roof on.”

Ready for some football?

Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment which owns Parx Casino in Bensalem is taking an early run with Epoxy under the leadership of Matthew Cullen who was hired four years ago. He heads Greenwood’s 100-person digital gambling operation that includes overseeing the company’s online sports betting in Pennsylvania New Jersey and Michigan. Cullen expects to expand sports betting to an additional three states. Parx handled $147 million in online sports bets between last July and April according to figures from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.

“Personalization is the next big thing” Cullen said because “people are going to want to bet on what they bet in the past or what they like or what they like to watch.” But Cullen added echoing Grove “it’s still early days.”

Cullen’s team will measure whether Epoxy leads to higher retention of bettors affects the amount of money a bettor bets and leads to higher engagement time on betParx.

The NFL football season drives television sales and ratings and figures indicate online sports betting. Pennsylvania online sports wagering jumped 65% to $527 million from August to September 2021 gaming board data show. September is the start of the NFL season. The month with the highest dollar volume in online sports waging in Pennsylvania was January the month of NFL playoffs with $737 million in bets.

Cullen said the plan was for the Epoxy app to launch on the betParx betting app for the NFL season.

Angelides said Epoxy would be ready. “It’s what we’re doing. Sports waits for no one. The game must go on.”

As to whether sports bettors would be comfortable with a mobile phone microphone that listens to them Angelides said that Epoxy’s research shows that more than 90% of core and casual bettors report they “like it when the products they use tailor the content to them so it’s easier to find what they want and discover new things.”

From high-rise to start-up

Reynolds 47 and Angelides 54 have settled into post-Comcast life. At the media and telecom giant they worked out of the 37th floor of the technology tower Philadelphia’s tallest building.

Now they rent the second floor of a quaint office building on the eastbound side of SEPTA’s Berwyn train station. It’s an easy commute for Epoxy’s employees who live in Philadelphia. The start-up employs 12 mostly a crew who followed Reynolds and Angelides from Comcast. The firm also uses six contractors.

Angelides said the plan over time is for 20 to 30 full-time employees.

Epoxy hopes to raise $7 million to $10 million in venture capital this summer and it has filed for patents on their technology through Philadelphia law firm Morgan Lewis. The co-founders see Epoxy’s technology as offering three services: synchronization between the TV viewing and bets visualization of sports data and bet recommendations.

Angelides and Reynolds met in the 1990s at Traffic.com in Chesterbrook a real-time traffic information service for radio and television stations. Traffic.com bought by Nokia took traffic data from road and highway sensors and sold it to television and radio stations. The business taught Angelides and Reynolds the importance of packaging real-time information for audiences.

OneTwoSee

At Traffic.com they thought of other areas where real-time information could be valuable. It was in the early days of mobile phone apps. When the pair realized that sports fans were always looking up sports stats on their phones they developed a business to access and visualize box-score sports data in real time. Fans could consume the data as they watched games.

“The idea was that if you were a sports fan and you were sitting there and you were watching the game and a player comes up and you don’t know who he is or what his stats are. How many home runs he has? What’s going to happen next? What’s the most likely outcome? You got to go through looking through box scores? It was a nightmare” Angelides said.

In late 2011 Angelides and Reynolds launched OneTwoSee to provide sports data instantly. It was their first start-up. Over time OneTwoSee developed the platform to display up-to-the-minute sports stats on cable television and integrated the service into Comcast’s X1 platform. Comcast viewed the sports data — accessed through a button on the TV remote — as a way to make its huge investment into sports rights more engaging for its subscribers. In 2016 Comcast bought OneTwoSee for an undisclosed price.

Inside Comcast the OneTwoSee team stuck together and helped to deepen the sports platform for the OIympic games.

Reynolds and Angelides said they had a great experience at Comcast and they left on good terms. But they were restless and viewed online sports betting as the next big thing.

Angelides gave notice to Comcast that he was leaving in November 2020. Reynolds did the same in mid-2021. Of his decision to leave Comcast Reynolds said that “once you start building stuff it’s hard not to do it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5aGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIyMDYxOS9uZXdzL2hlLXdhcy1vbmUtb2Ytb3VyLWJlc3QtZm9ybWVyLWJlYXJzLWJlYXQtd3JpdGVyLWpvaG4tbW9vbi1tdWxsaW4tZGllcy1hdC03NC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He was one of our best': Former Bears beat writer John “Moon” Mullin dies at 74,"John “Moon” Mullin whose coverage of the Chicago Bears for the Daily Herald Chicago Tribune and Comcast Sports earned him the respect of fans players and peers died Sunday after a battle with cancer. He was 74. Courtesy of Carolyn Timberlake

The first time I encountered John Mullin I knew I was in trouble. He was the Bears' beat writer for the Daily Herald a presence not to be ignored and I was the new fresh-off-maternity-leave Bears writer for the Tribune. He was good I was not. He had sources and relationships and a deep reservoir of football knowledge. I did not.

He appeared to be both everyone's friend and greatest fear. And I was rightfully worried.

While the other beat writers may have had sources in the front office and among the players and coaches Moon was tight with the strength and conditioning coaches the equipment manager. His relationships were professional but deep and they went all the way through the front office. But more than that Moon and the depth chart were one.

Bears writers would tease him for his bond with the third-string offensive guard reasoning they understood each other because Moon himself was an offensive lineman in college. But it was more than that and we all knew it. And he delighted in his revenge when the fierce defensive lineman Bryan Robinson moved quickly up the depth chart and became a standout in 1998 only to refuse to speak to all the jerks who didn't care enough to interview him before he was a starter. All but Moon of course who did more than interview B-Rob when he was a third-stringer but got to know him on a personal level as he did with virtually everyone. B-Rob loved Moon. More than that he respected him.

John Mullin who left us on Father's Day at 74 years old after a valiant battle with cancer was hired by the Daily Herald as a business writer in 1989 and had a life that could and should have been the subject of a fifth book. As a young man he jumped freight trains — “but only once” laughs his sister Ann. He worked in the steel mills in Dayton. He was a tennis pro once playing against — and losing to — an 11-year-old Andrea Jaeger the wager a dozen chocolate-chip cookies which he sent to her at Wimbledon. He was an insurance claims adjuster and an arson investigator. He worked in marketing and PR for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He majored in history and minored in psychology and had a Master's in Education.

It was not the usual route for a journalist but it gave him a perspective that few others had the perfect background for someone always looking for context.

When Moon moved over to the Tribune in 1997 I was of course thrilled that my opponent was now a teammate. We shared bylines and we shared laughs and his generosity was boundless not just with his reporting as one would expect but with the genuine support and unselfishness and us-against-the-world spirit that instantly made me tougher. Better.

He wanted to get the story first as much as the next reporter probably more than the next reporter but he was a man of principle and integrity first. It cost him at times; the slight hesitation to print something he knew but wanted to double-check or hold — because it wasn't worth damaging a relationship — may have meant someone else got the story first. But he was OK with the consequences. And it would more often than not result in him getting another bigger story down the line tipped by a player coach or front-office employee who knew they could trust Moon to get it right and wanted to pay him pay back for his earlier discretion.

That doesn't often win people promotions in our business. But it does win them respect among those who knew Moon and can look back today at a body of work and say he was one of our best.

For his contemporaries though today is not one in which we will talk about his work but rather a man who we are learning had deep friendships with so many of us; relationships held together with kind texts and encouraging words a practical joke that he took as well as he gave as Dan Pompei and Fred Mitchell could tell you and a glass of wine or two. Or three. He knew his wine to which Peggy Kusinski his partner in crime on many a Bears' road trip would attest.

For all of us Moon represented something different and yet something so very much the same. A pal a trusted confidant a dear friend as he was to me.

For years — and years — we met for breakfast — Egg Harbor in Lake Forest and Glenview Eggshell Cafe in Deerfield Rise n Dine in Wheeling and for the last several years Butterfield's in Northbrook. We knew who had the best jam (Eggshell's raspberry no contest) and where they kept the Country Crock at Butterfield's (in a special drawer in the kitchen where we often had to guide the newbie waitresses).

Moon always got the Meat Lover's omelet which as the name promises had a lot of meat. On it he emptied approximately half a bottle of ketchup and ate with relish. And he always let me have a bite of his pancakes.

It was there where we laughed until we cried. I often came straight from the “Y” for a while from a boxing class. For years after I stopped taking the class Moon would still invariably greet me with “So who did you punch today?”

We were angry for a while both of us swept up in the same Tribune layoff of '09 and it felt like a betrayal as much as heartbreak. Thankfully we both latched on quickly to other things Moon with Comcast Sports finding a job and a following who appreciated he was more than just a skilled reporter but a personality who engaged both viewers and his new co-workers often the ex-players who loved him when they were Bears.

And so the breakfasts gradually became less bitter but now wonderful catch-up sessions with us talking excitedly about these news jobs and something else: college teaching gigs that energized us as much as anything had. Moon already had been teaching at Lewis College and over the years I had visited his classes even taught with him at DePaul. Soon inspired by him I joined the faculty at Northwestern.

We talked about our students and our classes more than we had ever talked about the Bears exchanging stories and lesson plans and philosophies and soon Moon would pause and smile as he so often did and say “Living well is the best revenge isn't it?”

He would point to his nose and then to you with the other hand when you made a good point like it was a game of Charades. I loved that. And he quoted Winston Churchill like I would quote what happened on “The Bachelor.”

“Like Churchill said of Anthony Eden” Moon told me once when we were talking about one blowhard or another “He is a modest man with much to be modest about.'”

Of course I had to look up who Anthony Eden was the prime minister of the United Kingdom in the mid-'50s. But of course. Moon could say that without the slightest pretense. A Renaissance man in sweatpants.

He was an adoring father to his daughter Jenny. He played piano by ear sang and played guitar in a band in his 50s. He took up cycling in middle age and insisted on wearing the full biking regalia again delighting in the teasing that invariably followed when he'd ride to Bears practice and walk into the press room still in the Spandex shorts.

I didn't know it would be our last breakfast a few weeks ago thin as he had gotten mostly because he had recently purchased an expensive e-bike recently played golf still spoke like a man excited about his prospects and all that life had to offer especially the love of his life his wife Carolyn.

She generously shared Moon with his legions of friends even in his final days when he broke the Lake Forest Hospital record for most visitors. The hospital where Moon passed Sunday actually told his family of that stat though I can picture Moon verifying.

I can picture a lot of things all good all smiles though I think it will be a very long time before I will be able to walk into Butterfield's again without my friend. But when I do I will order the Meat Lover's omelet pour half a bottle of ketchup on top and laugh until I cry.

John “Moon” Mullin who covered the Bears for decades and this month set local records for hospital visitors as he fought the ravages of Stage IV pancreatic cancer died Sunday at age 74.

Quick with a smile and a story Mullin’s interests stretched far beyond — and were often more compelling than — the team he covered. With white hair and a matching beard he looked like Ernest Hemingway. He played guitar. He was a hardcore cyclist finishing his rides as the sun rose. As it set he liked a glass of good red wine.

After he checked into the hospital in worsening health earlier this month Mullin received wave after wave of visitors. Receptionists at the hospital told Mullin’s family they’d never handed out so many name tags to go visit one patient. By the end of last week he was limited to only two visitors at a time for 20-minute periods. Those who visited him waited their turn tagging in as though they were swinging over the boards for a hockey shift.

It made sense. Mullin worked with practically everyone in Chicago beginning at the Daily Herald before joining the Tribune in 1998 and Comcast Sports Net Chicago in 2009. He taught communications classes at DePaul.

Mullin was active until last month. With wife Carolyn he visited his sister in Naples Florida in January and went to see other family members in Hilton Head South Carolina in April. His treatment became less effective in May prompting hospital visits.

Mullin whose nickname was derivative of a longtime comic strip character was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in fall 2019. He lived more than two years longer than his original prognosis a credit to years of bicycle riding and a devotion to positive thinking. His strength from the former helped even as cancer spread to his lungs; his emotional strength from the latter was invaluable he said.

In December 2021 he began a series of YouTube videos called “Attitude Over Cancer.”

“The goal for a lot of us” he said during the first episode “is to keep this monster in a cave until they come up with a silver bullet to kill it.”

That’s just who this kid has been. He blasted a ball onto Comerica Park’s Pepsi Porch three years ago the first time he took batting practice in Detroit. He hit two home runs in his minor-league debut and later belted an inside-the-park homer in his first game at Low A. He has wowed in major-league spring training made remarkable catches at Comerica Park in 2020’s summer workouts performed at every level and developed as well as anyone could possibly have asked for. The Tigers selected him with the No. 5 pick three years ago believing his hit tool was the real deal banking he would grow into more power trusting he could prove the doubters wrong and roam the outfield with ease. Check check and check. Greene rose to become MLB’s No. 2 prospect a player with no limits on his potential.

None of it is surprising for those who have followed Greene since the day the Tigers drafted him. And it’s even less surprising to those who have known him even longer. There are plenty of stories about Greene’s special nature out there and here’s a good one from before he was this hyped rookie back when he was just a kid in Florida.

Riley Greene was 11 years old the first time he met Jered Goodwin.

Goodwin was running a local baseball camp and an assistant coach alerted him that there was a left-handed kid playing shortstop.

Goodwin walked over to inquire.

“You’re left-handed” he said. “Why are you playing shortstop?”

In front of a 6-foot-2 250-pound adult Greene explained. In a humble but matter-of-fact manner Greene told Goodwin he was usually able to field and throw as well as anyone on his team so he often played shortstop. That’s how it goes in youth baseball.

The answer made sense to Goodwin. He walked away then went back to his assistant.

“Sounds like this kid is the best player on the field” he said.

A few minutes later Goodwin watched as an 11-year-old Riley Greene started taking batting practice. He watched about five swings.

“OK” Goodwin said “he’s the best guy out here.”

That’s how things tend to go with Riley Greene.

It was only a matter of time until he started doing it at the world’s highest level.

“Sometimes” Goodwin said “I guess scouting is easy.”

Greene was 14 years old one week away from beginning his freshman year of high school when Goodwin called Florida Gators coach Kevin O’Sullivan. There was a kid he had to tell him about.

“This kid is either gonna commit to you or UCF” Goodwin said.

O’Sullivan soon offered Greene a scholarship. He accepted about a week after this phone call. He became the youngest player to ever commit to Florida. A big endorsement from Goodwin who coached Greene during his freshman year at Hagerty High School in Oviedo Fla. And a big-time bet from the Gators on a kid who had yet to play a high school game. Greene’s talent was prodigious like that.

But sheer ability wasn’t the only reason Goodwin was willing to promote a skinny still-growing kid to a baseball power. Goodwin is now the senior director of scouting operations at Perfect Game. He’s been a mainstay in elite prep baseball circles for a long time. When Greene debuted Saturday he became the 55th player Goodwin has coached in some fashion to reach the major leagues. Goodwin has coached natural talents such as Bo Bichette and Jesse Winker the two players he compares to Greene in terms of can’t-miss ability from a young age.

“He was right in line with that type of hit tool that type of mentality maturity” Goodwin said.

A little throw back from @Greene21Riley at 15 years old. This was a freshman year bomb with the same sweet swing that @AlanGreene21 molded daily. Cannot wait to watch the debut today. #Tigers @HagHSBaseball https://t.co/Tm9d2yl5dS pic.twitter.com/HDsOaCL8K4 — Jered (@JeredGoodwin3) June 18 2022

Goodwin has also seen good players who leveled off or didn’t make it. So in addition to Greene’s uncanny ability to hit the baseball Goodwin could not ignore Greene’s baseball IQ his savvy. Much of that came from his father Alan a hitting instructor who eats and breathes baseball. But by a certain age Greene had to take ownership of his own passion for the game. Special talent is an undeniable part of the Riley Greene story. But a worker’s mentality and a thirst to be great don’t get talked about enough.

“There has to be a passing of the baton where the kid takes control of his career or his passion” Goodwin said. “At 14 years old it’s a passion not a career. He took control of that dove into the nuances of the game. He didn’t want to just be a great hitter. And typically at 14 15 years old people are content with that.”

Those traits helped as Greene tore up the Florida prep baseball scene as he thrived as a prospect on a national stage as he continued to answer any questions anyone had about his game. As a senior there were scouts who knocked Greene’s defensive ability who said he’d never be able to stay in center field.

“He took that to heart” Goodwin said. “Tell him what he’s not good at and he’s gonna get good at it. That came from a very young age and that’s internal.”

On draft day in 2019 the Tigers selected Greene and introduced him as a center fielder. He never attended the University of Florida. He was simply too good and bigger things were calling.

The only wrinkle in this tale came on April 1. That morning Goodwin had woken up to a call from a trusted source telling him the Tigers had decided Greene was going to break camp with the team. They had not informed Greene yet but the decision was made and he’d be learning the news soon.

“That’s where it was going yeah” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said again Saturday.

A few hours later that day in April Goodwin’s phone went off again. This time with bad news. Greene had fouled a ball off the top of his right foot while facing Gerrit Cole. He initially stayed in the game but later went in for X-rays. Eventually he learned he had a fracture. That meant Greene never got to hear the news he was making the team. It meant an estimated six to eight weeks before returning to any sort of play.

“I got to say I probably took that harder than he did” Goodwin said.

Greene has admitted it was all difficult. He played video games and went to chain restaurants in Lakeland Fla. to pass the time. Catcher Jake Rogers rehabbing from Tommy John surgery gave him rides to the team facility before Greene was able to drive again.

The build-back was slow but Greene was diligent. When he was finally able to leave Lakeland to begin a minor-league rehab assignment the training staff threw him a mini going-away party.

A few weeks later he finally got to hear the news that had been delayed. Adam Melhuse the hitting coach at Triple-A Toledo called Greene into his office Friday afternoon as Greene was leaving the team training room. They started chatting about hitting. At one point Greene looked down and noticed a GoPro camera was turned on. He found that strange but he didn’t think too much of it. Turns out they were recording an important moment. Melhuse soon informed Greene he was going to the big leagues. He was more stunned than anything.

“I was really happy” Greene said. “I wasn’t expecting it at that moment.”

Here. We. Go. Tomorrow we will select the contract of MLB Pipeline’s No. 2 overall prospect @Greene21Riley. pic.twitter.com/m3XGrCNNe5 — Detroit Tigers (@tigers) June 17 2022

By the time Greene returned to his locker the news had already gone public. His phone was flooded with messages. He called his parents then his girlfriend. He scrambled to pack and turns out getting a flight to Detroit from where the Toledo Mud Hens were playing in Worchester Mass. was next to impossible. His parents had to fly into Pittsburgh and drive up to Detroit.

Greene spent the night in a hotel preparing for a Saturday morning flight. And on the night before the biggest day of his life Greene got a good’s night sleep.

“I got to a point where I shut my phone off” he said “and I was like ‘OK I just need a couple hours to myself here.'”

Riley Greene went 2-for-3 with two walks in his MLB debut Saturday in a victory against the Rangers becoming the first MLB player to reach base four times in a debut since Cedric Mullins in 2018.

On Saturday at Comerica Park Greene swung on a 1-0 slider. The ball got in on Greene’s hands and he fought it off the other way for an opposite-field single his first MLB hit. At first base Greene’s emotions were hardly detectable. He was the same way in the clubhouse before his MLB debut relaxing and humming along to country songs even on a day where all eyes were on him. He acted as though he belongs.

At one point Greene ventured to the locker of Miguel Cabrera. Cabrera stood and gave the Tigers’ newest prospect a hug.

“I’m very excited” Greene told him.

“Me too” Cabrera said.

There has always been that touch of magic around Riley Greene. Circumstances that make it seem as if fate set all this in motion. He would throw with his father late into the night construction lights keeping up the neighbors. He met his agent at the pool. The Tigers got to know him better than anyone largely because crosschecker James Orr’s daughter was a high school classmate. The trainer who helped Greene become quicker and more athletic happened to be the liaison officer at the same school.

“The thing that excited me the most was how his teammates responded. He gained the respect and credibility amongst the group because of that performance in the spring” Hinch said. “He hits the ball as hard as anybody. He plays the game there are some theatrics to him he’ll make some diving catches he’s just an all-around good player. There’s not a lot of overarching weaknesses and there’s a lot of strengths … doesn’t mean it’s gonna be easy but it means he needs to be tested at this level now.”

Greene was not done after that single Saturday. With his parents in the stands his father Alan locked in on the game like always Greene worked two walks one after battling back from an 0-2 count. He also knocked an 0-2 opposite-field single in his final at-bat.

Hinch has cautioned against anointing Greene as some sort of savior. He is not the singular solution to the Tigers’ poor play. Like any young player he is bound to encounter some struggles as he adjusts to life in the major leagues.

“We have a really good player on our hands that we need to break into the big leagues and make him better” Hinch said. “He’s gotta learn. He’s not a finished product. An arrival does not mean that he’s perfect.”

But Greene is different from most. More gifted more dedicated special. Goodwin has seen it since the kid was 11 years old. The Tigers saw it since he was a high schooler. Plenty of others got to know about it as Greene shot through the minor leagues.

On Saturday in an interview room in the lower level of Comerica Park Greene was asked when he knew when he realized that playing in the majors wasn’t just a fun dream but more of a tangible achievable goal.

“Probably in high school” Greene said. “It all started junior senior year. I realized I was a good hitter maybe this could happen for me. I kept working at it and now here I am.”

In that sense he was no different than many other young adults trying to find their place in the world. It’s a little different when that moment happens while he’s cuddling a baseball bat in his sleep. He’d gone hitless that night for Double-A Erie and had gone a week without an extra-base hit or an RBI. So he decided to take his bat to bed with him. “Wasn't playing too well just a couple mental things” Greene said at the time “and I was like 'You know what? I'm going to sleep with this and see what happens.' Suddenly I got a couple hits confidence was up and my dad was like 'Hey man if you ever are struggling just go sleep with your bat again.' “I never did anything like that [before]. It was just like a come-to-Jesus moment where I was like 'All right I've gotta figure out something because I'm the only one that can help me with this.' I just tried something.” The next day he tallied three hits and five RBIs. The game after that he relaxed and hit a pair of solo homers with two walks. He mentioned it after the game and the story took off. That was one of the first times that casual fans outside of Tigers circles learned about Riley Greene one of the game’s top prospects who is set to take MLB by storm. It’s also one of the first things to know about Riley Greene. “I’m very superstitious” says Greene who MLB Pipeline has ranked as the No. 2 overall prospect. “I once went to the same coffee shop for a month straight and got the same meal same coffee everything.”

Of course this was when he was on a hitting tear. He didn’t literally go every day thanks to road trips but you get the idea. He wasn’t necessarily enamored with the place. He’s not sure the staff there ever learned his name. But while he hit he kept going. That tendency to roll with a good thing also applied to dinner where Greene could be accused of channeling his inner Wade Boggs. “He likes his chicken tenders” fellow Tigers prospect Parker Meadows said. “He eats a lot of chicken tenders. He eats a lot of Chick-Fil-A a lot of Zaxby's. He's a big chicken guy.” If Greene has a bad game he has to do something different. He once stepped into a shower with his uniform still on to try to break a slump. “I'm like 'Riley you're not slumping. You're 0-for-4'” Tigers rookie Spencer Torkelson said with a laugh. “But he's so used to getting hits every single night. It's kind of funny.”

The superstitions are a funny trait for someone whose climb to the Major Leagues has been marked by a beautifully consistent swing and a laser focus to work on hitting a baseball. “It's not normal what he does with the bat” said Greene’s high-school coach Matt Cleveland. Some of that comes from pure talent. Some of that comes from family. A very small part might come from chicken and coffee. None of it comes from luck.

THE SWING IS THE THING If you’ve been to a Tigers Spring Training game in the last few years you might have seen Alan Greene even if you didn’t notice him. Most of the time he’s sitting there quietly in the family section behind home plate chatting with family or friends. When his son comes to the plate he’ll take out his cell phone and record the at-bat. Alan is a proud parent. He’s also a swing guy. He was a former college baseball player at Florida Tech who turned his love for the game into a career as a professional hitting instructor working at a sports facility in Oviedo Fla. on the northeast edge of the Orlando area. He has worked with many promising young hitters. With Riley he had an eager pupil. “I know I started playing tee ball when I was like 3” Riley said. That smooth powerful left-handed swing has been crafted over years and years of practice. When Riley’s grandmother accidentally bought her left-handed grandson right-handed golf clubs his dad was happy with it figuring a right-handed golf swing wouldn’t mess with a left-handed bat swing. They worked together so much that they had to use lights in their yard so that they could keep going at night.

Eventually Riley Greene advanced far enough that he no longer had his father as his primary coach. But Alan Greene is still there for help. He watches most if not all of Riley’s games online and he’s always a phone call or text away. “It's awesome having someone to go to when I need help and not be a coach being my father” Riley said. “Just being able to text him and say 'Hey what did you see?' Or if I just want to talk just son and dad. It's great having him going through all this. “If I need him I'll ask him. But if I don't he tends to stay away which I like. He's not constantly calling me and being like 'Hey man your hands were a centimeter lower than they were last night.' He's not really doing that which is good. You go 0-for-4 one day you don't really want to talk to anyone. You kind of just want to go home and relax. It's nice.” Above all he’s supportive -- even of his son sleeping with his bat. That’s an understanding parent.

THE LEGEND GROWS Though Oviedo is big enough to be called a city it’s still small enough that stories got around about a young Riley Greene. Cleveland was a coach at another school when he first saw that swing in the summer before Riley’s freshman year. “Riley in a game on a regular high school field as an eighth-grader hit the ball off the right-field wall twice and the left-field wall twice” Cleveland said. “The last pitch was over his head and he tomahawked it.” Another story that went around town was almost too much for Cleveland to believe. “They tried to intentionally walk him when he was 8 years old” Cleveland said retelling a story that had been relayed to him “and he just takes an outside pitch and hit it over the fence.” Riley says he was older; otherwise the story is the same. The end result isn’t even the best part. “It was actually off one of my best friends” Greene said. “We weren't best friends at the time but we knew of each other. And then in high school we became really close. “It's kind of funny because he always talks about it sometimes. He's like 'Yeah Riley hit a home run off of me off an intentional walk.' But we were like 10 years old. It was Little League. It was during Christmas time I remember and there was a blow-up snowman in the outfield. And I hit it.”

It was just like a come-to-Jesus moment where I was like 'All right I've gotta figure out something because I'm the only one that can help me with this.' Riley Greene

That polished swing kept punishing pitches on the occasions when opponents would pitch to him. A natural athleticism also came through. At one point during Greene’s senior year with pro scouts watching even during batting practice the teenager went to his coach and asked if he might be pulling the ball too much in search of power. He watched a video in which All-Star Freddie Freeman said he tried to hit every ball in BP to right-center field. “Two weeks later a workout for a pro organization I'm throwing” Cleveland said “and the kid hits 15 of the first 16 pitches out to dead center. He’s special man.”

MAKING AN IMPRESSION ON MIGGY James Orr had been in the Tigers’ amateur scouting department for over a decade but he and his family moved to Oviedo in 2016. His daughter enrolled at Hagerty High School where Greene was a popular member of the freshman class. “It wasn't even about being popular” Cleveland said. “He just kept a great group of friends.” Around the same time Orr heard from an old friend Kevin O’Sullivan the head baseball coach at the University of Florida where Greene had just committed to play. O’Sullivan gave Orr a scouting report. That combination put Greene on the Tigers’ radar. The Tigers were a .500 team entering the summer of 2018 before fading down the stretch and landing the fifth overall pick in the 2019 Draft. Speculation suggested that Detroit could take a college player with a faster projected path to the big leagues to help jumpstart their rebuild. But the Tigers have never been shy about drafting a high-school player if he’s the right fit. “We watched Riley for a long time” scouting director Scott Pleis said at the time “and the more you watch a player the more you're comfortable with his ability. And then you get to know them as much as you can.”

With Greene the ability and the makeup matched. His two big purchases upon being drafted were a boat to go fishing on the water and a truck to tow it. “He loves to fish” his agent Tripper Johnson said. The day Greene signed he took batting practice at Comerica Park before the Major Leaguers hit the field. Some players curious about the new face of the Tigers’ rebuild sat in the dugout and watched. Among them was Miguel Cabrera. This time Greene did not hesitate to pull. He hit balls onto the Pepsi Porch above the right-field seats. And as he made his way back to the dugout Cabrera was sold. “Leave him here” Cabrera called out.

A FRIENDSHIP OF FUTURE STARS Greene quickly hit his way out of Class A Short Season and finished that summer at High-A West Michigan. He showed enough promise to earn spot appearances in Spring Training games with the Major League club where he made an instant impression. By the midway point of camp Tigers chairman Christopher Ilitch was curious to see him play. Greene’s path was picking up when the COVID-19 pandemic halted Spring Training and scuttled the 2020 Minor League season. Greene joined the big league squad in July for Summer Camp in Detroit where he met 2020 top Draft picks Torkelson and Dillon Dingler. When camp broke they spent the rest of the pandemic-shortened season at the alternate training site in Toledo Ohio. All they had were intrasquad scrimmages against each other. They faced the same pitchers all teammates over and over. When workouts ended they went back to the same place and kept to themselves. Somehow they never got sick of each other. “It’s incredible how easy he was to get along with” Dingler said. “Me him and Spencer got pretty close during that year.” While Greene opened last season at Double-A Erie Torkelson and Dingler started at High-A West Michigan before joining him in June. When Greene and Torkelson were promoted to Triple-A Toledo last summer Greene packed their stuff in his truck and drove it across Ohio. Even when Greene was scratched from the Arizona Fall League last year following a collision in Toledo and Torkelson was later pulled with an ankle injury they hung out at Torkelson’s Arizona home. “We just clicked right away” Greene said.

To hear Greene and Torkelson discuss being roommates was like hearing a sitcom idea. Torkelson tried to help his teammate with a sense of fashion. “We’re getting Riley away from the tennis-shoes-and-jeans look” Torkelson said at the time. “We’re venturing off into bigger and better things in his style.” They have stories about Greene’s superstitions. But they also have stories about Greene’s feats as a player and a person. Then came this past Spring Training. “I mean I hate to bring it up” Dingler said “but he broke his foot on a foul ball against Gerrit Cole in a Spring Training game and then burned the center fielder on the next pitch and then legged out a triple. That tells you what kind of player he is.” “He broke his foot and then hit a standup triple” Torkelson marveled. “That's probably the coolest thing I've seen him do.” How did he do it? “Adrenaline” Torkelson said. “He said he hurt it and it felt like a bruise. Once he got to third and took a couple steps he was like 'Oh wait. It hurts a lot.'” Meadows was sharing a house with Torkelson Greene and others in Spring Training but he was in Minor League camp at the time. “I think it was April Fool's Day that it happened” he said. “I walked into the house and the guys told me and I kind of laughed because I thought they were all joking. Then I walk in his room and he's in a boot. That's just Riley him running out a triple against Gerrit Cole. The guy's just unbelievable.”

WAITING FOR THE CALL As incredible as it was to leg out a triple with a broken foot the attitude Greene took into his first major injury might have topped it. While he hadn’t been told he had made the Tigers’ Opening Day roster the announcement was expected. Torkelson -- who entered the season just ahead of Greene on prospect lists -- was told the next day that he had made the team. Greene’s Major League dream had been deferred but not denied.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL21sYi90aWdlcnMvMjAyMi8wNi8xOC9yaWxleS1ncmVlbmUtcmVhY2hlcy1iYXNlLWZvdXItdGltZXMtZGVidXQtdGlnZXJzLW9mZmVuc2UtYnJlYWtzLW91dC83NjczNDc4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Needed that': Riley Greene reaches four times in debut Tigers finally break out,"Detroit — You can call it the Riley Greene effect if you want the Tigers don’t really care. This was just long overdue.

After a long string of zeros the Tigers finally put some crooked numbers on the scoreboard a lot of them. They scored a season-high 14 runs and ended a six-game losing streak beating the Texas Rangers 14-7 on Saturday before an announced crowd of 28179 at Comerica Park.

""We needed that"" Spencer Torkelson said. ""It's definitely something to build off of. We've been grinding and we've kind of gone through it a little bit. It was nice to see hits fall and runs on the board. But this is only the beginning. We're not satisfied with just the one win.

""We can celebrate this one for an hour or so and move on to tomorrow.""

Greene the Tigers’ top prospect made his MLB debut and dumped an opposite-field single to shallow left field in his first at-bat. He ended up reaching base four times — two opposite-field singles (both off left-handed pitchers) and two walks. He also scored twice.

""When I ran out there to center field I was a little nervous"" Greene said. ""That's going to happen. I just tried to breath through it and it worked. Once I got my first hit I was all good.""

BOX SCORE: Tigers 14 Rangers 7

The last Tigers player to reach base four times in his big-league debut was Scott Livingstone in 1991.

""Just being able to play at the highest level it was awesome"" Greene said. ""And to be here with this team too is really really cool.""

Kids' Day at Comerica Park is typically Sunday but besides Greene rookies Torkelson and Kody Clemens each had two hits. Clemens knocked in two runs his first two in the big leagues.

Torkelson who came in hitting under .200 clubbed a 397-foot triple to left center to trigger a five-run fourth inning.

""We were sitting on the dugout steps and I said to Riley 'Thanks for coming you fixed Tork' "" manager AJ Hinch said laughing.

Of course it could've been the mustache too. Torkelson is in the early stages of growing a mustache.

""I rake with a mustache"" he said laughing. ""I don't think it's the best look but the boys needed something and I'll do anything. I don't care. I'll do anything for a win and some hits.""

It's been a while since the Tigers' clubhouse was that light and lively after a game. They'd scored just one run in the previous 35 innings and had been shut out for the 10th time Friday.

Robbie Grossman set the tone by lining a home run over the fence in left field off Rangers lefty starter Taylor Hearn in the first inning. It was his first home run of the season ending a 190 at-bat drought.

After Eric Haase doubled Javier Báez bashed a hanging slider from Hearn and hit it into the Rangers’ bullpen in left center.

""Finally some good contact"" Báez said. ""But you've got to keep that for every at-bat. I need to have that same feeling with a right-handed pitcher.""

The Tigers hadn’t hit multiple homers in a game since May 29. Báez who now has four homers hadn’t hit one since May 22.

""The entire lineup did something positive today and that was good"" Hinch said. ""We know it's in there. We had it before this year. This wasn't the first breakout game. We've just had long stretches in between. But I am thankful for it.

""These guys needed it. Our staff needed it our fans needed it. We needed a good game. This was a positive sign.""

Haase who has started to swing the bat better this past week had three hits including a three-run homer in the fourth. Grossman had three hits as well. Willi Castro had a triple single and two RBIs. Jonathan Schoop had two hits and an RBI.

Miguel Cabrera had two hits including his 604th career double. That moved him past Cal Ripken Jr. into 16th place all-time.

""It was great to see that"" Báez said. ""We've got a pretty good attitude here. A win like this it opens it up for us to come back tomorrow and do it again and keep it going.""

Greene showed his entire offensive package getting on base four times getting a pair of hits off left-handed pitching grinding out two walks and creating a run with his legs.

He led off the fifth inning with a walk went to second on a single by Torkelson to third on a fly out to right and he scored on a sacrifice fly by Clemens.

""I was just trying to have fun today"" Greene said. ""That's the name of the game in my opinion. Just have fun and everything else will take care of itself. Whether it's a bad day or a good day as long as you're having fun that's all that matters.""

Greene's plate discipline was a welcome sign.

""Yeah I'm more impressed with the walks"" Hinch said. ""The first hit is always memorable and we got the ball for him. The crowd was great even during the introductions. Everyone's been anticipating him coming up. It was really good to see him get that first hit.

""But the quality of at-bats was pretty awesome. It's something we need and one of the reasons we are excited about him.""

Elizabeth Woodruff drained her retirement account and took on three jobs after she and her husband were sued for nearly $10000 by the New York hospital where his infected leg was amputated.

Allyson Ward and her husband loaded up credit cards borrowed from relatives and delayed repaying student loans after the premature birth of their twins left them with $80000 in debt.

Ward a nurse-practitioner took on extra nursing shifts working days and nights.

“I wanted to be a mom” she said. “But we had to have the money.”

The three are among more than 100 million people in America ― including 41% of adults ― beset by a health care system that is systematically pushing patients into debt on a mass scale an investigation by Kaiser Health News and National Public Radio shows.

The investigation reveals a problem that despite new attention from the White House and Congress is far more pervasive than previously reported. That is because much of the debt that patients accrue is hidden as credit card balances loans from family or payment plans to hospitals and other medical providers.

To calculate the true extent of this debt the KHN-NPR investigation draws on a nationwide poll conducted by Kaiser Family Foundation for this project. The poll was designed to capture bills patients couldn’t afford as well as other borrowing used to pay for health care. New analyses by the Urban Institute and other research partners also inform the project.

The picture is bleak.

More than half of U.S. adults report that in the past five years they’ve gone into debt because of medical or dental bills the KFF poll found.

A quarter of adults with health care debt owe more than $5000. And about 1 in 5 with any amount of debt said they don’t expect to ever pay it off.

“Debt is no longer just a bug in our system. It is one of the main products” said Rishi Manchanda a doctor who has worked with low-income patients in California for more than a decade and served on the board of the nonprofit RIP Medical Debt. “We have a health care system almost perfectly designed to create debt.”

The burden is forcing families to cut spending on food and other essentials. Millions are being driven from their homes or into bankruptcy the poll found.

Medical debt is piling hardships on people with cancer and other chronic illnesses. Debt levels in U.S. counties with the highest rates of disease can be three or four times what they are in the healthiest counties according to an Urban Institute analysis.

The debt is deepening racial disparities.

And it is preventing Americans from saving for retirement investing in their children’s educations or buying a home.

Perhaps most perversely medical debt is blocking patients from care.

About 1 in 7 people with debt said they’ve been denied access to a hospital doctor or other provider because of unpaid bills according to the poll. An even greater share ― about two-thirds ― have put off care because of cost.

“It’s barbaric” said Miriam Atkins a Georgia oncologist who like many physicians said she’s had patients give up treatment for fear of debt.

Patient debt is piling up despite the landmark 2010 Affordable Care Act which expanded coverage to tens of millions of Americans but did not slow the rise of high-deductible health plans that leave patients with thousands of dollars in bills.

Now debt from hospitals and other medical providers are pushing millions into credit cards and other loans.

Patient debt also sustains a shadowy collections business fed by hospitals that sell debt to collection companies.

America’s debt crisis is driven by a simple reality: Half of U.S. adults don’t have the cash to cover an unexpected $500 health care bill the KFF poll showed.

Many simply don’t pay. Medical debt is the most common form of debt on consumer credit records. But the medical debt on credit reports represents only a fraction of the money that Americans owe for health care the KHN-NPR investigation shows.

About 50 million adults ― roughly 1 in 5 ― are paying off bills for their own care or a family member’s through an installment plan with a hospital or other provider the KFF poll found. One in 10 owe money to a friend or family member who covered their medical or dental bills another form of borrowing not customarily measured. Still more debt ends up on credit cards as patients charge their bills and run up balances. About 1 in 6 adults are paying off a medical or dental bill they put on a card.

For many Americans debt from medical or dental care may be relatively low. About a third owe less than $1000 the KFF poll found.

But health care debt can be catastrophic.

Sherrie Foy 63 and her husband Michael saw their retirement upended when Foy’s colon had to be removed.

After Michael retired from Consolidated Edison in New York the couple moved to rural Virginia.

Sherrie had the space to care for rescued horses.

The couple had diligently saved and had retiree health insurance. But Sherrie’s surgery led to medical bills that passed the $1 million cap on their health plan.

When Foy couldn’t pay more than $775000 she owed the University of Virginia Health System the couple declared bankruptcy.

The Foys cashed in a life insurance policy and liquidated savings accounts the couple had created for their grandchildren.

“They took everything we had” Foy said. “Now we have nothing.”

About 1 in 8 medically indebted Americans owe $10000 or more the KFF poll said.

Americans have been hit particularly hard by the rise of high-deductible health plans which force people to pay thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before coverage kicks in.

Even Medicare coverage can leave patients on the hook for thousands of dollars studies show.

About a third of seniors have owed money for care the poll found. And 37% of these said they or someone in their household have been forced to cut spending on food clothing or other essentials.

The widespread burden of medical debt has sparked new interest from elected officials including the White House which in April announced new initiatives to crack down on debt collectors and track hospital financial aid.

The changes likely won’t address the root causes of this national crisis. “The No. 1 reason and the No. 2 3 and 4 reasons that people go into medical debt is they don’t have the money” said Alan Cohen a co-founder of insurer Centivo who has worked in health benefits for decades.

Buck the Arizona father who was denied care has seen this firsthand while selling Medicare plans to seniors. “I’ve had old people crying on the phone with me” he said. “It’s horrifying.”

Buck now 30 recovered from the intestinal infection but after being forced to go to a hospital emergency room he was hit with thousands of dollars in medical bills.

Today the Bucks who have three children estimate they owe more than $50000.

“We’ve all had to cut back on everything” Buck said. The kids wear hand-me-downs. They scrimp on school supplies and rely on family for Christmas gifts. “I feel as if I’ve failed as a parent.”

The couple is preparing to file for bankruptcy.

Fortunately as the summer of 2022 arrives the 21st of June filling up the fridge or picnic cooler with the latest collection of beverages is an adventure in flavor starting with three new ""spirited"" drinks from the Coca-Cola Company.

These Are Costco's Most Popular Items Right Now

A Jack and Coke Please

Although this new offering from Coca-Cola is debuting in Mexico first before it heads to the U.S. there is no denying that the contents in the striking black—not red—can are an American original most notably in the South where the drink is known simply as Jack and Coke (or JD and Coke)—the ""Jack"" being Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey.

Announced in early June the combo has all the trappings of a hit in the fast-growing ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktail-in-a-can market. After all separately Jack Daniels and Coke are already best sellers. Plus according to the Lynchburg (TN) Times Jack Daniels's hometown newspaper so is the pairing of Jack and Coke which was voted the No. 1 mix in a survey of the most popular New Year's Eve drinks for ringing in 2022.

Before Jack and Coke came premixed in a can fans followed the classic way to enjoy the refreshing combo: a glass of ice and a shot (or two) of whiskey topped with fizzing sweet Coca-Cola.

Coca-Cola's first canned soda cocktail for the U.S. market it will come in regular Coke and Coke Zero flavors. The alcohol content is 5% by volume which is equal to most bottled beers.

Hmm Maybe a Spiked Lemonade

If whiskey's not your thing how about cooling down on a summer afternoon with a tangy lemonade that delivers a punch—something like Simply Spiked Coca-Cola's new alcohol-infused twist on its best-selling line of Simply fruit juices.

Scheduled to hit the shelves this summer Simply Spiked is Coca-Cola's second deal with MolsonCoors. Last year the two teamed up on the launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer.

Next to its line of colas Simply is Coca-Cola's second-largest brand by revenue according to the company sold in single 24-ounce cans and 12-can variety packs. The newly fortified Simply will be available in lemonade strawberry lemonade watermelon lemonade and blueberry lemonade flavors. A 12-ounce can contains 5% alcohol by volume and 170 calories.

Wait How About a Cocktail with a Splash of Fresca?

Earlier this year Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands a brewing company that includes the Corona beer family announced the upcoming release of Fresca canned cocktails.

It is a natural pairing: like Coke with Jack Fresca has long been used as a mixer by design. Introduced in the late 1960s Fresca was ""positioned both as a mixer and a refreshing sparkling beverage as an alternative to bottled waters and seltzers"" according to Coca-Cola.

The new offering is called Fresca Mixed and boasts no calories and zero sugar. To date there is no word on the flavors of the newly fortified Fresca—Spanish for ""fresh""—but the cocktails will be ""using real spirits"" and the flavors ""will be inspired by recipes created by [Fresca] fans from around the globe"" according to a press release from Constellation Brands.

The Fresca products will be produced marketed and distributed through Constellation. ""One of the core tenets of our innovation strategy is a belief in the power of extending strong and trusted brands in thoughtful ways to bring to market unique products that resonate with consumers"" said Mallika Monteiro Constellation's chief growth strategy and digital officer.

'Tis the Season of Bubbly Pineapples

Trader Joe's is celebrating summertime with the release of its new Sparkling Pineapple Juice. Get it now—as a seasonal treat it will disappear from the shelves come September.

Made from real pineapple juice not concentrate the sparkling beverage contains no added sugars and only four ingredients: pineapple juice water carbon dioxide (it makes the bubbles) and ascorbic acid (which maintains color) according to Trader Joe's.

The signature flair of the pineapple drink is the ""ultra-fizzy"" bubbles says Trader Joe's which adds in its own signature style ""this bold beverage sips like a sparkling pineapple daydream on a tropical summer's day.""

For Whom the Bellini Tolls

PepsiCo is reviving if not the spirit at least the memory of a cocktail made famous by Ernest Hemingway. Called the Bellini the original is a mixture of Prosecco Italy's version of Champagne with white peach juice and purée. Created and served at Harry's Bar along the Grand Canal in Venice Italy Hemingway would drop by for a Bellini to sip while he wrote.

The main difference between the real Bellini and PepsiCo's aside from the view and the literary company is that PepsiCo's version is not alcoholic. It's a sparkling water called Bellini Bliss Bubly with no calories no sweeteners no artificial colors.

PepsiCo's ""first-ever mocktail"" the Bellini Bliss is flavored with mango peach and pineapple. Bellini Bliss Bubly will be available for 10 weeks this summer from June 13 to August 19 in stores nationwide and online in exclusive variety packs.

(courtesy: Pixar)

Cast: Chris Evans James Broli Efren Ramirez Isiah Whitlock Jr Taika Waititi Uzo Aduba Tim Peake and Bill Hader

Director: Angus MacLane

Rating: Two and a half stars (out of 5)

Fun while it lasts but disappointingly predictable for the most part Lightyear makes no effort to break away the familiar Disney constellation and reach for new dimensions

The movie stays largely within the broad Pixar spectrum give or take a handful of surprises and at least one memorable addition a robotic cat that steals the show as the titular character's all-weather companion and is certain to unleash a merchandising frenzy that could rival the one that followed the release of Toy Story in 1995.

Directed by Angus MacLane (also the writer of the screenplay with Jason Headley) Lightyear is supposedly a Toy Story spin-off. It actually has little to do with the universe that Andy Davis inhabited. Lightyear is as a title card tells us upfront a 1995 movie that introduced Andy to the cocky space ranger and led to his receiving the astronaut toy as a birthday gift.

Fabulous computer animation is the least that one expects in a Pixar movie. The voice cast too is as formidable as ever with Chris Evans doing well enough as Buzz Lightyear's voice for us not to miss Tim Allen. And the plot is familiar enough to instantly let the audiences warm to the intergalactic adventures of the hero and his mates.

Lightyear isn't actually building upon story that has been told before. It creates its own universe and throws in a fresh bunch of supporting characters. The screenwriters are therefore free to give full rein to their imagination and not get bogged down by small matters like continuity and cross-referencing

The traits that define the character of Buzz Lightyear do however recall his obdurate streak as the reason why he often leaps before he thinks and gets into situations that boomerang.

The story is narrated primarily in the form of a ""mission log"" that Lightyear records before during and after the key events in his mission to find a way out of the planet that he is stranded on. That plot device imparts a sense of immediacy and subjectivity to the story. The perspective is Buzz Lightyear's but because it takes a wide sweep of encounters and exigencies into its embrace it is never limiting.

But does that create a launchpad for a soaring dizzying sci-fi ride? Not really but Lightyear has all the trappings of an uncluttered crowd-pleaser if the crowd in question is about Andy's age either physically or at heart. The movie has its share of eye-popping action riding on space vessels robots and space ranger exploits a fair sprinkling of humour and a few delicate moments that tug at the heartstrings.

The most notable among the last-mentioned narrative component has Buzz Lightyear's commander and best friend Alisha Hawthorne (Voice of Uzo Aduba) leave a message for her always-absent mate who watches it long after she has passed on. Buzz has missed many of the landmarks of Alisha's life because of his unrelenting and unsuccessful forays in quest of hyperspace fuel to propel the spaceship that will take him home.

Because of ""time dilation"" four years elapse on T'kana Prime after every hyperspace fuel test that Buzz attempts. That means he isn't around when the planet and those that live on it leap forward chronologically and undergo major changes.

So what we have here is a classic Disney hero. He overreaches and falters and then repents his actions and seeks redemption. There are to boot rookies who have a thing or two to prove and a villain whose back story is as much about the past as about the future.

Lightyear kicks off on a planet that seems habitable. It turns out that it is swarming with hostile lifeforms - sentient killer foliage and exceedingly aggressive bugs among other dangers - that can make survival extremely difficult.

Lightyear Hawthorne and the rookie Featheringhanstan (Bill Hader) retreat to their ship which is soon grounded because Buzz flies into a rockface in attempt to escape from the planet. From here on Captain Lightyear has his job cut out: having got the crew into big trouble he takes it upon himself to be their saviour. His acts of heroism stem more from desperation than well chalked out strategies and result in more setbacks.

Sox the robotic feline upstages everyone else in Lightyear and that at times includes Buzz himself. Created to be Lightyear's companion and assistant Sox is a troubleshooter extraordinaire a lovable creature whose survival instincts are put to the test in one highly hazardous outer-space situation that is bound to elicit gasps of shock from the audience. But at all other times Sox is the one in control even as the others grope for answers.

The others include Mo Morrison (voice of Taika Waititi) a new clueless recruit whose pen gets more play than it deserves and Darby Steele (Dale Soules) an elderly convict on parole. The two do get their place under the stars but never have the kind of space that Sox has.

It is a completely different story for Izzy (the voice of Keke Palmer conveys both resolve and vulnerability) who must surmount her fear of space and be of assistance to Buzz Lightyear as the latter battles life-threatening challenges thrown at him by Emperor Zurg (James Brolin). More important she has the Hawthorne legacy to worry about and that keeps Izzy on her toes.

The cause of diversity is obviously well served by Alisha Hawthorne. She is Black and so obviously is her granddaughter Izzy. It is rare for a spaceman even less a spacewoman to be African American despite what Hidden Figures (2016) revealed to the world.

Lightyear as the whole world knows by now also slips in a same-sex kiss. Though the lip lock is no more than a mere flash it is a Pixar breakthrough that will go down in history. It is another matter that the movie itself consistently diverting but a touch antiquated in terms of what it crams into the plot isn't a departure from norm in most other respects.

Lightyear is content to play out within a limited bandwidth and therefore fails to soar in the direction of exciting new frontiers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2dlbnNoaW4taW1wYWN0LW5vZWxsZS1jb25zdGVsbGF0aW9ucy1ndWlkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Genshin Impact Noelle Constellations Guide,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2dlbnNoaW4taW1wYWN0LW5vZWxsZS1jb25zdGVsbGF0aW9ucy1ndWlkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Hamilton Bermuda (June 19 2022) – Jason Carroll (New York City) stood on the dock at Royal Bermuda Yacht Club well after midnight looking fatigued yet energized after winning line honors in the 52nd Newport Bermuda Race.

Carroll and his crew on the MOD70 trimaran Argo set an elapsed-time record time of 33 hours—faster than any elapsed time ever recorded in the 116-year history of the Bermuda Race—covering the 635-nautical mile course at an average speed of 19.24 knots. But it wasn’t without some pain.

“The forecast under-appreciated just how rough the sea state was” said the 44-year-old Carroll. Later he added “The whole crew is wiped out. We’re tired.”

Tired perhaps but also happy to set another course record—Argo’s sixth to go with two world records—and relieved that they made it to shore in one piece. They were the first Saturday-night finishers in the history of the storied race co-organized by the Cruising Club of America and the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club.

“We’re thrilled about the record” said Chad Corning (New Rochelle New York) the program’s manager. “There are only so many major ocean races…to have the Bermuda Race the Middle Sea Race and the Caribbean 600 means a lot to us. And it’s great to be the only boat to finish on Saturday. The Bermuda Race has so much history this record is probably the most significant one for us because it is such a well-established race. It’s a great feeling.”

Carroll’s international crew aboard Argo included Westy Barlow (Newport Rhode Island) Corning Pete Cumming (Warsash England) Thierry Fouchier (Marseille France) boat captain Chris Maxted (Melbourne Australia) Charlie Ogletree (Seabrook Texas) and Alister Richardson (Bournemouth England).

Balrow replaced navigator/sailing master Brian Thompson (Cowes England) who tested positive for COVID before the race and did not sail. Corning filled in as navigator.



“On paper it was very much a rhumbline race” said Corning. “We ended up to west of rhumb because we had to sail high to keep the boat under control. If we bore away we’d have sped up too much. We were trying to keep the speed around 20 knots. So we were keeping a higher course to keep the boat slow that’s why we weren’t on rhumbline.”

After starting the race with a full main and J1 headsail clearing the committee boat within mere feet Carroll said that it didn’t take long for the crew to start depowering.

“We spent a lot of time throttled back making sure we wouldn’t have a problem. It was quite rough for us in the middle of the race” Carroll said. “About three hours into the race we were down to two reefs and the J2. Ten hours in we had the J3. We made a whole bunch of steps down in first few hours as we got offshore.”

Corning echoed Carroll in saying that it was a rough race mostly due to the sea state.

“We were expecting a sea state of 2 to 2.5 meters but in general it was 3.5 to 4 meters” said Corning. “The Gulf Stream was a bit smoother because the current direction was more or less aligned with the wind direction. We had 25-30 knots of wind for most of the race and the high was mid-30s at times. We were really just hanging on.”

Corning said that they transited the Gulf Stream at about 90 degrees and saw a 4-knot current flowing west to east but they were in and out of it quickly. They sailed the meat of the course with two reefs and a storm jib for about 21 hours from Friday evening until Saturday afternoon (June 17-18).

“It was some of roughest conditions we’ve had on the boat” Corning said. “The sea state was just nasty coming from all different directions. You never knew where the waves were coming from and they would hit the boat at all different angles. You had to crawl around the cockpit to get anywhere. It was a very violent motion a lot of the guys got sick.”

Mālama Second to Finish

At 07:48:43 ADT this morning almost eight and a half hours after Argo finished skipper Charlie Enright (Barrington Rhode Island) guided the IMOCA 60 Mālama from 11th Hour Racing across the finish line. Mālama like Argo a foil-assisted craft completed the course in 41h:28m:48s at an average speed of 15.3 knots.

While Argo’s elapsed time is the fastest in the history of the race Mālama’s is the fourth fastest. The two foilers bookend the 100-foot Comanche’s 34h:49m mark in 2016 and the 90-foot Rambler 90’s 39h:39m time in 2012.

Enright said that Mālama experienced winds up to 35 knots and never sailed lower than 70 degrees to the wind. “It was pretty impressive” he said “sailing with cracked sheets upwind doing 18 knots.

Enright noted how the team had to overcome issues that cropped up with electronics and rigging with the focus otherwise on safety. “In those conditions we try not to come out of the water [on the foils]; we’re trying to displace as much of the boat as possible. We can control how much we come out by adjusting the rake of the foil and the extension of the foil.”

Gibbs Hill St. David’s Leaders Approach Island

With the foilers safely moored in Bermuda the focus is now on to be the elapsed-time winner of the race’s major divisions. At 1300 ADT today there is a battle royale taking place.

The leading boats in the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse Division included Christopher Sheehan’s Pac52 Warrior Won the Mills 68 Prospector owned by Lawrence Landry Paul McDowell and Martin Roesch and the TP52 Hooligan owned by John Evans and John Sheehan.

In the St. David’s Lighthouse Division Kate and Jim Murray’s Pac52 Callisto from the U.K. is leading the Reichel/Pugh 74 Wizard chartered by Fred Detwiler and Bruce Aikens.

All of those boats are racing within proximity of each other to the west of rhumbline. The forecast is predicting lighter winds throughout the afternoon so the first finisher likely won’t cross the line until early tomorrow morning.

Casualty on the course

The crew of the yacht Morgan of Marietta a Centurion 42 reported that owner/skipper Colin Golder (New Providence NJ) went overboard early this afternoon in strong winds approximately 325 miles from Bermuda and did not survive. After extended effort Golder’s body was recovered by the vessel’s crew and the vessel is returning to the mainland. Next of kin has been informed.

Event information – Race details – Entry list – Tracker

The 52nd running of the Newport Bermuda Race co-organized by the Cruising Club of America (CCA) and the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club (RBYC) began Friday June 17 2022 at the entrance to the East Passage of Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay.

Special to The Daily News

HAMILTON Bermuda — Jason Carroll of New York City and the crew of the MOD70 Argo outran every elapsed-time record associated with the Newport Bermuda Race when they completed the 52nd edition Saturday night local time.

Argo’s elapsed time of 33 hours 0 minutes 9 seconds is more than 30 hours faster than Carroll’s Gunboat 62 Elvis set in the first multihull division in the 2018 Bermuda Race. It is also 1:42:42 faster than the 100-foot monohull Comanche’s Open Division mark of 34:42:53 set in the 2016 race.

And it’s more than 6½ hours faster than Rambler 90’s mark of 39 hours 39 minutes which earned owner George David the Schooner Mistress Trophy in 2012 for fastest elapsed time by a monohull in the race's four major divisions.

Argo is the first-ever Saturday night finisher in the history of the storied Bermuda Race co-organized by the Cruising Club of America and the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club.

Owner/skipper Carroll’s international crew aboard Argo included Chad Corning (New Rochelle New York) Pete Cumming (Warsash England) Thierry Fouchier (Marseille France) boat captain Chris Maxted (Melbourne Australia) Charlie Ogletree (Seabrook Texas) Alister Richardson (Bournemouth England) and navigator/sailing master Brian Thompson (Cowes England).

More:The 52nd Newport Bermuda Race begins Friday. Here's what to know and how to watch.

“This crew has been on the boat a lot. We’ve all worked together for a lot of years” said Corning the 50-year-old crewman and program manager in a pre-race interview. “For the shorter 600-mile races we like to sail with eight. It just makes sail handling that much easier.""

Argo averaged 19.24 knots in setting the multihull course record and sailed approximately 486 nautical miles in the 24 hours after the start. Argo sailed mainly to the west of rhumbline and took advantage of a meander in the Gulf Stream that gave it a favorable boost towards Bermuda.

Argo started the Bermuda Race on Friday. Watching the boat do its pre-race preps one could see the mast canted heavily to starboard indicating the crew knew it would be a starboard tack slog until they got within sight of Bermuda. The only two maneuvers were a tack to port and one back to starboard to the finish line off St. David’s Lighthouse in the final 10 miles of the course.

In April Argo set a record from Antigua to Newport of 3 days 15 minutes shaving 5½ hours off the previous mark set by sistership Phaedo. The Bermuda Race record is the sixth course record to go with two world records that Argo has set since Carroll purchased the foil-assisted trimaran in 2018.

Argo’s preparations for the Bermuda Race included fitting a new rudder to replace one that was broken in April during training in Antigua prior to the record run to Newport.

“We toasted the V2 rudder and replaced it with one of our first version rudders for the record run” said Corning. “We’ve got two generations of foils and rudders and the new rudder is a direct replacement of the first V2 rudder.

“Argo is as good as a MOD70 can be” he continued. “The only development we’re considering is a switch to flip-up rudders instead of being destroyed. Things break when we hit things and that’s a problem. In terms of how the foils and rudders work together it’s as good as can get across the range. The underpinnings of the V2 foils and rudders are from our capsize in 2019. We wanted a safer boat. The boat’s a bit faster in some conditions but better overall because it’s safer and more under control.”

More under control likely means many more records for Carroll and the Argo crew in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYmVybmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi9hcmdvLWNyZXctcmVmbGVjdC1vbi1yZWNvcmQtYnJlYWtpbmctcnVuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Argo Crew Reflect On Record Breaking Run,"Jason Carroll stood on the dock at Royal Bermuda Yacht Club well after midnight looking fatigued yet energized after winning line honors in the 52nd Newport Bermuda Race.

Carroll and his crew on the MOD70 trimaran Argo set an elapsed-time record time of 33 hours—faster than any elapsed time ever recorded in the 116-year history of the Bermuda Race—covering the 635-nautical mile course at an average speed of 19.24 knots. But it wasn’t without some pain.

The forecast under-appreciated just how rough the sea state was” said the 44-year-old Carroll. Later he added “The whole crew is wiped out. We’re tired.”

Tired perhaps but also happy to set another course record—Argo’s sixth to go with two world records. They were the first Saturday-night finishers in the history of the storied race co-organized by the Cruising Club of America and the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club.

“We’re thrilled about the record” said Chad Corning the program’s manager. “There are only so many major ocean races…to have the Bermuda Race the Middle Sea Race and the Caribbean 600 means a lot to us. And it’s great to be the only boat to finish on Saturday. The Bermuda Race has so much history this record is probably the most significant one for us because it is such a well-established race. It’s a great feeling.”

Carroll’s international crew aboard Argo included Westy Barlow [Newport Rhode Island] Corning Pete Cumming [Warsash England] Thierry Fouchier [Marseille France] boat captain Chris Maxted [Melbourne Australia] Charlie Ogletree [Seabrook Texas] and Alister Richardson [Bournemouth England].

It was previously reported that navigator and sailing master Brian Thompson [Cowes England] was part of the crew but he tested positive for COVID before the race and did not sail. He was replaced in the crew by Barlow and Corning filled in as navigator.

“On paper it was very much a rhumbline race” said Corning. “We ended up to west of rhumb because we had to sail high to keep the boat under control. If we bore away we’d have sped up too much. We were trying to keep the speed around 20 knots. So we were keeping a higher course to keep the boat slow that’s why we weren’t on rhumbline.”

“After starting the race with a full main and J1 headsail clearing the committee boat within mere feet Carroll said that it didn’t take long for the crew to start depowering.

“We spent a lot of time throttled back making sure we wouldn’t have a problem. It was quite rough for us in the middle of the race” Carroll said. “About three hours into the race we were down to two reefs and the J2. Ten hours in we had the J3. We made a whole bunch of steps down in first few hours as we got offshore.”

Corning echoed Carroll in saying that it was a rough race mostly due to the sea state.

“We were expecting a sea state of 2 to 2.5 meters but in general it was 3.5 to 4 meters” said Corning. “The Gulf Stream was a bit smoother because the current direction was more or less aligned with the wind direction. We had 25-30 knots of wind for most of the race and the high was mid-30’s at times. We were really just hanging on.”

Corning said that they transited the Gulf Stream at about 90 degrees and saw a 4-knot current flowing west to east but they were in and out of it quickly. They sailed the meat of the course with two reefs and a storm jib for about 21 hours from Friday evening until Saturday afternoon.

“It was some of roughest conditions we’ve had on the boat” Corning said. “The sea state was just nasty coming from all different directions. You never knew where the waves were coming from and they would hit the boat at all different angles. You had to crawl around the cockpit to get anywhere. It was a very violent motion a lot of the guys got sick.”

Initially the video reported that the photo—capturing Song Kang and Han So Hee in casual outfits—surfaced on an Instagram feed allegedly belonging to Song Kang’s sasaeng fan. While the two people in the photo are masked and hence nearly impossible to recognize the said Instagram account shared the photo with hashtags #SongKang and #HanSoHee and re-sparked the dating rumor between these Nevertheless co-stars.

Fueled by the chemistry they had on the set of Nevertheless Song Kang and Han So Hee have been embroiled in dating rumors since 2021. With the photo surfacing Koreans began wondering about their relationship. Some Korean media outlets even reported on it—though pointing out that neither party has commented on the rumor.

Later on June 19 (KST) Han So Hee’s My Name co-star Moon Sang Min addressed the photo being circulated and clarified that the photo is from a “My Name get-together.”

Carson Woolwine (left) to the practice of Dr. David Scamard (right) at Excellence in Eye Care at Costco means more hours and appointments for customers looking for great optometry service. (Photo: Charmaine George)

As life gets back to a more normal routine as the Covid-19 pandemic finally fades independent Doctor of Optometry David Scamard O.D. is pleased that his Excellence In Eye Care is growing. More and more patients are discovering and appreciating both his office’s convenience and well excellence.

Five years ago Dr. Scamard moved his Excellence In Eye Care LLC to inside the Costco next to the Tampa Premium Outlets on S.R. 56. Prior to that his office was located a couple of miles west off of S.R. 54 in Lutz.

Now J. Carson Woolwine O.D. — a 2016 graduate of Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry — has joined Dr. Scamard at the practice.

The addition of Dr. Woolwine has led to expanded availability for appointments. Excellence in Eye Care is now open six days a week where it previously was open only five.

A second exam room also was outfitted so that two patients can be seen simultaneously. Both exam rooms offer top-of-the-line equipment with state-of-the-art technology.

Offering the latest technology has always been important to Dr. Scamard. He and Dr. Woolwine use a high-tech retinal imager to view the internal structures of the eyes. They also use a digital refractor which is faster more accurate and more efficient than the old-style refracting devices. Many patients also like the digital refractor because they don’t usually have to have their eyes dilated.

All of the equipment is electronic and controlled by a computer. It ties in with the practice’s electronic medical records too for a streamlined and convenient patient experience.

Costco shoppers have gotten used to seeing Dr. Scamard over the last five years but many of his patients have known him much longer. He opened his first private practice on Bruce B. Downs Blvd. in New Tampa in 2002 and has taken care of patients in New Tampa Wesley Chapel Lutz and Land O’Lakes ever since.

Dr. Scamard earned his undergraduate degree at the University of South Florida in Tampa and received his O.D. degree from Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale.

The combination of his decades of experience and commitment to keeping his practice on the cutting edge of eye care technology has allowed Dr. Scamard to help some patients when others couldn’t.

Mike Roth says he was born with an incurable virus in his right eye but for most of the 29 years of his life it didn’t really bother him. That all changed last year when he started having trouble with his left eye.

He went to his ophthalmologist who couldn’t figure out the problem and sent him to a specialist. The specialist then sent him to another specialist who sent him to an eye institute in Miami.

Fortunately for Mike he happened to be playing ultimate Frisbee with a teammate whose wife worked for Dr. Scamard. She told the doctor about Mike’s frustrating issue and Dr. Scamard offered to take a look.

Although Mike did also see the specialist in Miami he visited Dr. Scamard too and both doctors came to the same conclusion.

“It turns out the virus had switched eyes and began to attack the optic nerve in the other eye” Mike explains. Eventually his retina detached causing blindness and he had to have surgery to repair it. The surgeon suggested he be fitted for contacts which was basically a lifelong dream come true for Mike.

“I’ve worn glasses every day since I was five years old and no one would fit me for contacts because they weren’t sure how the virus would react” says Mike. But Dr. Scamard said he was a good candidate for contacts and was willing to help him. “That was something I was crazy excited for.”

Mike had his surgery a little over a year ago and has now been wearing contact lenses without any problems for eight months.

“My experience (with Excellence in Eye Care) has been nothing short of incredible” Mike says explaining that Dr. Scamard found answers for him when many other doctors gave up. He also truly cared about Mike’s situation and his well-being. “Dr. Scamard has personally reached out to me a couple of times just to see how things are going.”

Scamard explains that he is able to help people like Mike — and many others — because he and Dr. Woolwine offer the latest innovations in contact lenses.

“There’s even a contact now that helps prevent bacterial growth which makes it healthier for the eye” Dr. Scamard explains. “There has been a constant improvement in the technology and materials we have to work with.”

The entire process from eye exam to putting the glasses on your face or contacts in your eyes can be completed right there in Costco. You don’t need to be a Costco member to visit Excellence in Eyecare and have an exam but you do need a membership to purchase your glasses and contact lenses from the wholesale giant’s extensive eyewear department located right next to the office.

Get Those Eyes Examined!

Excellence In Eye Care currently is seeing many patients who have missed their annual eye exams due to the pandemic. Dr. Scamard encourages everyone who hasn’t had their eyes checked lately to make an appointment.

“The health of your eyes is very important” he says “and we of course practice all the guidelines for protection to make sure our patients are safe and we’re safe too.”

So whether you’re in need of an annual eye exam or your first exam in a long time Dr. Scamard and Dr. Woolwine invite you to visit their convenient location for top-notch care.

“We always strive to make all of our patients happy and make the experience as pleasant as possible” says Dr. Scamard. “We make sure their eyes are healthy and that they can see their best.”

Excellence In Eye Care is located inside the Costco at 2225 Grand Cypress Dr. on the south side of S.R. 56. The office is open Mondays Wednesday and Fridays from 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1 p.m.–7 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m.–2 p.m. For more information call (813) 279-7038 or visit ExcellenceInEyeCare.net.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9zaG9wcGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L29wZW4tY2xvc2VkLWp1bmV0ZWVudGgtY29zdGNvLW5pa2UvNzY2MDgzMTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Costco Walmart open on Juneteenth?

SEATTLE Washington––Costco Wholesale Corporation better known as just Costco in 2016 introduced a novel strategy to wring profits out of the necks of chickens.

Now Legal Impact for Chickens a recently formed San Francisco-based nonprofit is pursuing a novel legal strategy to try to stop or at least mitigate the Costco practices.

Costco meanwhile appears to be “playing chicken” with a variety of threats ranging from shareholder dissatisfaction with the use of $4.99 rotisserie chickens as a “loss leader” to entice customers at increasing economic cost to the risk of avian influenza wiping out the whole Costco corporate strategy.

“Do the right thing”

Lawsuits and other pressure tactics applied by a range of animal advocacy labor and environmental organizations may be the least of current Costco corporate concerns but the public credibility of the Costco motto “Do the right thing” may be in trouble.

Right now the allure to average customers of $4.99 rotisserie chickens appears to be sufficient to keep Costco profits near an all-time high. But if for any reason those chickens become unavailable in sufficient volume to meet demand or the price goes up to $5.99 or higher Costco may discover that putting all of its chickens into underpriced plastic boxes was not the great longterm business plan most of the corporate board of directors thought it was.

That is when customers might start going down the street to closest rivals Walmart and Whole Foods Market instead whose practices may be little better for the chickens involved but keep the consequences of exploitive corporate behavior farther from coming home to roost.

“The farmers are not responsible”

Legal Impact for Chickens is hardly the first animal advocacy group to challenge Costco.

The Humane League Mercy for Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals among others have already buzzed Costco in recent years.

Mercy for Animals hit particularly hard in February 2021 with undercover video of cruel and gruesome practices on farms working under contract to Costco and the Costco subsidiary Lincoln Premium Poultry formed in 2016 to ensure Costco a steady supply of $4.99 rotisserie chickens.

The Mercy for Animals video clips were broadcast without specific identification of the farms involved because explained Mercy for Animals’ executive director Leah Garcés “The farmers are not responsible in the sense that they are not dictating the type of breeds they are not dictating the space etcetera. This is all being dictated by Costco. Ultimately we are asking people to hold Costco accountable.”

“Law compliance comes ahead of profit-seeking”

Holding the Costco board of directors responsible is the direct aim of the Legal Impact for Chickens lawsuit based on a legal theory propounded by Leo E. Strine chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court from 2014 to 2019.

Wrote Strine in a 2010 article entitled Loyalty’s Core Demand: The Defining Role of Good Faith in Corporation Law:

“For a corporate director knowingly to cause the corporation to engage in unlawful acts or activities or enter an unlawful business is disloyal in the most fundamental of senses.

“A publicly chartered corporation becomes a legal citizen imbued with rights and responsibilities. When directors knowingly cause the corporation to do what it may not—engage in unlawful acts or unlawful businesses—they are disloyal to the corporation’s essential nature.

“Law compliance thus comes ahead of profit-seeking as a matter of the corporation’s mission” Strine emphasized “and directors owe a duty of loyalty to that hierarchy.”

Washington vs. Nebraska & Iowa

In the Legal Impact for Chickens case Costco shareholders Krystil Smith and Tyler Lobdell acting “derivatively on behalf of Costco Wholesale Corporation” are suing the 17 Costco directors and the Costco Wholesale Corporation itself.

Smith a Costco stockholder since 2020 and Lobdell a Costco stockholder since 2016 ask the Superior Court of the State of Washington King County/Seattle division to declare that “Costco’s poultry production practices violate the laws of Iowa and Nebraska finding the Individual Defendants liable for breaching their fiduciary duty to act lawfully which they owe to Costco” and finding “the Director Defendants liable for breaching their fiduciary duty of loyalty to Costco.”

Further Smith and Lobdell ask the court to order the defendants “to ensure that henceforth all applicable laws and regulations regarding the treatment of animals (including the Iowa and Nebraska laws detailed herein) are followed; permanently enjoining the Individual Defendants and their successors agents representatives employees and any party acting in concert with them from engaging in conduct that causes Costco to violate Nebraska’s animal neglect laws;” with an identical enjoinment from “engaging in conduct that causes Costco to violate Iowa’s animal neglect laws.”

Seeking right to do surprise inspections

The individual defendants would be ordered “to take on behalf of Costco all necessary actions to reform and improve Costco’s policies procedures and practices to comply with applicable laws” and to allow Smith Lobdell “and each of their chosen representatives to conduct random and unannounced inspection of any property where Costco’s birds are kept to ensure compliance with this Court’s orders.”

Persuading the Superior Court of the State of Washington King County/Seattle division to do any such thing will require Bellingham Washington animal rights attorney Adam Karp representing plaintiffs Smith and Lobdell to clear several high legal hurdles.

Karp in effect is asking a lower court in Washington to both interpret and enforce state laws in Nebraska and Iowa which the courts of Nebraska and Iowa have so far not enforced either against Costco and Lincoln Premium Poultry or any other major agricultural producer.

Precedent suggests that even though Costco and almost all of the Costco directors reside within King County the King County court will find that the initial complaints about cruelty and neglect should be brought in Nebraska and Iowa where agricultural producers enjoy broad exemptions from cruelty and neglect laws.

Precedent also suggests that any case involving multi-state issues is likely to end up in federal court.

RICO case?

There are established legal mechanisms for pursuing cases in federal court in which a corporate entity allegedly pursues criminal activities in a jurisdiction where the local authorities are unwilling or unable to enforce laws. The 1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act better known as the RICO Act is probably the best known such mechanism; others exist in civil rights law.

The Legal Impact for Chickens case against Costco is structured somewhat like a RICO Act case but differs both in being pursued as an action among shareholders internal to the company and in having been filed at the state level making no allegations pertaining directly to interstate commerce.

The language of the case however spells out allegations against Costco which might stick in the “court of public opinion” even if not advancing in a court of law.

Loss leader

Explains the pleading “A widely-known and prominent feature of Costco’s business model is to use low-priced rotisserie chickens as a loss leader to lure foot traffic to its store. Public reports show this loss-leader strategy resulted in 106 million rotisserie chickens sold” in 2021 up from 64 million sold five years earlier in 2016.

“To execute this prominent feature of its business model and hold firm on the $4.99 price its rotisserie chickens have been sold at for over a decade despite rapidly rising input costs and general inflation” the lawsuit charges “Costco set up a vertically integrated poultry production business to supply itself with a large quantity of cheap chicken meat.”

In that connection the case contends “Costco’s directors and officers have violated their fiduciary duty by knowingly causing Costco to neglect and abandon chickens in violation of state laws” as “an integral part” of the Costco “poultry production strategy.”

“Illegal in Nebraska and Iowa”?

Like other major poultry producers “Costco knowingly propagates chickens bred to grow so fast that many of them cannot stand under their own weight” Legal Impact for Chickens alleges.

“Costco then sends millions of these fast-growing birds to dirty crowded factory farms where “disabled birds slowly die from hunger thirst injury and illness” the lawsuit summarizes.

“Despite Costco’s directors’ and officers’ knowledge of the Company’s illegal animal neglect and abandonment the directors and officers have caused and allowed Costco to continue its current treatment of chickens in violation of their fiduciary duties.”

Asserts the lawsuit “Costco’s practices—which cause birds to suffer and die without proper care—are illegal in Nebraska and Iowa” though Nebraska and Iowa courts have yet to so rule.

Corporate sharecropping

The part of the Legal Impact for Chickens lawsuit that may be most damaging to Costco is a succinct summary of business practices that appear to amount to corporate sharecropping:

“Costco working through Lincoln Premium Poultry encourages its growers to sign 15-year contracts. The factory farms and equipment within them are built according to Costco’s specifications. As a result as a practical matter it would be nearly impossible for a contract grower to profitably repurpose his or her barn should the grower end his or her relationship with Costco.

“Costco’s recruits typically must take out large loans in order to finance the building of the new factory farms according to Costco’s specifications.

“As a result of the debt growers must take on the fifteen-year contracts they sign the fact that they end up with expensive factory farms which are hard to profitably repurpose and the fact that the contract growers often have no prior chicken growing experience the contract growers are vulnerable to Costco’s decision making and virtually incapable of ending their relationship with Costco.”

360000 chickens at a time

In consequence of all of this the lawsuit details “A single grower may have as many as 360000 chickens at a time. Given these birds’ health problems” plus “the immense financial pressure placed on contract growers it is essentially impossible for a single Costco contract grower to take proper care of 360000 birds—many of whom are severely injured or wounded. Costco is aware of this impossibility.

“By leaving tens of thousands of its birds at a given contract-grower factory farm in Nebraska or Iowa where Costco knows the birds will not receive adequate care Costco is both abandoning and neglecting its birds in violation of the law.”

This contention may be difficult to prove in a Washington court let alone to the satisfaction of a Nebraska Iowa or federal court.

National Chicken Council

On the other hand according to a 2021 Costco Wholesale Statement Regarding Broiler Welfare “With respect to our dedicated suppliers: all broilers are raised uncaged in barns where they are free to move about without restriction. The minimum standards followed in these barns are based on those developed by the National Chicken Council” which “represents companies that account for approximately 95% of broiler chicken production in the United States. For our dedicated suppliers” Costco said “compliance with National Chicken Council standards is tested by third-party auditors who are independent of Costco and the producers.”

However contends the Legal Impact for Chickens case “Even the National Chicken Council has sought to distance itself from the description of Costco’s chicken neglect” published on February 6 2021 by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof based on the Mercy for Animals video.

“The National Chicken Council responded by saying ‘[t]he conditions described in the article are not an accurate representation of the health and welfare of today’s broiler chickens.’

“Contrast this” the lawsuit says “with Costco’s response to the undercover investigation which stated that much of the investigation footage simply depicts ‘normal and uneventful activity.’”

Antibiotic use

Even if the Legal Impact for Chickens case is quickly dismissed shareholder activism has reportedly changed Costco corporate practice at least once before.

“As the biggest competitor with Whole Foods selling $4 billion in organic foods Costco has been wooing shoppers who care about the source of their food for years” recounted Civil Eats on December 11 2018. “In fact the company just announced that it would tighten its standards around antibiotic use in all the meat it supplies thanks in part to an ongoing effort by shareholder activists.”

On the other hand a Civil Eats update mentioned that “In September 2019 a coalition of 10 local groups called calling for a moratorium on ‘concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and the extreme vertical integration of animal agriculture’” in direct opposition to Costco expansion plans in Nebraska.

Instead of complying Felix Behr of Mashed.com reported on February 22 2021 the Costco subsidiary Lincoln Premium Poultry “expanded its workforce from 600 to over 1100” while “Local contractors tasked with raising the chickens built 440 out of 520 [planned] barns.”

H5N1 is biggest threat to Costco

Meanwhile the most imminent threat to the Costco business model centering on $4.99 rotisserie chickens remains the H5N1 avian influenza. Both Iowa and Nebraska experienced outbreaks in March 2022.

Recalling that a 2015 H5N1 outbreak “led to nearly 5 million laying hens being euthanized at six farms in Dixon County Nebraska” Lincoln Journal Star reporter Matt Olberding observed that “An outbreak now could be even more devastating in Nebraska as the state has since added dozens of operations raising millions of broiler chickens for the Costco processing plant in Fremont” which by itself supplies more than a third of all the $4.99 rotisserie chicks that Costco sells.

JUN 18 2022 4:15pm

POCONO PINES (Tobyhanna Township) – A 285-foot cell tower – a height equal to a building of over 26 stories – has been proposed for 3rd Street in Tobyhanna Township.

Crown Castle USA Inc. a Fortune-500 company that builds and operates cell towers and other communication network infrastructure wants to erect a tower on a vacant two-acre parcel across from 191 3rd Street in the Pocono Pines area of the township. However the property is not properly zoned or sized for the proposal. CrownCastle is therefore seeking use and dimensional variances from the township’s Zoning Hearing Board.

The board has set a hearing on the request for June 29 2022 at 5 pm. The hearing will take place at the Tobyhanna Township Municipal Building 105 Government Center Way Pocono Pines PA 18350. The public may attend and participate in the proceeding.

The use variance is required because the proposed parcel is in the R1 residential district. Township zoning allows cell towers only in the CI Commercial/Industrial and the OS Open Space/Resource Conservation Districts. Dimensional variances are sought because the proposed 285-foot tower is taller than permitted under the code. In the CI district cell towers up to 180 feet high are permitted while in the OS district they are limited to 100 feet. Local ordinances also require a setback equal to the height of the structure. The property the tower is proposed for can only provide setbacks ranging from 78 to 226 feet.

The board will take testimony and evidence from the applicant as well as from the public. The applicant has the burden to prove among other things that it should be able to use the property for a cell tower because due to some unique characteristic of the property not caused by the owner it is impossible to use the property for something that is permitted under the zoning ordinance. If they can show that they then have to also prove that putting a cell tower on the property is the most “minimal change” needed to be able to develop the property. Their burdens of proof are the same for the height limitations they are asking to raise.

Members of the public are permitted to appear and participate in the hearing offering evidence or comments about the application. The plans and applications are available to review at the township offices.

The Zoning Hearing Board’s decision is subject to an appeal to the Monroe County Court of Common Pleas. The appeal must be filed within 30 days of the decision and may be filed only by the applicant or a member of the public who participated in the hearing and was aggrieved by the decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L3NlcmJpYW4tcm95YWxzLWFza2VkLWh1bnRlci1iaWRlbi1mb3ItaGVscC10by1yZXN0b3JlLXBhbGFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Serbian royals asked Hunter Biden for help to restore palaces,"When the royal family of Serbia needed cash to rehab their palaces in Belgrade they came hat in hand to — Hunter Biden.

Crown Prince Alexander Karađorđević of Yugoslavia and his wife Crown Princess Katherine of Serbia met with Biden in November 2015 and didn’t hesitate asking the then-vice president’s son for an expensive favor emails from Hunter Biden’s abandoned hard drive show.



“We were having problems with the state budget for the Royal Compound consisting of two palaces built by my grandfather King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. We were hoping that Hunter might be able to help with his father to solve the problem” Alexander told The Post.

At the time Vice President Biden handled a broad international portfolio for the White House that included Serbia. Two months before the call he had met with Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic when he visited the United States. And just nine months after Hunter’s chat with the royals Joe Biden was in Serbia meeting with top leaders and held an event at the royal palace.

Alexander is the only son of Peter II the last person to rule as King of a unified Yugoslavia. Peter was forced to flee after Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941. The monarchy was formally abolished in 1945 and Alexander grew up abroad. He and wife Katherine were eventually allowed to return and have been living in their old royal digs since 2001. Belgrade is the capital of Serbia which became an independent nation after the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.

Princess Katherine was born in Greece but studied business in the United States at the University of Denver and the University of Dallas. Her phone contact and email are contained in Hunter Biden’s laptop which was abandoned at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019.

The royals live day-to-day in the Old Palace in Belgrade a lavish six-bedroom abode built in 1920s Serbian-Byzantine style. Its entrance hall is paved with stone and walls are decorated with medieval frescoes. A formal dining room is decorated with wood-carved ceilings bronze chandeliers and and paintings from old masters. The adjoining White Palace is used for receptions. The compound features a movie theater billiard room and a vast library.

The residences received more more than a million dollars a year from the government for staffing and upkeep — which Alexander said was not enough.

“It’s a big responsibility to maintain a place like this” Alexander told Reuters in 2010. “You have a list of repairs. Number one is the roof. Number 50 is the swimming pool.” Serbian media reported this year that the palace has soaked up $2.87 million in state revenue over the last five years.

Hunter Biden’s royal confab took place on Nov. 3 2015 and lasted 30 minutes according to an entry in his calendar. Eric Schwerin Hunter’s longtime business partner and president of his investment company Rosemont Seneca was also on the call.

Emails from the hard drive suggest Hunter Biden’s business appetites extended to the small Slavic state. The country’s ambassador to the United States Vladimir Petrovic appears in Hunter Biden’s contact list — and they also appear to be chummy.

“We are looking forward to you visiting Serbia at your convenience” Petrovic emailed Hunter Biden in advance of a planned trip there in May 2010. “I had some preliminary conversations with some business people in Serbia and I think you would find some opportunities when you travel there. Please let me know if I can provide some additional information prior to your trip to Belgrade”

Mark Doyle a one-time senior adviser to then-Sen. Joe Biden and national finance director of his unsuccessful presidential run in 2008 emailed Hunter Biden in April 2010 about plans to connect him with “high net worth individuals” in Serbia.

Petrovic “wants to start putting together a full day for you with [Serbian President Boris] Tadic and potential investors” Doyle wrote adding in a follow up that “my sense from Vladimir is that they are very willing to help you with your fund.” At the time Doyle was operating as a Serbian foreign agent through his firm Prairie Avenue Advisors

When Petrovic retired from his country’s foreign service he emailed Hunter Biden to let him know he would now be reachable at the lobbying firm Roberti White (now Roberti Global).

The royals were grateful for Hunter Biden’s help.

“We would like to thank you very much for today. It was a great pleasure to have met you. Katherine and I are very grateful to you for being so good to us and for being so understanding” Alexander told Hunter Biden in an email that same day — sharing a 2009 image of the royal couple with then vice president Biden and second lady Jill Biden.

Prince Alexander told The Post he believed “nothing happened” after the Biden conversation — but added that “finally the Serbian government did provide the budget” for palace maintenance.

Prince Alexander said he did not pay Hunter Biden or his business associates and was not asked to.

7 Joe Biden and Prince Alexander flash a smile in 2009.

His highness confirmed that he was introduced to Hunter Biden by Sally Painter a co-founder of the DC lobbying shop Blue Star Strategies. The firm took on the controversial Ukrainian energy company Burisma as a client in 2015 and is reportedly under investigation by the Justice Department for potential illegal lobbying on behalf of the company. At the time Hunter Biden was on Burisma’s board netting $83000 a month.

Painter did not respond to request for comment from The Post.

The royals are known in charitable and philanthropic circles in the United States and the earliest connections between them and Hunter Biden is an invite Hunter received to a “masquerade gala” in 2011 at Cipriani to benefit Katherine’s nonprofit Lifeline New York. The organization focuses on providing medical assistance and food to those in Serbia.

Many Serbians continue to have ill feelings toward President Biden for his role as an ardent supporter of the US-led bombing campaign against Serbia in the spring of 1999.

“I am a patriot who is deeply disappointed that they would be dealing with Biden” a friend of the royal family told The Post adding that begging the Biden’s for cash was “a dagger through Serbian hearts.”

In the next few years Ingrid Alexandra will increase her public profile and take on more responsibilities on behalf of the royal family but will continue to focus on her education the palace said in a statement.

Crown Prince Haakon secured her place in the line of succession by changing the law to allow first-born daughters to ascend the throne over their younger male siblings. Her birthday means that if required she can now act as Regent of Norway.

In letters written to the Princess from her mother Crown Princess Mette-Marit and father Crown Prince Haakon praised her and assured her of her new responsibilities.

Her mother Crown Princess Mette-Marit wrote: 'Ingrid I could not be more proud of the girl I have been privileged to follow since the first time your clear brown eyes peered up at me after you came into the world.'

The teenager received letters from her mother and father to mark her milestone birthday

Crown Prince Hakon said: 'Berit's husband Bjørn has talked to me a number of times about duty as a value as a positive force. I am not certain whether it was something he mostly said to me or whether he talked to others about it as well. It is fully possible to find freedom even in doing one's duty. '

Crown Princess Mette-Marit wrote: 'Those of us who know you know how much you love your country. How greatly you enjoy travelling to different parts of Norway. About how extra proud you feel wearing your sweater with NOREG printed on it.

The defendant was located in a pub car park where officers believed they had him trapped but he managed to make off via a second exit point.

He was later arrested near his home in Kingston Row Sturminster Newton.

Castle aged 24 appeared in the dock for sentencing at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday May 29.

Prosecuting Gary Venturi said officers in a police car became aware Castle was driving an Audi and they wanted to speak with him.

They located the vehicle in a layby near Gillingham. As officers pulled up they could see movement within the Audi with two people changing seats.

Someone got out of the car and then the defendant who was behind the wheel now made off at speed.

Mr Venturi said the vehicle “swayed from side to side” as it went off and police initiated a pursuit.

The prosecutor said Castle drove at speeds of at least 60mph in a 30mph. At one point he approached a roundabout at close to 90mph.

The defendant went straight through a red light “with no intention to brake” and travelled on the wrong side of the road.

Officers aborted the pursuit due to concerns for the safety of other road users and Castle was deemed a wanted man by police.

No details of the duration or distance covered in the pursuit was given in court.

Castle and the vehicle were later located in the car park of Red Lion pub . Police thought they had him trapped but he made off through a second exit.

Later officers attended the area around his home address where they saw the Audi parked up. More officers attended including a dog handler and Castle was arrested nearby. He was carrying £80 to £90 of meat in meat which someone else had stolen from Tesco.

Castle pleaded guilty to dangerous driving driving without a licence using a motor vehicle without insurance and handling stolen goods.

The court heard he had 13 previous convictions for 31 offences.

Mitigating Richard Wayman acknowledged that immediate custody was the only outcome.

“It is for him to take the further steps to turn his life around” Mr Wayman said.

Sentencing judge Recorder Tom Brown told Castle: “You are a young person with a criminal record encompassing a range offending.”

He jailed the defendant for eight months and disqualified him from driving for two years and 89 days.",,,

Some want to save it.,"CSX Transportation plans on demolishing a 95-year-old brick roundhouse on the Far South Side that a preservation group has been trying to save for years.

The Columbus Landmarks Foundation put the Parsons Yard roundhouse on its most endangered list in 2020.

Drivers on Parsons Avenue can easily see the roundhouse south of Route 104. Affixed to the roundhouse are CSX signs that say ""Waiting for demolition.""

The railroad said that's the plan although it's unclear when it would begin.

""As part of our ongoing infrastructure maintenance program CSX has been conducting a wide range of terminal clean-up activities and facility improvements across our network"" CSX spokeswoman Sheriee Bowman said in an email. ""This systemwide clean-up includes the removal and consolidation of old unused yard structures and old equipment. At CSX safety is our highest priority and that starts with a safe well-maintained work environment.”

""No timeline has been set for demolition"" she said.

Chesapeake & Ohio built the 27-bay brick roundhouse in 1927. During the 1950s parts of the roundhouse at the railroad's Parsons Yard were closed with unused bays demolished. Fifteen bays remain.

Becky West Columbus Landmarks' executive director said CSX doesn't seem to be open to the idea of private investment.

""The demolition of this roundhouse would be a tremendous loss for South Columbus"" West said as well as the city as a whole the state and the nation.

""Our understanding is that it is one of the few roundhouses with a turntable left"" she said.

Local architect Peter Krajnak president of the Columbus Landmarks Board and chairman of its Endangered Properties Fund Committee said in an email that the roundhouse should stay.

""The beauty of this roundhouse building lies in the unique form of the building which clearly conveys the former function of locomotive maintenance and storage"" Krajnak said.

""The building still has a story to tell and with a splash of creativity this structure could potentially be adaptively reused as a destination gathering place similar to the successful transformation of the former trolley car service building into the East Market in the Trolley District.""

Stu Nicholson the executive director of All Aboard Ohio also mentioned the old trolley barn complex on the Near East Side that has been redeveloped.

""This is a building worth preserving. Especially in light with what they’ve done with the trolley barn"" Nicholson said.

""Make the railroad an offer. They may let it go for a token amount"" he said.

The South Side of Columbus is doing a lot to upgrade its look and image he said. The roundhouse could be used for something else even a farmers' market he said.

""This is the last of a breed in Columbus"" he said.

Alex Campbell who runs the columbusrailroads.com website said the roundhouse was used decades ago for steam locomotives.

Campbell said he hopes it stays but is doubtful.

""I think the railroad would view it as a nuisance"" he said. ""Rail fans would like it.""

@MarkFerenchik",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWlucy5jb20vdHJuL25ld3MtcmV2aWV3cy9uZXdzLXdpcmUvb2ZmaWNpYWxzLWNlbGVicmF0ZS1jb21wbGV0aW9uLW9mLWNyZWF0ZS1hcmdvLWNvbm5lY3Rpb24tcHJvamVjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Officials celebrate completion of CREATE Argo Connection project - Trains,"SUMMIT Ill. — Some projects in Chicago’s CREATE program which seeks to address rail congestion bring dramatic changes to the landscape. The Englewood Flyover the lengthy bridge which raised Metra’s Rock Island District above the Norfolk Southern main line on the city’s South Side is the classic example.

For others the impact is far more operational than visual. The Argo Connections project B9 in the CREATE labeling system is a prime example. Most people may never see the infrastructure work being celebrated on Friday June 17 but its impact will be widespread.

CREATE (that’s Chicago Region Environmental And Transportation Efficiency) celebrated the completion of the Argo project with a ribbon cutting that brought out both the state’s U.S. senators U.S. Rep. Marie Newman and a host of other government and railroad officials. It’s the 32nd project to be completed of the 70 on CREATE’s agenda since the program began in 2003.

“The big problem we are addressing with each of these projects is how to move trains through the Chicagoland area more quickly” said U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin. “Why is that important? Well there are two reasons that come to mind immediately. One is called supply chain. Have you heard the term? We know the inflation we are facing reflects the fact that the supply chain is not as efficient as it should be.

“The other problem we are facing is how to move trains some with passengers some with freight through the same areas in an efficient way … That is one of the bottom-line accomplishments on this particular B9 project.”

Added U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth “Our rail system carries nearly half of all intermodal rail containers and nearly 30% of all the railcars right here. It’s really crucial that we move goods quickly and efficiently so we can keep the costs down.”

The project involved building a new double-track connection and new crossovers at the connection between the Belt Railway of Chicago and an Indiana Harbor Belt/CSX Transportation line at Argo adjacent to Archer and 63rd streets in Summit with additional crossovers at a control point at 71st Street raising speeds from 10 to 25 mph.

That connection doesn’t directly involve Metra commuter trains — although its Heritage Corridor trains cross a nearby diamond and stop in Summit — but Metra’s CEO Jim Derwinski was as passionate as anyone in extolling its benefits during the series of speakers marking the project’s completion. He noted the huge collection of partners in the effort to make the 1500 trains that move in Chicago each weekday — roughly 700 freights 700 from Metra and 100 from Amtrak — do so more smoothly

“Six Class I railroads Metra Amtrak the federal government the state of Illinois the county of Cook all of our municipal partners along with IDOT” — the Illinois Department of Transportation — “it’s an amazing project” Derwinski said. “And every time we get together for a ribbon cutting or even a groundbreaking it reminds us where we have come to.

“We didn’t do that in the past. That’s why this network got congested. And even though we’re here on CSX property this project benefits Metra. It benefits Metra’s riders. Because it decongests another portion of the network today.”

A few minutes later in a conversation with Trains News Wire Derwinski elaborated on the Argo project’s impact.

“It relieves pressure at the areas where we cross the freight traffic” he said. “… On the Heritage Corridor alone we cross six different rail crossings and on an average day there’s 150 movements over those crossings. So to keep those commuter trains on time it’s really about clearing the freight train from its slot at that crossing. And projects like this speeding up the throughput and opening up a little more capacity are going to get the freight trains through those crossings faster.”

The freight railroads certainly welcome that additional capacity as well.

“For the IHB it means more fluidity in and out of Argo but we also see it as an opportunity to increase business up the road” said Indiana Harbor Belt General Manager John Wright. “We have terminals up in Norpaul” — about 10 miles away in Franklin Park Ill. — “that we want to develop for future business so it gives us more velocity through this area adds another track for trains coming out of the BRC railroad and obviously helps our partners with Metra and Amtrak in getting across the diamond. … When you can go high speed at what is basically a crossroad it makes a big difference in the fluidity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBobm9tcGVuaHBvc3QuY29tL2Jhbmtpbmctc2VjdXJpdGllcy1idXNpbmVzcy9iZW5lZml0cy1pbnZlc3Rpbmctc3RvY2stZXhjaGFuZ2Utb3Zlci1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The benefits of investing on the stock exchange over real estate,"There is no denying the strength of real estate investment in Cambodia particularly over the past decade.

Much infrastructure including housing factories and industrial zones among many others as well as in trade and tourism have been built greatly developing formerly unused land.

This rapid growth greatly boosted the value of real estate and naturally became desired by investors and landowners. Yet there are other ways to generate a similar passive income.

Stock investment is one possible alternative with similarly high future profit ratios to real estate one in which even beginners can quickly get up to speed while it is something existing real estate investors can easily familiarise themselves with.

Cambodia’s securities market while still in its infancy holds great growth potential.

While investors during initial public offerings (IPOs) hold great advantages over those on the secondary market some stocks may of course see a decline after an IPO.

However the majority of the listed companies on the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) have seen gains with some such as Phnom Penh Autonomous Port (PPAP) Sihanoukville Autonomous Port (PAS) and the newly listed JS Land Plc (JSL) having gone up to three time their IPO valuations.

Chart 1: Increase ratio between IPO and current price of PPAP PAS and JSL.

However this isn’t to say that stocks that have declined or haven’t gained exponentially are without potential. Some stocks fall for a brief period owing to external circumstances rather than a drop in fundamental quality.

Nonetheless these stocks usually rebound after a period of time. Investors able to identify such stocks can benefit greatly.

For example Phnom Penh SEZ Plc (PPSP) once plunged as low as 1160 riel per share around late 2020 only to recover to 2420 riel just months later.

In general stocks that experience substantial price movements like this are ideal for investors who can forecast price movement patterns and are willing to undergo risks in exchange for significant returns while also being able to handle any losses.

Investors with a more conservative approach can make long-term investments in steadily increasing stocks while still reaping the benefits of dividends and capital gains.

With Cambodia’s securities market still developing it is fair to expect its growth to reach greater heights and match the bourses of developed nations in due time.

The top publicly listed companies around the globe today would not have got to where they are without the existence of their stock exchange.

Tesla for instance is currently worth more than $650 billion a value larger than other well-known car manufacturers like Toyota BMW and Nissan combined.

The company went public in 2010 offering 13.3 million shares priced at $17 each. Today each share is worth around $760.

To put it into perspective investors who put $1000 into Tesla stock in 2010 would have approximately $44000 today – a gain of 44 times the outlay.

While it may hold true that Tesla would still have been successful today even if it had not gone public the company would have been no way near as large.

Stock investment also offers a variety of other conveniences over real estate such as better liquidity the ease of getting into it low transaction fees portfolio diversity and tax incentives.

Better liquidity means it is easier for investors to buy or sell stocks whenever they want – in comparison finalising a real estate deal takes a long time.

Furthermore stock investment does not require a big cash injection to get started as investors can embark on their trading journey by purchasing just one stock per transaction.

Currently the pricing for each stock can range from just over 2000 riel to around 16000 riel.

Additionally transaction fees for stock trading in Cambodia right now are very low approximately 0.5 per cent. It is also easy to diversify investments in stock trading.

Investors can spread their assets across a variety of different industries such as ports garments and banking as well as real estate companies.

Finally in the endeavour of promoting stock trading in Cambodia the government has provided tax incentives including tax exemptions and reduced taxation.

That is not to say investing in stocks comes with no risks. Stocks can be much more volatile than real estate. Investors are recommended to be careful with their investment following up on their asset value at least weekly.

On the other end of the spectrum there are stocks that require investors to play a long-term waiting game to see any sizeable gains. These stocks increase steadily for years and see minor activity. These are more suited for long-term investors than those seeking a quick buck.

Due to a lack of basic stock analysis some investors may engage in emotion-driven purchases and sales.

Investors can be swayed by rumours news or the opinions of peers causing them to make regrettable purchase decisions. Hence it is best to always do proper research and analysis when investing in any listed company.

While stock investment is known to be more liquid than real estate it does not apply to every stock listed. It can become a hassle to sell and buy less demanding stocks. A way to combat this is to diversify purchases.

The bottom line is that while real estate and stocks are both financial products with their own set of risks and rewards neither promises unqualified and endless gains.

However the general public should always keep in mind that investing in stocks or the other financial products in the securities market is a simple method to get started in investment especially for those with more modest financial resources.

Not that it exactly came up short on the torque front. The same dyno pull revealed the Ram was pushing out an equally insane 3642 lb-ft (4938 Nm) of twist action courtesy of a highly tuned 6.7-liter Cummins inline-six engine running an unholy 180+ psi of boost though a compound turbo setup and a generous shot of nitrous.

According to the Engine Builder website the Ziegler truck was the last of the competing trucks to be strapped to the dyno at which point its team had 2621 hp (2657 PS) and 3677 (4958 Nm) to beat. Ohio-based garage-owner Justin Ziegler didn’t quite top that torque benchmark but he pulverised the power target and smashed the previous all-time UCC dyno record of 2929 hp (2970 PS) in the process.

The Ram’s power delivery is so explosive that the real action is condensed into a couple of seconds when the Cummins engine starts boosting and the truck does its best to climb right off the rollers its brakes visibly glowing orange behind the wheels. Organizers actually cleared the stands directly adjacent to the dyno to make sure no spectators would be put at risk if one of the trucks’ engines decided to let go during a pull and scatters its guts all over the crowd something that has happened before.

But since the Ultimate Callout Challenge is a multi-discipline event that also requires vehicles to pull a sled and hammer down a drag strip we also get to see the ZPD complete an eighth-mile sprint in only 4.99 seconds at 148.51 mph (239 km/h) and watch another Dodge truck nicknamed “Running in the Red” showing exactly how to haul the mother of all trailers in this video from the 1320 Video YouTube channel.

As for why you’d want to torture an engine by making it pull all that weight I guess that comes down to a mischievous human desire to make machines do crazy things they were never designed to do.

'For lease' signs are hung in windows shops are empty and unsightly roadworks litter the main streets amid construction of the City Rail Link (CRL).

But both Auckland Council and the city centre's business association are confident the CBD can bounce back and said there is a plan to welcome visitors to Aotearoa.

'It's a mess'

For about a year the intersection at Victoria St West and Albert St has been shut while Link Alliance contractors move and upgrade underground utilities build Te Wai Horotiu (Aotea) Station and its above-ground entrance and complete streetscape improvements.

While the intersection is open to pedestrians and cyclists it will be shut to vehicles until mid-2023.

Colm Cummins' iconic Irish CBD bar The Fiddler is caught up in the construction chaos - they are right outside the entrance.

He said they're hugely affected by the roadworks and don't believe the state of the CBD is doing them any favours as it's just not a welcoming destination for tourists.

""It's a mess with construction homelessness street dwellers empty shops and no police. Auckland [CBD] is the last place tourists would want to visit and definitely re-visit"" he told Newshub.

""The CRL seems to be on a mission to close my business and my neighbours' businesses too.""

Cummins said the city centre has also become a hotbed for unpleasant interactions.

""Last Friday my staff member was spat on by a homeless man after he was asked to leave the premises"" Cummins said.

""This happens all the time for us because we are situated so close to the CRL project … I fear for my staff my customers and myself. I especially don't feel safe bringing my young kids to the CBD anymore.""

But Cummins is far from the only Auckland CBD business owner in strife. It's a similar state of affairs for Israeli-born restaurateur Yael Shochat the owner of much-loved Fort St institution Ima Cuisine.

Thanks to the pandemic she's lost regular customers and has racked up a large amount of debt.

Like Cummins she's concerned by how unsafe the CBD has become.

""I worry about my staff when they are on their way home after a shift"" she told Newshub.

""We are constantly getting things taken from the back and people urinating by our back door… People sitting on the public benches by the restaurant can be abusive. I've had to call the ambulance a few times for them too.""

Shochat still has a positive outlook and is confident that while the CBD will take time to bounce back the first tourists will understand that some businesses didn't survive and it will be a bit empty.

Cummins too believes the CBD can rebound as a vibrant location for tourists - but said it needs a major shake-up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Nwb3J0L2dhYS9hcmlkLTQwODk5MTU1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cavan see off McEntee's Sligo to reach Tailteann Cup final,"Cavan 0-20 Sligo 1-14

Pre-tournament favourites Cavan are through to the inaugural Tailteann Cup football final after holding off a determined Sligo at Croke Park.

Leading by five points at half-time the 2020 Ulster champions might have been expected to push on for a more comfortable win but in the end were more than happy to finish three clear.

Sligo refused to throw in the towel and were boosted by the half-time introduction of marquee forward Niall Murphy following hamstring trouble.

Murphy scored four second-half points and helped to get the margin back to just two points on a couple of occasions late on but Cavan held on with star duo Gearoid McKiernan and Gerard Smith registering crucial late points.

Cavan will return to Croke Park in just under three weeks for a July 9 final clash with Westmeath or Offaly on the undercard to the All-Ireland SFC semi-final meeting of Galway/Armagh and Derry/Clare.

Sligo declined to start Murphy following a hamstring injury and they missed his quality initially the underdogs wasting a series of opportunities throughout the first-half.

Tony McEntee's men registered five wides in that period dropped four separate score attempts short and had two goal chances - Patrick O'Connor hit the bar in the 28th minute and Mikey Gordon had a shot cleared off the line just before the interval - which came to nought.

Cavan in contrast showed a remarkable ability to take any chances that came their way with 11 different Breffni players getting on the scoresheet in the first-half alone.

Martin Reilly got Cavan's first point and was later replaced by Cian Madden who closed out the first-half scoring with a kick from distance that just about dropped over.

In between the rest of the starting forwards both midfielders as well as defenders Killian and Conor Brady all split the posts.

Cavan deserved their 0-6 to 0-0 lead after the opening 15 minutes though O'Connor's 20th minute goal came as a lifeline for Sligo which just about kept them in contention.

Having overcome Leitrim on penalties in the quarter-finals it was another three-pointer from a spot kick for Sligo with O'Connor converting after the onrushing Luke Towey was hauled down by Gerard Smith.

Sligo also clipped two points which came from quick frees Dublin based Kerryman Pat Spillane notching one and Darragh Cummins the other.

It all added up to a 0-11 to 1-3 half-time lead for Cavan and Killian Clarke Clarke became their 12th different scorer when he found his range in the 45th minute.

James Smith struck his second of the day for Cavan shortly after though Sligo had still eaten into their lead and got the gap down to just two points with 15 minutes to go.

The introduction of Murphy was a game changer with six second-half points coming through the Coolera-Strandhill man.

Murphy scored four himself won a free which Sean Carrabine converted and played in Spillane for another score.

Two points was as close as the Connacht semi-finalists got though as Cavan kept their noses just about in front with two crucial points from McKiernan and Gerard Smith in the run-in.

CVS,CVS Health,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iYXVzY2gtaGVhbHRoLW1pc3ByaWNlZC1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS0yMDUyMzczMjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bausch Health: Mispriced Opportunity,"In January earlier this year I wrote an article on Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC) in which I speculated that the upcoming spin-off of the Bausch + Lomb eye care business and its aesthetic business (named Solta) would unlock tremendous value. After publishing that article I invested in the stock. Bausch was to split into three businesses:

The eye-care business Bausch + Lomb Corp. (NYSE:BLCO). The aesthetic businesses Solta would be separated via an IPO. The pharmaceutical business (and other remaining businesses) would continue as Bausch Health Companies.









But the best laid plans often go awry. While Bausch executed an IPO of the Bausch + Lomb business a combination of weak first-quarter earnings and the bear market has hit it like a freight train. Just look at the carnage. The stock price is down 73% this year!

Bausch Health: Mispriced Opportunity

Bausch's IPO of Bausch + Lomb was on May 6 with shares of the contact lens and eye-care company opening trading at $18.50 after selling 10% of the total shares for $18 in the IPO. The IPO was for less than the previously expected price of $21 to $24 a share given weak market conditions. The IPO proceeds (about $600 million) will be used by Bausch for debt reduction. The parent company also plans to sell another 10% of Bausch + Lomb stock and then spin off 80% of the remaining to shareholders. As of right now Bausch Health owns 90% of Bausch + Lomb. Given market conditions the Solta IPO has been put on hold.

Here are how the two stocks have fared side-by-side since the spinoff:

Bausch Health: Mispriced Opportunity

Even though both stocks are down Bausch Health is down far more even though it owns 90% of Bausch + Lomb. Bausch Health's market cap is $2.7 billion while Bausch + Lomb's market cap it $5.5 billion. This means the Bausch Health shares are selling for a negative amount of money if you back out the 90% of Bausch + Lomb it owns. Mr. Market's logic does not make much sense to me in that it is valuing Bausch Health's pharmaceutical business far below zero.

While the remaining pharma business is heavily leveraged logic dictates that equity value cannot be below zero. Therefore even if we were to ascribe a zero value for the remaining company after separation the 80% of Bausch + Lomb stock which Bausch Health will eventually offload should be worth $4.4 billion.

This also does not account for the fact that Bausch + Lomb itself looks undervalued as compared to its eye-care peers like Alcon (ALC) and The Cooper Company (COO). For Bausch Health perhaps a zero value is appropriate given the huge debt load it is carrying. After the spinoff is completed any market value ascribed to the remaining company's equity is expected to be small and highly speculative.

Story continues

However Bausch faces several unresolved shareholder lawsuits and there is a possibility that the spinoff could be declared an illegal transfer to avoid liability. A group of investors are already suing the company accusing it of fraudulent transfer of assets. The lawsuit could have a dampening effect on the stock price but it is likely a settlement will be reached.

There are some important Gurus who are long Bausch Health including Carl Icahn (Trades Portfolio) so this is not some orphan stock.

Guru Portfolio Date Current Shares % of Shares outstanding % of Total Assets Managed Comment Carl Icahn 2022-03-31 34721118 9.61 3.63% John Paulson 2022-03-31 25839035 7.15 18.18% ValueAct Holdings LP 2022-03-31 14430901 3.99 4.54% Reduce -7.59% Larry Robbins 2022-03-31 9256661 2.56 4.28% Reduce -25.96%





Charlie Munger (Trades Portfolio) once said that If youre going to be in this game for the long pull which is the way to do it you better be able to handle a 50% decline without fussing too much about it. Well this is much more than a 50% decline so I am a little fussed. So what do I do? In this particular case I bought more. The market action does not make sense and from my perspective the fundamentals have not changed from when I previously formed my investing thesis on this stock.

Francis Chou (Trades Portfolio) had the following to say about this stock in his 2021 semi-annual letter:



""Comparable companies like Cooper Companies (COO) and Alcon Inc. (ALC) are currently trading between 18 and 20 times 2022 EBITDA estimates and 25-30 times trailing EBITDA estimates. If Bausch + Lomb trades at similar multiples as a stand-alone company the total value of Bausch Health using a sum-of-the-parts method would be worth north of US$45 per share (net of debt).""





Bausch Health was a big mess when the current CEO Joseph Papa took over in April 2016. The stock was trading at around $30 at that time. The company has reduced long-term debt from about $30 billion to $23 billion now and is aiming to bring it down to $20 billion when the Bausch + Lomb and Solta separations are complete. Unfortunately the company got caught flat footed by the current bear market and will have to wait a while before the separation. The stock is ~$7 now in spite of clear fundamental improvements.

LOS ANGELES (CNS) -- A ticket with five numbers but missing the Mega number in the latest drawing of the multi-state Mega Millions lottery was sold at a Mid-Wilshire pharmacy and is worth $7727088 the California Lottery announced.

California law requires major payoffs of lottery games to be paid on a pari-mutuel basis.

One ticket each with five numbers but missing the Mega number was sold in Florida and Texas and are each worth $2 million because the players utilized the Megaplier option where for an additional $1 any non-jackpot prize will be multiplied by the Megaplier number drawn according to the Multi-State Lottery Association which conducts the game.

There were no tickets sold with all six numbers and the estimated jackpot for Tuesday's drawing will grow to $290 million.

The numbers drawn Friday were 20 36 53 56 69 and the Mega number was 16. The estimated jackpot was $273 million.

The drawing was the 18th since the last time a ticket with all six numbers was sold.

The odds of matching all five numbers and the Mega number are 1 in 302575350 according to the California Lottery. The overall chance of winning a prize is 1 in 24.

The Mega Millions game is played in 45 states the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ib3lzLWJvc3MtdGFsa3MtZGVzcGVyYXRlLWdyaW15LTE2MDAwOTMyOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Boys Boss Talks 'Desperate Grimy' Hookup and [Spoiler]'s Worrisome Fate,"Warning: The following contains spoilers for The Boys Season 3 Episode 5. Proceed at your own risk!

Kimiko and Frenchie weren’t the only pair moving into new territory on The Boys this week.

More from TVLine

In the latest episode Butcher told Maeve that the trip to Russia in search of a weapon capable of killing Homelander came up empty. Feeling defeated the two got drunk — so much for their sobriety — and commiserated about the sad state of affairs. Then Maeve leaned into Butcher and… the two kissed! When Butcher stood up with a sternly shocked expression Maeve followed and challengingly replied “Still think you’re too good for me?” Let’s just say he definitely wasn’t too good to not have sex with her.

“The writers talked about that moment as like desperate and a little grimy” showrunner Eric Kripke tells TVLine. “We talked about Monster’s Ball when Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry hook up and it’s just so grimy because they’re both mourning deaths. So we talked a lot about [how] they’re both so cornered right then and there and they both have so much in common surprisingly [in] how much they hate Homelander how much they hate superheroes in general how f—ked they both feel. And then it just kind of explodes in this hookup.”

The Boys Butcher/Maeve

If Butcher and Maeve’s unexpected moment of passion seemed familiar in its staging and tone that might be because star Karl Urban took inspiration from a famous erotic thriller. “He got really interested in the first big sex scene between Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange in The Postman Always Rings Twice because it’s so desperate and grimy and fast and he was really inspired by that” Kripke shares. “If you actually put the two sex scenes up next to each other they’re pretty similar. It was just about kind of capturing that energy of desperation.”

Unfortunately for Maeve Homelander could smell Butcher on her after the hookup leading him and Black Noir to kidnapped her. Starlight feared that Maeve was dead which Ashley would neither confirm nor deny instead spinning a story about how Maeve had entered a wellness center for treatment.

“You should be very concerned about [Maeve’s] wellbeing but tune in to see. She’s in a tight spot” Kripke teases.

As for whether Homelander’s decision to take Maeve captive was an act of jealousy or about him feeling betrayed Kripke believes his response was the culmination of many perceived threats over the years. “I don’t think it was an impulsive moment” Kripke says. “For Homelander it was a long time coming. It’s the airplane video that Maeve has been blackmailing him with it’s years of small slights that he like banks away. For the writers it was a sign of oh wow this guy really is in control at Vought because he’s starting to settle his debts and that’s what makes him so scary.”

The Boys fans what did you think of Butcher and Maeve’s hookup? And do you think Maeve is alive or dead?

Bryce Dallas Howard is marking her 16thwedding anniversary with a sweet tribute to her husband Seth Gabel.

TheJurassic World star gushed about Gabel in the Instagram post which she shared with her 2.4 million followers.

Howard 41 posted a photograph of herself wearing a patterned belted maxi dress with long sleeves as she gazed lovingly at Gabel 40 who smiled at the camera while wearing a beige jacket over a blue shirt and dark blue jeans.

She wrote in the caption: “Seth Gabel we celebrate 16 years of marriage today and I am more in love with you now than ever. Happy Anniversary. Love Your Wife.”

Although Gabel who stars in the TV series Fringe did not post an anniversary tribute he is no stranger to making sweet posts about his wife.

On her birthday in March he shared a photograph of the red-headed actor and said: “Look at this angel. Mother of my children. Light of my life. It’s her birthday today. Happy birthday baby girl.”

The couple met at New York University and began dating in 2001. They married on 17 June 2006 and share two children 15-year-old son Theodore Normal Howard-Gabel and 10-year-old daughter Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel.

Howard who is the daughter of film director Ron Howard opened up about falling in love with Gabel in a 2011 interview with The Guardian.

She said: “The second I saw him on campus at New York University I broke into hives. That night I wrote in my journal: ‘Today I met the man that I’m going to marry’.”

But although it was “love at first sight” for Howard Gabel took some time to become interested romantically in her.

“I pursued him for months and months and there was no interest” she said. “Then I called him at an insane hour of the night and asked him out for coffee.

“He agreed we went out and he called one of our friends afterwards and said: ‘The tables have turned. I am so nervous she doesn’t like me anymore and I really like her!’”

Howard has also spoken candidly about experiencing postnatal depression following the birth of her first child in 2007.

She wrote in Goop about feeling “nothing” when her son was handed to her after the birth.

“Postpartum depression is hard to describe – the way the body and mind and spirit fracture and crumble in the wake of what most believe should be a celebratory time” she said.

“The danger of being silent means only that others will suffer in silence and may never be able to feel whole because of it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wZXRlLWRhdmlkc29uLXRyeWluZy1iZXN0LWtpbS0xNTI5MDA4MjMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pete Davidson Is Out Here Trying His Best to Be Kim Kardashian's Instagram Boyfriend,"Pete Davidson Is Out Here Trying His Best to Be Kim Kardashian’s Instagram Boyfriend

Being an Instagram boyfriend/husband is a serious job. You have to get your partner’s vision. You have to get the angles right. The lighting. The perspective. Do you know when to crouch down to elongate your lover’s figure? When to step back to show that the backdrop matches the outfit? This kind of work requires an attention to detail and an intuition for subtle direction—perhaps a “look over your shoulder” or a “fix your hair on that side” or a “let’s do it again your shoes were cut off.” It’s artistic direction. It’s emotional labor. It’s an act of love.

So imagine the pressure of fulfilling this role for Kim Kardashian one of the most visible women on earth who boasts 319 million Instagram followers (and counting). The responsibility lies with Pete Davidson who just joined (or re-joined) Instagram in February. This should go well!

On her Instagram Story Kim shared her and Pete’s “few attempts at trying to get content” during a recent trip to Tahiti. The videos showed the reality star trying out a few poses on the beach while a giggly Pete did his best to capture them from the other side of the camera.

Things got rough when Kim started working with a paddle board. “Oh he’s letting me struggle at this point” she wrote in one caption. “I think he’s purposely letting me drift off far away” she added in another.

But after a few hiccups Kim ultimately ruled that Pete “turned out to be the best photog.” They even “got the cutest pics and just had so much fun trying” she added.

Pete even got a little ambitious and tried to shoot content while he and Kim were riding bikes. “Wasn’t his best work” Kim admitted.

But he did manage to get a sweet clip of Kim pedaling along.

And the couple got this cute little photo dump out of the whole learning experience which Kim posted on her grid.

A for effort Pete. Keep practicing!

On June 15 sisters Kristin Doughty Danaher and Katie Doughty Maddox sought guidance from the Boothbay Planning Board about converting office space on Church Street into a residential unit housing four to six people. The sisters are daughters of Bruce Doughty one of the shipyard’s founders.

The office building was first a residential unit owned by Hodgdon Yachts. Washburn & Doughty bought it several years ago. Doughty Danaher reported the building is a two-story 2368 square foot free-standing residence. The company wants to reconfigure it into four to six single bedrooms with employees sharing a common kitchen living space and two bathrooms. Doughty Danaher added there were no plans to change the building’s footprint. “As you know housing is becoming harder to come by” she said. “The lack of housing is preventing workers from accepting positions with us whether it’s short- or long-term. So we’re here looking for guidance in what kind of application we need.”

Board Chairman Bill Wright suggested a minor development review application. He added the board would need to review increased sewer generation created by the change of use. “We would also want to see a parking layout lighting and buffering plans” Wright said.

The property is zoned in maritime commercial and shoreline overlay districts.

In other action the board conditionally approved an application for an amended subdivision lot line. Boothbay Region Surveyors’ David Tonry represented clients Stephen and Eleanor Alley of Boothbay. The couple sought an amended lot line so they could convey a plot to David and Angela Alley. The request was approved unanimously with a provision requiring a revised plot plan. The condition requires showing the property conveyed into a single lot. The property is on West Wind Drive in a residential zone.

The board meets next at 6 p.m. Wednesday July 20 in the conference room.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The three students – Jordan Baumeister Dustin Reff and Trevor Borman – are computer science majors that used artificial intelligence and data science to create models predicting future market trends. These models also provide a comparison for anomalies like droughts or floods using historical data trends.

""Our overall goal was to optimize the risk versus reward tradeoff that shows up when you exchange these contracts on the futures market"" Reff says.

The idea to create a model like this came from Ron Ragsdale a rancher who worked with SDSMT student Todd Gange in 1993. Ragsdale had created a system for calculating predictions of the cattle market on pen and paper using a series of equations.

""What he did was genius"" Gagne says. ""He looked at the futures market for both cattle and corn and backed out all the costs needed to fatten his calves. He used 187 variables not just feed. He included the costs of the lights in his barn vaccination and fuel. This way he knew what he could pay for his calves to make a profit in the future.""

Gange helped Ragsdale optimize his system using a computer program Gange and his wife Holly had created in college. Ragsdale's method combined with Gange's program failed to produce accurate results only twice.

Ragsdale passed away in 2021 before he was able to publish his thesis on market theory. Before his death Gange and Ragsdale launched a student program and Gange passed his software on to a new team of SDSMT students.

The goal of this new team – Baumeister Reff and Borman – was to take modern tools like AI and enhance the old program making it more robust and better able to predict factors that may drive the market off its typical course.

""If I know what the value should be in the future what happens when something like mad cow disease widespread drought or widespread flooding occurs? All these things can send the market into arbitrage"" Gagne says. ""We twisted and turned this data and tried to look at it in new ways to see anomalies or patterns that we think are tradable in the future.""

The team created two prediction models: one that evaluates the historical data trends to determine risk vs. reward and one that predicts the best times to buy and sell.

The project is still ongoing. The three students have graduated but will coach the next team in the fall to begin the next phase of the project. Next semester's students will rebuild the models and determine which of Ragsdale's 187 variables are the most important in predicting the markets and build in indicators for over- or undervalued animals.

""As a sponsor Todd provided years of data support and a good story"" says Brian Butterfield a lecturer of computer science and engineering at Mines. ""These students took advantage of the opportunity by applying their skills in data science and data analysis to advance the work. I appreciate watching what emerges by providing students with the framework to build something and gain real-world experience.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5zZmllbGRuZXdzam91cm5hbC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L2FudGlxdWUtZmFybS1tYWNoaW5lcnktZGlzcGxheS1jcmF3Zm9yZC1jb3VudHktZmFpcmdyb3VuZHMvNzY0ODMxNTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antique farm machinery on display at Crawford County Fairgrounds,"BUCYRUS — The Crawford Farm Machinery Show pulled in a crowd Friday evening at the Crawford County Fairgrounds.

""We just bring our tractors in and display them people come out and they look at them"" said Roger Haas a trustee of the Crawford Antique Farm Machinery Association which organizes the event.

Friday's main events were the antique tractor pull and purse bingo.

""It's mainly your farming community that respond to it"" Haas said. ""These are tractors us older guys grew up on. I've got a tractor that my dad brought in 1952 and I restored it. It's just kind of like a club. We're all in a club.""

A wide assortment of older tractors was on display for public viewing such as a 1957 red Farmall 450 1939 red Farmall F14 1948 Silver King 1952 orange Minneapolis-Moline U and a 1944 pink McCormick Farmall H.

Haas had two tractors on display a 1951 John Deere B and the 1952 Farmall Super C.

""Our featured tractor this year is the White Corp which consists of the Minneapolis-Moline Oliver and Cockshutt tractors"" he said.

""Last count I had 81 tractors here"" Haas said.

Delta Air Lines pilots want you to know it is not their fault.

Delta Air Lines Pilots Pen Open Letter To Customers On Flight Delays Overtime

Pilots at Delta Air Lines represented by the Air Line Pilots Association have taken the rare step of publishing an open letter to customers as the summer travel season begins. Delta which once stood out among its peers for its stellar operational performance has not been immune from delays and cancellations this year. But pilots wish to make one thing clear: it’s not us.

Here’s the letter:

To Our Valued Customers: The Delta pilots take pride in the reliability and the service that defines Delta Air Lines. We are disheartened when we witness the impact of your disrupted travel plans. As you travel with us this summer and beyond we ask you to please remember the following: Delta pilots will continue to prioritize safety – every day and on every flight.

We have been working on our days off flying a record amount of overtime to help you get to your destination. At the current rate by this fall our pilots will have flown more overtime in 2022 than in the entirety of 2018 and 2019 combined our busiest years to date.

We empathize and share in your frustration over the delays cancellations and disrupted travel plans you’ve experienced. We agree; it is unacceptable. As we welcome you aboard we will continue to go above and beyond to ensure the integrity of the operation. Delta’s management needs to do the same before you lose confidence in the Delta brand. The Pilots of Delta Air Lines

The defensive letters seeks to hold management accountable for the operational woes (encouraged in part by the reduction of the aircraft fleet and most notably of personnel through voluntary attrition during the pandemic) but goes a step further in pointing out that Delta pilots are working harder than ever to avoid delays and cancellations by stepping up.

The revelation that Delta pilots as a whole are projected to work more overtime in 2022 than in 2018 and 2019 combined is big news as those two years marked the two busiest years to date prior to 2022.

CONCLUSION

I’m not always in favor of airline union tactics but I found this letter very reasonable and thought that it struck a nice balance between defending pilots while pledging to continue to step up to avoid disruptions.

Despite their most valiant efforts I still predict travel this summer will be like a rollercoaster. Be prepared: but don’t take out your frustration on Delta pilots if your flight is delayed or cancelled.

ATLANTA — Travelers continue to see a high number of cancelations out of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport -- particularly for those flying on Delta Air Lines.

On Sunday as of 6 p.m. there were 103 flights canceled to and from the world's busiest airport. According to a flight tracking service Flight Aware 79 of those were Delta flights.

As far as delays FlightAware reports there were at least 246 flight delays at Atlanta's airport. A majority of them were Delta routes with 146 flights reporting a delay in their schedule.

On Saturday of the 130 flights canceled to or from Atlanta 100 were Delta flights.

It comes on the heels of a busy summer travel season -- and a holiday weekend with Juneteenth and Father's Day.

Airports with the most cancellations included those in Charlotte North Carolina a major hub for American Airlines LaGuardia and Newark Liberty in the New York City area and Reagan Washington National outside Washington D.C.

The issues started on Thursday and Friday for the airline with several viewers reaching out to 11Alive about having to sleep on the floor at the airport due to cancelations.

11Alive News reached out to Delta to get answers for these travelers and received the following statement:

“We apologize for any inconvenience and delay customers have experienced as a result of issues primarily driven by weather ATC and crew resources.

Delta people continue working hard to deliver the operations customers have come to expect from us and we are working quickly to resolve travel issues and get customers to their destination.”

The stranded fliers told local outlet 11 Alive their flights had been delayed or cancelled multiple times.

Delta recently announced plans to reduce flights in July and August to prevent summer travel disruptions.

Dozens of Delta passengers have been stranded at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport for more than 24 hours following a slew of cancellations according to local reports.

Frustrated travelers told 11 Alive they've had flights changed or cancelled multiple times thwarting their plans and leaving them without personal items left in checked bags. Their travel woes come as more than 14000 flights within out of or into the US have been cancelled or delayed across Friday and Saturday with an additional 950 already axed on Sunday according to data from flight tracker Flight Aware.

Reports of marooned customers also follow Delta's recent announcement that it plans to cancel 100 flights per day in July and August to prevent summer travel disruptions as the airline struggles to keep up with skyrocketing demand and ongoing labor shortages.

""A variety of factors continue to impact our operations including challenges with air traffic control weather and unscheduled absences in some work groups"" a Delta spokesperson told Insider on Saturday. ""Canceling a flight is always our last resort and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience to their travel plans.""

Disabled army veteran Joe Reis told 11 Alive that the extensive delays have prevented him from returning home from his honeymoon putting a damper at the end of what had otherwise been a joyous occasion.

""Instead of it being a happy honeymoon it became a very miserable plane ride waiting for this hell hole to let us finally leave"" Reis told 11 Alive adding that he slept on the floor of the airport overnight.

Others are starting to run out of essential items like Brooke Osbourne who told 11 Alive she's now short on diapers and formula for her 11-month-old daughter.

""We've just been giving her more food throughout the day and less bottles since all of her formula is in our checked bag which is in Omaha"" Osbourne said.

While all airlines have shown signs of struggle in recent months Delta has been hit particularly hard. The carrier cancelled 700 flights during Memorial Day weekend the most of any airline. A spokesperson told Insider at the time that Delta allowed cancellations at least 24 hours ahead of departure time and found later flights for 90% of customers impacted by disruptions.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met virtually with several top airline CEOs on Thursday to discuss the industry's challenges and press the executives to find ways to improve service ahead of the July 4 holiday Reuters reported.

""Air travelers should be able to expect reliable service as demand returns to levels not seen since before the pandemic"" Buttigieg tweeted on Friday.

Last Updated 2 years ago

The carriers United Airlines and Delta Airlines have announced this week new updates to their menu options including plant-based alternatives for their customers.

As part of their new alliance with Impossible Foods United Airlines is now adding two new plant-based items to their menus on certain flights and airport lounges.

Starting this week first-class passengers will now be able to taste the United-exclusive Impossible Meatball Bowl and the Impossible Sausage on domestic flights with more than 800 miles and in Polaris lounges in San Francisco Los Angeles Newark and Chicago.

Delta Airlines on the other hand has included in its menu new farmer-direct teas cold-brew coffee wine beer sundaes and snacks. The carrier has highlighted its alliances with small businesses and suppliers from all over the world including women and LGBTQ+-led brands.

Delta has also announced that first-class passengers will be able to enjoy welcome meals and beverages before takeoff —on flights 900 miles or greater— and seasonal menus which also include plant-based options such as the harissa-spiced Impossible burger. The carrier had already announced a plant-based menu for long-haul flights a few months ago and will now include new summer options.

Both carriers have been creating new menu options to satisfy their passengers' needs testing these alternatives with their selected audience and reinstating offerings that were previously available but reduced or banned during the pandemic.

United Airlines New Menu With Plant-Based Options

The carrier has explained that the decision on including plant-based meals has been taken considering US consumers and their increasing interest in this type of food.

Aaron McMillan United Managing Director of Hospitality and Planning said: “To many travelers the quality of food choices at the airport and in the sky are a really important part of the customer experience so we're invested in making sure our menu items exceed their expectations. This is the first of many updates we look forward to sharing in the months ahead.”

The Impossible Meatball Bowl —served to first class on domestic flights with more than 800 miles— features three meatballs made from plants and broccolini a unique mixture of Impossible Foods products placed on a bed of couscous and topped with tomato sauce.

For breakfast at San Francisco Los Angeles Newark and Chicago O’Hare Polaris lounges passengers will be able to taste the Impossible Sausage as an omelet ingredient or breakfast patties in the buffet.

Dan Greene Senior Vice President of Sales at Impossible Foods also showed enthusiasm with this new alliance and menu and said: “It's exciting to see the airline bring new options to consumers that are better tasting and better for the planet. We think United flyers are going to love having access to Impossible dishes in the air and in the lounge.”

Delta Airlines New Offerings

Now that the pandemic restrictions have been eased Delta has been reintroducing hot meals and new products like plant-based lamb meatballs or impossible burgers. This week the carrier announced new products as part of their alliances with small businesses.

Kristen Manion Taylor S.V.P. of In-Flight Service at Delta said: “We’re always listening to what our customers tell us they’d like to see onboard and we’re giving them more of what they say they’re craving while also making an impact in global communities.”

Delta will be offering Thrive Farmers products in all cabins such as English Breakfast tea —and special teas for Delta One customers like Egyptian Chamomile— and also Explorer Cold Brew’s Ethiopian coffee.

The company Une Femme will offer exclusive sparkling wine for Delta Tip Top Proper Cocktails will provide Delta passengers —during trans-oceanic routes— canned margaritas or old fashioned and Kona Brewing their beers Big Wave Golden Ale for domestic flights.

The new snacks include mini Sunchips Harvest Cheddar Flavored Whole Grain Snacks Lemon Coconut bars from Kate’s Real Food and for Delta One customers even gourmet ice cream from High Road Craft. Product availability will depend on the routes passengers class and availability.

""But they’re worth every single penny because they’re my favorite duet partner of all time. So if you will indulge me"" J.Lo added before Emme began singing Christina Perri’s ""A Thousand Years"" with a bedazzled rainbow microphone.

Emme further joined J.Lo for a verse of Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"" and the intro of ""Let's Get Loud.""

Scientists have identified a distinct subpopulation of polar bears in southeastern Greenland that in an area with little sea ice survive by hunting from ice that breaks off glaciers.



The discovery suggests a way that a small number of bears might survive as warming continues and more of the sea ice that they normally depend on disappears. But the researchers and other polar experts cautioned that grave risks to the overall polar bear population in the Arctic remain and will only be lessened by cutting greenhouse gas emissions to curb global warming.





The subpopulation believed to number several hundred animals was identified during a multiyear study of what was thought to be a single population of bears along Greenland’s entire 1800-mile-long east coast. Through analysis of satellite-tracked movements tissue samples and other data the bears in the southeast were found to be isolated both physically and genetically from the others.“This was a wholly unexpected finding” said Kristin Laidre a biologist at the University of Washington who has studied marine mammal ecology in Greenland for two decades. Laidre is the lead author of a paper on the subpopulation published Thursday in the journal Science.Southeastern Greenland is especially remote with narrow fjords hemmed in by steep mountains. At the inland end there are often glaciers that terminate in the water; at the other end is open ocean with a strong south-flowing current. “These bears are very geographically isolated” Laidre said. “They’ve really kind of evolved to being residents because that’s the only way to live down there.” The researchers estimated that this subpopulation had been isolated for at least several hundred years.Overall there are an estimated 26000 polar bears around the Arctic in 19 officially designated subpopulations. The animals live on the seasonal sea ice hunting their primary prey seals as the seals bask on the ice or come up for air through breathing holes. But the rapid warming of the Arctic linked to human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases has reduced the extent and duration of sea-ice cover.Some subpopulations notably one in the southern Beaufort Sea off Alaska and Canada are already declining because the ice does not persist long enough for the bears to hunt enough food for themselves and their offspring. Polar bear experts say that if the world continues to warm polar bears could become nearly extinct by the end of the century.Southeastern Greenland is relatively warm and the fjords there have less sea-ice cover than many other areas with polar bears — on average about 100 days a year with enough ice for them to live and hunt on.“We know that that is just too few for a polar bear to survive” Laidre said. Those are the kinds of conditions that may become widespread elsewhere in the Arctic later this century.Laidre and her colleagues found that the Southeastern Greenland bears hunt from sea ice while it is around. But when it’s gone the bears have other ice to hunt from: the freshwater ice that calves off from the glaciers into the fjords as icebergs and progressively smaller chunks and that persists most of the yearThe bears hunt from this floating mix of ice called glacial mélange in the same way they hunt from the sea ice. “It gives them an extra and uncommon ice platform that bears in many other places don’t have” Laidre said allowing them to catch enough seals for them and their offspring to survive and thrive.But habitats like this are rare said Twila Moon a scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder Colorado who analyzed sea-ice and glacial-ice cover in the fjords as part of the research.“There are limited locations in the Arctic where we see substantial and consistent production of glacial mélange” Moon said. In addition to some areas in Greenland the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard has glaciers that terminate in the water.So while these special conditions may allow some bears to survive as the sea ice continues to shrink overall the animals will continue to be threatened by climate change.“We are expecting to see large declines of polar bears across the Arctic under current warming trajectories” Laidre said. “And this study doesn’t change that.”Steven Amstrup chief scientist with conservation group Polar Bears International who was not involved in the research said the study was “really thoroughly done” and “points to a very discrete group of bears.”Whether it constitutes a 20th official subpopulation is up to a group of experts to decide under the auspices of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

According to reports the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the National Payments Corporation of India International (NPCI International) and the Lyra Network of France a French payment solution company has been initiated.

As part of the agreement Lyra Networks would allow Indians to pay using UPI and Rupay cards at various stations and machines supported by Lyra Networks making payment easier for Indian students and tourists.

Countries already using UPI – UAE Singapore Nepal Bhutan.

The entire world is witnessing that India conducts 5.5 billion UPI transactions in a month which is a noteworthy achievement for India. In a discussion with media outlets the concerned minister stated that this MoU with France is a significant step toward globalization.

Feeling proud of this achievement? Want to know more about India’s international forays? Then stay tuned and keep reading.

1. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) started with one product in 2008 and now has a portfolio full of innovative and one-of-a-kind digital payment products. NPCI has successfully formed alliances with Discover Financial Services in the United States Japan Credit Bureau in Japan Union Pay International in China the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) of Bhutan and the Network for Electronic Transfers in Singapore.

Following NPCI Board and RBI approval NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) was established on April 3 2020 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). NIPL is dedicated to the operation of RuPay (domestic card scheme) and UPI (mobile payment solution) outside of India. To grow NPCI’s digital payment offerings the foreign subsidiary has formed relationships with banks and payment partners.

2. NIPL entered the UAE market in April 2022 collaborating with NeoPay Mashreq Bank’s payment subsidiary to facilitate Unified Payments Interface-based payments to Indians visiting these countries.

3. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Reserve Bank of India announced plans on September 4 2021 to integrate Singapore’s PayNow and India’s Unified Payments Interface real-time payment systems by July 2022. Users should be able to conduct quick low-cost financial transfers straight from one bank account to another between Singapore and India.

4. NIPL and the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) of Bhutan agreed in July 2021 to introduce the Unified Payments Interface in Bhutan. More than 200000 Indian visitors visit Bhutan each year and this facility is intended to benefit them.

5. To implement a Unified Payment Interface in Nepal NIPL partnered with Gateway Payments Service Pvt Ltd an approved Payment System Operator in Nepal and Manam Infotech Private Limited in February 2022. Nepal is the first country outside of India to use this as a payment platform paving the way for cash transactions to become more digital.

The emergence of the UPI craze

According to Fidelity’s Annual Global Faster Payment Report the Unified Payment Interface is the “Most advanced sophisticated public digital Payments infrastructure in the world.”

The magnitude and speed with which UPI operates are mind-boggling. On this platform the number of active Indian banks counts to 143. The platform reached 1 billion transactions in October 2019 and has over 100 million active users on its platform. Nowhere else in the world has such a facility existed nor has such a large number of transactions ever occurred on a single platform.

The competitive edge of UPI

UPI has moved India well ahead of the rest of the globe and Indians can transfer money using QR codes and other techniques while most nations still rely on old means. In developed economies card payments remain the most popular method of payment. Cheque payments are still the talk of the town in many European nations. Challenger banks or new era banks emerged as a result of this.

When it comes to digital innovation in the financial industry India and China are well ahead of the rest of the globe. The nations with a substantial number of unicorn start-ups are India and China. AliPay and Wechat are seamless in China although they are not as simple as UPI.

What is UPI?

The National Payments Corporation of India created UPI as an instant real-time payment system to facilitate inter-bank transactions. Mobile-based payments have become one of the most popular kinds of digital payments since they are convenient safe and cost-effective. UPI allowed 45.6 billion transactions worth $1 trillion in the previous fiscal year making it the world’s best-performing real-time payment platform.

DG,Dollar General,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L2JldHRlci1idXktZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwtdnMtZG9sbGFyLXRyZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Dollar General vs. Dollar Tree,"Which discount retailer is a better defensive play?

Dollar General (DG 2.76%) and Dollar Tree (DLTR 1.24%) the two largest dollar store chains in America have been resilient stocks to own during recessions. Both retailers usually become popular destinations during economic downturns as cash-strapped shoppers hunt for bargains.

Both companies continued to expand their fleet of brick-and-mortar stores as the ""retail apocalypse"" crushed other retailers over the past decade. They also shored up their defenses against Amazon and Walmart by targeting lower-income neighborhoods.

As the U.S. teeters on the brink of a recession Dollar General and Dollar Tree both look like solid defensive investments. But is one of these discount retailers a more compelling buy right now?

The differences between these two stores

Dollar General isn't a true ""dollar"" store that sells everything for a dollar. Instead it's a discount retailer that primarily targets rural areas that haven't been saturated by superstores.

Between the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2022 Dollar General expanded its total store count from 13601 to 18356 locations. Its annual revenue expanded at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2% from fiscal 2016 to 2021 and it experienced accelerating sales throughout the pandemic as more shoppers stocked up on household products.

Dollar General's gross margin increased from 30.8% in fiscal 2016 to 31.6% in fiscal 2021 even as it endured higher tariffs on Chinese products during the Trump Administration and its earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 18.1% throughout those five years.

Dollar Tree acquired its rival Family Dollar in 2015 and it mainly serves urban and suburban areas. Dollar Tree's namesake banner initially sold all of its products for $1 but raised its prices for the first time to $1.25 last year.

Family Dollar sells most of its products for less than $10. But over the past few years Family Dollar added Dollar Tree sections to some of its locations while converting others to Family Dollar and Dollar Tree ""combo"" stores. Between the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2022 the company expanded its combined store count from 14482 to 16162 locations.

Between fiscal 2016 and 2021 Dollar Tree's annual revenue increased at a CAGR of 4.9% as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 8.9%. However its gross margin declined from 37.3% in 2016 to 29.4% in 2021 as it grappled with higher tariffs and sluggish sales at Family Dollar which struggled a lot more against its discount competitors than its Dollar Tree stores.

Family Dollar also temporarily closed about 400 of its stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to deal with product recalls related to a rodent infestation. Dollar General didn't suffer any comparable setbacks.

Investors are more bullish on Dollar General

Over the past five years Dollar General's stock has rallied more than 230% as Dollar Tree's stock advanced nearly 120%. Dollar General attracted more bulls than Dollar Tree for four simple reasons: Its focus on rural areas exposed it to less competition it was growing faster its gross margins were expanding instead of contracting and it wasn't burdened by a slow-growth banner like Family Dollar.

That trend could continue this year. For fiscal 2022 Dollar General expects its same-store sales to rise 3% to 3.5% and for its net sales to improve 10%-10.5% (including a two-percentage-point benefit from a 53rd week) as it opens 1110 new stores. It expects its EPS to increase 12% to 14% (which also incudes a four-percentage-point benefit from the 53rd week).

Dollar Tree expects its same-store sales to rise by the mid-single digits in fiscal 2022 and for its net sales to grow 5.5%-7%. It didn't provide an exact target for its new store openings but it expects its total selling square footage to increase by approximately 3.9% for the full year. It expects its EPS to grow 34% to 41% as it raises its prices and reins in its expenses.

The valuations and verdict

Dollar General trades at 20 times forward earnings and pays a forward dividend yield of nearly 1%. Dollar Tree trades at 19 times forward earnings and doesn't pay any dividends.

Dollar General and Dollar Tree should both be good stocks to own as inflation and rising rates rattle the markets. But if I had to choose one over the other I'd still stick with Dollar General -- it clearly beats Dollar Tree across several key areas trades at a comparable valuation and pays a dividend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy80LWRvbGxhci1zdG9yZS1pdGVtcy1hbWVyaWNhbnMtMTMwMTE4NjExLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Dollar Store Items Americans Are Purchasing the Most Right Now,"Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com

Dollar stores are a mainstay in American life with a 2020 survey indicating that around 60% of Americans had shopped at a Dollar Tree in the previous 12 months. The two heavyweights in the industry are Dollar General and Dollar Tree which purchased Family Dollar in 2015. But these true “dollar stores” are also under increasing competition from the likes of Target Walmart Ikea and Costco. Despite that there are still some items shoppers can’t help saving on at dollar stores.

To determine what Americans are buying at dollar stores GOBankingRates conducted a survey of 1037 American adults in early April 2022. Highlights of the results are below along with advice on what experts say you should and should not be buying at dollar stores.

What Is Most Bought at Dollar Stores?

Purchases made exclusively at dollar stores as opposed to the other options such as Costco and Ikea are diversified. Food was the most common response at 24% followed closely by personal care items at 22%. Party supplies and home goods ranked highly as well pulling in 17% and 15% of the vote respectively.

What Is Least Bought at Dollar Stores?

The clear losers when it comes to items bought at dollar stores are kitchen appliances and apparel. As kitchen appliances are often high-dollar items it makes sense that more consumers would use big-box stores like Costco for those types of purchases. Apparel however seems like it would be a good fit for a dollar store purchase but it only generated about 4% of the vote.

What Should You Really Be Buying at Dollar Stores?

Dollar stores offer lots of low-cost merchandise but some deals stand out more than others. While you can get equal or lower prices on some items at other stores dollar stores shine in certain particular areas. According to experts these are typically some of the best things to buy at a dollar store.

Greeting Cards

Dollar stores might not offer the widest variety of choice when it comes to greeting cards but you can’t beat the price. Greeting cards at drugstores and other retailers commonly top $5 each far more than you’ll pay at a dollar store.

Picture Frames

Unless you’re looking for a fancy embossed frame to house your new Monet dollar stores offer perfectly functional frames for much lower prices than at other outlets.

Picnic and Party Supplies

Dollar stores are perfect outlets for one-time events such as picnics and parties. As you won’t need your products to last more than one time you don’t have to spend the money to invest in more durable items. Just be sure that you buy enough as dollar store per-pack quantities are often small.

What Should You Avoid Buying at Dollar Stores?

Human nature dictates that we seek out the cheapest price for items we want to buy. However sometimes price isn’t everything. Although low prices can be found at dollar stores sometimes the items offered are of lower quality or nearing their expiration dates. For this reason experts advise that you shouldn’t simply buy everything you need at a dollar store. These items in particular have been noted by experts as things to avoid at dollar stores.

Batteries

Most dollar store batteries are carbon-zinc instead of alkaline. Although the price is right you’ll likely have to replace those batteries very frequently. Carbon-zinc batteries can also be damaging to devices if they leak.

Beauty Products

Beauty products at dollar stores are often old or lower quality. Unless you can find some marked-down name brands it’s best to skip the beauty aisle especially in the case of SPF products which may no longer provide the protection you need.

Tools

When you buy a tool you need it to be durable to handle heavy impacts and strong forces. Dollar store tools typically can’t cope.

DLTR,Dollar Tree,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L2JldHRlci1idXktZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwtdnMtZG9sbGFyLXRyZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Dollar General vs. Dollar Tree,"Which discount retailer is a better defensive play?

Dollar General (DG 2.76%) and Dollar Tree (DLTR 1.24%) the two largest dollar store chains in America have been resilient stocks to own during recessions. Both retailers usually become popular destinations during economic downturns as cash-strapped shoppers hunt for bargains.

Both companies continued to expand their fleet of brick-and-mortar stores as the ""retail apocalypse"" crushed other retailers over the past decade. They also shored up their defenses against Amazon and Walmart by targeting lower-income neighborhoods.

As the U.S. teeters on the brink of a recession Dollar General and Dollar Tree both look like solid defensive investments. But is one of these discount retailers a more compelling buy right now?

The differences between these two stores

Dollar General isn't a true ""dollar"" store that sells everything for a dollar. Instead it's a discount retailer that primarily targets rural areas that haven't been saturated by superstores.

Between the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2022 Dollar General expanded its total store count from 13601 to 18356 locations. Its annual revenue expanded at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2% from fiscal 2016 to 2021 and it experienced accelerating sales throughout the pandemic as more shoppers stocked up on household products.

Dollar General's gross margin increased from 30.8% in fiscal 2016 to 31.6% in fiscal 2021 even as it endured higher tariffs on Chinese products during the Trump Administration and its earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 18.1% throughout those five years.

Dollar Tree acquired its rival Family Dollar in 2015 and it mainly serves urban and suburban areas. Dollar Tree's namesake banner initially sold all of its products for $1 but raised its prices for the first time to $1.25 last year.

Family Dollar sells most of its products for less than $10. But over the past few years Family Dollar added Dollar Tree sections to some of its locations while converting others to Family Dollar and Dollar Tree ""combo"" stores. Between the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2022 the company expanded its combined store count from 14482 to 16162 locations.

Between fiscal 2016 and 2021 Dollar Tree's annual revenue increased at a CAGR of 4.9% as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 8.9%. However its gross margin declined from 37.3% in 2016 to 29.4% in 2021 as it grappled with higher tariffs and sluggish sales at Family Dollar which struggled a lot more against its discount competitors than its Dollar Tree stores.

Family Dollar also temporarily closed about 400 of its stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to deal with product recalls related to a rodent infestation. Dollar General didn't suffer any comparable setbacks.

Investors are more bullish on Dollar General

Over the past five years Dollar General's stock has rallied more than 230% as Dollar Tree's stock advanced nearly 120%. Dollar General attracted more bulls than Dollar Tree for four simple reasons: Its focus on rural areas exposed it to less competition it was growing faster its gross margins were expanding instead of contracting and it wasn't burdened by a slow-growth banner like Family Dollar.

That trend could continue this year. For fiscal 2022 Dollar General expects its same-store sales to rise 3% to 3.5% and for its net sales to improve 10%-10.5% (including a two-percentage-point benefit from a 53rd week) as it opens 1110 new stores. It expects its EPS to increase 12% to 14% (which also incudes a four-percentage-point benefit from the 53rd week).

Dollar Tree expects its same-store sales to rise by the mid-single digits in fiscal 2022 and for its net sales to grow 5.5%-7%. It didn't provide an exact target for its new store openings but it expects its total selling square footage to increase by approximately 3.9% for the full year. It expects its EPS to grow 34% to 41% as it raises its prices and reins in its expenses.

The valuations and verdict

Dollar General trades at 20 times forward earnings and pays a forward dividend yield of nearly 1%. Dollar Tree trades at 19 times forward earnings and doesn't pay any dividends.

Dollar General and Dollar Tree should both be good stocks to own as inflation and rising rates rattle the markets. But if I had to choose one over the other I'd still stick with Dollar General -- it clearly beats Dollar Tree across several key areas trades at a comparable valuation and pays a dividend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy80LWRvbGxhci1zdG9yZS1pdGVtcy1hbWVyaWNhbnMtMTMwMTE4NjExLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Dollar Store Items Americans Are Purchasing the Most Right Now,"Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com

Dollar stores are a mainstay in American life with a 2020 survey indicating that around 60% of Americans had shopped at a Dollar Tree in the previous 12 months. The two heavyweights in the industry are Dollar General and Dollar Tree which purchased Family Dollar in 2015. But these true “dollar stores” are also under increasing competition from the likes of Target Walmart Ikea and Costco. Despite that there are still some items shoppers can’t help saving on at dollar stores.

To determine what Americans are buying at dollar stores GOBankingRates conducted a survey of 1037 American adults in early April 2022. Highlights of the results are below along with advice on what experts say you should and should not be buying at dollar stores.

What Is Most Bought at Dollar Stores?

Purchases made exclusively at dollar stores as opposed to the other options such as Costco and Ikea are diversified. Food was the most common response at 24% followed closely by personal care items at 22%. Party supplies and home goods ranked highly as well pulling in 17% and 15% of the vote respectively.

What Is Least Bought at Dollar Stores?

The clear losers when it comes to items bought at dollar stores are kitchen appliances and apparel. As kitchen appliances are often high-dollar items it makes sense that more consumers would use big-box stores like Costco for those types of purchases. Apparel however seems like it would be a good fit for a dollar store purchase but it only generated about 4% of the vote.

What Should You Really Be Buying at Dollar Stores?

Dollar stores offer lots of low-cost merchandise but some deals stand out more than others. While you can get equal or lower prices on some items at other stores dollar stores shine in certain particular areas. According to experts these are typically some of the best things to buy at a dollar store.

Greeting Cards

Dollar stores might not offer the widest variety of choice when it comes to greeting cards but you can’t beat the price. Greeting cards at drugstores and other retailers commonly top $5 each far more than you’ll pay at a dollar store.

Picture Frames

Unless you’re looking for a fancy embossed frame to house your new Monet dollar stores offer perfectly functional frames for much lower prices than at other outlets.

Picnic and Party Supplies

Dollar stores are perfect outlets for one-time events such as picnics and parties. As you won’t need your products to last more than one time you don’t have to spend the money to invest in more durable items. Just be sure that you buy enough as dollar store per-pack quantities are often small.

What Should You Avoid Buying at Dollar Stores?

Human nature dictates that we seek out the cheapest price for items we want to buy. However sometimes price isn’t everything. Although low prices can be found at dollar stores sometimes the items offered are of lower quality or nearing their expiration dates. For this reason experts advise that you shouldn’t simply buy everything you need at a dollar store. These items in particular have been noted by experts as things to avoid at dollar stores.

Batteries

Most dollar store batteries are carbon-zinc instead of alkaline. Although the price is right you’ll likely have to replace those batteries very frequently. Carbon-zinc batteries can also be damaging to devices if they leak.

Beauty Products

Beauty products at dollar stores are often old or lower quality. Unless you can find some marked-down name brands it’s best to skip the beauty aisle especially in the case of SPF products which may no longer provide the protection you need.

Tools

When you buy a tool you need it to be durable to handle heavy impacts and strong forces. Dollar store tools typically can’t cope.

In June 1972 less than three years after Hurricane Camille brought Richmond its worst James River flood in the modern era Hurricane Agnes brought even higher waters.

Agnes wasn’t even close to Camille; it was far worse. At the Westham Station river gauge near the Huguenot Bridge the river crested at 16.62 feet above flood stage on June 23 1972.

Downtown it was even higher cresting at a staggering 28 feet above flood stage at the City Locks along Dock Street — 5 feet higher than Camille.

One other flood since in November 1985 was on par with Camille but nothing else has been close. So far in the 21st century the James has reached no higher than 10 feet above flood stage falling just shy of the 10-foot threshold in late February 2003.

The flooding from Hurricane Gaston in 2004 was from flash flooding or water collecting in the Shockoe Valley from localized heavy rains. The floodwall completed in 1995 only protects the city from the James River.

Richmond had seen worse from the James only one other time since its founding in what was called the Great Fresh of 1771. Reports from that time vary but many suggest the James was around 40 feet above normal.

***

Over the six days leading up to the 1972 crest 7 inches of rain fell in Richmond but rainfall upstream is where it matters. Two days before the peak of the flood in Richmond Lynchburg had 6 inches of rain in one day and all that water began rushing down the James.

On that same day Charlottesville had 6 inches of rain. Similarly that water raced down the Rivanna River to meet up with the James and take over Richmond.

Agnes was no longer a full-fledged hurricane by the time its rain arrived in Virginia and it did not act alone. Another system approached from the north to interact with Agnes and intensify its rainfall. Even so it is not a coincidence that the three largest floods in Richmond’s modern era all involved storms having origins in the tropics.

Having just gone through Camille three summers earlier the city thought it had an idea of what to expect proactively closing the Boulevard and Mayo bridges in advance of the rising water.

But early during the morning of June 23 the water purification plant succumbed to the flood. Soon afterwards the Army had to start flying in tanks of water to people living in the city. Water then flooded the Vepco (now Dominion Energy) 12th Street power station cutting off power to downtown.

At 7 a.m. that morning the city ordered the downtown area sealed off. Barricades went up staffed by police and the National Guard.

With water resources rapidly becoming scarce city firefighters went around to commercial areas ordering all but essential water use stopped.

The next morning the headline in the Times-Dispatch was more bleak: State City Water Shortages Critical; Flood Damage $160 million 17 Dead

With only the Lee Bridge open to traffic backups ballooned to seven miles in each direction to get across the river. The then-new Manchester Bridge had to be opened early for emergency traffic and heavy trucks were routed along the brand new bridge to keep the weight load down on the Lee Bridge.

Closing the Mayo Bridge had been an excellent decision as the bridge was entirely covered in water. The street light poles sticking out of the water were the only visible evidence of the bridge.

***

A report from the National Hurricane Center later in 1972 revised the statewide damage estimates to $126 million. Adjusting for inflation puts the damages at around $850 million in 2022 dollars.

Thirteen people died as a direct result of the flood.

A flood of this magnitude gets seared into your memory. A few people shared what it was like:

""Due to Richmond’s water and sewer system being damaged by the flood waters we had no water and were told to not flush except for extreme needs (advised to put Saran Wrap over toilet bowl to keep odors at bay).""

- Leslie Payne Richmond

***

""Was working for Vepco at 7th and Franklin. We had our own lunchroom but they had no water as the water treatment plant got flooded. Military brought in water dispensers and they served us on paper plates with plastic utensils. Getting to work from Sandston was a real challenge. Looked like a war zone with national guard blocking roads that were flooded.""

- Sharon Marston Ashland

***

""I remember vividly my dad driving my brother and I to see the flood downtown Richmond and seeing the National Guard troops with their rifles. I was 6. I told my dad to go past them and get closer. Dad asked if I wanted to get shot by the soldiers. I guess Kent State still had folks on edge.""

- Don Chandler Richmond

***

""I was a child but I remember the Nickel Bridge (aka Boulevard Bridge) was closed to traffic but we could walk out on it. The river was so high and fast and the debris was unbelievable.""

- Ann Normand Davidson Richmond

***

""I was in the Air Force stationed at Andrews AFB. I was due to come home to Richmond on that day for 45 days of leave before deploying to my next assignment. I started down I-95 south but just south of Fredericksburg it was closed. I had to go back to Fredericksburg and take Route 301 to Richmond. Drove my ‘64 Corvair across a half washed-out bridge to get to Richmond. I remember the only thing visible on the Mayo Bridge were tops of the street lights.""

- Charlie Frank Richmond

***

Agnes went on to produce devastating flooding farther northward in most of central Pennsylvania and in several parts of Upstate New York. Many of those flood records remain unbroken as well.

Later this week we'll take a closer look at the Richmond City Floodwall to see if it is ready for another Agnes.

He started as a delivery driver for the company 14 years ago and worked his way up to supervising. As supervisor Krueger ensures that general mangers maintain Domino’s standards in their restaurants.

“I am incredibly honored and excited to receive this award” Krueger said. “This award means so much to me. Winning is affirmation that I have what it takes in this business. It feels great to be honored for doing something I love.”

Three regional winners were chosen from supervisors all across the country and Krueger was selected as the overall winner at a company ceremony in Las Vegas in May.

When Krueger’s boss called him to tell him the news Krueger said he was silent on the phone for two minutes.

“I was speechless when I found out. I didn’t say anything” Krueger said. “It was awesome. I was nervous very nervous but it was great to be acknowledged by your peers for something that you do day in and day out.”

Supervisors who have been in the position for at least 26 weeks were considered for the award. A Domino’s spokesperson said Krueger stood out among the rest because of his ability to lead his restaurants to produce “outstanding results” in sales profitability and customer satisfaction.

“Chris continues to deliver an unprecedented work ethic and great leadership to the Domino’s brand” said Fred Lund Domino’s senior vice president of global development. “This kind of direction takes our brand to the next level and we congratulate him on this great accomplishment.”

According to Domino’s 90% of franchise owners began as delivery drivers for the company. Krueger said he was grateful for the advancement opportunities he has earned over the last 14 years with Domino’s.

“When I first started working at Domino’s back then it was just a job to me; it was just a paycheck” Krueger said. “But I didn’t really know what the brand had to offer as far as where you can move up the line. The big thing is ... if you push yourself and apply yourself Domino’s has a lot to offer people.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3czRzYW5hbnRvbmlvLmNvbS9uZXdzbGV0dGVyLWRhaWx5LzE5LXllYXItb2xkLXN1c3BlY3Qtc3RpbGwtYXQtbGFyZ2UtYWZ0ZXItYW4tYXJtZWQtcm9iYmVyeS1hdC1kb21pbm9zLXBpenph0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzNHNhbmFudG9uaW8uY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzbGV0dGVyLWRhaWx5LzE5LXllYXItb2xkLXN1c3BlY3Qtc3RpbGwtYXQtbGFyZ2UtYWZ0ZXItYW4tYXJtZWQtcm9iYmVyeS1hdC1kb21pbm9zLXBpenph?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,19-year-old suspect still at large after an armed robbery at Domino's Pizza,"KERRVILLE - The Kerrville Police Department is searching for Logan Rene Rodriguez 19 who was accused of being involved in an armed robbery at Domino's Pizza.

Early Friday morning KPD arrived on the scene at 305 Sidney Baker where an aggravated robbery had recently taken place.

The two suspects Rodriguez and Antonio Valdez had allegedly stolen cash from a Domino's delivery driver while flashing their handguns. Rodriguez and Valdez fled from the area quickly after.

When KPD officers arrived on the scene they obtained information on the suspect's vehicle after seeing security cameras. The officers located the SUV on the 100 block of Willow Way and Valdez was called in for questioning. He was later arrested and is currently in Kerr County Jail.

A warrant has been issued for Logan Rene Rodriguez's arrest who still hasn't been located. Rodriguez is perceived to be 5’10” tall and weighing about 155 pounds with black hair brown eyes and a light mustache and goatee.

This is an ongoing and active investigation.

Citing an insider scoop AutismCapital claimed that Abracadabra accrued $12 million in bad debt as a direct result of Terra’s sudden downfall “because liquidations couldn't happen fast enough to cover the protocol’s MIM liabilities.”

We have a scoop from one of our associate autists: MIM (Magic Internet Money) may be nearly insolvent. MIM is one of the larger stablecoins with a market cap of ~$300M.

Daniele Sestagalli founder of Abracadabra however refuted the claims of insolvency by ensuring to have enough funds to pay back the piling debts — which has been attributed to the falling MIM prices. Sestagalli stated:

“[The Abracadabra] Treasury has more money than the debt and $CRV are valuable for the protocol.”

Doubling down on his stance Sestagalli further publicly shared the treasury address holding $12 million in assets while asking concerned investors to verify the same using on-chain data.

On the other hand Autism Capital alleged that Sestagalli’s bad debt was created five days ago and shared the below screenshot showing his conversation about the same on MIM’s Discord group.

While the risk of insolvency continues to threaten the Abracadabra protocol either through the MIM treasury continuing to dump in value or more bad debt created investors are advised to keep track of market fluctuations and “do your own research” (DYOR) before making investment decisions.

Pink features heavily in pattern designer Molly Mahon’s English country cottage and she certainly has rose-tinted glasses on when remembering how she her husband and their three children—the youngest just a baby—literally camped out in a couple of tents in the garden for eight months while their home was being renovated. “It made life so pared back and simple” she recalls. It also meant she could oversee everything. The work involved moving the property’s staircase to improve the flow downstairs and digging down into the ground to give her 6-foot-4 husband enough headroom. Mahon doesn’t regret making the house more functional for her family of five but she’s glad the camping part is behind them. “I wouldn’t do it now” she says with a laugh.

That was 10 years ago. Over the past decade Mahon has slowly layered the cottage’s rooms (the oldest parts of the property date back to the 1600s!) with colorful fabrics and wall coverings of her own block-printed designs to charming effect. “I wanted to use my own pieces so perhaps in a way it was easier” she says. The home’s forest location means it can feel dark a fact remedied by Mahon who used pink (specifically Farrow & Ball’s Pink Ground paint color) in as many rooms she could get away with. “I’m obsessed” she attests. “The whole house would be pink if I had my way. I find it gives off a warm and comforting glow.”

The couple had accumulated plenty of furniture and objects when they were in their last house so this one filled pretty quickly. In the winter Mahon loves nothing more than hunkering down in front of the sitting room’s fire with a needlework kit bringing to life jaunty cushions that she backs with fabrics from her studio. She embellished the fireplace herself with paint in a style inspired by a nearby holiday home that was once a gathering point for the free-spirited artists writers and thinkers known as the Bloomsbury Group and added a similarly inexpensive yet unique flourish to the kitchen’s plain shelves with block-printed paper edges cut into scallops.

The unstructured “skirt” lampshades that are peppered through the house were another DIY (one she loved so much she started selling them on her website). “I think we’ve got a bit funny about making something for our home. [The term] craft has got such a granny-ish vibe to it” she muses “but for me craft has changed my world.”

Mahon is aware that her maximalist taste perhaps isn’t everyone’s cup of tea but one area she advises getting busy with pattern is a tight space such as a hallway or staircase. Her landing is so “ridiculously narrow” that the beds had to be made into two pieces just to move them up the steps but the oak leaf wallpaper (which she block-printed herself on-site) “really opens it up because it gives that depth of field to it” she says.

The primary bedroom is also an incubator for clashing prints. “I couldn’t bear the thought of sleeping in a white room” she admits. Mahon pinned up a large swath of fabric behind the headboard to make up for the fact that they couldn’t squeeze a four-poster bed in the space. Plus it was easier (and safer) than mounting artwork. “It didn’t feel right to have glass frames above my head” she explains “so the poppy print was a really cool solution.” The simple slatted-wood bedside tables topped with glass are another clever way to bring in more soft furnishings.

The house has evolved as quickly as Mahon’s children now ages 15 13 and 9 but she thinks she has finally achieved a “timelessness” with their bedrooms. All the kids have what she calls “proper beds” upholstered in fabrics of her own design and which she believes will see them through their teenage years.

When guests come to stay the family bunks together in various formations to free up a space but no one’s room is more hardworking than 13-year-old Lani’s where there are two single beds pushed together. “It’s a movable feast—they can be separated out for sleepovers” justifies Mahon. “Every room has its own character and suits each child but anyone can sleep in there and feel comfortable; that’s always my aim.”

Fuel laundering a type of fuel fraud is the criminal act of removing government fuel markers that are in fuels allocated for lower-taxed essential uses such as agriculture and home heating and selling them for higher taxed uses such as automotive to avoid taxes that generate necessary revenue for governments.

In the European Union (EU) fuel fraud costs governments 7 to 10 billion EUR in tax losses each year* - money that would otherwise be spent on public services. For consumers fuel fraud means that petrol products are adulterated leading to low quality fuels that may leave harmful deposits in car engines which can damages them to the extent of breakdown.

Fuel fraud also has consequences for the environment. It causes environmental pollution due to the use of chemicals to attempt to separate the marker from the fuel and the illegal dumpling of the toxic waste products from this process.

There really is no such thing as a free lunch.

An anonymous bidder paid a record-breaking $19 million for a private steak lunch with legendary investor Warren Buffett. The sale was part of the 21st annual auction for a lunch with Buffett produced in collaboration with eBay and the Glide Foundation a San Francisco-based non-profit working on combating poverty hunger and homelessness.

The bidding started with $25000 on June 12 and ended with $19000100 from an anonymous bidder on Friday according to a news release from eBay.

This year’s huge sum is more than four times the winning bid of $4567888 in 2019 — the last auction before a hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 2019’s winner was cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun.

The mystery winner will enjoy a private lunch with Buffett and up to seven guests at Smith & Wollensky Steakhouse in New York City says eBay.

Unfortunately for aspiring investors hoping to top this year’s record this is the last year of the “power lunch” with Buffett. The annual auction has raised over $53 million for Glide.

“On behalf of GLIDE and those we serve I thank Warren Buffett for his unwavering generosity partnership and dedication and for his incredible contribution to our mission” said the organization’s president and CEO Karen Hanrahan in the news release.

The auction was first started by the late Susie Buffett in 2000. Since 2003 eBay has managed the auction.

“We are incredibly proud that Warren Buffett’s final Power Lunch has broken our all-time record of funds raised with all proceeds supporting GLIDE’s efforts to create pathways out of crisis and transform lives” said eBay CEO Jamie Iannone in the release.

Guest columnist

In nearly every sector the pandemic exacerbated extant challenges and education is no exception. The effects of learning loss teacher shortages and disparities in access feel more pressing than ever and yet there is reason to be optimistic. Effective evidence-based interventions do exist. One of those is Children’s Defense Fund Freedom Schools.

At the University of West Florida College of Education and Professional Studies our faculty conduct research to better understand and identify solutions to challenges facing educators. This scholarship informs how we prepare teacher candidates for the classroom.

In the fall of 2020 the Freedom School president and board reached out to our teacher education program to discuss how UWF could become involved. Through our discussions we identified that a partnership would be mutually beneficial and Dr. Karen Evans a faculty member in the Department of Teacher Education and Educational Leadership was identified as the liaison who would develop a partnership. Evans reached out to UWF alumni and students to fill staff positions. Briana McCreary an alumna of UWF's Educational Leadership program was chosen as one of the site coordinators and Jacquelynne Poling a recent graduate of our ESE/Elementary program was selected to serve as a servant leader intern.

The CDF Freedom Schools program is a free six-week summer literacy and cultural enrichment initiative that serves children in communities where quality academic enrichment programming is limited too expensive or non-existent.

With origins in the Mississippi Freedom Summer project of 1964 which brought college students from across the country to Mississippi to secure justice and voting rights for Black citizens CDF Freedom Schools continue to engage college students as instructors - servant leader interns - and build a love of reading and sense of empowerment in young students referred to as scholars. Scholars learn about histories that are often overlooked in traditional curricula and read books featuring characters of color written by authors of color.

The Central Gulf Coast CDF Freedom Schools targets elementary school children living in areas of concentrated poverty and/or who attend consistently low performing elementary schools in Escambia County. This is the demographic group most at-risk for pandemic-related learning loss. As demonstrated in a 2020 study by the Pew Research Center 41% of low-income parents were very concerned about their children falling behind as a result of disruptions caused by the pandemic.

'Save our future::Pensacola Freedom School students march to support youth justice

This disparity is also manifest in summer learning loss. Recent research shows that the average student loses 17-34% of the prior year’s learning gains across the summer months and those students who have experienced learning loss in one summer were more prone to also lose ground in subsequent summers. Again CDF Freedom Schools offer promise. Nationally more than 81% of participating Freedom Schools student scholars avoided summer reading loss. At the Central Gulf Coast CDF Freedom Schools specifically 87% experienced no reading loss according to the basic reading inventory which is used to measure scholars’ reading proficiency before and after Freedom School.

CDF Freedom Schools employs a research-based integrated reading curriculum that features a diverse body of children’s literature that celebrates multiple racial and cultural identities. Essentially the program makes reading enjoyable through books that are relatable and empowering. This is critical to creating lifelong readers especially at a time when National Assessment of Educational Progress data show that among U.S. children reading for fun has become less common. During the 2021 summer program CGC Freedom Schools scholars read an average of 18.6 books per week during the six-week program.

Another challenge facing K-12 education that has been making news headlines of late is the national teacher shortage. Teacher shortages predate the pandemic and are the result of a host of factors. While there is no magic bullet the CDF Freedom Schools model does address one crucial factor: Teacher development and mentoring that effectively create a stable pipeline of educators.

Central to CDF Freedom Schools is its intergenerational leadership model. The program is staffed primarily by college students and recent college graduates with a 10:1 child to adult ratio. The program is designed not only to impact the scholars but also the college-age men and women who teach them. The program employs site coordinators who are experienced educators; these site coordinators offer their experience and insights to the servant leader interns. Programs that provide teacher candidates with an expert teacher mentor in a clinical setting have proven to be an effective tool in creating a strong and stable teaching force.

After the proven success of the program during the summer of 2021 a formal memorandum of understanding was signed between our College and Central Gulf Coast CDF Freedom School. We will continue to provide faculty and staff support and I became a member of the board. This year the board has worked hard to raise the $100000 needed to grow the program to 50 young scholars in Summer 2022. Freedom School now offers a space where UWF teacher candidates can complete their first field experience course during the summer months. McCreary will again serve as the site coordinator and five of the six servant leader interns are UWF students.

The beauty of education is that its ripple effects are beyond quantification. I am hopeful that these 50 young scholars will carry with them and share not only a love of reading but the sense that they can inspire change in themselves their families their schools their communities their country and the world.

Those musings have turned into a play - called Horton Hatches a Controversy - that's about to premiere as part of the city's Fringe Festival.

Judene believes Seuss would agree with the decision made to stop publication of some of his books because of racist and insensitive imagery.

What triggers the vicious attack?

She has freaked out before. Further did she kill her cousin in the latest whodunnit? Here’s what we know so far for the NBC sudser.

Days of our Lives Spoilers: Sarah Horton Goes Ballistic

DOOL weekly spoilers hint that Sarah Horton attacks again. This time Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker) falls victim. But what triggers her to go after Nicole? It seems the cute doc may not be in her right mind.

Sarah may be having another freaky hallucination. After all the side effects of Sarah’s treatment are setting in. Further Days of our Lives teasers suggest the apparition worries her.

After all she recently saw a pen-wielding Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) as Kristen DiMera (Stacy Haiduk) with a syringe. Does she see Nicole as her kidnapper as well? Or as somebody else that the addled doctor has a bone to pick with?

On the other hand perhaps Sarah Horton spied the tender moment between Nicole and her ex-husband. The former doctor did have feelings for Eric Brady (Greg Vaughan) and shared a child.

She could blast Nicole for playing games with Eric while she’s engaged to Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering). Either way watch for the attack this week.

Did Sarah Kill Her Cousin on DOOL?

The latest Days of our Lives whodunnit has fans wondering how long the suspect list is in the murder of Abigail Deveraux (Marci Miller). The killing sent shockwaves through Salem.

No arrests have been made by the SPD yet. However Sarah may have paid dear Abby a visit that fateful evening. DOOL recaps show the woman seeking out advice from Dr. Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall).

After all she suffers from sudden onset hallucinations. She tells the kindy shrink she almost attacked Victor when she thought he was Kristen. Doc reassured Sarah the visions would subside over time.

Plus she may need to have Dr. Kayla Brady (Mary Beth Evans) change the dosage of her medication. Further the shrink counsels her patient to talk to Abigail about her similar experience with the crazy hallucinations.

But Days of our Lives viewers recall Dr. Horton visiting Gwen Rizczech (Emily O’Brien) in jail. There she learns her cousin Abigail left the syringe used by Kristen in the basement where the medicine woman was initially attacked last year.

Did Sarah head to the DiMera mansion armed with this new knowledge? And did a confrontation between the cousins go terribly wrong when Sarah is struck with a scary vision?

In the confusion she may have stabbed Abigail and left her for dead on DOOL. The physician could have made a huge mistake that night.

Days of our Lives Spoilers: Does Addled Doc Have an Alibi?

DOOL viewers wonder where Dr. Horton went after seeing the jailed Brit. Did she go home to tell her lover Xander Cook (Paul Telfer) about what she learned from his ex-fiance? However dandy Xandy may not know what his girlfriend was doing.

Hunky Xander Cook could provide his girlfriend’s only alibi on Days of our Lives. Further he’s the type of boyfriend that would lie to protect his sweetheart. Does he know what Sarah Horton was doing that evening?

In addition he may be stunned when Sarah Horton attacks Nicole Walker. Watch for Sarah Horton to freak out and savagely attack Nicole Walker on Days of our Lives. What triggers the confused woman? Did she brutally go after her cousin as well?

The city’s largest taxpayer DTE will retire its Trenton Channel Power Plant on June 19.

It is continuing to provide power until its coal reserves are depleted.

Although Trenton officials have been planning for the closure it will have an impact on city finances.

“Fortunately there is development and growth throughout the city occurring that will hopefully offset their departure” City Administrator Dean Creech said. “We have been preparing. We have adjusted our budget to be less reliant on the DTE tax revenue. We have also worked diligently to bring more businesses to Trenton and have been seeing some successes. We also made sure that our demolition ordinance ensures that all properties in the city are returned to their original state. We want to avoid vacant properties that need extensive cleanups or have other impediments to development.”

The retirement will impact about 60 employees.

Mayor Steven Rzeppa has formally addressed residents on the issue.

“While the plant retirement marks the end of power production at the Trenton Channel site we look forward to continuing our partnership with DTE and bringing about an environmentally and economically sustainable development that can benefit our region for generations to come” Rzeppa said. “It will unquestionably come with tremendous challenges for our community but with every challenge comes great opportunity.”

There are no current plans for the plant and property but Creech said city officials have been meeting with DTE officials monthly and plan to solicit for development proposals soon.

According to Renee McClelland a DTE senior communications strategist DTE is in the midst of a critical and “fundamental transformation” in the way it produces energy in the state accelerating coal plant retirements and investing in cleaner Michigan-made energy.

That includes wind and solar parks and a natural gas plant.

Creech said the retirement won’t just have a financial impact in the city but an emotional one for some as well.

The plant became somewhat of a landmark in Trenton.

“It will be sad to see the red and white smokestacks gone from the landscape knowing how many people made their livelihood there and how much it was a part of our community” Creech said. “But I am hopeful that a transformative development will come about and put that parcel of land to a sustainable and vibrant use.”

DTE has reduced carbon emissions 30% since 2005 and will further cut these emissions to 50% by 2028 and 80% by 2040 McClelland said.

It is on course to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 she said.

A key part of DTE’s clean energy generation transformation and net-zero carbon emissions goal involves the sequential retirement of its coal-fired power plants.

“We have already retired five coal facilities (Marysville Harbor Beach Conners Creek River Rouge and St. Clair) and will retire Belle River by 2028 and Monroe by 2040” McClelland said.

As DTE works to decommission its recently retired plants officials said they not only are working closely with community leaders but they also are working with government officials and local businesses to foster development and investment within impacted areas and are looking to maintain a presence in the community through volunteer initiatives. ​

“We recognize that we have a big task ahead of us and understand that these retirements are going to affect our employees and the surrounding communities” McClelland said. “Through proactive intentional planning and collaboration with stakeholders we believe any potential negative impacts can be minimized.”

The following is a brief history and facts of the plant and its connection to Trenton provided by Rzeppa:

● In 1922 all eyes were on a 55-acre parcel of land in south Trenton on Slocum Island and activity began to stir.

● Over the next few years Slocum Island was transformed into the Trenton Channel Power Plant.

● Upon completion of construction the plant boasted six turbines 13 coal-fired boilers and was the first power plant to use pulverized coal.

● Trenton Channel first fired on May 1 1924 utilizing the largest single-cylinder turbines practical to provide power to the booming automobile industry in Detroit and the surrounding region. At the time Trenton was still a village.

● Over the years the plant expanded coal was brought in by vessel and Trenton became a city.

● A strong relationship developed between Detroit Edison and the city of Trenton where countless plant employees lived raised their families and saw generations get high-paying jobs for Edison right in their hometown.

● There was a gradual winding down of the booming automotive and industrial sector in the region.

● Developers and city planners formed a new vision for the region that included more green spaces parks and paths.

● Throughout this time Detroit Edison (now DTE) partnered with the city of Trenton on projects to improve the quality of life for residents and cement a commitment to environmental stewardship.

● DTE employees worked with the city to construct MacArthur Park on Newman Street which transformed an underutilized space into one where residents could play enjoy nature and connect with one another as they promoted sustainable environmental use and revitalization of vacant spaces.

● Trenton and the region have seen tremendous changes over the last few decades transitioning to a more futuristic economy and moving the city towards becoming a purposeful destination for outdoor recreation — including fishing bicycling and enjoying greenways and trails.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9kZXRyb2l0LWNpdHkvMjAyMi8wNi8xOS9jb21tdW5pdHktaGVscHMtc2hhcGUtZWRlbi1wYXJrLWdyYXNzeS12YWNhbnQtZGV0cm9pdC1sb3QvOTk1MTAwODAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Community helps shape 'park within a park' for grassy vacant Detroit lot,"A grassy vacant lot where an elementary school once stood in a neighborhood on the southwest side of Detroit is one step closer to being transformed into a park.

Grassroots community groups recently broke ground on the Eden Park project a six-acre ecological haven designed for an area of the city that has long dealt with industrial pollution.

During a groundbreaking ceremony recently Detroit dignitaries like Mayor Mike Duggan and U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib D-Detroit were on hand to mark the beginning of construction on the project. But Eden Park is the result of a decade-long effort by community members to turn the abandoned school site into a public space.

""You have your faith you have your vision and this is why we’re here today” said Tlaib acknowledging the local efforts during her speech at the Memorial Day weekend ceremony WDIV (Channel 4) reported.

The groundbreaking kicked off a weekend of festivities including a carnival that offered a glimpse at what the finished version will offer to the area which encompasses the Detroit neighborhood and the cities of Ecorse and River Rouge.

Construction for Eden Park is expected to be completed by 2024.

Eden Park is seen as one solution to combatting environmental problems the neighborhood has grappled with and is part of a community effort to take environmental concerns into its own hands following decades of battles over air quality in the area according to the project's website.

“Community residents for their own safety and safety of their neighbors they have immersed themselves in environmental justice” said the Eden Park steering committee co-chair Alicia Renee Farris.

“So it’s not what we thought it’s what the community recommended.”

When planning began in 2011 the idea was to develop a community center inside the shuttered Mark Twain Elementary School located on Detroit’s Gleason Street. Plans evolved and with a new focus aimed at designing a green space for the neighborhoods.

One of the catalysts for the green space idea was the environmental justice work at New Mt. Hermon Missionary Baptist Church which in recent years became an air monitoring site for a community-led operation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate the overall air quality of the neighborhood.

New Mt. Hermon Missionary Baptist Church owns the abandoned school property Eden Park will be built on and sits across the street.

The neighborhood surrounding the park is predominantly African American with a mix of elderly residents who have remained in the community for years and younger residents with children many of whom have long standing family connections to the area.

Large lush trees surround the perimeter of the property with a sign out front that reads Future Home of Eden Park. In the immediate vicinity orderly rows of one story family homes line the blocks.

On a recent morning residents were out mowing their lawns and taking care of their gardens. Churches throughout the neighborhood were filling up for Sunday service. A boy walked down the street eating a frozen ice pop and families sat out on their porches.

A few streets over from Eden Park Tracey Thomas was in her front yard watering the plants in the front of her house. The 52-year-old Ecorse resident has been in the neighborhood for decades and lives just a few houses down from where she raised her children.

That’s typical of the neighborhood Thomas said. The area is a peaceful place where “everybody knows everybody” and residents tend to stay for a long time she said. It’s a place where people can raise their children and later pass their house down to the next generation.

Thomas who is not involved in the project heard about the plans for Eden Park recently through word of mouth. Having a park that will jointly serve the southwest Detroit neighborhood as well as adjacent neighborhoods in Ecorse and River Rouge is something she hasn't seen before she said.

“Usually everything is separated but I think it will be a good thing it’s something good for the community” said Thomas. “It will be a beautiful thing.”

Thomas hopes the park will provide a safe place for young people in the neighborhood and she said she would like to see more projects for children.

The age makeup of the population factored significantly into the planning process according to Farris.

“It’s a mixed community but it’s also a very close-knit community” she said. “We knew we needed to consider the aging population and the younger population.”

The space will have a playground but it will also have a so-called “park within a park” which is described as a space that will provide scenic and tranquil surroundings for residents with Alzheimer's disease or neurological disorders.

The project also has been spearheaded by the Tri-City Community Development Corp. and partnered with some of the corporations that have historically contributed to the area’s air pollution like Marathon Oil.

Funding for projects in the neighborhood and surrounding 48217 ZIP code was recently included a settlement between the Sierra Club and DTE Energy Co. The nearby communities in Ecorse and River Rouge also are included in the settlement. Some of the money is earmarked for the construction of Eden Park.

Entities like the Wayne County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority and Ben & Jerry’s Foundation have also helped fund the project.

Rainy Hamilton a principal architect who runs the largest African American design firm in Michigan and his firm Hamilton Anderson Associates are handling the architectural and design aspects of the Eden Park project.

Hamilton also has a special connection to the project and the surrounding community.

He lived in the area as a child and saw his artwork displayed for the first time inside the halls of Mark Twain Elementary school which was then located at the grassy site across from the church.

""I do remember vividly holding my mother's hand standing in the hall of Mark Twain Elementary and looking at a watercolor painting I did displayed in a glass case right at the main entrance” Hamilton said.

Seeing the school abandoned in recent years was heartbreaking he said.

Now some 60 years later he’s designing a park that will give the community a six-acre slice of open space.

""It gives the neighborhood a place to come together to celebrate to play to relax"" he said.

Hamilton is hopeful the park will become a well-used amenity for the community. He is excited to see how the park brings native bird species and flowers to the area.

“It’s so hard these days the need is so great” said Hamilton. “So to see it getting to this point where it’s starting to turn a corner I think that encourages me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWFkbGluZWRldHJvaXQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzMwNzU0L2hvd19kb195b3VfYnVpbGRfYV9wbGFjZV9saWtlX3BpbmVfa25vYl9hc19mYXN0X2FzX3Bvc3NpYmxlX3VudGlsX3RoZV9sYXN0X21pbnV0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How do you build a place like Pine Knob? As fast as possible until the last minute.,"The Free Press provides your Sunday read today with a nice Brian McCollum portrait of the man who built Pine Knob Joe Locricchio just in time for its 50th year and rechristening under its original name.



Pine Knob on a summer evening (File photo)

It's long-ish and detailed and we can't tell you the whole story in a summary but the gist is a classic: One man had a vision for what the 600-acre parcel he bought in 1969 could be and pushed to carry it out down to the last detail.

Locricchio died in 1998 just 57 years old but the amphitheater he carved out of the rolling hills of northern Oakland County serves as a monument -- and what a monument a place where hundreds of thousands of locals and out-of-towners have spent some of the best nights of their lives watching pop-music acts put on shows that almost always end at the stroke of 11 p.m. (Every minute an act goes over the local noise-ordinance curfew costs them $1000.)

But the best passage may be about opening night. Everyone who's ever crashed a project to a hard deadline should be amused by how the first show -- David Cassidy 1972 -- went off:

Hours before teen idol Cassidy stepped onstage June 25 to perform his afternoon show for a screaming young audience workers were still scrambling paintbrushes still rolling. On that opening day Pine Knob's box office wasn’t finished. Its floor being prepped for tiles was sticky. Cash drawers weren't yet installed so dollar bills were chucked into cardboard boxes. The staff included many town locals lacking theater experience and learning on the fly. “We also paid a lot of cleaning bills after that first show because a lot of (concertgoers) ended up with orange stains on their clothes” said longtime Nederlander employee Marc Roland. “The seats weren’t completely dry from the paint.”

What a keepsake a pair of orange-stained 1972-era hot pants (worn in hopes of catching cute David's eye) would be today.

Hughley's Family But Doubles Down on ...,"Fans are dragging Mo’Nique after the Academy Award winner issued what they claimed wasn’t a genuine apology to D.L. Hughley‘s family following the past remarks she made during the pair’s weeks-long feud.

The comedians have been at odds since late May after Monique blamed him for a contractual issue she had with the promoter of a comedy show in Detroit at the Fox Theatre. Mo’Nique accused Hughley of removing her as the headlining act. Although the 59-year-old denied any wrongdoing Mo’Nique ignited the feud by throwing shots at Hughley’s wife and bringing up a past clip of Hughley discussing why he didn’t initially believe that his daughter was sexually assaulted by a 13-year-old boy at the time.

On June 18 while performing at the Duke Energy Center of Performing Arts in Raleigh North Carolina Mo’Nique apologized to Hughley’s family for her actions and “hurting” their feelings.

She said “I’d like to consider myself a woman of honor. So I’ve got to do something right now publicly that I did publicly. And when I f–k something up I’ve got to fix it up. So I’m going to take care of that right now before I go any motherf–king further. To D.L. Hughley’s family I want to publicly apologize if I hurt anyone’s feelings.”

The 54-year-old added “I want to publicly apologize to his wife his babies if I hurt their feelings because that was never my godd–n intention. I never meant to hurt their feelings.”

Towards the end of her apology Mo’Nique told concertgoers that although she’s admitting her mistakes by bringing Hughley’s family into the feud she’s not taking back what she previously said about the “Kings of Comedy” star. Mo’Nique stated “Oh but that n- – -a D.L. I meant every motherf–king thing I said.”

As the video circulated online fans criticized Mo’Nique’s apology. The backlash stemmed from the specific terms she used to apologize for the past comments she made about Hughley’s family in an attempt to hurt him.

“When someone says ‘I apologize IF’ that’s not an apology anymore ….. because you are still thinking or feeling some type of way as to apologize or not. This isn’t genuine . My opinion though.”

“No. Absolutely no. Because she really said some wild stuff & whether or not she was mad at that man: it did not warrant for her to literally try to emasculate him.”

“Man that was so long ago now she waited too long to apologize. Ask God for forgiveness not me because I’m human and I’m not going to forgive you she crossed the damn line including that man’s family.”

“It’s not an apology… she knows she was wrong. That’s what she should’ve said. There is no “if” here in this instance. She weaponized a young woman’s trauma and I can’t forget that.”

“What kinda apology was that.”

Mo’Nique’s apology comes weeks after Hughley declared that he had ended the feud."

But in a world where employees rule with an iron fist how long can small businesses survive?

The answer according to recent interviews with business owners and managers in western and northern Michigan isn't pretty.

'It's a seismic cultural shift'

Has the staffing shortage gotten better in West Michigan? According to restaurateur Lucas Grill: ""The short answer is no.""

""It's been such a crazy two years"" Grill owner of Seventy-Six Poquito and Obstacle No. 1 in downtown Holland said. ""When the pandemic started and everything closed for a good two weeks everybody was with their families.

More:Will the employee shortage ever end?

More:West Michigan employers continue to fight staffing shortages

""By the time they went back to work a month and a half later things changed. It's a seismic cultural shift. They saw what they were missing their whole lives. There's an entire group of people thinking 'If I work in the restaurant industry I'll work nights and weekends and holidays. I'm working when they're playing.'""

Grill has offered long holiday weekends to all of his employees plus increased wages — but full-service restaurants can't survive without evenings and weekends.

""Everybody is having a hard time right now but the restaurant industry is especially tough"" he said. ""There's a massive amount of people leaving. We have half the managers we had pre-COVID and not one of them are in the industry anymore. We had veteran bartenders and servers switch careers.""

In the last month Grill has lost employees to manufacturers like Gentex and Request Foods.

""They're paying $22 $23 $24 an hour"" he said. ""I can't compete with that. Their pockets are deeper. The restaurant industry is in a very precarious spot right now. This is the worst I've ever seen. And the truth is I think the only way this ends is a recession or the closure of enough restaurants that everything balances out.""

Constant turnover

Walloon Junction Bar and Grill in Walloon Lake is lucky to have a core staff of committed employees — but they weren’t enough to keep the business open seven days a week.

Manager Kirt Ploe said the restaurant just recently increased its hours to six days a week after dropping down to five due to staffing shortages.

In order to keep his core staff Ploe said he raised wages began offering insurance and a summer incentive — through which employees with perfect attendance will receive an extra $2-per-hour bonus for hours worked June-September.

“Offering insurance is something I feel people really look for in a long term job"" Ploe said. ""You want that kind of security (but) offering that security has never been in the hospitality industry.

“We aren't just looking for summer help we're looking year-round looking for full-time employees to build a future rather than just be an employee. So I’m trying to offer the stability that you get from those types of jobs.”

Ploe said one of the biggest challenges he's faced is turnover spending resources to train new employees only for them to leave soon afterward.

“Constantly” he said. “(New employees) come in for a few days and then just disappear. I don't know the reasoning. I just know that's what I see a lot of. They're not around for long.”

Despite the shortage Ploe is expecting a record-breaking season this year as visitors begin making their way to northern Michigan.

Ploe who also owns Sunnyside Family Diner in Boyne City said the last few years have been busier than ever. That's been the case for many businesses that survived the COVID-19 pandemic.

“(Sunnyside) is already doing record numbers for this year"" he said. ""This one is my first summer here at the junction so I expect it to be at least on par with that.”

'I don't see what the fix is'

In addition to retailers and restaurants entertainment venues like the Cheboygan County Fairgrounds are having a hard time finding people to fill open positions.

For the last two years the fairgrounds has placed an ad in the paper looking for a fairgrounds maintenance and repair person. No one has answered the ad nor applied to do the work at the county-owned facility.

Cheboygan County Fairgrounds Supervisor and Cheboygan County Recycling Department Manager Dan O'Henley said there isn't anyone to reach out to to try to get someone to work. There are several factors he said that could potentially be causing the lack of available labor — including the wages being paid for the position.

""So nobody's going to come work do construction or do manual labor for that money when they can go somewhere else for a lot more"" O'Henley said. ""There's just nobody. I don't have the clear answer as to why it is.""

O'Henley has had to fill in and drive trucks for the recycling program because he only has one part-time truck driver. He also has to oversee operations at the fairgrounds. Meanwhile maintenance personnel from the county have been trying to help pick up the slack — but they have other responsibilities too.

""There's just no help"" O'Henley said. ""So it's tough it's a tough time for everybody. Nobody answers the ad. Now when is that going to change? I don't know what's going to change it. It's just tough.

""I don't know how other people are doing it in other businesses. How are these people driving to work with gas at $5 or $6 a gallon? I don't know. I don't have any of the answers.""

The labor shortage could also affect the annual county fair.

""It's a very interesting time"" O'Henley said. ""It almost leaves you speechless because you think well you could do this or you could do that and none of that works.""

O'Henley doesn't have the solution.

""I don't see what the fix is"" he said. ""We're trying to deal with it just like everyone else.""

Adapting to change

Katelyn Shawn has been the manager of Wicked Sister a popular bar and restaurant in downtown Sault Ste. Marie since 2016.

Since the pandemic began and the bar had to find new ways to operate she's been struggling to hire full-time employees.

“One thing that we tried to do throughout COVID was we didn't want to just close down and leave everybody without a job or without money to pay bills and rent but we stayed open” Shawn said. “We just did delivery and takeout.

""We rebranded ourselves because of COVID so we still have the opportunity to allow every employee the opportunity to make money.”

Shawn didn't have to fire anyone but that doesn't mean she didn't lose workers. Students living at LSSU moved home to take online classes. Other workers had to leave to care for sick family members or to spend time with their children.

“And then they ended up getting a different job after things opened back up"" Shawn said. ""So we've seen a few different reasons for losing people and we've hired some people on too but we have to keep adjusting our menu and adjusting our workload based on the crew that we have.”

It isn’t just bars and restaurants that are feeling the pain of not being able to find workers — many small businesses in town are also looking to hire.

“I have friends that work in other small businesses and they say it's so hard to get people in and get people trained. There are a lot of people that have no experience but it’s hard to find people that are willing to learn that don’t just say ‘Well I could go to McDonald's and make more money.'

""A lot of people are seeing corporate chains that are offering a bigger wage and it's hard for a small local business to compete with that.”

“This is not just a military artifact—a human life is behind of [sic] each of these things” one listing for an army belt tells prospective customers.

Another listing reads “The uniform of a Russian soldier from the war in Ukraine 2022. The lot is unique in that it was taken not in the first days of the war but roughly speaking these days. Just 3 days ago… this form [sic] was in the hottest place—in the Donbas.”

At $425 the ensemble isn’t cheap. But as the listing grimly notes: “Good condition not worn for long:)))”

The seller who asked that he be identified only by his first name Taras told The Daily Beast he owns a small grocery store in Kyiv but that the war has affected his business badly.

“Now everything is difficult” Taras said. “eBay helps out and has become the main type of work… Wartime items are of great interest to collectors.”

Since Russian troops entered Ukraine in March the nation’s economy has all but imploded. Some 50 percent of Ukraine’s businesses have shuttered over the past four months and about half of all Ukrainians have lost their jobs. Only 2 percent of the newly unemployed have been able to find ways to stay afloat according to economist Nataliya Katser-Buchkovska. If the war continues unabated up to 90 percent of the Ukrainian population could sink into poverty the UN’s International Labor Organization warned in May.

Taras just started selling war relics this month and has moved about 20 items so far. Now that his shop is struggling Taras said he recently started thinking his profession is “Dude who takes [and sells] crazy things.”

He obtains most of his auction items independently but also said he takes orders from clients he connects with online.

“Today one of my clients asked me to get and send him a hatch from a damaged tank” Taras said on Tuesday adding that he has not yet come across a suitable one. “We have guys from the front line we buy things from them and thus give support to them.”

After active hostilities in and around Kyiv died down Taras said he began taking items left behind by the Russians. In addition to removing hardware and personal effects from enemy equipment Taras has also purchased “from the population” some of the things he offers for sale online.

His customers are primarily in America Canada and Australia Taras said. “But most of all America.”

The items vary based on what he discovers explained Taras who often posts a snippet of backstory and a photo of where he found the item along with his listings.

“[O]fficer’s pencil case from a self-propelled artillery mount” one reads. “product 100% original. Taken from the self-propelled guns (last photo) after a quick counteroffensive in the Chernihiv region. The Russians retreated leaving the equipment without fuel. There is only one photograph of the person carrying the item the documents were seized by the military earlier.”

“Kyiv region of Brovarsky district!” Taras says in another. “The sleeping bag of an officer of the Russian army was removed from the armored personnel carrier.”

A handful of others have had the same idea gathering battlefield relics for sale to a fascinated—and largely insulated from the actual day-to-day horrors of war—foreign market.

It’s all permitted for sale under eBay’s military items policy which excludes weapons explosives and certain types of body armor. However pro-Putin items are now prohibited as are those with the pro-Putin “Z” symbol an eBay official told The Daily Beast.

For $123 plus $16 shipping an eBay vendor who goes by “ukrseller_one” will send you a “Modern Russian Soldier’s military trevel [sic] kit. Inside you can watch what Russian soldiers use in the field. There is a separate soldier’s life inside… As you see some items were used. The torch is worked [sic] it’s fantastic!”

Inside are personal items such as a toothbrush a sewing kit gauze shampoo and a few pairs of briefs. The seller who did not respond to The Daily Beast’s inquiries promises to provide the eventual buyer with “full information how where and when it was captured.”

“P.S. We have this soldier’s photo” the listing says. “You will be satisfied watching on it [sic].”

A wristwatch once worn by a Russian soldier can be yours for $83 plus free shipping via ukrseller_one whose profile places him (or her) in Vinnytsia Ukraine.

“This watch was captured at the befining [sic] of June near Izum city Kharkiv region Ukraine” reads the listing. “Russian officer’s watch. Broken watch with broken belt captured after hard battle. Russian oficer’s [sic] name surname unit location is known. All details after purchasing.”

The same eBay seller was until recently offering a set of gently used long johns once worn by a member of the Russian forces.

“​​This underwear was found near Pryluki city Ukraine” the listing says. “There was [a] night battle and Russian soldiers hadn't time to take on [sic] own underwear. As you see there is one pants and two t-shirts (the second t-shirt is free)”

There were no takers at an opening bid of $49 or a buy-it-now price of $66 plus $13 shipping.

Further afield if you’re looking for twisted engine parts from a Russian short-range cruise missile “prettiestgirlstore” based in Romanow Ukraine is happy to supply them for a starting bid of $125. Shipping is free and U.S. buyers are provided with a USPS tracking number.

“Turbojet engine parts from a russian Kалибр (NAТО-reportіng name SS-N-27 ‘Sіzzlеr’)” the listing reads. “100% Inert and Safe. Real Battle Relic - June 9 2022 / Novohrad-Volynskyi city.”

In another listing prettiestgirlstore who also did not respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment offers up a “Real military trophy!”

“Found in an abandoned tank” the description reads. “Items of Buryat tankers: Cap Badge two Branch Insignia Badges Belt two Buryat commemorative coins and two buddists protective talismans. Battle of Izium (March 2022) There are a lot of soldiers from Buryatia in the Russian Army.”

The lot according to the listing “Smells of diesel fuel and a tank.”

Half of prettiestgirl’s profits are donated to charity the account claims stating at the bottom of all listings “Glory to Ukraine! Victory will be ours! Good will triumph over evil!”

None of it sits particularly well with one Russian national now living in the U.S. who comes from a family with generations of military service. He told The Daily Beast that he finds the idea of buying Russian personal effects “disgusting” comparing it to dead U.S. soldiers’ gear being sold to curious collectors by the Taliban. (He requested that he not be named for this story.)

Still business is brisk and customers continue to submit requests according to Taras.

“One guy was very offended that he could not get a tank helmet and writes to me every day” he said. “Now I’m looking for a tank helmet for him.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzYvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtbHVuY2gtMTktbWlsbGlvbi11c2QtZWJheS1hdWN0aW9uLW5ld3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Charity Lunch Auctions for $19 Million USD,"After 43 bids at an eBay auction the last chance to purchase lunch with 91-year-old billionaire Warren Buffett sold for $19 million USD to an anonymous buyer.

Proceeds from the “Power Lunch with Warren Buffett” will benefit Glide a San Francisco-based charity organization dedicated to offering refuge and support for the homeless. The charity lunch idea was first conceived by Buffett’s late wife Susie who volunteered at the organization. Held annually since 2000 with a hiatus in 2020 and 2021 due to risks posed by Covid-19 this year’s lunch marks the 21st and last time Buffett will partner with Glide for the opportunity.

This year’s lunch was eBay’s most expensive item ever sold for charity and the previous record “Power Lunch” purchase of $4.57 million USD was sold to TRON founder and crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun in 2019.

“It’s been nothing but good” Buffett said in a statement. “I’ve met a lot of interesting people from all over the world. The one universal characteristic is that they feel the money is going to be put to very good uses.”

This year’s winning bidder is eligible to bring up to seven guests to join Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Manhattan. Buffett will be open to talking about anything aside from his investment plans. Past winners who’ve attended the lunches have stated that Buffett likes his steaks rare with hash browns and a cherry coke. He also reportedly asks for extra spoons to try everyone’s desserts.

SUV

A 2021 model with 1715 miles (2760 km) on the clock it has seen a lot of action but since it is only about one year old it presents itself in top-notch form from the Giallo Orion Metallic paint finish to the Nero Cosmus interior with a touch of yellow.We won’t keep you waiting much longer as you’re probably curious to find out how much it costs. However you will probably have to sit down for this one as it is a bit too much: $1199950 or just shy of the $2 million mark. The Italian supercar is advertised on eBay by a used car dealer based in Houston Texas which has some exciting machines in its portfolio from the Mercedes-GT Black Series to the Maserati MC20 a whole bunch of costly SUVs and even a Bugatti Chiron listed for $3.5 million.According to the ad the Aventador SVJ Roadster in question features 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels electrically adjustable seats with heating telemetry system reversing camera and a lot of carbon fiber inside and out. Black Alcantara decorates the seats and other parts of the interior whereas the yellow accents including the ‘Raging Bull’ logos embossed into the headrests 12 o’clock marking on the steering wheel door pull straps and special floor mats provide contrast.As we already mentioned this is the Roadster version of the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ  so it comes with an open-top view of the sky above. However while in most vehicles lowering the roof is done electrically at the push of a button it is a bit trickier than that in the said Italian supercar. That’s because anyone who wants to work on their tan on the go will have to manually remove the two panels above the cockpit and then store them up front in the frunk. There isn’t anything chic about doing manual labor in an eye-watering expensive machine but at least it is a one man (or woman) job and the panels are not that hard to remove and install back in.The owner hasn’t messed around with the engine of this blue-blooded car and that’s always a good thing especially when talking about rides that cost seven figures. Like all versions of the Aventador and its derivatives the SVJ Roadster  uses a naturally aspirated V12. The 6.5-liter power unit kicks out 759 hp (770 ps / 566) at 8500 rpm and 531 lb-ft (720 Nm) of torque at 6750 rpm. Mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive with mechanical self-locking rear differential the Aventador SVJ Roadster brags about doing the 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) in 2.9 seconds before topping out at over 217 mph (350 kph).Now if you had well over one million bucks to blow on a set of wheels you’d obviously be spoiled for choice but would you get this Lambo? That’s a tough question to answer as there are various other exciting vehicles that you could buy with that sort of cash including a full-blown supercar a super and a very comfortable sedan to use on a daily basis and you’d still have some money to spare. A nice home in most parts of the world costs way less than that so there’s another option right there. As for this writer  he’d probably settle for a used Lamborghini Huracan get a G-Wagen alongside it and a luxurious four-door to complement the lineup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9tb25leS8xODg4MzczMy9lYmF5LWV4cGVydC1zZWxsaW5nLWJpbGxzLWxhcHRvcHMv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL21vbmV5LzE4ODgzNzMzL2ViYXktZXhwZXJ0LXNlbGxpbmctYmlsbHMtbGFwdG9wcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I’m an eBay expert – follow these lesser-known tips to make HUNDREDS from your unwanted junk...,"CASH IN I’m an eBay expert – follow these lesser-known tips to make HUNDREDS from your unwanted junk

THEY say one man's trash is another treasure - so it's no wonder that three-quarters of Brits are selling items from around the house to raise some extra cash.

And according to Ebay you could pocket as much as £1106 if you pick the right items to sell.

From musical instruments worth nearly £150 to old laptops worth almost £300 - there are plenty of things you can sell to raise some extra pocket money.

There are plenty of places to list your stuff online including Facebook Marketplace Gumtree and more.

On Ebay you can list up to 1000 items a month for free although you can pay to have your listing promoted higher up.

You will have to pay a ""final value fee"" when you sell something though - so be sure to factor that in.

It's calculated as 12.8% of the total amount of the sale including the cost of postage plus a fixed charge of 30p per order.

And if the total amount of the sale is over £2500 for a single item you'll pay 3% for the portion of the sale price above £2500.

We picked the brains of Emma Grant head of pre-loved at eBay UK to find out how to make the most from your old junk.

Pick your product

“We’ve noticed laptops and old smartphones are selling really well at the moment so if you have lying around at home unused they could earn you up to £290” Emma said.

The make and model of your tech will determine how much you can earn from it as well as what sort of condition it's in.

She also said that the company’s partnership with Love Island has resulted in a spike in sales of pre-loved clothing.

“As the islanders are wearing their favourite eBay looks the public at home are following suit and adding pre-loved clothes to their shopping baskets” she added.

Make your listing stand out

Once you've listed your items you need to make sure they sell. And there are some simple tweaks you can make to boost your chances

Keywords are key

“Take the time to get your keywords right and bidders will come” Emma said.

When buyers search on eBay it automatically filters the listing titles so it's crucial to make sure you describe your listing correctly and use terminology people are searching for especially brand and product names.”

Choose the right category for your product

“It might sound obvious but it’s very important to always choose the most specific category to sell in” Emma said.

For example if you are selling old children’s clothes make sure its listed in the children’s fashion category rather than just fashion in general.

Pictures are important

Emma said: “Most users will not bid on items they cannot see.”

She recommended taking photos in natural light against a neutral background and being honest about any scratches or aesthetic damage to the item.

Be as detailed as possible

Include as much information as possible about the condition of the item noting any wear and tear.

“By including details that can’t be seen in the image for example if you are selling clothes noting the feel or fit of the product you’ll help buyers decide if this is the item for them” Emma added.

Describing your item accurately will also help you avoid any negative feedback from disappointed buyers.

Be realistic with pricing

There are pricing recommendations on eBay and it’s worth following them.

“Try searching for similar items on eBay to make sure you’re going for the right price and always ask yourself ‘would I pay this price for this item?” Emma suggested.

Time your listings

Try listing coats or jackets in the run up to winter workout gear to kick-start the new year or a cut-out dress for the summer holidays.

“By listing products that are trending and back in fashion you can easily make some extra money from clearing out last season’s looks"" said Emma.

Shop your home

“We know people around the UK are concerned by the rising cost of living and while selling unwanted items might not be a solution to the problem at large it can be an effective way to make some extra cash to go towards bills or contribute to your savings for a holiday this summer” Emma said.

“On eBay you can sell everything and anything around the home from kitchenware to living room decor you’d never think you’d find some of these things on eBay but you’d be surprised.

“Whether it's a musical instrument which you could make £137 for or an old laptop that could earn you £290.”

Give it a go

Even if you have never used eBay before it is an easy way to both declutter and make some extra cash said Emma.

“You can even get the kids involved - perhaps an incentive for tidying that playroom up!

""It’s also a great way to do your bit for the planet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoaW5lLmNuL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvMjIwNjE4NjkzOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett charity lunch fetches winning bid of US$19m,"A lucky and likely wealthy person bid more than US$19 million to dine with Warren Buffett in the 21st and final time that the billionaire businessman auctioned a private lunch.

A lucky and likely wealthy person bid more than US$19 million to dine with Warren Buffett in the 21st and final time that the billionaire businessman auctioned a private lunch to benefit a San Francisco charity.



The winning bid in the eBay auction that ended on Friday night far surpassed the previous record of US$4.57 million paid in 2019 by cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun although the new winner's identity could not immediately be determined.

Proceeds benefit Glide a nonprofit in San Francisco's Tenderloin district that helps the poor homeless or those battling substance abuse. Glide offers meals shelter HIV and hepatitis C tests job training and children's programs.

Buffett 91 the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc has raised more than US$53.2 million for Glide in the 21 auctions which began in 2000.

An eBay spokeswoman said the lunch was the most expensive item ever sold on the company's website to benefit charity.

No auctions were held in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Buffett became a supporter of Glide after his first wife Susan who died in 2004 introduced him to the charity where she had been volunteering.

He has also pledged to give away nearly all of his fortune. Buffett was worth US$93.4 billion on Friday ranking seventh worldwide according to Forbes magazine.

This year's auction winner and up to seven guests will dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Manhattan.

Buffett will talk about almost anything but not where he may invest next.

Hedge fund managers David Einhorn and Ted Weschler are among previous auction winners.

Weschler became a Berkshire portfolio manager after paying a combined US$5.25 million to win the 2010 and 2011 auctions.

Berkshire owns dozens of companies including the BNSF railroad Geico car insurance energy manufacturing and retail businesses and stocks such as Apple Inc and Bank of America Corp.

Buffett still owns nearly 16 percent of the Omaha Nebraska-based conglomerate despite having donated more than half of his shares since 2006 including US$4 billion on June 14."

The account is curated by independent developer Dan Clarke and presents logos from all eras and genres of gaming from 90s graphics card manufacturers to modern-day JRPG devs. Perhaps there's something to be interrogated about a life lived in the belly of consumerism seeing a logo for a product I enjoyed 15 years ago and hooting at my screen in glee but I just don't care at this point—seeing these pop up in my Twitter feed is just nice. Here's a small sampling of some of my favorites from Game+Logo's less than a month online.

Origin Systems

Gone but never forgotten flayed alive by Electronic Arts and its good name stapled to EA's now rather quaint and outmoded proprietary storefront Origin Systems gave us the likes of Ultima System Shock and Wing Commander and paved the way for subsequent CRPGs JRPGs and immersive sims. Origin's sky-blue logo featuring a compass piercing the text of the company name gives off good vibes with a hint of melancholy for what we've lost.

UMD

The winding road of tech history is paved with failed media formats and Sony's weird little plastic-encased discs for the PSP have long since joined the likes of Betamax and HD DVD. Still seeing the logo I can't help but remember the promise of Spider-Man 2 on UMD—the best movie ever made and I could watch it while waiting for a sizzlin' fajitas plate with my parents at Chili's.

3dfx

The graphics card shortage certainly had me pining for a simpler time in PC building. It's always hard to believe that 3dfx and its legendary Voodoo cards had such a short run given their massive impact on PC gaming. Now fond memories alone sustain us.

After being delisted in late 2016 due to problems with the DRM publisher Electronic Arts saddled it with Madness Returns returned in late February this year. It managed to stay on Steam for less than four months before being removed again. As the boilerplate text on its Steam page currently says ""At the request of the publisher Alice: Madness Returns is no longer available for sale on Steam.""

While fans have been quick to blame EA again this time it may be the result of a simple mistake. As American McGee has suggested on Twitter the issue could be down to a problem with another game by developer Spicy Horse: action-RPG Akaneiro: Demon Hunters.

Akaneiro which we described as ""one part Little Red Riding Hood one part Japanese mythos and five parts 'under construction' tape"" had become unplayable—first due to a login problem that could only be circumvented by what one of its developers called an ""Ugly hack"" shared on the Steam forum then by the servers going down.

McGee suggests that while delisting the broken Akaneiro Spicy Horse's other game may have accidentally been caught in the same net. ""We're reaching out to Support and trying to get this resolved"" McGee wrote. If that's the case hopefully it can be restored soon. In the meantime Alice: Madness Returns remains available on Origin and on Game Pass via EA Play.

One of the most popular events in the FIFA Mobile calendar recognizes the best performers from each league season. This year we have an event packed with challenges rewards and of course brand new cards. With so much choice available picking the best option takes a bit of thinking. We’re here with the TOTS Player reviews where we look at each of the FIFA Mobile 22 TOTS starters from the major leagues with this time being Ligue 1 analyzing their playstyles and detailing their pros and cons.

The fifth league of the FIFA Mobile 22 TOTS event is the Ligue 1. A selection of players was selected from the top flight of French football and with a community vote a squad was chosen. This could be the most diverse set of TOTS players we have had so far. League winners PSG only took 4 out of 11 slots whilst the other 7 slots were distributed amongst 5 teams. AS Monaco and Stade Rennais had 2 each whilst Olympique Marseilles RC Lens and FC Nantes each had 1.

All those calculations. All that time. All that effort. It all comes down to this. Choose wisely!

FIFA Mobile 22 Ligue 1 TOTS Players

Aurelien Tchouameni (CDM)

Overall: 94

94 Requirement : 28000 TOTS Community Points

: 28000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Long Passing

Overview

Tchouameni made 50 appearances in all competitions for Monaco in what became the season that established him as one of the biggest talents in Europe. Just recently the defensive midfielder was announced as Real Madrid‘s new Summer signing. The Spanish giants paid close to €100 million according to reports – making this the team’s 4th most expensive signing of all time.

VSA

This card does pop up as a defender every now and then in this mode and overall it performs alright. Tchouameni is not overly difficult to get past however he is tall with quite a heavy build. This allows him to get in the way of passes/shots and add more pressure on the player. For a CDM he defends well and that’s pretty much all that’s needed from a card like this in VSA.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

TOTS Tchouameni is a reliable option for H2H because of how rounded and complete the card is. Defensively Tchouameni is solid with great tackling and aggression. He feels fairly smooth with the ball and is decent at carrying it through midfield. Tchouameni’s passing is a standout though both short-range and long-range.

He plays like an orchestrator in midfield with his ball-playing ability. Sometimes this card would make runs forward as well which may be useful for some players. However for lone CDMs it is important that the card stays back to support the defensive in case of a counter-attack. Tchouameni can get caught out of position from time to time so this is something to be careful of.

Jonathan Clauss (RWB)

Overall: 94

94 Requirement : 28000 TOTS Community Points

: 28000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Balanced

Overview

Clauss had his best season by output in his entire senior career. He was involved in 16 goals in 37 appearances for the French outlet RC Lens. The Frenchman made his move to Ligue 1 for the 2020/21 season and he has been an important player to the team since. His runs and lethal crosses from the right have been crucial in creating goals for Lens.

VSA

An RWB has not been a common position in FIFA Mobile 22. Ideally all cards should be in position for VSA so it’s difficult trying to find a place for Clauss whilst avoiding drops in chemistry/skill boost. Aside from that this card occasionally pops up as a defender in this mode (when positioned as an RB). However he is far from a good defender and he struggles to impose a presence as well. All in all it doesn’t make sense to go for TOTS Clauss for a VSA team and it’s not recommended either.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

It’s evident this card is much better suited for H2H teams. Using Clauss as an RM or an RB is much better than as an RWB. This is mainly because there are no premium LWBs at the time of writing (the best one is at 90 overall). Clauss is a great wide outlet to have in the team. His dribbling and movement feel very fluid and fast. Passing-wise Clauss is tidy and accurate.

Crosses are not as game-changing in this season of FIFA Mobile 22 and this is supposed to be one of the things Ligue 1 TOTS Clauss specializes in. However if you can get multiple players in the box a cross from Clauss could be deadly due to the second balls and deflections. This card is very much oriented to counter-attacking football. Clauss’s whole game focuses around charging forward into spaces and trying to get the ball into the box as often as possible.

Alban Lafont (GK)

Overall: 95

95 Requirement : 42000 TOTS Community Points

: 42000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Reflexes

Overview

FC Nantes finished 18th last season and just slipped away from relegation. This season though they improved drastically finishing 9th in the Ligue 1. Lafont was an important player for the French outlet starting in all 38 matches. At just 23 years old for a goalkeeper he is certainly a good prospect and will be one to watch in the coming years.

VSA

In this season of FIFA Mobile goalkeepers aren’t worth dwelling on when building VSA teams. They’re not that different in terms of shot-stopping and it’s more their “value-for-overall” which makes the difference. TOTS Lafont is very tall and big in build so it appears as though he covers the goal more than other keepers.

However his shot-stopping is nothing too special. In a way Lafont’s massive presence may be useful to essentially try and intimidate the other player. At higher ranks though against more skilled players this is unlikely to make much of a difference.

H2H

It’s the same case in H2H as in VSA for TOTS Lafont. He looks huge on the pitch although his shot-stopping is not really that stand out in comparison to other keepers. Again perhaps his size may put off some players but this is unlikely to happen against more experienced opposition.

William Saliba (CB)

Overall: 95

95 Requirement : 42000 TOTS Community Points

: 42000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Tackling

Overview

Saliba had his first complete-playing season and managed wonders for his team. The 21-year-old made 36 appearances for the French club Olympique Marseille helping them to 15 clean sheets – almost double their total from last season. Saliba has gone on to feature for the France national team as well which is a fantastic achievement for someone of his age. The Frenchman will return to his parent club Arsenal and it will be exciting to see what he can achieve in the Premier League.

VSA

Saliba is a tall and strong CB that is generally a tough player to get past. He can move attackers with just his pure strength and he often gets in the way of shots and passes mainly because of how big his presence is in-game. In addition his tackles are well-timed and clean as well.

However Saliba’s weaknesses are skill moves like the Roulette and the Lane Change. He often gets stunned and is slow to react after which essentially takes him out of the game for a few seconds. All things considered Saliba is a decent defender for VSA but there are certainly CBs on the market that suit this mode better.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

This card is definitely more suited to H2H than VSA. In addition to his defending skillset Saliba has a great pace to catch up with fast attackers. He is also comfortable with bringing the ball out from the back and spraying passes at distance. Saliba can easily slot into a dual-CB partnership and can also function anywhere in a back 3 with little problem.

Benjamin Bourigeaud (RM)

Overall: 96

96 Requirement : 67000 TOTS Community Points

: 67000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Dribbling

Overview

Bourigeaud had a fantastic season with Stade Rennais. He started in all 38 matches for the French outlet and totaled 11 goals and 12 assists. The 28-year-old was the heart of Rennais every game and helped them to a 4th place finish. In fact Bourigeaud’s 121 chances created the last term is the best out of any player in the Top 5 European leagues.

VSA

Just by looking at the stats it is clear this card is definitely not targeted for VSA teams. The 3* weak left foot for a right midfielder is not great at all. Whilst Bourigeaud’s shots are decently accurate and powerful they aren’t reliable and trying to move onto the right foot each time is quite inconvenient. Whilst Bourigeaud is a fine dribbler the end product just isn’t there. On top of that he only has 3* skill moves too – something else that isn’t ideal for VSA.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

We can see a better version of this card in H2H than in VSA by a long distance. Bourigeaud is of course very fluid and fast with the ball but also has a brilliant passing range too. He can pick out a player from any range both through a crowd and over. Bourigeaud is best played as a wide playmaker that stays towards the wing. His incisive passes and shots from outside the box are the key things to make use of.

Neymar Jr (LW)

Overall: 96

96 Requirement : 67000 TOTS Community Points

: 67000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Agility

Overview

Neymar’s 5th season with PSG was another plagued with injuries. However the Brazilian showed shades of his former self with 22 league appearances. Neymar racked up 13 goals and 6 assists in these games averaging 0.86 contributions per game. The 30-year-old has been one of the most feared attackers of the last generation because of his deadly attacking skill-set and outrageously quick feet.

VSA

Neymar has always been a useful card in FIFA Mobile particularly in VSA. His 5* weak foot combined with his brilliant agility and ball control make him lethal for attacking chances. Neymar’s shots are also reliable especially the outside-foot shots which rarely ever miss. Left-wingers usually appear a lot more often than other positions in VSA chances and having Neymar there is a great solution.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

Like in real life Neymar feels brilliant on the ball and is rapid on the turn. His two-footed nature means he can be unpredictable in the box and a pain to deal with for opposition defenders. The card isn’t especially centered towards playmaking but that doesn’t mean it can’t play a good through ball either. Neymar’s low strength stats are easy to point out but it barely makes a difference in-game. All in all this is a really great card for any team.

Marquinhos (CB)

Overall: 97

97 Requirement : 111000 TOTS Community Points

: 111000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Strength

Overview

Marquinhos was one of PSG‘s most important players last term starting 32 of their games. He helped them reclaim the Ligue 1 title by contributing towards 13 clean sheets and popping 5 goals for himself at the other end. This upcoming season will complete a decade of his time at PSG.

VSA

Overall Marquinhos is a solid defender in VSA. He marks attackers well and although he does get slightly stunned by skill moves he can react quickly. Despite his small presence on the pitch Marquinhos is quite strong with his tackles. For the large price perhaps this card isn’t worth it for VSA but nonetheless it’s still a decent player all around.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

In addition to his defensive skill set Marquinhos is capable of bringing the ball out from the back. As he was originally a midfielder in real life he still possesses that great passing range and control over the ball. He is quite fast too which is always a bonus for H2H. Because of this he can fit into any formation be it a back three or four.

Wissam Ben Yedder (ST)

Overall: 97

97 Requirement : 111000 TOTS Community Points

: 111000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Target Man

Overview

Ben Yedder was one of the best strikers in French club football last term. He fired 25 goals and assisted a further 5 in just 29 league starts for AS Monaco. This has been a season to remember in particular for Ben Yedder who set a personal record for the most domestic goal contributions.

VSA

Ben Yedder is a lethal player in the box for VSA. He feels smooth with the ball and has an excellent burst of speed. His finishing ability is also fantastic the Frenchman can finish with both feet and can get incredible power on his shots. Ben Yedder is a little short in height but he can still head the ball with power and has a fair bit of strength too. All in all this is a great striker for the team.

Image via Electronic Arts

H2H

Similarly in H2H Ben Yedder is a constant threat whenever he gets the ball inside the box. He can score from anywhere in there and has a 5* weak foot making him a handful for opposition defenders. For those that like their strikers to make runs in behind Ben Yedder can do that as well! He has quite a bit of pace and can run into spaces often. This is a really deadly striker to have and can suit multiple playstyles.

Martin Terrier (LM)

Overall: 98

98 Requirement : 163000 TOTS Community Points

: 163000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Long Shots

Overview

Terrier seemed to have exploded onto the scene in the last season of the Ligue 1. The 25-year-old bagged 21 goals and a further 3 assists more than doubling his previous highest season goal tally (9). He helped his team Stade Rennais to a respectable 4th place finish securing UEFA Europa League football for next season.

VSA and H2H Gameplay

Image via Electronic Arts

Stats-wise this looks like a pretty decent card and it is in-game too. However there are certain things that annoyingly bring it down. The combination of 3* skill moves and 3* weak foot is far from ideal. This is particularly irritating in VSA where Terrier’s weaker left foot continuously came in the way.

The card can’t do one of the game’s best skill moves either (the Lane Change). By ignoring those two factors this is actually a really great card. It’s lightning-quick really smooth with the ball and powerful with the finish. For such a high price perhaps there should be more which is why this card was slightly disappointing.

Lionel Messi (RW)

Overall: 98

98 Requirement : 163000 TOTS Community Points

: 163000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Speed

Overview

Messi ended his first season at his new club on a high by winning the Ligue 1 title. The Argentine star scored 6 and assisted 14 in just 24 league starts with an additional five goals in seven UCL matches. His year may not have fully gone as planned but even in an “under-performing” campaign Messi put up numbers that many players dream for. That’s a symbol of how high the standards are that he has set himself and just how good he has been all this time. Who knows which edition of FIFA Mobile 22 holds the final Ligue 1 TOTS card for Lionel Messi? So drink it in and enjoy it whilst it is here!

VSA and H2H Gameplay

Image via Electronic Arts

TOTS Messi is a complete winger that can both create play and finish it. Just like in real life Messi is very fluid with the ball and is really fun to use. His passing range is great and this card is capable of making those crazy through balls. Shooting-wise Messi is fantastic too – he can score from anywhere in the final 3rd and in particular he’s got one ridiculous finesse shot.

The card’s low strength is easy to point out from the stats but that rarely comes up as an issue in-game. For H2H it’s worth noting that Messi plays like more of a wide playmaker. He doesn’t make runs forward/in behind. Instead he will receive the ball around the halfway line and then carry it forward to try and create something.

Kylian Mbappe (ST)

Overall: 98

98 Requirement : 173000 TOTS Community Points

: 173000 TOTS Community Points Skill Boost: Shooting

Overview

It’s difficult to put words together and describe how good Kylian Mbappe can be at times. The 23-year-old is an absolute freak of nature and we still haven’t seen him at his absolute best either. In the last season he racked up 28 goals and 17 assists in just 35 appearances – about 1.3 goal contributions per game. By doing that Mbappe casually claimed both the Top Scorer and Top Assister awards. It really is scary to think about what Mbappe would like at his full potential.

VSA and H2H Gameplay

Image via Electronic Arts

Those that have used Mbappe’s previous cards in this season of FIFA Mobile 22 will know how enjoyable this guy is to use. He’s got an incredible shooting ability alongside great dribbling and electric pace. On the ball there are few cards in the game that are as smooth and fluid as Kylian Mbappe. He has fairly decent strength too making him a handful for opposition defenders. This card is of course very expensive but it’s a nice card regardless.

The majority in Congress claimed to solve the problem by giving FDA more money without specifics or accountability. Though Abbott has resumed production President Biden confirmed after meeting with manufacturers that the shortage will extend at least another 2 months and so he'll continue to fly in formula from Europe.

These actions will not get to the root cause of the problem: government tinkering with market forces. Until we change how the federal government runs and make agency decisions transparent and accountable to the American people we will continue to stumble from one disaster to the next.

Shortages of lifesaving products are not new. They happen when bureaucrats and middlemen make decisions behind closed doors without transparency or accountability. You might remember shortages of chemotherapy drugs EpiPens and more recently saline solution and the dye used in computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans. Oncologists have been forced to choose which cancer patient gets a dose of chemo. Bee allergic children are told to ""just avoid bees.""

The pathway to market for these products is controlled by secret contracts between insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who craft the formularies for insurer's drug plans or between hospitals and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) gatekeepers that control which products they use. These contracts limit the number of companies that manufacture products that are used in hospitals and nursing homes by eliminating smaller companies from the deals creating de facto monopolies and driving up prices.

Those of us who practice medicine see the people who face these disasters every day in our work. We are asked to guide parents through shortages caused by people who have little or no connection to our patients while government officials provide temporary appeasements but no long-term solutions.

This is exactly the same approach the Biden administration democrats and a handful of republicans in Congress want to take with the problem of soaring insulin prices. Over the past 20 years the price of a vial of insulin has increased by more than 1000%. Our leaders in government want you to believe this is because greedy pharma companies have jacked up the price year after year squeezing diabetics for every penny they can to keep the supply flowing. The reality is more complex.

Very few people purchase insulin directly from pharmaceutical companies. Most get it through a pharmacy which uses a PBM middleman to manage the transaction. Pharma companies give PBMs ""rebates"" in exchange for preferred placement on their formularies (lists of drugs that your insurance covers). These ""rebates"" are tied to the price of the drug -- higher drug prices mean more profits for PBMs. In actuality ""rebates"" are kickbacks as evidenced by the fact that the PBM (and the GPO) enjoy a government-sanctioned exemption from the anti-kickback statute.

By controlling the formulary PBMs control which drugs your insurance will cover. This gives them tremendous sway over the drugs you take and the price you pay for them. They leverage the rules of this game to favor more expensive drugs and keep their profits rolling in. This is exactly what happened with insulin. Express Scripts the largest PBM will cover Humalog Eli Lilly's branded insulin but not Lispro its generic insulin that's 65% cheaper.

Rather than try to untangle this web of secrecy and self-dealing both Biden and Congress's proposal would ignore the middlemen and cap only the monthly cost of insulin at $35. This puts taxpayers and employers on the hook for the rest of the overpriced cost which flows to PBMs and the insurance companies that own them. It will be business as usual as middlemen continue to rake in massive profits on every vial sold.

Many members of Congress understand this is a systemic problem yet they won't tackle the wealthy kickback collectors. Is it possible they think these middlemen are too big to fail?

The Federal Trade Commission just announced that it will open an investigation into PBM practices and while that is welcome news we need solutions that get at the root of the problem. One model that would accomplish this was proposed in Matt's Act (HR 7722) a bipartisan bill that would reduce the insulin co-pay to $20 for the uninsured. HR 7722 removes the middlemen from the insulin market pays manufacturers a reasonable price and maintains an open formulary so other insulin manufacturers can also compete in the market which would drive down prices across the board. This type of model would solve the insulin cost problem for everyone in America -- except the PBMs.

In addition we need immediate transparency for the current and previous kickback contracts for crucial medications that have previously faced shortages -- like epinephrine saline chemotherapeutics penicillin and CT contrast -- so we can see how much government sanctioned kickbacks are costing Americans and consider repealing them.

Without these two important steps we will continue to have shortages in our government manipulated market. It frightens us to think that the infant formula shortage could soon play out much the same way with insulin.

“It is smoldering” said Gabrielle Hillman a resident of Metairie. “We’ve been trying to be better about using our eco-mode on our A/C but then you come home and it’s 80 degrees in the house.”

As Louisiana nears record highs and feels-like temperatures in the triple digits there’s only so much one can do to stay cool-- crank the A/C and pay the price.

Nick Caillouet says he’s not surprised about seeing higher bills during the always unforgiving southern summer.

Entergy says set your thermostat to 78° this summer to save on your energy bill

“I’m running the A/C at 70 degrees no matter what because I’m out in it all day. I need to come home to cool air” he said.

Higher outside temperatures require more energy to cool your home which means bills increase when you’re looking to cool down from the summer swelter.

“During this time of year that A/C unit is basically costing you over half of your electricity bill” said Sandra Diggs-Miller Vice Pres. of Customer Service for Entergy New Orleans. “That’s before you get to the appliances and the lights and all the other things attached to it.”

She said increased fuel costs have led to higher bills.

“The cost of natural gas has increased exponentially since February” said Diggs-Miller. “I want customers to know that the fuel charge fluctuates based on personal usage.”

She recommends people set their thermostat at 78 degrees to save money.

Entergy says set your thermostat to 78° this summer to save on your energy bill

“Any degree below (78) can actually raise your bill as much as 3%. So if you’re cranking your A/C down to 72 degrees you’ve already increased your electricity bill by 18% that month” Diggs-Miller said.

While some may challenge that recommendation she said cooling costs can account for as much as 55% of your monthly energy usage.

The hot summer months add stress to the local energy grid. Eric Smith associate director of the Tulane University Energy Institute said the grid in Louisiana is strong enough to handle the surge.

“Generally we don’t lose power from heat. I mean we’re used to it you know. That’s not our normal situation. Where we lose power catastrophically is with hurricanes” he said.

This summer other areas of the country are preparing for rolling blackouts caused by the heat and the stress it places on the nation’s power grid a result of fossil fuel plants shutting down and a stronger push for alternative energy sources.

Smith says Louisiana is in a much better position than other states thanks to heavy industrial power consumption.

“We have a fairly well-developed grid with one glaring exception... which is Texas doesn’t have a whole lot of interconnects with anybody including Louisiana. But we have good interconnects with Mississippi Arkansas even Oklahoma” he said which allows the state to purchase power from neighboring states in emergency situations as long as the connections work.

“It’s a question of how much stress are you going to put the system under? You can never guarantee that nothing is going to happen” said Smith. “But what you want to do is get rid of the obvious things that have a tendency to happen more frequently like wires going down or the loss of a fuel supply that’s predictable.”

Smith says the Louisiana power grid is “in pretty good shape” following Hurricane Ida nearly 10 months ago.

“The biggest long-term weakness is that we don’t generate much of our power locally. It’s all being brought in from outside Orleans Parish” he said.

As other states shift to greener forms of energy Smith said those states will still need a backup for emergencies-- like drought wildfires and even hurricanes.

“When you’re dealing with wind and solar and hydro to a certain extent you’re dealing with intermittent sources and they have a habit of going down when you least need them to go down” he said adding they can be unreliable if conditions aren’t favorable. “But you have to simultaneously install backup power supply and that’s one of the problems [states like] California has had.”

Fortunately Louisiana has two main sources of power he says nuclear and natural gas.

Wind and solar energy fields oftentimes require thousands of acres of land something that Louisiana can’t afford. Because of this Smith predicts nuclear energy will dominate the “green” space of energy consumption.

“Nuclear energy has a lot of potential to supply clean power and the ability to be reliable with a smaller footprint per kilowatt-hour than anything else we’re currently doing” said Smith.

All in all Smith says Louisiana is in a good position and likely won’t see rolling blackouts this summer like other states.

“I think Louisiana is probably going to complain a lot because that’s what we do but the fact of the matter is if you spent time analyzing other parts of the country they have far far worse problems with power supply than we do.”

Diggs-Miller says the work continues to harden the grid in Southeast Louisiana and believes Entergy is ready for the hurricane season. She said the energy giant has a hurricane response plan and is working closely with the City of New Orleans and the Sewerage and Water Board.

This problem has captured the attention of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu who formed a Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee to address the rental market.

“If we aren’t willing to take on the rent increases that are driving families out of Boston then we aren’t meeting the needs of our neighborhoods” the mayor said in a statement announcing the committee back in March.

While escalating costs are certainly troublesome in Boston where the majority of residents and families are renters there are other issues that need to be exposed and addressed. Among them is the “lottery” system for affordable housing which city officials developers and leasing agents need to improve with greater fairness and transparency.

This issue was made all the more real for me when young professional I know told me her story. “Chantise” as I’ll call her here has “won” no less than 15 lotteries for affordable units in new developments in neighborhoods across Boston. Out of those opportunities how many apartments has Chantise been able to rent? Zero.

3000 Applications for 62 Units

As Chantise discovered leasing agents sometimes had as many as 20 lottery winners for one apartment. At times she was told she was “close” but that actually meant five potential renters ahead of her.

Her story is all too common. As Emilio Dorcely CEO of nonprofit developer Urban Edge in Roxbury told WGBH News “At the rate we’re going we’re not going to really meet the housing needs of both people who are already here but also the projected new residents that would be moving to Boston for the next several years.”

Competition is fierce for affordable housing options. One project Emilo was working on received 3000 applications for 62 units.

Bias runs rampant such as the leasing agent who pointedly asked Chantise (not once but twice) whether she was “Section 8.”

Lotteries allows renters to take a look at the properties (although as Chantise discovered the units shown may not be the ones that ultimately get rented). In one building she toured Chantise asked the leasing agent “How diverse is this building?” The agent immediately responded “It’s not about diversity it’s about who can afford it.”

Assuming he misunderstood the question Chantise rephrased it “Are there any people of color in this building?” The agent replied “Like I said this is not about diversity – it’s about who can afford the rent.” Immediately a Hispanic couple who happened to be touring the property at the same time exchanged a knowing look with Chantise.

Sadly this does not surprise me. Gentrification across Boston including in the Roxbury neighborhood where I live is all about raising rents. Affordable housing gets little more than lip service creating a housing crisis for people of color who feel unwelcome and excluded in these developments. Bias runs rampant such as the leasing agent who pointedly asked Chantise (not once but twice) whether she was “Section 8” referring to government subsidies for low-income housing. And twice Chantise confirmed that she was not; rather this working professional with a full-time job needs affordable housing like so many others.

Agents Developers: Step Up

It’s a national crisis compounded by skyrocketing housing prices across the U.S. In metro areas high costs and low supply are nearly insurmountable obstacles for professionals looking to rent a decent apartment. As for the lowest-income renters their problem is most acute with a coast-to-coast shortage of supply. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition “No state has an adequate supply for affordable rental housing for the lowest-income renters.”

The Brookings Institution recently examined the Boston market where zoning laws have limited housing development. As the institute wrote: “First high housing costs impede the regional labor market making it harder for employers to hire and retain workers. Second limiting housing development near job centers and public transit leads more workers to undertake long-distance solo car commutes worsening traffic and creating harmful environmental impacts.”

Third “exclusionary zoning” within affluent white communities “exacerbates racial and economic segregation … limiting Black and Latino or Hispanic families’ access to high-opportunity communities.”

To say such practices must stop is to state the obvious but once again we need to shine a harsh spotlight on unfair exclusionary practices. Developers and leasing agents must pledge to increase fairness and transparency in the rental process particularly where affordable units are part of a development. To do anything less is to violate the principles of inclusive development – and perhaps cross a legal line as well.

As for Chantise she recently found a place to rent; however it is not in one of the new buildings she had hoped to occupy. But she could no longer endure the emotional roller coaster of “winning” the lottery to view an apartment she would never be able to rent. As she told me “If that wasn’t bad enough every time I applied for an apartment they pulled my credit. That happened 15 times – and I know that impacts my credit score.”

Come on Boston. We can do better than this.

I joined the civil service late in the day five years ago. While I will get a pension obviously this will be much less than if I had spent my career in this area. I am in the Single Public Service Pension Scheme which I find totally incomprehensible.

I worked for almost 20 years in the UK where I was born as a teacher then relocated to Ireland in my late 30s. I will get a state pension from the UK and I opted to take my teaching pension at 55 — yes I have declared this — because my starting salary in the civil service was not great.

I have worked in Ireland since leaving university here 19 years ago. Before the civil service this was in the private sector where I just paid the standard PRSI.

I aim to pay off my mortgage in a couple of years; the house is probably worth about €300000. I have no dependants and have no intention of leaving the property to my two ghastly siblings to whom I do not speak or their children.

How can I release equity in the property to make my retirement more comfortable without leaving myself at the mercy of predatory investment companies?

I would also be grateful if you could explain how getting a UK state pension impacts upon my State pension here?

– Mr PJ email

Employment is more mobile all the time — both between private and public sectors and between different countries. As a result there are many people who will find themselves in much the same position as you.

First the good news. It appears you have managed to build up some retirement benefits consistently along the way in your career. Unfortunately for you in your 19 years working in the private sector here in Ireland those amounted only to the basic State pension as you made no private sector pension provision.

In addition your UK teacher’s pension already well short of the maximum available by virtue of your truncated career in the sector will have been adversely affected by your decision to start drawing it down at 55.

These are personal decisions that everyone has to make based on their circumstances at the time. There is little point living in penury in order to maintain a pension payout that you may or may not live to enjoy later in life or may not need as much at that point. In your case given your low starting salary in the civil service you opted to tap the teacher’s pension earlier than you might have.

In retirement then you will currently have four difference strands of retirement income. First there will be this albeit lowered teacher’s pension then the pension from your current civil service employment.

You joined the civil service at 53 so you will have just 12 years to build up a pension entitlement if you decide to retire at the minimum pensionable age. However while Irish civil servants can retire at 65 there is nothing to oblige them to do so. They are able to continue working until they are 70 which in your case would certainly help in boosting your retirement income — and the retirement lump sum you would also be due.

Those who do keep working past 65 are not allowed to draw down their Irish State pension until they retire I gather but then you will have the benefit of your salary. You will also have the benefit of the UK state pension which kicks in at the UK state pension age — currently 67.

Up to 2016 the UK had both a basic state pension and an additional state pensions or Serps. This has now been replaced by a new state pension scheme. My understanding is that as a teacher and a member of the teacher’s pension scheme you will have contracted out of the additional state pension and this will be reflected in your entitlement under the new state pension.

At today’s rate you would get £141.85 a week if you were entitled to a full state pension but as you worked in the UK for only 20 years you would get only a proportion of that. As I understand it you need 35 years’ contributions for a full pension — it used to be 30 — so you will get 20/35ths of the rate or about £81 a week or €94.50.

Of course by the time you retire those numbers will have risen.

There is nothing to stop you receiving your UK state pension directly into an Irish bank despite Brexit. You will need to contact authorities in the UK’s international pension centre four months before your 67th birthday. Getting your UK pensions paid to you here has no impact on the Irish State pension as they can both be assessed separately.

Then there’s the Irish State pension. Again this can get complicated. Under existing rules the pension is calculated on the basis of your PRSI payments over your working life in Ireland. This penalises people who took career breaks but works in favour of those like you arrived here mid-career and worked from then to retirement. On that basis you would be entitled to a full State pension of €253.30 a week at current rates.

However we are transitioning to a new total contributions approach that requires 40 years of contributions for a full pension — or 2080 weekly contributions. On that basis you will get a pro-rata pension as your PRSI contributions will stop once you reach the age of 66 (though that may change). That would give you 27 years of contributions and a State pension of about €171 at current rates.

As of now you are entitled to whichever calculation is more favourable. The intention is to move fully towards the total contributions approach but the understanding was that this would have happened before now. You’d assume it will close the door to you before you hit 66 but this is Ireland so nothing is certain.

So you may have more income that you think by that stage.

You rightly stress that you have declared your teacher’s pension in Ireland. This is relevant because state pensions are taxable where when aggregated or with other income they exceed any local tax-free threshold.

Releasing equity

When it comes to releasing home equity in retirement or close to it there are limited options. You either sell all or part of the property to a specialist finance house. Neither is particularly good value but given your interest in maximising your potential income during your life without any intention to leave assets behind you in death they might appeal. You refer to “predatory investment companies” but the fact is that no one is lending to someone who has no ability to make repayments except under a lopsided arrangement that favours the investor.

Seniors Money trading as Spry Finance lends money against the market value of the home. You can borrow a maximum of 15 per cent of that market value at the age of 60 rising by one percentage point for every additional year to a maximum of 45 per cent at the age of 99. So on the current market value of your home you could borrow about €66000 at the age of 67 or €75000 at age 70.

Clearly the actual figure will be determined by your home’s market value at the time you go to borrow.

You can take an initial loan and return at a later age to borrow more based on any increase in the property value and your increased years.

Interest is added to the loan which if not repaid earlier is payable from the sale of the property when you die or vacate it. Though interest can accrue alarmingly the company says your total liability will never exceed the value of the home.

As it appears you’re not particularly taken with your close family using all the equity in the property to improve your standard of living seems an option that would be worth considering.

The other option is residential reversion. Where you continue to own the property with a loan under residential reversion you are effectively selling a stake in the property.

In Ireland the one company offering this service is called Home Plus. And as it is not going to get access to the property for a while you will get only a fraction of the true value of the stake you sell. Home Plus’s chief executive Ian Higgins transparently noted as an example that a couple aged 67 and 70 looking to release 25 per cent of the value of their home would have to sell 72 per cent of the property to his firm.

In your case on today’s values that would give you an additional €75000 at a cost of 70 per cent of your home.

The final option would be to find someone outside either of those two formal structures willing to purchase your home while granting you an exclusive right of residence in it until you die. As this would inevitably be a property investor I expect that even if you could find such a person the value they would pay would reflect the fact that they would not get access to the property until you die. You would also want to make sure that any contract of sale was very carefully drawn up to ensure your right to live in the property was legally fully protected before signing anything.

Income tax rules explained | Mint,"I am planning to buy a residential flat by investing the redemption proceeds of my mutual funds investment. Will I be able to claim capital gain exemption if I reinvest the redemption proceeds for buying the second residential flat as I already have one residential house in my name? What is the time period of investment in residential property from date of mutual fund redemption? Can I claim this exemption again if I had already claimed exemption earlier for buying the first house?

Answer: Section 54F of Income Tax Act allow an individual and an HUF to claim exemption from long term capital gains arising from sale of an asset other than a residential house if the net sale consideration received on sale of such asset is invested to buy a residential house property within specified time period subject to fulfilment of certain conditions. This exemption can only be claimed if the you do not own more than one house on the date of sale of the assets.

Since you only have one house other than the one being planned to save capital gains tax you are eligible to claim exemption under Section 54F if you invest the redemption proceeds of your mutual fund investments to buy the second house. I presume that all your investments in mutual funds have become long term.

The sale consideration has to be invested to buy a residential house within two years from sale of the mutual fund investments. You can also self-construct a residential house or book an under construction property and get the construction completed or possession within three years from the date of sale of your mutual fund investments. Amount remaining unutilised by 31st July of the next financial year i.e. the due date of filing of your ITR has to be deposited in capital gains account scheme on or before this date.

Yes. you can claim this exemption for second house even if you have already claimed similar exemption earlier.

Travel retail—which covers mostly duty-free environments at airports downtown locations airlines cruise ships and border shops—is one of the company’s highest-growth channels and serves three billion consumers in a typical year.



The new 300000-square-foot facility adds to the company’s existing distribution footprint in Switzerland but its scale means that it doubles output capacity. The new unit is modular and therefore equipped to support continued “dynamic growth” of travel retail. It is also more sustainable with for example solar panels on the roof generating 1600 kilowatts at peak performance (kWp).



High expectations



Earlier this year leadership changes at the very top of travel retail gave BeautyMatter the impression that ELC was preparing for a boom as airport travel picked up and China’s duty-free island of Hainan continued to prosper.



This was confirmed by ELC’s president and CEO Fabrizio Freda. He came in person to the opening ceremony on Tuesday June 7 underlining the importance of the project. Freda said “Travel retail continues to demonstrate resilience driving tremendous growth over the last decade. We remain extremely confident in the channel for the long-term especially as travel restrictions ease globally and people start traveling again.”



He added: “The opening of our new Galgenen distribution center will enable us to adapt even better to ever-changing retail needs and growth opportunities for the channel.”



ELC claims its travel retail division has the biggest market share in the channel for total beauty (skincare makeup fragrance and haircare) ahead of L’Oréal Group. This is based on figures from Generation Research which in 2019 before the pandemic started estimated the entire channel (across all categories) was worth just over $86.4 billion. In 2020 the market collapsed to $44 billion largely due to the pandemic impact at airports but beauty thrived in downtown duty-free locations like Hainan.



ELC has also pushed forwards with strong activations to recruit new consumers and build brand awareness for its portfolio of luxury brands which includes Jo Malone London La Mer and Tom Ford.



Thirty years of travel retail



Israel Assa ELC’s new Global President Travel Retail Worldwide was unable to attend the opening due to COVID but in a statement he said “As we mark the 30th anniversary of The Estée Lauder Companies’ travel retail business we are incredibly proud of our track record ... and having made the channel an integral engine of growth for ELC. By investing in these capabilities (in Galgenen) and with our retailers we can capture the next generation of growth in this prestige marketplace.”



On the center itself ELC’s Executive Vice President Global Supply Chain Roberto Canevari commented “Galgenen will serve as a cornerstone of (our) global fulfillment network. This distribution center will not only significantly enhance our capacity but enable operational efficiencies speed-to-market and resiliency through highly automated equipment and technologies.”



ELC is the fifth-largest employer in the canton of Schwyz having opened an affiliate office in Switzerland more than 55 years ago and its first manufacturing plant more than 45 years ago. Switzerland is also home to ELC’s EMEA and travel retail supply chain management hub in Wollerau.



On the sustainability front as well as roof solar panels Galgenen’s building design is based on the newest standards to reduce energy and water consumption; features total LED lighting; and a comprehensive waste management system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plbWltYW1jZXZveS8yMDIyLzA2LzE5L3RoZXktaW5oZXJpdGVkLWJpbGxpb25zLXVwb24td2FsdG9ucy1rb2Nocy1tYXJzYmlsbGlvbnMtbWVldC1hbWVyaWNhcy1yaWNoZXN0LWhlaXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,They Inherited Billions Upon Billions: Meet America's Richest Heirs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2022/06/19/they-inherited-billions-upon-waltons-kochs-marsbillions-meet-americas-richest-heirs/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plbWltYW1jZXZveS8yMDIyLzA2LzE5L3RoZXktaW5oZXJpdGVkLWJpbGxpb25zLXVwb24td2FsdG9ucy1rb2Nocy1tYXJzYmlsbGlvbnMtbWVldC1hbWVyaWNhcy1yaWNoZXN0LWhlaXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The Brooklyn-based business would have been liable for corporation tax of almost £7m if it had booked all sales made in the UK at its local entity Etsy UK according to research by the campaign group TaxWatch.

Instead the vast majority of UK sales – the total of which are revealed in Etsy’s US stock market filings – are booked via an Irish company where they attract a lower tax rate. The tactic is similar to that used by a string of US tech companies including Facebook Google Apple and Microsoft. Amazon books much of its UK business via Luxembourg. There is nothing illegal about such structures but they raise ethical questions about where profits and tax are paid.

Etsy which listed on the US-based Nasdaq exchange in 2015 is liable for the UK’s digital services tax which would have amounted to about £2.4m for 2020 according to TaxWatch but that amount still falls far short of its calculation for corporation tax due if all UK sales had been registered here and not booked in Ireland.

Since then Etsy’s sales surged by 68% in 2021 to $329m hitting a level more than six times than booked in 2018. The group also snapped up the UK-based secondhand fashion site Depop in June last year adding millions more of sales in this country to its books.

George Turner at TaxWatch said: “Despite Etsy’s ethical pretensions it is in fact just another US tech company using the same tax structures as other US tech companies to move profit out of the UK and into tax haven Ireland.”

Turner said Etsy’s current tax bill in the UK might fall even further as the digital service tax could be ditched under a global tax deal organised via the OECD.

Etsy is unlikely to be liable for a planned OECD-backed global minimum corporation tax for global businesses with sales of more than €750m (£643m) – expected to be 15% of income. Under the plans companies that use tax havens will face an additional tax charge in their home country – the US in Etsy’s case. Under current plans only businesses with turnover of more than $20bn – compared with Etsy’s $2bn-$3bn – would be forced to pay additional taxes in the countries where they make their money.

Etsy declined to comment on the details of TaxWatch’s calculation of its tax liabilities in the UK but it is understood the company did pay a digital service tax in the country in 2020 and 2021.

An Etsy spokesperson said the company had “paid or accrued for any known and material tax obligations in compliance with current cross-border tax laws. Cross-border corporate tax law is extremely complex and Etsy is committed to paying our fair share.

“Ireland is the location of our international headquarters where we employ dozens of people who support our international community across many critical business functions like software and product engineers payments operations technical project managers and member support.”

Etsy said it endorsed the OECD’s attempt to “create a more equitable and simple model” for cross-border taxation and added: “We are very supportive of a global consensus on how to tax the digital economy even if our tax bill increases.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMC13ZWlyZGVzdC10aGluZ3MtYnV5LW5vdy0xOTAwMDA0MDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 10 Weirdest Things You Can Buy Right Now On Etsy Feel Borderline Illegal,"

Recently we went down a bit of a rabbit hole searching far and wide for some of the weirdest items you can buy on Amazon. While some were relatively PG such as a giant loaf of bread to be used as a pillow others were… well… items like a wolf dildo. There’s really no other way to say it.

Today's Top Deals

But this got us thinking which other hidden corners of the internet can you purchase some odd items? Well sadly we got an answer way too quickly. It’s Etsy. And the weirdest things from Etsy completely surpass the bizarreness we saw on Amazon. We almost wish we were never curious to begin with.

The thing about Etsy is that just about everything is either vintage or homemade. While the majority of this aspect makes Etsy an incredible place for small businesses and up-and-coming artists it also allows for a bit of a strange grey area regarding what is allowed to be sold on Etsy. Something you might think is really wacky another might be calling their “art”. We understand art is absolutely subjective but some things feel like they deserve a spot on the dark web instead of Etsy.

From planters (yes for your plants) you won’t believe exist to murderabilia we’re not sure should be sold online check out 10 of the weirdest things you can buy on Etsy below.

And visual artists have also been inspired by the Tesla Inc TSLA CEO. Just click about on Etsy Inc ETSY and you'll find a surplus of Musk-inspired art.

However some of these Etsy works are more interesting than their creators might have imagined. Today let's take a tour through this digital gallery in search of the 10 weirdest paintings of the man that everyone is always talking about.

A Blunt Reaction: The now-iconic image of Musk smoking a blunt has inspired a flurry of artwork but this painting by the Etsy seller Celia Renee Design offers a bizarre consideration of the wacky weed's side effects: it appears that the left side of Musk's face has become swollen and discolored while he is puffing away. It also appears that his blunt disintegrated in his fingers which might be the cause of his dyspeptic expression.

The Harvey Dent Look: No one ever accused Musk of being a ""two-face"" but Petras Interior Art's interpretation gives him a distinctive facial split with a craggy blue-grey half that suggests the dark side of the moon and a sharp yellow-bronze half that suggests the lunar surface facing the sun.

Man In The Moon: Fans of ""The Honeymooners"" may recall the opening credits with Jackie Gleason's broad beaming face filling up the moon but Etsy artist Luke Dangler went one better by making Musk's entire head into the outer space entity. And Musk is unusually happy to see a spaceship heading straight for his nostrils.

A Whiter Shade Of Pale: This multimedia offering from The Rufus Shop has a ghostly yet jocular Musk framed in neon. Hey why not?

The Angel Of The Lord Declared Unto Elon: Very few people would ever mistake Musk for Our Lady of Guadeloupe but Etsy seller Little Beauty Room found a divine concept in offering the Tesla chief executive as a religious icon worthy of enshrinement on a votive candle glass.

My My At Waterloo Napoleon Did Surrender: Musk is considered by many to be a 21st century hero but the Etsy seller Portrait My Pets has no trouble placing him in an 18th century military environment. However he might want to take a minute to straighten out those medals.

L'Amour Est Bleu: The artist known as S3XYDES9 appears to believe that Musk would be a perfect addition to Blue Man Group hence the shaved head and cobalt skin.

Dr. Strangemusk: Perhaps the oddest vision of Musk is this work from Travis Chapman Art which casts Musk in the Slim Pickens role as the cowboy airman riding an H-bomb to his doom in Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove."" But then again no one ever said to Musk that he wasn't going to get his hair mussed.

What's Up Musk?: Musk obviously neglected to make that left turn at Albuquerque and thus wound up in Elmer Fudd's neighborhood. This painting by Minotaurt is the rare Musk-inspired piece that acknowledges his work with The Boring Company.

A Man's Best Friend Is His Doge: And of course how could we have a Benzinga piece without a shout out to Dogecoin DOGE/USD? Kudos to The Crypto World for this artwork featuring the digital asset that Musk loves to hype even if he won't accept it for payment on his Tesla vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTcvc3R5bGUvanVuZXRlZW50aC1wYXJ0eS1zdXBwbGllcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Juneteenth Merchandise: The Good the Bad and the Cringe,"Brandy Goodner first learned about Juneteenth when she was 14. Although she didn’t begin celebrating the holiday — a commemoration of the day in 1865 that enslaved people in Texas were told that they had been freed two years earlier — until she was an adult Ms. Goodner now parties like she’s making up for lost time.

“I’m a little over the top” said Ms. Goodner 41 who lives in Indianapolis. “I like a little extra pizazz some details things of that sort.”

In 2020 seeing an opening in the market for Juneteenth decorations and party favors — the few she found on Etsy were never exactly what she had in mind — Ms. Goodner decided to create her own line of Juneteenth party supplies.

Last year she started her own party-supply company We Celebrate Black and began offering her goods online. Through word of mouth she started to sell banners paper cups and plastic cutlery with zigzag decorations in yellow black and red for the Pan-African flag a symbol of Black liberation in the United States.

It's been a trying year for the investing community. Since hitting their respective all-time closing highs within the past seven months the well-known Dow Jones Industrial Average benchmark S&P 500 and growth-dependent Nasdaq Composite have lost 19% 24% and 34% of their value as of June 16 2022.

Although big declines in the stock market can be worrisome historical data shows that buying during these dips is a genius move. Over long periods every notable decline in the major U.S. indexes has eventually been wiped away by a bull market. The key to success aside from buying stakes in innovative high-quality businesses is allowing time to work its magic.

With equities significantly below their all-time highs a number of innovative companies stand out as amazing values for patient investors. What follows are five surefire stocks that have the ability to build generation wealth over the next 25 years.

Intuitive Surgical

To begin with robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.46%) offers significant wealth-building potential for long-term investors thanks to its lasting competitive advantages.

When the first quarter came to a close Intuitive Surgical had installed 6920 of its da Vinci surgical systems in hospitals and surgical centers worldwide. This figure is many multiples higher than its next-closest competitor. But what's far more important to recognize is that the cost of these systems coupled with the training given to surgeons to operate them makes it highly unlikely that customers would ever switch to a competitor. Da Vinci system buyers effectively become a long-term cash stream for the company.

Intuitive Surgical's razor-and-blades operating model is its other big selling point. Although its surgical systems are costly they're intricate to build and therefore produce only mediocre operating margins. As the installed base of da Vinci's systems has grown the percentage of sales from instruments sold with each procedure as well as system servicing has grown. These segments generate considerably higher operating margins and are what can propel Intuitive Surgical's valuation much higher over the next quarter century.

Berkshire Hathaway

For more than 50 years few investments have been more ""surefire"" than riding the coattails of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Since becoming CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.41%) (BRK.B 0.30%) in 1965 the Oracle of Omaha has led his Class A shares (BRK.A) to an annualized return of 20.1% through Dec. 31 2021. On an aggregate basis we're talking about a return of 3641613%.

One of the biggest reasons for Berkshire Hathaway's overwhelming success is Buffett's affinity for loading his company's investment portfolio with cyclical businesses. Buffett is well aware that it's impossible to predict when a recession might occur. But he does realize that periods of economic expansion last substantially longer than recessions. By investing in sectors he knows well and buying stakes in businesses that'll benefit from long-winded expansions he's set his company up to thrive off of the natural growth of the U.S. and global economy.

Berkshire Hathaway's historic outperformance also looks to be a function of its mountain of passive income. Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is on pace to collect north of $6 billion in dividend income. Dividend stocks have a lengthy track record of outperforming their non-dividend-paying peers; and Buffett tends to hold these dividend-paying stocks for years or decades at a time.

Mastercard

A third surefire stock with the capacity to generate life-changing wealth over the next quarter century is payment processor Mastercard (MA 0.82%) which I'll add is a Berkshire Hathaway holding.

Mastercard is the perfect example of how long-term investors can play a simple numbers game and come out as winners. Though recessions usually result in lower spending by consumers and businesses economic contractions typically don't last long. Mastercard benefits from disproportionately long periods of economic expansion and the higher spending that accompanies them.

It's equally important to note that Mastercard strictly acts as a payment processor and not a lender. Despite having the opportunity to collect interest income and fees becoming a lender would expose it to loan delinquencies and charge-offs during periods of economic weakness. Not having to set aside capital is the big reason Mastercard bounces back from recessions faster than most financial stocks.

As a final note most global payments are still being conducted in cash. This gives Mastercard a sustainably long runway to push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions and faster-growing emerging markets.

Etsy

Assuming it doesn't get acquired specialty e-commerce retailer Etsy (ETSY 0.50%) has all the tools and intangibles necessary to build life-changing wealth in the next 25 years.

Whereas most online retail platforms are built solely for volume and lack much in the way of personalization Etsy's retail platform is designed with engagement in mind. The company's merchant network is almost entirely small businesses that produce unique or customizable products. While considerably larger e-commerce players exist none is a direct competitor to what Etsy can offer from a personalized/customized standpoint.

The other impressive aspect has been Etsy's ability to transform casual shoppers into habitual buyers. A ""habitual buyer"" is a term used by the company to describe someone who makes at least six purchases totaling $200 in aggregate over the trailing-12-month period.

Between the end of 2019 (i.e. before the pandemic) and end of 2021 the number of habitual buyers on the platform grew by 224%. This increase is what's allowing Etsy to charge merchants higher fees for advertising and analytics and is a testament that investments in its platform designed to drive user engagement are working.

Alphabet

Lastly even though it's already one of the world's largest public companies by market cap Alphabet (GOOGL 1.87%) (GOOG 1.85%) is a surefire stock that can build generational wealth over 25 years. Alphabet is the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.

The company's foundational segment is Google which has pretty consistently grown its sales by a double-digit percentage for the past two decades. Based on trailing-12-month data provided by GlobalStats Google accounts for 91% to 93% of worldwide search engine market share. If businesses want to reach users they're well aware that paying a premium to advertise with Google is their smartest option.

But what's even more exciting for Alphabet is the growth of its ancillary segments. The aforementioned YouTube is the second most-visited social site on the planet. Meanwhile cloud infrastructure service provider Google Cloud ranks third in global cloud spending. Google Cloud has been growing sales by roughly 45% to 50% annually and cloud service spending is still arguably in its early innings.

Taking into account that cloud service operating margins can leave advertising margins in the dust Alphabet's operating cash flow could take-off by mid-decade."

You might be thinking “A roller coaster is a roller coaster right?” WRONG! Some are geared toward children while others are certainly not for the faint of heart. Disney World now officially has 8 (!!!) roller coasters thanks to the recent addition of Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. So how do they all stack up? Which ride would you bring your elderly grandmother on and which will leave you dizzy for days?

We’re ranking ALL of the Disney World roller coasters by intensity — so let’s get started!

Oh Barnstormer. A first roller coaster for many. This circus-themed coaster is modeled after a stunt plane and takes guests on a flight high above the circus. At only 1.5 minutes it’s an extremely short coaster ride and doesn’t offer much in terms of thrills — there are a few exciting twists and turns but nothing that will leave you seeing stars.

The height requirement for the Barnstormer is 35 inches so it’s perfect for kiddos who are looking to check out their first roller coaster. The seats are on the restrictive side and guests may struggle to find ample leg room.

Magic Kingdom’s newest roller coaster (until TRON opens...eventually) is Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. This attraction has a 38″ height requirement just slightly taller than the Barnstormer making this a family-friendly coaster as well. While onboard you’ll experience twists turns hills and drops but the cars are smooth — making this an enjoyable ride.

One interesting thing to note about Mine Train is that it features a first-of-its-kind ride system with vehicles that swing from side to side throughout your train journey. Little ones might find this one a little intense if they’re still new to the roller coaster game.

Climb aboard this larger-than-life Slinky Dog on a thrilling adventure designed by Andy himself. Although this is a family coaster Slinky Dog Dash feels fast. Combined with the exciting and unexpected stop followed by a launch through a tunnel this isn’t just any old “family-friendly” coaster.

This attraction is downright fun and leaves us wanting to ride again and again. Although it might not make you weak in the knees like some coasters can the twists and turns and ups and downs found throughout this ride are nothing to laugh at.

Alright folks now we’re really talkin’. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad just might be the first “intense” roller coaster on this list. There aren’t any major drops on this ride — though there are a few that’ll make you get a little air — and it can reach up to 30 miles per hour.

While that may not sound extremely fast when those speeds are combined with the quick turns of this attraction the centrifugal force can make you rock side to side in your train cart. It’s not uncommon for us to stand up from this ride feeling just a little bit disoriented.

This classic ride is considered a must-do for many Disney World guests. The towering white “mountain” looks threatening and what awaits inside are non-stop twists turns and drops through a dark sky lit up by only stars.

What makes Space Mountain intense is the combination of the 28 mile per hour top speeds and the near total darkness you’re in for most of the ride. With a 44 inch height requirement this one isn’t for the little kiddos and even older kids may find it too extreme.

Disney World’s newest attraction just so happens to be a roller coaster. And much like Space Mountain it’s also completely in the dark. This attraction is intense from the very beginning as you are reverse launched through a “jump point” into space. Loud music plays all around you as one of six hit songs takes you on a journey.

Your ride vehicle is an omnicoaster meaning that it can rotate and spin 360 degrees throughout the ride. You truly never know which direction you’re headed or which way is up or down. Despite this there are no intense drops (except for one at the beginning) and no inversions or loops. Many guests have reported experiencing motion sickness and have stated the dark can be disorienting.

Speaking of attractions with launches Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster features a high-speed launch of 0-60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds. Then you’re launched with a force of nearly 5 Gs into a different kind of highway in the sky in your stretch limousine among the darkness. Before you know it you’re met with three inversions two rollover loops and one corkscrew.

Oh and did we mention this is all while you’re being blasted with Aerosmith tunes from a 32000 watt audio system with 24 subwoofers? Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster is an intense attraction no matter how you slice it but it still doesn’t take the cake when it comes to Disney World coasters.

Expedition Everest takes passengers on a dangerous runaway train ride through the Himalayan Mountains — and it really feels like it too! Aboard the train ominous murals on the wall warn guests to turn back. Once you reach the top of the mountain the train screeches to a halt in front of broken tracks and the train shoots backwards down the mountain.

The yeti greets you (but not in the friendly way) as you’re plummeted down an 80-foot drop that twists down the mountain. The combination of high speeds at 50 miles per hour sudden drops turns and backwards movement make Expedition Everest the most intense roller coaster in Disney World.

That’s our definitive ranking of Disney World coasters by intensity!

Want to experience all of these attractions without spending all day in line? Disney Genie+ is the paid way to skip the standby lines at many Disney World attractions via the My Disney Experience app. Guests can purchase the service and schedule return times to skip the line using Lightning Lanes.

If you’re heading to Disney World soon keep in mind that guests are still required to have valid theme park reservations in addition to valid park admission. You can read more about the Park Pass Reservation System here!

How we plan to use our Arcadia Fifth Wheel

That's us backing our new Arcadia Fifth Wheel onto our property in Tennessee

We've camped in motorhomes – Class B B+ and C models – for the past 10 years.

And indeed we still have our Leisure Travel Vans Wonder RTB.

We love the easy mobility that motorhomes offer particularly when traveling from place to place to place. We expect to get a new motorhome this fall too so having a motorhome for trips that have us going place to place (like when working RV shows doing personal appearances chasing stories in multiple locations) will continue to be a big part of our RV Lifestyle going forward.

But ever since we bought 5 acres of property in Tennessee last fall we've been excited about camping there for longer stays. That's where the Arcadia Fifth Wheel comes in. As soon as all our utilities are in we plan to bring it down and use it there as a base camp staying longer than we usually do in the motorhome.

We're also looking for some similar property we can buy in Michigan and see us using the Arcadia up there too. In the winter we could bring it for extended stays in Florida or Arizona too.

The favorite features of our Arcadia Fifth Wheel

Jennifer setting the dining table inside our Arcadia Fifth Wheel

The Arcadia Fifth Wheel offers so much room and storage.

It's like a cabin on wheels. The big panoramic windows truly bring the outside in.

It is really comfortable with an L-shaped sofa a long kitchen table that doubles as a workspace for us a fireplace a big bathroom and shower and a super comfy memory foam Queen sized bed.

The solar panels and bank of three 100-watt lithium batteries from Dragonfly (the parent company of Battleborn batteries) allow us to comfortably boondock and run everything except the AC units.

We're thinking about adding more batteries and solar in the future (we have room for 1200 watts of solar) so we can run the AC a bit off the grid but for now as we've been getting used to the whole fifth wheel experience we're good.

Photos from our Arcadia Fifth Wheel

The walk-through tour video will give you a pretty comprehensive look at our new Arcadia and the features we like the most.

But to round out this post here are a few still photos of us using it. So far we've traveled about 2800 miles in it pulling it with a 2021 Ford F-250 Lariat Diesel 4×4. I'm getting about 12.5 miles per gallon.

I use a Curt A20 Fifth Wheel Hitch. Even though our Arcadia Fifth Wheel is about 12000 pounds fully loaded the hitch has a capacity of 20K pounds and will allow us to tow something even bigger if we want to someday.

This is the day we first saw our new Arcadia

We've sure been using our new Arcadia Fifth Wheel so far this summer

Our Arcadia Fifth wheel has two slides. One is a bedroom wardrobe. The other is an entire wall in the main living area.

Our Arcadia Fifth Wheel and our the 2021 Frd F-250 4×4 diesel Lariat was use to tow it.

US supermajor ExxonMobil has agreed to provide $600 million insurance money in the event of an oil spill at any of its offshore operations in the Caribbean Community nation officials said Friday.

The company had been feuding with Guyanese authorities and rights groups in recent months over the amount it should set aside in the event of an oil spill at its lucrative Stabroek Block where more than 25 successful wells have been drilled since its first discovery in mid-2015. Exxon is operating through its local subsidiary Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL).

Company spokesperson Janelle Persaud Friday said that an announcement this week by government that Exxon has agreed to set aside $600 million “per event” is accurate. “That is what we are talking about. It is embedded in the permits” she said.

Rights groups and opposition parties have been pressuring government to ensure there is a fund to clean up and manage oil spills. Government had demanded a $2 billion dollar figure but the two sides say they have now agreed that a $600 million “per event” figure could suffice in the event of an environmental disaster even as negotiations continue regarding a $2 billion oil spill guarantee from the Texas-based parent company.

The main opposition APNU-AFC coalition has already submitted a motion to parliament to debate full coverage insurance for Exxon. Parliament is yet to debate it.

Actual production from the block began in December 2019 making the former British colony one of the world’s newest producers. The 2015 oil shout has ensured that most of the world’s leading companies including Repsol of Spain Tullow Oil of the United Kingdom have moved to drill exploratory wells near the Stabroek Block.

Oil has also been found in two neighboring blocks Canje and the Corentyne Block where upstart Canadian junior explorer CGX Energy recorded well successes earlier this year.

So far Exxon says its bloc contains more than 10 billion barrels of oil so far. The US Geological Service has long estimated that the Guyana-Suriname basin contains at least 16 billion barrels of oil offshore.

Neighboring Suriname one of CARICOM’s most resource-rich companies has also cashed in on the lucrative basin where several joint venture companies have found a number of gushing wells just across the marine border with Guyana.

Most Americans facing record gas prices cringe when they fill up their tanks.

But not people in New Jersey and Oregon. They’re not allowed to touch the gas nozzle. Seriously.

In New Jersey it’s been illegal for drivers to pump their own gas since 1949. A ban on self-service gas has been in place in Oregon since 1951 although the state relaxed restrictions for rural towns a few years ago. Violators can be fined up to $500 for breaking these states’ laws.

So why don’t New Jersey and Oregon let you pump your own gas? And what happened to the days of gas station attendants filling up your tanks in the rest of the country?

It’s a strange complex history that dates back more than a century.

Self-service bans

The United States has experimented with self-service gas since the first stations were built in the early 1900s. Yet it wasn’t until about 1980 that self-service became the primary gas station model in this country.

“Their rise to the top was not a smooth one” write Ronald Johnson and Charles Romeo in a 2000 study on the growth of self-service.

The earliest self-service gas pumps in the United States appeared around 1915. They were designed primarily for emergencies or for after dark when gas stations were closed. People would pre-pay with coins to operate them.

Full-service gas stations adamantly opposed self-service. They saw cheaper self-service gas as a competitive threat to their business and wanted to limit its spread.

Fuel sales have slim profit margins. Gas stations made their money and distinguished their brands by offering a variety of services such as oil and battery checks windshield wiping and vehicle repairs. Station attendants in full uniforms – some wearing bow ties – filled up customers’ tanks a key part of their larger service strategy to attract drivers in the first half of the 20th century.

Full-service gas stations played up safety hazards around self-service arguing that untrained drivers would overfill their tanks and start a fire. With support from local fire marshals gas stations lobbied state legislators to pass bans on self-service. By 1968 self-service was banned in 23 states.

It was not until the success of self-service internationally and a crucial change in gas stations’ business model that self-service began replacing attendants in the United States.

“Modern self-service gas stations actually were pioneered in Sweden” said Matt Anderson the curator of transportation at The Henry Ford museum in Michigan. “Drivers there paid less for self-service than for full-service. From there the concept spread through Europe.”

Self-service gas stations like this early one in 1948 became popular as stations lost their hold on the auto service and repair market. AP

At the same time vehicle warranties began to stipulate that cars must be serviced at dealerships a shift that eroded gas stations’ service and repair business.

“Traditional full-service gas stations lost their profit center in automotive repairs and were forced to change their method of operation” said Wayne Henderson the author of the book “One Hundred Years of Gas Stations.”

Gas stations had to look for new ways to grow profit. They moved to self-service which reduced their costs and increased volumes on gas sales and they diversified into selling food tobacco coffee snacks and other items with higher margins.

Self-service “ended up being more popular because it could create large volumes and opportunities for other profit” said Gary Scales a doctoral candidate at Temple University writing a dissertation on the history of gas stations.

Gas station operators began pushing states to repeal their self-service bans. By 1992 around 80% of all gas stations nationwide were self-service up from just 8% two decades prior.

‘Political third rail’

Despite frequent legislative attempts court challenges and opposition from the gas station industry New Jersey and much of Oregon still don’t permit self-service.

Oregon’s law says it’s in the public interest to maintain the ban. Allowing self-service would increase fire hazards create challenges for elderly citizens and drivers with disabilities and lead to gas station attendant job losses according to the statute.

In 1982 Oregon voters defeated a ballot measure to overturn the ban but more recent polling shows attitudes in the state are split. A 2014 poll found that Oregon residents were almost evenly divided on the subject with 44% backing a move to self-service and 46% in favor of keeping the ban.

Oregon relaxed its ban in 2018 allowing self-service for drivers in rural counties with populations under 40000.

In New Jersey the self-service ban along with the state’s reputation for low gas prices is part of its culture. “Jersey Girls Don’t Pump Gas” proclaims a popular bumper sticker.

Attempting to overturn the ban has been seen as a loser politically.

“On self-service gas that’s been sort of a political third rail in New Jersey” Gov. Phil Murphy said in April.

But record gas prices and gas stations’ struggles to find workers have led to renewed attempts by New Jersey gas station industry advocates to lift the ban. In May 75 gas stations in the state lowered prices in an effort to gain support for allowing self-service gas.

It’s unlikely that the state will allow drivers to pump their own gas anytime soon however. The president of the state’s Senate opposes a bill that would end New Jersey’s ban.

The state’s residents have little interest in self-service. A March poll found that 73% of them say they prefer having their gas pumped for them.

“There is apparently one thing all New Jerseyans can agree on nowadays” Ashley Koning the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University-New Brunswick said when the poll was released. “And that’s the time-honored Jersey tradition of having your gas pumped for you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvaXJhcXMtYmFzcmEtb2lsLXRha2UtYmlnZ2VzdC1zaGFyZS1leHhvbi1zdGFrZS13ZXN0LXF1cm5hLTEtb2lsZmllbGQtMjAyMi0wNi0xOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iraq's Basra Oil to take biggest share in Exxon stake in West Qurna 1 oilfield,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/iraqs-basra-oil-take-biggest-share-exxon-stake-west-qurna-1-oilfield-2022-06-19/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvaXJhcXMtYmFzcmEtb2lsLXRha2UtYmlnZ2VzdC1zaGFyZS1leHhvbi1zdGFrZS13ZXN0LXF1cm5hLTEtb2lsZmllbGQtMjAyMi0wNi0xOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3JlZ3VsYXItZ2FzLXByaWNlLXNsaXBzLWJlbG93LW1pbGVzdG9uZS1kaWVzZWwtcmlzZXPSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9yZWd1bGFyLWdhcy1wcmljZS1zbGlwcy1iZWxvdy1taWxlc3RvbmUtZGllc2VsLXJpc2VzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Price of gasoline spends weekend moving lower,"The average price for a gallon of gasoline slipped again on Sunday remaining below the $5 threshold for a second day.

Atlanta - Mercedes-Benz Stadium

Boston - Gillette Stadium (Foxboro Ma.)

Dallas - AT&T Stadium

Guadalajara - Estadio Akron

Houston - NRG Stadium

Kansas City - Arrowhead Stadium

New York City - MetLife Stadium (East Rutherford N.J.)

Philadelphia - Lincoln Financial Field

San Francisco - Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara Ca.)

Seattle - Lumen Field

Toronto - BMO Field

Vancouver - BC Place

But the biggest snub was possibly D.C. which was named a site the last time the United States hosted the event back in 1994.

According to the Washington Post this is the fault of the Washington Commanders.

""There is one entity that is responsible: the Washington Commanders"" Washington Post soccer writer Steven Goff told 106.7 The Fan.

Back in 1994 the World Cup was played at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium but it is no longer used and is expected to be demolished soon.

That leaves the possibility of FedEx Field being used but with the stadium in poor condition and outside the D.C. area it was passed up for other options like Kansas City Seattle and Philadelphia all of whom were not host cities back in 1994.

The four biggest home delivery fleets in the US -- Amazon UPS FedEx and DHL -- know what the North American Council on Freight Efficiency predicts: An electric last mile van uses about $2000 of energy a year compared to $10000 a year in fuel calculated at $2.98 a gallon. That wasn't enough to save ELMS from its financial ambiguities alleged stock shenanigans and executive departures.

ELMS

The company offered a Class 1 urban delivery van with 110 miles of range at a base price of $28000 and a larger Class 3 chassis that would normally be fitted with a cargo box offering 125 miles of range. Those range numbers would underwhelm any electric car buyer but are actually evidence of why electric delivery vans make sense: They can nail a major work role with easily attained range dovetailing with many other traits of electrification beyond that.

Rewarding grunt

Delivery trucks need ample torque and put it to better use than reaching 60 mph in 2 seconds. Electric motors deliver almost all of their prodigious torque from 1 rpm while gas and even relatively torquey diesel engines have to be coaxed and revved into delivering peak torque.

UPS tapped electric delivery van maker Arrival to start building its fleet of electric last mile trucks at local ""microfactories"" in the US UK and Europe. UPS

Good at going slow

There are few things less efficient than combustion engines which use most of their fuel to generate waste heat rather than move the vehicle they're installed in and slow stop-and-go driving is combustion inefficiency at its worst. But electric powertrains are hardly phased by that driving pattern and remain efficient poking around town. To paraphrase Eric Schmidt the fact that delivery vehicles have been powered by combustion engines is a bug in the course of automotive history.

Routes kill anxiety

There's not much cause for range anxiety if you know exactly where you're going down to the distance number of turns stops traffic conditions and terrain; That kind of knowledge makes it clear if you'll have enough charge and is the kind of planning and analysis that's been part of local trucking for a long time. It's the opposite of the unpredictable driving we do (and imagine we'll do) with our personal cars. And while the charge analysis display on the dash of electric personal cars is just data art to most owners it's highly significant to fleet operators. Electric delivery vans will make it home on a charge or not be sent out in the first place.

Frequent use is key

The high marginal cost of electrification or autonomy are best amortized by using the product as much as possible. Delivery vans work 8 to 12 hours a day rather than sitting parked 95% of their lives their advanced features seldom used. Electric work trucks should return their investment faster than a Tesla Model S Plaid gets out of its own way.

ELMS

Low floors rate high

Remember the last time you moved and how fatiguing it was loading things in and out of that truck? A low flat load floor is a big deal on delivery trucks served well by the flat low-mounted batteries used by most electric vehicles. Dispensing with an engine and its drivetrain also eliminates the ""doghouse"" that often occupies the middle of the cab and can demand a design with an additional step up. Even one step saved getting in and out of the cab when a driver makes a stop can create a more pleasant less fatiguing day and a little more appealing job.

Even when gas was $2.98 a gallon the energy cost difference between electric and gas-engined last mile trucks was stark. NACFE

Delivery fleets get it

Amazon recently announced it would buy up to 100000 electric vans from Rivian though the company will also source them from Ram after Jeff Bezos ribbed Rivian about delivering the vehicles. FedEx will only buy electric delivery vehicles by 2030. UPS has placed an order for 10000 electric delivery vans deploying across the US UK and Europe through 2024. And you might not have even known that a fifth of DHL's delivery van fleet is electric because it uses familiar-looking Ford Transits that are converted by Lightning eMotors.

It's not clear how much Americans will drive as we emerge from the pandemic but local delivery miles have a long way to grow. Doing that work with clean quiet economical last mile vehicles seems like the most obvious priority in the immediate future of electric vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZtb250aGx5LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy90aGUtZ2FtZS93aG8taXMta2VlZ2FuLWJyYWRsZXlzLWNhZGRpZS0yMzMzMDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Is Keegan Bradley's Caddie? Get To Know Scott Vail,"Who Is Keegan Bradley's Caddie?

Keegan Bradley has racked up four wins on the PGA Tour including a major triumph at the 2011 PGA Championship in what has been an impressive career to this point. However the American suffered a dip in form over the last few years falling as low as 150 in the world rankings. Of late though he has been climbing back up the world rankings coming very close a few times at getting back into the PGA Tour winner's circle. But who caddies for the American? Find out below.

Who Is Keegan Bradley's Caddie?

The man currently on the bag of Bradley is experienced looper Scott Vail. The Canadian is the son of former ice hockey player Eric Vail who made 591 appearances in the NHL which included stints for the Atlanta and Calgary Flames as well as the Detroit Red Wings.

However Scott was drawn to golf and worked at the Oshawa Golf Club in Canada growing up where he met Derek Gillespie with whom his caddying career would begin on the Canadian and Nationwide (now the Korn Ferry) Tours. At the back end of 2005 Vail linked up with Brandt Snedeker and the pair went on to enjoy a lengthy spell together that included eight wins an epic FedEx Cup triumph in 2012 and two Ryder Cup appearances.

Scott Vail and Brandt Snedeker celebrating their 2012 FedEx Cup win

But after 12 years the pair decided to go their separate ways with Snedeker sharing his thoughts on his ex-bagman. Snedeker said: ""Scott is a great friend great caddie and more importantly a great man. We both reached a point where we felt it was time to go our separate ways and pursue other opportunities. I wish Scott the best and know whoever is lucky enough to land him will get one of the best caddies in the world.""

High praise indeed from the former FedEx Cup champ. But Vail's next hook-up was a fleeting one. After just six events on the bag of Henrik Stenson the Canadian was back on the market with both Stenson and Vail agreeing they weren't the best fit.

However it appears with Bradley Vail has found an ideal match with the 2011 PGA Champion expressing at times how Vail has helped him rediscover his form. Such has been his success on tour that the caddie has found his own level of fame in his home country admitting he doesn't quite know how to handle it.

Hartford earned a penalty in the 31st minute after Efraín Morales brought down Andre Lewis in the box. Corey Hertzog took his penalty shot down the middle and ATL UTD 2 goalkeeper Justin Garces dove to his right saving the shot with his left foot.

The visitors opened the scoring in the 42nd minute through Luka Prpa. A loose ball bounced around the Atlanta penalty area before falling to Logan Gdula which the defender volleyed toward net. Gdula’s effort hit off captain Tom Brewitt and into the feet of Prpa who took a touch before finding the back of the net with his left foot.

Joel Johnson doubled Hartford’s advantage in the 75th minute. Prince Saydee moved with the ball down the left wing and laid off a pass for Lewis who found Rashawn Dally on the right side of the Atlanta box. Dally played a one-touch pass for Johnson who put his left boot through a shot that Garces got a palm to but was unable to keep out of the net.

The third and final goal for Hartford came in the 80th minute. Rashawn Dally powered a shot toward Garces and the Atlanta goalkeeper made a reaction save; however Brewitt swept up the rebound and touched the opportunity into the goal.

ATL UTD 2 (3-11-1 10 points) returns to action Saturday June 25 in Oakland California at Laney College Football Stadium against Oakland Roots (10:30 p.m. ESPN+).

The holiday celebrates when the news about the Emancipation Proclamation reached those that were enslaved in Texas in 1865.

Though Juneteenth is celebrated every June 19 it's being federally observed on Monday June 20 which is leading to some businesses and services normally open to be closed.

Here is what's open and what's closed on Monday June 20 to observe Juneteenth:

Mail services

All U.S. Postal Service offices will be closed on June 20 and there will be no mail delivery.

UPS is also observing Juneteenth and there will be no pickup or delivery services. You may want to check with your local UPS stores for possibly modified hours as well.

FedEx is not observing Juneteenth.

Banks

All federal banks will be closed on June 20.

Not all banks are required to observe federal holidays so be sure to check with your local bank specifically. Nonetheless Chase Bank Fifth Third Bank and U.S. Bank have all confirmed they will be closed.

Trash services

The City of Cincinnati trash pick-up will be delayed one day if your usual trash pick-up is on Monday. Rumpke will continue to pick-up trash as normal.

Grocery stores

Most major grocery store chains — including Kroger Walmart Meijer and more — will remain open under their normal hours.

Some small family-owned grocery stores and shops may be shut so always make sure to check your local stores hours before leaving your home.

Local governmental offices

The City of Cincinnati offices and services are closed Monday. Similarly all Hamilton County offices will be closed.

Covington administrative offices will be closed as well.

Federal buildings

All non-essential federal government buildings and offices will be closed Monday.

The “Daily Project” team led by Duan Baoyan of Xidian University in Shaanxi province released a statement on June 14 that said the group has set a target of 2028 to have a solar power plant in space. The project is part of OMEGA or Orb-Shape Membrane Energy Gathering Array a space-based proposal for solar power that was first announced in 2014. The research team at that time had set a 2030 goal for deployment of the system.

The research team in a news release said it recently conducted tests in front of several outside energy experts and academics who verified the successful test on June 5.

The statement released Tuesday from the team said “The world’s first full-link and full-system space solar power plant ground verification system successfully passed experts Group acceptance.” The group said “This verification system has broken through and verified a number of key technologies such as high-efficiency light concentrating and photoelectric conversion microwave conversion microwave emission and waveform optimization microwave beam pointing measurement and control microwave reception and rectification and smart mechanical structure design.”

Ongoing Research

“The research on space solar power plants is currently a hot spot in the world” said Baoyan in a statement. The Xidian group noted previous and ongoing efforts in other countries around space-based solar power including NASA’s SPS-ALPHA or Solar Power Satellite via Arbitrarily Large Phased Array project. The U.S. space agency in announcing that project a decade ago said SPS-ALPHA is a “bio-mimetic approach to the challenge of space solar power” that if successful “will make possible the construction of huge platforms from tens of thousands of small elements that can deliver remotely and affordably 10s to 1000s of megawatts using wireless power transmission to markets on Earth and missions in space.”

To learn more about space-based solar power read “Space-Based Solar Power May Be Closer Than You Think” in the December 2021 issue of POWER.

Testing at Xidian has been done utilizing a 75-meter-high steel structure (Figure 1) built on the southern campus of the university. The structure includes five subsystems that monitor the solar power arrays according to Gizmodo a design technology and science website.

Officials at Xidian said the goal of the OMEGA project is to be set up in geostationary orbit with the ability to store energy from the sun which would then be converted to electrical energy that would be transmitted to Earth.

The model power station at Xidian works by capturing sunlight and converting it to microwave beams. It then transmits through the air to a ground-based receiver station where it can be converted back to electricity. Though the model station is sending the beams only a distance of 55 meters researchers think the technology can be expanded to send power from orbiting solar panels to Earth.

Solar power from space in part is designed to eliminate a limiting factor of the technology as putting panels in space enables a solar array to evade cloudy conditions and the shadow of the Earth. Along with researchers in China and the U.S. other countries—including Japan the UK Russia India and France—are studying space-based solar arrays. The researchers at Xidian acknowledged that individual components of space-based solar power systems have been previously tested but said their group is the first to successfully test a full-system model.

Japan’s Efforts

“At present in the development roadmap of many technologically powerful countries Japan has come from behind and has become one of the most cutting-edge researchers in the world” the Xidian group said. “They were the first in the world to formally include space solar power plants in the national space program and they also proposed a unique concept of distributed tethered solar power plants and formulated a three-stage long-term development roadmap of ‘research-development-commercial.’ In 2015 Japanese researchers carried out a microwave wireless energy transfer experiment with a distance of 55 meters and verified the transmission based on the 5.8 GHz frequency solid-state source and phased array system with a transmission efficiency of 9.88% … in terms of microwave wireless energy transmission technology temporarily leading the world.

“However Japan’s test system is still not a full link and lacks the process from light to electricity” the group said. Baoyan said Japan’s “technical advantages are concentrated in the link from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. While [with] Xidian the ground verification system built is a full-link system-wide system which realizes the complete process from tracking the sun concentrating light photoelectric conversion microwave transmission to microwave reception and rectification.”

Are YOU Ready to Go Electric or Maybe Solar?,"Some of us are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around the idea that there could be 35 million Electric Vehicles (EV’s) on the roads by 2030 but have you heard that the next way to power cars will be through solar energy?

Before exploring the future of solar powered vehicles here’s a quick recap of the progress of electric charging stations in Fort Wayne. Fort Wayne's Public Works Division has installed eight EV charging stations at several locations throughout the community and will be installing another twenty or more this year. You can find their locations here.

""The momentum at which electric vehicles are moving forward has been pretty impressive"" said City of Fort Wayne Public Works Director Shan Gunawardena. ""The automobile industry is planning on having an electric option in pretty much every standard model that is going to be available probably within the next five years. Having infrastructure was a big first step we needed to make. We just wanted to make sure we were not left behind because we’ve done a lot of things here in Fort Wayne to attract economic development. We didn’t want a lack of electric vehicle infrastructure to be a reason why people didn’t want to come to Fort Wayne.”

Charging EV’s does take much longer than filling up your gas tank and at this point at-home chargers aren’t cheap so you’ll be happy to hear that in the future you may be able to charge your EV while you’re driving. There are several projects underway to provide power within the road or on a strip running along the road. These “pads” will transmit electricity wirelessly to receivers that are mounted under your vehicle. The Indiana Department of Transportation and Purdue University are working on this concept.

Now that you’re starting to imagine the possibility of owning a much quieter EV that will be better for our planet because it doesn’t rely on fossil fuels to operate try to imagine a vehicle that runs on a free natural and renewable energy.

Solar powered electric cars may be available for purchase as soon as this year! The concept is very similar to the way a house is powered by solar panels—by converting sunlight into electricity. There’s a great article that lists the many pros and cons of solar cars. And if you want to take a look at some of the existing solar vehicles take a look at this video.

“Another important consideration is the emergence of solar powered charging stations” said Director Gunawardena. “We’re looking into the concept of charging stations on solar powered buildings as we remodel the Avenue of Autos three buildings we recently purchase in order to relocate a number of City of Fort Wayne functions for maximum efficiency.” Here’s an article for more information on that concept.

Turning to electric vehicles or solar cars in the future will do much to help protect our planet. But until we have more access and even after we have more access to these improved vehicle powering options the best way to protect the environment when traveling from point A to point B is to opt for an active form of transportation like riding a bike or walking—whenever that choice makes sense. Luckily our Fort Wayne Area Trails Network consists of nearly 129 miles of trails with 97.4 miles inside City limits.

We encourage you to enjoy our trails and we’ll do everything possible to keep growing them along with the necessary infrastructure to keep your vehicle moving.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3dhdGNoLmNvbS9zb2xhci9zb2xhci1wcGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Understanding Solar PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements in 2024 ),"A PPA is a popular financing option for solar energy because it allows the homeowner to use solar energy without paying the hefty up-front cost of going solar. But don’t be fooled by a “free solar panel” gimmick — solar PPAs aren’t free and they have their disadvantages. In this article we’ll dive into the pros and cons of solar PPAs. But first let’s review some logistics.

Instead of leasing solar equipment in your name you allow for either a third-party solar developer or in some cases solar companies to place their equipment on your roof at no cost to you. In exchange the solar developer (who owns the equipment) receives the tax breaks and a new energy client (that’s you). As the owner of the roof that the equipment gets placed on you can expect to receive reduced energy costs often time at a fixed-rate and lower than market price in your area. Making this a desirable deal for both the solar energy supplier and you.

While loans and leases are pretty common with big purchases like cars you may not know much about a third common solar financing option — power purchase agreements or PPAs. A solar PPA is one way to lease solar panels.

In contrast other installers can only offer similar financing through solar leases PPAs or third-party providers (such as Mosaic or Sunlight). Third-party loan providers can complicate the process while opting for a loan or PPA will disqualify you from some of solar’s biggest benefits (additional property value federal solar tax credit and local solar incentives).

Eligible homeowners enjoy 18 months of solar power before having to pay their first bill. When coupled with the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC) the initial energy savings can offset more than a third of the overall cost of a system before requiring a dollar down.

For that reason Blue Raven Solar developed an innovative solar financing plan that offers in-house flexible zero-money-down options. The results speak for themselves as Blue Raven Solar is now one of the fastest-growing solar companies in the nation and was recently acquired by SunPower. Its BluePower Plus+ plan (exclusive to Blue Raven) mimics the flexible structure of a lease while still providing the greatest benefits of owning your system.

We like Blue Raven Solar because it understands that for most homeowners the cost of solar presents the biggest barrier to entry.

SunPower’s biggest downside? Its high-efficiency panels are considerably more expensive than most of its competitors’ products. However its powerful panels are workhorses that make up for the initial cost with more backend production (think about this like spending more money for a car that gets more miles per gallon).

If that weren’t enough SunPower systems come packaged with products all manufactured in-house by its sister company Maxeon. This means that your panels solar cells inverters battery and EV chargers are designed to work together and are all covered under the same warranty.

SunPower earns its position as the top national installer on our list for a handful of reasons: It installs the most efficient solar technology on the residential market offers the most expansive service area and backs its installations with a warranty well above the industry standard. All the while SunPower pioneers sustainability efforts within the industry.

SunPower designs and installs industry-leading residential solar and storage solutions across all 50 states. With a storied history of innovation dating back to 1985 no other company on this list can match SunPower’s experience and expertise.

How Do Solar PPAs Work?

When a homeowner signs a solar power purchase agreement they’re signing a contract with a solar company or a third-party owner who will take care of all the steps involved in putting the solar photovoltaic (PV) system on the home. That includes design installation and necessary permitting.

In return the homeowner — also called the host customer — pays the solar panel owner for the energy produced by the solar panel system installed on their house. The energy is typically sold at a fixed rate that’s lower than the local utility’s electricity rate.

Below is a diagram showing how it works between the utility the homeowner/host and the PV system owner/developer.

If your solar panels produce more energy than your home needs at any given time the extra kilowatt-hours (kWhs) will be sent to the utility grid if net metering is available. You’ll receive energy credits for those kilowatt-hours that can offset (or potentially eliminate) any electricity charges you have (for example for electricity from the utility used at night when your solar panels aren’t producing energy).

Even if you eliminate your monthly utility bill by going solar remember you’ll still have a separate monthly electricity bill from the owner of the solar energy system. You’ll send a monthly payment off to the solar panel owner for each kilowatt-hour of solar energy you used. If your home uses more energy than your solar panels produce then you’ll have two bills — one from your utility company and the other from the owner of your PPA.

A solar PPA term typically ranges from five to 25 years. At the end of the term you’ll have the option to renew the agreement have the solar system removed or purchase your solar panel system from the owner at fair market value.1

How Much Can You Save With a Solar PPA?

The amount you can save with a solar PPA varies depending on a few factors:

Electricity costs in your area

Solar energy costs set out in your PPA

Your average household energy usage

However you’re going to see the lowest amount of lifetime savings with solar leasing compared to buying your solar panels with cash or with a solar loan.

Understanding How Much You Can Save Each Month with a Solar PPA:

Say you’re a homeowner in Vermont considering solar panel costs where electricity is roughly $0.20 cents per kWh. You enter into a PPA contract with a solar company that charges $0.15 per kWh of solar electricity used. To keep numbers simple let’s say you used 1000 kWh of electricity and your solar panel system produced 1000 kWh of electricity in one month.

In this perfect scenario the amount of electricity you created and consumed would cancel out which means you’ve eliminated the $200 energy bill you would have owed your utility if you didn’t produce your own electricity. While that sounds nice don’t forget you still owe the solar company $150 for the 1000 kWh of solar energy you used from the solar panels.

In this example you would end up saving $50 per month with a solar PPA or $600 per year. That’s not bad and it’s certainly a bigger savings than not going solar. But if you owned your solar panels you likely would have saved a lot more.

Solar PPA vs. Solar Lease: What’s the Difference?

While a solar PPA is a type of solar lease there’s a difference between the two. With a standard solar lease you make fixed monthly payments for access to the solar equipment — you can think of it as monthly rent for your solar panel system. Since you would be renting the equipment you would technically own the energy it produces. On the other hand with a PPA you’re not paying for the equipment but rather for the solar energy produced by the panels.

In many ways solar leasing presents a competitive option compared with a PPA. The amount customers pay for a solar lease is determined based on the capacity of the panels while solar PPAs are paid based on the actual generation and usage. The difference means that those with solar leases will have a more fixed price that won’t fluctuate with your energy usage.

That’s good news during high-energy months like summer when your AC is cranked on high. But you could pay more with a standard solar lease during months of low energy usage.

Solar leases and PPAs are not offered by all solar companies but are common through national solar companies like Sunrun.

What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Financing with a Solar PPA?

Although a great option for sustainability and energy savings the decision to go solar comes with many pros and cons as does each solar financing option. If you’re considering signing a solar PPA here are a few advantages and disadvantages to keep in mind:

Pros of a Solar PPA Cons of a Solar PPA No up-front costs Won’t save as much on electricity costs Still eligible to take advantage of net metering Homeowner can’t take advantage of rebates tax benefits or other solar tax incentives of owning a clean energy system Limited risk and performance headaches because the solar developer is in charge of installation and maintenance Cost of leasing price typically increases each year of PPA contract Reduced energy costs as solar energy rates are lower than standard utility rates and will fluctuate less often Over the system’s lifetime you’ll likely end up paying an equivalent or higher amount than what you would have if you bought the solar panels outright Smaller household carbon footprint Leased solar panels don’t add value to your property like panels you own do because they are not a part of the property you own. Power production guarantees mean you won’t be paying if your system isn’t producing as advertised Breaking your PPA can be a hassle

Advantages of a Solar PPA

The majority of homeowners who sign a PPA do so because they’re interested in renewable energy production but don’t want to pay the high up-front cost. Installing a solar project with a PPA can seem like the best of both worlds.

A solar PPA allows you to feel good about having a clean energy system without having to shell out tens of thousands of dollars and deal with the installation and permitting process which can be quite the headache.

Additionally you get to enjoy lowered electricity bills and possibly even net-metering credits from your utility for the energy your panels produce. While you’ll still be paying a solar developer or third-party owner for the solar electricity your house uses you’ll have a better idea of energy costs because they’re outlined and locked into a contract. Solar rates won’t increase without warning like electricity rates can.

Disadvantages of a Solar PPA

While there are several pros the cons of solar PPA weigh a lot heavier in our opinion. Although you’re saving up front the cost benefits of going solar are significantly reduced when you don’t own your solar panel system.

You can lower your electricity bills with a solar PPA but when you own your system you have the opportunity to significantly reduce or even eliminate those costs. When you have a solar PPA you’re always going to be owing a company money for your energy consumption — whether it’s your utility your solar developer or both.

Sure solar energy rates are often less than that of standard electricity but most solar PPAs include a “price escalator.” That means the amount you pay for solar will increase each year which is an even bigger disadvantage considering the cost of solar PV systems has been decreasing year over year. 2

Lastly having a solar PPA agreement also makes you ineligible for several solar incentives like the federal investment tax credit (ITC) and solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) which could greatly lower the overall cost of your solar panel system.

Other Solar Financing Options

The average U.S. solar panel system costs roughly $29970 before applying any tax credits so it’s understandable that most homeowners cannot shell out that kind of cash up front. But that doesn’t mean solar leases or PPAs are your only option.

Most of the top solar companies provide plenty of options to finance a solar panel system that you can actually own or you can look into getting a loan from a government program or your bank.

Financing through a solar installer: Many installers partner with lenders to provide lower-interest solar financing to their customers.

Many installers partner with lenders to provide lower-interest solar financing to their customers. Getting a PACE loan: Also known as an R-PACE loan Residential Property-Assessed Clean Energy loans are long-term low-cost options to fund your solar purchase. This type of loan attaches the cost of the panels to your property tax bill through a special tax assessment.

Also known as an R-PACE loan Residential Property-Assessed Clean Energy loans are long-term low-cost options to fund your solar purchase. This type of loan attaches the cost of the panels to your property tax bill through a special tax assessment. Getting a standard bank loan: Solar loans can be secured through credit unions banks utilities or state programs. In certain cases you can choose an on-bill financing option in which the loan is repaid through your monthly electric bill with your utility provider. With this option part of your monthly utility savings can be put toward your loan payment.

Should You Get a Solar PPA?

Ultimately the way you decide to utilize solar energy is entirely up to you. We typically recommend that homeowners buy their solar panels outright to maximize all of the financial benefits of going solar. But we also recognize this isn’t a realistic option for everybody.

A solar lease or PPA is a good option for homeowners who aren’t in a good position to purchase their own system (whether financially or otherwise) are ineligible for solar tax credits or simply don’t want to deal with system maintenance.

One word of caution: Those advertisements for “free solar panels” are misleading. It’s unlikely that solar panels will ever be free but you can install solar panels on your home with a $0-down financing option through a solar PPA lease or solar loan.

Colorado’s Eastern Plains — from Yuma County cornfields to Prowers County feedlots and the wheat and sorghum fields in Kiowa County — are set to undergo their biggest transformation in more than a century as clean electricity is added to the crops they produce.

There is already a flurry of activity as wind and solar developers — more than a dozen have turned up in Yuma and Kiowa counties — are locking up acreage for prospective projects in leases with ranchers and farmers.

“We’ve had windmills around here for a long time. These are just bigger” said Jan Kochis 73 whose family runs a farm and cattle operation in Elbert County and already has wind turbines on her land generating royalties.

“It’s our new cash crop. We don’t have to worry about the rain or hail as long as the wind blows” Kochis said.

Not everyone is sanguine about what is coming. “Once these big companies come in we are going to lose control” said William Harman 54 who runs a family cattle business and farm in Washington County. “Once you sign a lease you lose control.”

The spur for all this activity is Xcel Energy’s recently approved $1.7 billion Power Pathway transmission project — which will belt eastern Colorado with 560 miles of high-tension transmission lines — an electric highway to Front Range cities and suburbs for new wind and solar installations.

Colorado’s climate goals leads to creation of the Power Pathway

Power Pathway is in turn the product of Colorado’s push embedded in state law to reduce its emissions of climate-altering greenhouse gasses. The goal for the state is a 50% reduction over 2005 levels by 2030 and a steeper 80% reduction for the utility industry.

The pair of 350-kilovolt transmission lines — looping from Fort Saint Vrain in the north down to rural Kiowa County and then over to Pueblo and up to Aurora — is the backbone of Xcel Energy’s plan to develop clean electricity generation and meet state mandates.

“Over the next 10 years the electric grid in Colorado is going to be transitioning from thermal fossil fuel plants to largely wind and solar” Colorado Public Utilities Commissioner John Gavan said at a recent session on climate change. “We are going to be slathering the Eastern Plains with wind and solar.”

For the communities on the plains Power Pathway will spark one of the biggest changes since 1909 when the Enlarged Homestead Act doubled the permitted homestead to 320 acres in an effort to promote nonirrigated or dryland farming.

“We live out here we own this land and all of sudden these companies are coming in saying we are going to do this and we are going to do that without us having much say particularly on transmission” said Monte Willeke 69 who farms wheat hay and millet for livestock in Washington County. “The money is all right. It is the longevity that bothers me and having to look at those transmission lines and wind mills forever.”

But Tom Jackson who raises corn outside the town of Joes in Yuma County said “maybe 60% of the people are OK with it either way everybody realizes it’s coming.”

For Xcel Energy the state’s largest electricity provider the project is all about chickens and eggs and fields of dreams.

Since 2007 Xcel Energy has retired 900 megawatts of coal-fired power plants — the main source of its greenhouse gases — with another 1410 MW slated to be closed by the end of 2030.

To help fill the gap and provide for growth Xcel Energy wants to add 2300 MW of solar generation 1600 MW of new wind farms and 400 MW of storage — much of it through independent wind and solar developers selling electricity to the utility.

There is a catch. Usually generation projects are built first and then transmission is added to link the plant to the grid but Xcel Energy is seeking to develop so many new projects and at such a quick tempo in an effort to capture expiring federal tax credits that without assured transmission it won’t get done.

At stake is as much as $850 million in tax credits provided projects are up and running by the end of 2025. Whatever part of the cost isn’t covered by the credits may have to be paid by Xcel Energy customers.

Building the Power Pathway even before there are any solar fields or wind farms is Xcel Energy executives said in PUC testimony a way to avoid the “chicken-and-egg dilemma.”

“For clean energy resources and emission reductions in Colorado the Pathway Project through the Eastern Plains is the ‘Field of Dreams’” Alice Jackson then-CEO of Xcel’s Colorado subsidiary said in testimony last year.

Build it and they will come — and coming they are. Engie North America a subsidiary of a French multinational corporation is looking to build a wind farm in Yuma County and Enel Green Power an Italian energy company is working on a wind project in Elbert County.

“It’s a big land rush. Everyone is jockeying to get into position” said R.J. Jolly a Cheyenne County commissioner and farmer who has signed a wind lease agreement with Enel. “There is a lot of money on the table.”

Some of the best natural wind resources in the country

To be sure the plains are no stranger to renewable generation. They are already home to 237 MW of solar installations and more than 2200 wind turbines in 38 wind farms across 11 counties with 4800 MW of generating capacity according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The Eastern Plains have some of the best natural wind resources in the county according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and in 2020 wind turbines produced 23% of Colorado’s electricity.

But while those facilities were built over the last 18 years Power Pathway and Xcel’s $8 billion Clean Energy Plan envisions adding almost as much capacity in the next five or six years.

“The Power Pathway Project is virtually unprecedented in scope and cost in Colorado history” the PUC said in its decision approving the project.

When the Rush Creek Wind Project the state’s largest wind farm was built in 2018 — across 95000 acres in Lincoln Kit Carson Cheyenne and Elbert counties — a legion of construction workers trucks and heavy machinery flooded the region.

“We are a small rural county all of a sudden you have a thousand workers show-up” Jolly said. “There is no place to stay the hotels are full the RV parks are full some guys are commuting 70 miles from Colorado Springs. It really takes a toll on your emergency services the police and fire.”

In Limon a rented bedroom went for $1700 a month and local residents in Burlington for a fee were taking in workers’ wash because the laundromat was closed on Sunday a NREL impact study reported.

“It can be chaotic and feel messy but when you are done you have a new level of economic activity would wouldn’t have had without the boom” said Greg Brophy a former state senator Yuma County farmer and state director for The Western Way which bills itself as “conservative stewards of the Western environment.”

From 2000 to 2024 even without Power Pathway renewable energy industries will have spent an estimated $9.4 billion in construction and investment activity on the Eastern Plains and in 2024 — based on existing and approved facilities — wind farms will provide $15.2 million in lease payments to landowners and pay $23.1 million in property taxes according to a Western Way analysis.

What’s this mean for the 13 counties along the route?

Now to a lesser or greater degree the Rush Creek story may be repeated across the 13 counties Power Pathway will affect and county governments ranchers and farmers are bracing for change.

To understand the potential impacts — for plains residents and Xcel Energy customers as well — a journey along the Power Pathway’s route is revealing.

The project will be built in five segments. The precise route still isn’t set as Xcel Energy tries to trace the Power Pathway of least resistance among landowners and local governments.

Xcel Energy estimates it will have to negotiate with as many as 700 landowners and pay $123 million for land rights and related activities.

“We are working with landowners talking with counties … trying to find the route that is least impactful to the community” Hollie Velasquez Horvath Xcel’s regional vice president for state affairs and community relations.

The company does have “backstop authority” to take a right-of-way by eminent domain a power it has never used.

“Using a backstop isn’t creating a good partnership and creating a relationship for the future” Velasquez Horvath said. “We are going to be there for the long haul.”

The first leg of the line — Segment 1 — will run 75 miles from the Fort St. Vrain substation an existing link to the electric grid to the Pawnee substation in Morgan County. The county is already seeing solar power development as Denver-based Pivot Energy is building five solar arrays.

Morgan County has a moratorium set to expire in July on any new wind or solar projects while it updates ordinances. “We saw that our regulations were behind the times” said Jon Becker a Morgan County commissioner. “We didn’t deal with battery storage and we felt that was going to come with any renewable energy project.”

“We have some small-scale solar but we are expecting larger projects” he said “800 to 3000 acres wouldn’t be a surprise.”

Pivot Energy agrees. “Eastern Plains counties have ideal topography to support large-scale solar development” Jon Fitzpatrick Pivot senior vice president for project development said in an email. “The use of this land for solar is also economically favorable.”

Solar is fine but Becker questions whether it will fill the bill. “It is a nice addition to the county but at the same time we have environmentalists running out the largest taxpayer in the county” he said. Xcel Energy’s plans call for closing part of the coal-fired Pawnee Generation Station and converting part to natural gas.

“Coal has been a great partner in this county” Becker said. “Solar and wind are nice but by no means do they pay the taxes or create the employment of a coal-fired power plant. Xcel says that operations may be similar but until we see it we are cautious.”

From the Pawnee substation Power Pathway swings east and south for 160 miles — in Segment 2 — through Washington Yuma Kit Carson and Cheyenne counties. Segment 2 is a key section for developing wind and solar projects and is slated to go into service in 2025.

In Washington County the line may run by the Harman Cattle Co. Harmans have lived on this land since 1904 and today five Harman families have farming and livestock operations on their 12000 acres.

“We are good farmers. We live off the land” Harman said. “People ought to pay attention to the land not royalties.”

The concern is that a forest of wind turbines — with their blinking red lights all night a warning for aircraft — will irrevocably alter a landscape of dappled prairie dotted with black cattle that sweeps to the horizon in every direction capped by a sky working the cool end of the color pallet in shades of baby blue to slate.

“Our open spaces do need to be preserved” Harman said. “The night sky is beautiful. That is something I’d miss.”

Harman’s wife Kim 53 tells the story of a night sky — thick with stars the Milky Way clear and vivid — that brought tears to the eyes of a Japanese 4-H exchange student.

In addition to the blinking lights and broken landscape there are concerns about noise from the turbine blades and “shadow flicker” that the turning blades can cast on nearby homes at certain times of the day.

Washington County imposed a moratorium on wind projects in 2020 while it worked on an ordinance which was adopted last fall. “We’ve the regulations in place to handle applications” Commissioner Kent Vance said. “We haven’t seen any projects yet … We’ve heard of leasing of land.”

Coal has been a great partner in this county. Solar and wind are nice but by no means do they pay the taxes or create the employment of a coal-fired power plant. — Jon Becker a Morgan County commissioner

Up the road from the Harmans Willeke is part of a group trying to organize farmers and other landowners to negotiate the Power Pathway right-of-way with Xcel Energy. This effort is based on a similar group negotiation three years ago when an oil pipeline project came through.

“The problem is they keep changing the route” Willeke said. He suspects the utility seeks the most compliant landowners.

“I am not against landowners putting a tower on their property or a transmission line I am more concerned about making sure the property owner is compensated” he said.

Race for credits

The haste to get everything done — the transmission lines the wind farms and solar arrays — is being fueled by the race to get the federal tax credits Willeke said. “The federal government created this.”

To get the credits — which are calculated based on the amount of electricity a wind farm or solar array generates — an installation has to be in operation by the end of 2025.

For 1000 MW of new wind resources the tax credit is worth $300 million and for 1000 MW of solar it comes to about $100 million according to an Xcel Energy PUC filing.

A horse grazes on in Morgan County on May 23. (Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun via Report for America)

Xcel Energy is proposing 3900 MW of new wind and solar in its electric resource and clean energy plans now pending before the PUC. That adds up to a potential $850 million in federal credits.

And while the PUC has approved the Power Pathway project it still hasn’t ruled on Xcel Energy’s plans for new generation or its clean energy plan which aims to cut carbon emissions by 87% by 2030.

In its approval of Power Pathway the commission established a sliding scale of penalties and bonuses for cost overruns or coming in under budget as well as completing or not completing sections on time.

If Xcel Energy doesn’t complete Segments 2 and 3 — both key to a wind and solar built-out — by the end of 2025 it could face a $10 million penalty. The commission however rejected a proposal from the state Utility Consumer Advocate for a budget cap on the entire project.

Oil and gas landmen now are scouting wind solar

Meanwhile Power Pathway moves forward and the land rush is on for projects.

Yuma County cheek and jowl with Nebraska has been Colorado’s top corn producer but it also has been far off the wind and solar development radar. Not anymore.

“There are close to a half dozen companies obtaining leases that we are aware of” Andrea Calhoon the county administrator said in an email. “We are anticipating a fair amount of conversation over the next couple of years in response to the Power Pathway project.”

For Greg Hill 49 the lease offer by Engie first came in a packet in the mail. Then there was a follow-up with a company representative Dan Timmer who used to be a landman acquiring mineral rights for oil and gas operators.

The Hill family came to the region in the late 1800s and they own 15 eastern Yuma County quarter sections in conservation easements pasture dryland farming and irrigated farming. (The invention of center-pivot irrigation in Strasburg in 1948 was the last big innovation on the plains though it impacts only a fraction of land in Colorado.)

Hill leased every acre he could for wind turbines. “If global warming is real and it is we need to address it” he said. “I am a little nervous about having a giant company come in and do this but I will be excited to see those turbines go up.”

There is more than altruism at work. Engie estimated that each turbine would generate up to $14700 in annual royalties during the first 20 years of operation according to Hill’s leasing documents.

Engie confirmed that it is developing a project in Yuma County but declined further comment.

If global warming is real and it is we need to address it. I am a little nervous about having a giant company come in and do this but I will be excited to see those turbines go up. — Greg Hill 49

In Phillips County Yuma’s neighbor to the north National Renewable Solutions has put up meteorological towers as a prelude to a wind project that will also straddle Logan and Sedgewick counties according to Laura Schroetlin the Phillips County administrator-planner.

Minnetonka Minn.-based National Renewable Solutions part of the multinational investment corporation BlackRock Inc. did not reply to repeated telephone requests by the Sun for comment.

Both Phillips County and neighboring Logan County have moratoriums on wind and solar development while they work on new ordinances but Schroetlin said that the coming of renewable energy still seems far off. “We get more stirred up by confined feedlots” she said.

From Yuma County Power Pathway plunges south — through rolling prairie furrowed with arroyos and fringed with clusters of cottonwood trees gathered at dry gullies waiting for a drink — to Kit Carson County already home to five wind farms.

Segment 2 will end at a new Goose Creek substation in Cheyenne County where the next leg — Segment 3 — will run 65 miles south through Cheyenne and Kiowa counties.

Unlike the counties up north Kit Carson and Cheyenne have had years of experience with wind farms. Cheyenne is home to Xcel Energy’s 500-MW Cheyenne Ridge Wind Project and parts of Rush Creek. The county has had land use ordinances regulating wind farms for more than a decade and they have periodically been updated Jolly said.

“Some people are interested in having them [turbines] some aren’t” Jolly said. “We have a wind lease on our place and I have mixed emotions about it. It has a much bigger impact on the land than oil and gas.”

“But it is what it is you can’t lock the gate” Jolly said. “We’ll have to learn to live with it.”

Some Cheyenne and Kiowa county farmers have banded together and hired a lawyer to negotiate wind leases for them.

A group of about a dozen Cheyenne County farmers representing some 36000 acres got a uniform wind lease. “The feeling was if we got a big enough block together we could get these companies to pay a fairer rate” said Matt Campbell 42 who grew on his family farm in the county.

And as in Yuma County the group found itself dealing with former oil and gas landmen. “We call them lease hounds” Campbell said. A similar group of landowners has banded together negotiate leases in Kiowa County.

Kiowa County like Yuma has not yet seen any wind or solar development but at least half a dozen prospective developers have already stopped by the county building according to Tina Adamson the county administrator.

Perhaps the biggest dispute yet for Power Pathways came along Segment 3 in Kiowa County as the Sand Creek Memorial Foundation and the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes objected to one potential route they said would compromise the view at the memorial commemorating the 1864 massacre of 230 Cheyenne and Arapaho by Colorado volunteer soldiers.

They said the high-tension line would violate the spirit of legislation that called for preserving the original landscape.

Xcel Energy agreed to move the line 10 miles from the memorial but the idea of preserving a 10-mile viewshed buffer raised the dander of local farmers and landowners who felt they hadn’t gotten a say and were concerned that such a large buffer around the memorial would stifle development and take some landowners out of the wind farm game.

“It’s the way they went about it. Xcel wasn’t very transparent” said Burl Scherler 71 who raises winter wheat and sorghum and in good years corn and sunflowers on 20000 acres in Kiowa County — though due to the challenges of dryland farming rarely is all the acreage in cultivation.

“The governor wants renewable energy it has value to the country but the state has to realize we are out here and to treat us fairly” said Scherler who has farmed his land for 50 years. “We want to have a fair shake.”

Scherler said that it now looks that the Power Pathway will cut across 2 miles of his land. He has signed an agreement with Xcel Energy allowing it to do surveys and geological archaeological and biological studies. “We’ve got people sitting on the side of the road counting birds.”

One bird in particular — the lesser prairie-chicken — could end up being an even bigger challenge for Xcel Energy than the Sand Creek Memorial as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering listing the bird as an endangered species.

That designation would impact Segments 3 and 4. “Habitat conservation costs could be as high as $3.5 million per line mile and could increase total costs for these segments by up to $180 million” according to a PUC filing.

Sheridan Lake — home to 89 people a gas station and the Hawk’s Nest Convenience Store — is the lone town in the area and its Plainview Elementary School has 30 pupils. “Out here the key is to maintain critical mass” Scherler said. “If you don’t the next thing you know your kids have to go 50 miles to school or to Kansas.”

The coming of Power Pathway and all it promises could help maintain critical mass. “Thirty new jobs may not sound like much but to us it is huge” Scherler said.

Just west of Sheridan Lake Xcel Energy will build its new May Valley substation. The PUC also gave the utility conditional approval for an additional $250 million 90-mile spur running from May Valley to the Twin Butte’s area in Baca County home to some of the best wind and solar resources in the state — and the lesser prairie-chicken.

From May Valley the Power Pathway will head due west 140 miles in Segment 4 through Kiowa Lincoln Crowley and Pueblo counties.

Math on lease agreements pencils out. The map is a different matter.

No county has felt the impact of wind development more than Lincoln County. The first wind farm Cedar Point went up in 2011 followed by three more plus a section of the Rush Creek project.

The county is now home to 525 wind turbines and in 2021 the five wind farms paid $2.4 million in taxes to the county and area school districts according to county assessor records.

“Ag and cattle account for more than $25 million in sales so agriculture remains king” said Troy McCue executive director of the Lincoln County Economic Development Corp. “Still this has been a good way to diversify our economy.”

“It has not been difficult to integrate wind economically” McCue said. “The wind blows so hard on the Eastern Plains it is good now that someone is getting some use out of that.”

Segment 4 ends at the Xcel Energy’s Tundra substation just northeast of Pueblo. Power Pathway turns north here for the last leg of its journey — Segment 5 — 120 miles through Pueblo El Paso Elbert and Arapahoe counties ending at the Harvest Mile substation outside of Aurora.

One route that was in play ran right next to the Book family’s calving barn — the heart of the cow and calf operation the family runs. The Books were not happy.

“It would have been a tremendous disturbance and the line was only going to be a quarter of a mile from the house” Penny Book 73 said.

Jesse Book a grandfather of her husband Lansing purchased the land near the El Paso County crossroads community of Rush for taxes in the early 1930s. The operation now covers 5000 acres.

The homestead house — renovated — is now home to the Books’ son Robert 46 and his wife and two children the fifth generation on the land.

Book Land & Cattle is now owned by Robert who splits his time between a job as a financial adviser in Colorado Springs and running with his parents’ help the family cow-calf operation.

In its ongoing jockeying to find the right route Xcel Energy has moved the proposed line about 3 miles from the Book ranch. Still Penny Book worries about “what comes next — the wind farms.”

“People think there is a lot of nothing out here but that’s what I love” she said.

Some 28 miles north of the Books Andrew Kochis a Czech immigrant had taken advantage of the 1909 Enlarge Homestead Act and in 1916 moved to a 320-acre plot near Matheson.

Today Kochis Farms covers 10000 acres and is home to corn and wheat fields 200 head of beef cattle and 30 Rush Creek wind turbines as well as an Xcel Energy substation and Jan Kochis is fine with it all.

“There is no problem farming around the turbines” Kochis said. “The cows like to go right up the base for the shade.”

“In some of our fields we have some pretty nice roads now” she said “When they built the roads they compensated us for taking land out of production same for land taken out of production during construction.”

And then there are the royalties from their lawyer-negotiated lease agreement. The Kochis family gets an annual payment on their fraction of the overall Rush Creek Project that comes to $6000 to $8000 for each turbine.

“You’ve got no expenses and the money is really nice when you’ve had a dry year” she said.

What about the blinking red lights at night? “I don’t look” Kochis said. And the noise of the blades? “You walk out on a quiet morning and hear this calming swish swish swish.”

Moving north the Power Pathway begins to meet exurban development pushing east from Colorado Springs Castle Rock and Parker. “Due to its proximity to growing municipal areas in the state … Segment 5 presents routing challenges not common in other segments” the utility said in a PUC filing.

One of those challenges is the Elbert County Environmental Alliance a recently formed homeowners’ group seeking to simultaneously protect the environment and property values — especially in the Bijoux Basin.

“The lines would run right through the basin which is pristine and rich in wildfire life” said Robert Poletiek an alliance board member and 26-year resident of the area.

The depression in the plains offered shelter not only to nesting eagles but to Comanche tribes Poletiek said. “Keep your eyes down and you still find imprints of tipi circles and arrowheads.”

This is where the Eastern Plains sprawling ranches begin to break-up. First into 60-acre parcels like the one upon which Poletiek lives and then moving closer to Interstate 25 into suburban subdivisions.

“It isn’t only the line it’s the knock-on effect of all the development the wind and solar” Poletiek said. Enel Green Power is already developing the Bijou Hills Wind Project on 20000 acres east of the basin.

Alliance members have shown-up at Xcel Energy’s open houses placards in hand and spoken at every Elbert County Commission meeting.

“We’ve gotten a good reception at the commission and from Xcel” Poletiek said. Xcel representatives he said have indicated that they may consider a path to the east of the basin.

“Segment 5 was always going to be the hardest” Poletiek said but without it the complete circuit — which enables electricity to be sent in either direction and helps ensure reliability —cannot be closed.

“We realize Segment 5 has to be built somewhere” Poletiek said.

Colorado isn’t alone in pressing for building more transmission and renewable generation. Among the projects under development in the West are SunZia Southwest Transmission covering 520 miles between Arizona and New Mexico Greenlink West running 423 miles through Nevada and the Cross-Tie Transmission project a 214-mile line between Nevada and Utah.

Building transmission is often controversial. A proposed 145-mile line to bring hydropower to Massachusetts from Quebec was blocked by voters in Maine and the Missouri legislature in response to the Grain Belt Express — a 800-mile line designed to bring Kansas wind power to Illinois and Indiana — passed a bill giving counties and landowners a stronger hand dealing with the developer.

“Building transmission is extremely difficult” Gavan the PUC commissioner said. “You only have to look across the country at other failed projects that have inhibited other jurisdictions from hitting their targets to see how risky it is.”

One key advantage Colorado has is “being able to go it alone” said Charles Teplin a manager in the electricity practice at consultant RMI.

“We have wonderful resources of wind and solar” Teplin said. “The folks on the Eastern Plains can benefit from the economics of exporting what they have and the urban core benefits with clean energy. We don’t have to go through another state we don’t have to deal with another jurisdiction.”

No not that one.

On June 8 the Cleveland City Council voted 16-1 to request that FirstEnergy remove its name from Cleveland Browns Stadium.

They're following the lead of fans who have pushing to get rid of the name because of the utility's ongoing bribery scandal.

The Akron Beacon Journal reports that FirstEnergy paid the Browns a reported $103 million in 2013 for the naming rights through 2030.

The U.S. Department of Justice is looking into allegations that FirstEnergy officials bribed state legislators to the tune of $61 million to pass a bill to grant the company a $1.3 billion bailout for two nuclear plants — courtesy of you.

It's already resulted in the takedown of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder with more shoes to drop.

According to a report by Energy Wire in recent years the Ohio Legislature has done the bidding of utility companies hamstringing the development of renewable energy through the following actions:

2014 — Senate Bill 310 put a two-year ""freeze"" on Ohio’s renewable and energy efficiency standards.

2014 — The Legislature adopted new wind setbacks that have stifled new wind development.

2016 — Gov. John Kasich vetoes an extended freeze on clean energy requirements.

2019 — House Bill 6 nullifies Ohio’s clean energy standards.

2021 — Gov. Mike DeWine signs Senate Bill 52 giving Ohio counties the right to veto all renewable energy development or specific projects.

Bill? Bill who?

For its part in the bribery scheme FirstEnergy has paid $230 million in fines to the state but only Householder has been perp-walked.

No can blame Browns fans in Northeast Ohio for being upset. They're getting hit with a triple whammy: taxes for the publicly-funded stadium the bailout and being FirstEnergy customers.

When will institutions learn that naming a public venue after a living person or corporation can be a crapshoot?

While there are many bona fide and genuine philanthropists in the world — Stark County is rich with them — some people love to write big checks as a chest-thump in the chase for immortality.

Temple University and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst are still trying to scour off the ick from their Bill Cosby connection.

It's a rare public building that doesn't bear a person's name.

Practically every school everywhere is named after someone.

In Canton we have federal buildings named after the late Reps. Ralph Regula and Frank T. Bow in thanks for their decades of service.

Charita Goshay: Money talks when it comes to naming sports fields

No refunds!

You can only pray the person honored doesn't end up in the hoosegow like former Ohio Rep. Bob Ney on bribery charges forcing Ohio University to scrub his name from a fitness center.

Ohio University found itself embarrassed yet again in 2016 when its Scripps College of Communications un-christened its Roger Ailes Newsroom after it was learned that the founder of Fox News serially and sexually harassed women in his employ for years.

Ailes a Warren native donated $500000 to his alma mater in 2007.

Because the payrolls of most NFL team are larger than the GDPs of some banana republics it's become the norm for teams to sell naming rights though no one will ever convince me that Heinz Field is more poetic than Three Rivers Stadium as much as I like their ketchup.

Back when the Browns were 0-16 comedian Mike Polk coined the name ""Factory of Sadness"" an apt and accurate description as a place where loyal fans came out week after week to occupy wind-whipped seats and cheer on a team that had practically rolled over and played dead.

But you can't pay an offensive lineman with a wisecrack.

Browns owner Jimmy Haslam is about to set a mountain of money on fire for a player who probably won't play for another year — if even then. He isn't about to cut FirstEnergy a refund check.

One good thing about being a Browns fan: It prepares one for disappointment.

CLEVELAND — The Cleveland Browns may be looking for a site to build a new stadium once the current lease is up according to NEOtrans' Ken Prendergast.

Prendergast cites two sources close to the Haslam ownership group that state the Browns owner is ""leaning toward building a new stadium versus renovating the existing FirstEnergy Stadium."" Those sources Prendergast cites also say that the Haslams are not happy with the condition of the current stadium and how the structure is ""aging poorly.""

FirstEnergy Stadium is currently under a lease agreement that will keep the Cleveland Browns playing in its confines through at least 2028.

Senior Vice President of Communications for the Browns Peter John-Baptiste did not comment on the validity of the claims by NEOtrans but did say that the Haslams are continuing to look into the viability of developing land on the lakeside.

Where are these two sites those sources speculate the Haslams are looking at? One would be where the Main Post Office is currently located at 2400 Orange Avenue.

Another would be a stretch of land along Lakeside Avenue including the current location of the 3News studios. 3News can confirm that nobody from the Browns organization or Haslam ownership group have reached out regarding this information at this time.

FirstEnergy Stadium is currently the 10th oldest stadium in the league and has only seen one major renovation in 2014 for $120 million. Current estimates based on other renovation projects and new stadium costs estimate that a new stadium would cost over $1 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MtaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L3JlcG9ydC1icm93bnMtZXhwbG9yaW5nLXNpdGVzLWZvci1uZXctZG93bnRvd24tc3RhZGl1bS_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8xOC9yZXBvcnQtYnJvd25zLWV4cGxvcmluZy1zaXRlcy1mb3ItbmV3LWRvd250b3duLXN0YWRpdW0vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: Browns exploring sites for new downtown stadium,"They don’t make sports stadiums like they used to.

The Haslam Sports Group run by Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam plus their son-in-law JW Johnson is exploring the benefits of building a new stadium for their football team rather than renovating FirstEnergy Stadium according to a report by neo-trans.blog.

Tentative sites for a new stadium include land west of North Coast Harbor and East Ninth Street west of West Third Street and north of the bluff overlooking the railroad tracks according to the report. In other words the new stadium would not be far from where the current one stands.

A new stadium would allow for the current one to be demolished. The land it occupies would be developed into retail stores and housing to create revenue to help fund a new domed stadium.

FirstEnergy Stadium opened in 1999 as Cleveland Browns Stadium to accommodate the expansion team the NFL awarded Cleveland after Art Modell move the original Browns to Baltimore in 1996.

The stadium was partially funded by a “sin tax” on alcohol and tobacco in a vote approved overwhelmingly by Cuyahoga County voters (72 percent to 28 percent) on Nov. 7 1995 — one day after Modell stood on a stage in Baltimore to announce he was moving the team. The sin tax originally was designed to renovate old Cleveland Stadium. But Cleveland city officials reached an agreement with the NFL that the team replacing the former Browns would be an expansion team rather than a relocated one if a new stadium was built.

Ground was broken for the new stadium in May 1997. It opened in July 1999. The first game played was a preseason contest against the Vikings on Aug. 21 1999.

The Stadium was renamed FirstEnergy Stadium in 2013. Renovations in 2014 and 2015 improved the experience for fans. But it is still one of the most spartan stadiums in the NFL.

Browns spokesman Peter John-Baptiste told neotrans that the blog site was “a little too far out in front of the story” but this development is not new. Dee Haslam talked about the possibility of a new stadium with a group of reporters at the team’s training complex in Berea back in 2018.

“The main thing is to start the conversation at some point” she said. “I don’t know that we’re ready to start the conversation but we are ready to get all the information we can about what’s possible. So I think it’s really important to find out what’s possible.

“There could be a lot of great ideas that we might not be able to do because it’s not feasible for one reason or another” Haslam said. “I don’t want to get the horse in front of the cart until we’re knowledgeable enough to know because we’re not informed enough to know right now. But we do know that we have a desire to make a bigger impact on the future of Cleveland.”

The lease on FirstEnergy Stadium expires after the 2028 season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd2dzYnluYXR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjIvNi8xOS8yMzE3NTEzNS9hcmUtdGhlLWJyb3ducy1hbmQtdGhlLWNpdHktb2YtY2xldmVsYW5kLXdvcmtpbmctdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC1hLW5ldy1zdGFkaXVt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are the Browns and the City of Cleveland working to develop a new stadium?,"A lot of northern United States sports teams have constructed indoor stadiums for their teams. There are two thoughts concerning this: makes sense with winter climates and no thank you because it takes away the tradition of the game that should be played under these extreme conditions.

It seems the Browns are in the beginning stages of conducting feasibility studies to see if a new stadium could be on the horizon for the franchise. Their current lease expires in 2028.

According to a report on neo-trans.blog two sources close to the Haslam Sports Group have stated that the Browns are looking into building a new venue centered around a ballpark village instead of costly renovations to FirstEnergy Stadium.

The owners of the Browns Jimmy and Dee Haslam are not content with the condition of FirstEnergy with the fact that the stadium has aged significantly; plus (according to them) the arena was poorly-built to begin with.

FirstEnergy opened in 1999 as home to the new Browns built on the site of old Cleveland Municipal Stadium which served the community from 1931-1996. The new stadium’s original name was Cleveland Browns Stadium and was built at a cost of $283 million. Crowd capacity for a Browns game is 67431 which includes 143 executive suites. Two renovation projects were completed in 2014 and 2015.

When the Haslams purchased the Browns they sold the stadium naming rights to FirstEnergy which was reported to be about $6 million a year for 17 years.

When asked about a new stadium the Browns’ front office has not responded other than to say that the assumption at this point “is a little too far out in front of the story.”

The question at this juncture is whether to renovate FirstEnergy or build a brand new retractable roof stadium that is not only able to be closed for inclement weather conditions but would be available year-round for numerous non-sports events. This would increase revenues for the venue. Rough cost analysis has shown that with renovations to the existing stadium plus adding a roof would be very close to the construction of a completely new building.

According to the report it seems that the Browns are in preliminary talks with the City of Cleveland to develop a sports village which would surround the new stadium similar to what many Major League Baseball teams have accomplished - such as Ballpark Village adjacent to Busch Stadium in St. Louis.

The Browns might even be connected in the proposed Bedrock riverfront plans that Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert has designed which includes 29 acres of riverfront land between Huron Road and the Cuyahoga River.

The estimated cost of a new stadium has been mentioned at north of $1 billion. And if a new stadium is eventually in the works there are two sites earmarked already.

One site is 70 acres of land which the City owns the majority of located west of North Coast Harbor and East 9th Street. The other is where the Post Office currently stands at 2400 Orange Avenue just southeast of downtown. It sits on 36 acres with another 48 acres adjacent to that tract which is owned by the Ohio Department of Transportation. The Post Office bought the old Chevrolet plant with plans to relocate.

These two parcels represent the largest contiguous pieces of land near downtown.

There are traces that indicate that this idea of a new stadium has been brewing for some time. The Browns offered their support to the City as it has gone through a preliminary visioning process that has been in the works for two years. This has involved landscape architects and city planners. The City has also applied to the Ohio Department of Transportation for federal funding which would allow the City to conduct required studies and assessments.

One other item in the works that would have to be ironed out is the proposed land bridge over the railroad tracks.

Regarding the expenditure of a new stadium the plan would be to sell the existing land owned by the City that the current stadium is located on to developers. As usual it would be expected that some public funding will be necessary regardless of if FirstEnergy is renovated or new digs are built. Both of these ideas would increase the Haslams’ ability to offset costs.

Apparently the 25-year mark is the new standard for the life of an NFL stadium as other NFL teams are asking for new stadiums in Washington Buffalo and Carolina. If Cleveland does indeed build a retractable dome they would become the only club in the AFC North to have an indoor stadium.

Right now the Browns are wanting to start the conversation of what to do next.

And just maybe the City of Cleveland could host a Super Bowl.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA2L2NsZXZlbGFuZC1icm93bnMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS13YW50LW5ldy0xLWJpbGxpb24tc3RhZGl1bS1saWtlbHktcHVibGljbHktZnVuZGVkLmh0bWzSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2xldmVsYW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDYvY2xldmVsYW5kLWJyb3ducy1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LXdhbnQtbmV3LTEtYmlsbGlvbi1zdGFkaXVtLWxpa2VseS1wdWJsaWNseS1mdW5kZWQuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cleveland Browns reportedly want new $1 billion stadium likely publicly funded,"CLEVELAND Ohio – The Cleveland Browns are apparently eyeing a new $1 billion stadium – likely to come at significant taxpayer expense – as part of a costly lakefront redevelopment plan at a time when the team is already mired in multimillion-dollar controversies.

NEOtrans real estate blogger Ken Prendergast reported the news in a post Friday writing that unnamed sources close to team owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam told him they want a covered stadium that could cost over $1 billion and are even open to moving the city-owned stadium to a new location near downtown to get it. And so far the Browns have not denied it.

In a recent interview Peter John-Baptiste senior vice president of communications for the Browns and Haslam Sports Group told Prendergast that he was “a little too far out in front of the story” and would not comment on specifics.

Reached by phone Sunday John-Baptiste declined to respond to the blog post but confirmed that the team is conducting “feasibility studies on what a new stadium could look like.” The results are expected sometime in 2023 and focus “primarily on renovating the current stadium” he said but he could not definitively refute whether plans might eventually include rebuilding or moving the arena.

Instead he pointed to ongoing efforts to redevelop up to 70 acres of city-owned lakefront property including the land on which the current stadium sits into a sort of ballpark village surrounding – and further supporting -- the stadium as evidence of the team’s intent to stay put. The plan envisions adding housing retail parking hospitality and recreation spaces along the harbor but is dependent on the city building a land bridge linking the area to other downtown amenities.

“Our focus is on the lakefront” John-Baptiste said. “That’s the neighborhood we’re in and that’s where we want to be.”

He could not say how much an upgraded facility might cost but it’s likely to require significant public funding considering most professional teams negotiate subsidies from their home city and county. The current stadium which was built in 1999 cost $283 million largely funded by city bonds backed by the county’s “sin tax” on alcohol and cigarette purchases.

A portion of that tax which expires in 2035 is currently used to pay for capital or emergency repairs to the stadium per the terms of the team’s lease agreement. Earlier this month Cleveland City Council approved using the fund for $10 million in repairs including a replacement of the pedestrian ramps that carry fans to and from the stadium’s upper levels. The remaining portion came from the city’s general fund.

The news comes at a time when the team is already under fire for guaranteeing quarterback Deshaun Watson’s $230 million contract – the most in NFL history – despite the now 24 massage therapists who have filed civil lawsuits against him alleging sexual misconduct. That means he could continue to be paid even if he does receive disciplinary action ranging from suspension for a specific number of games or indefinitely to banishment from the league.

The NFL Players Association is preparing to fight any suspension without pay cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot recently reported.

The news also comes as the Browns continue to defend their million-dollar relationship with FirstEnergy amid the ongoing bribery scandal around House Bill 6 and accusations that the company bankrolled a dark money group that tried to undermine its city-owned competitor. Cleveland City Council recently called on the company to relinquish its naming rights of the football stadium but the Browns said they remain “committed to our relationship and look forward to our continued partnership.”

FirstEnergy reportedly paid the team $107 million in 2013 for naming rights through 2030.

The Browns have also been one of the main catalysts for redeveloping Cleveland’s lakefront. The Haslams proposed a plan last year to extend the downtown Mall into a sort of land bridge over the Ohio 2 Shoreway finally linking downtown to lakefront attractions like the city-owned football stadium Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center. Not only is it believed the bridge would increase public access to the lakefront but it would extend the city grid to the water’s edge and make new land available and attractive for other businesses.

The plan already has significant backing. Mayor Justin Bibb the city of Cleveland and the Greater Cleveland Partnership have organized a civic task force with five working groups and more than 150 participants to try to make the transformation happen.

The cost to reconfigure traffic and build the land bridge has been estimated at $229 million the majority of which is expected to be funded by state and federal sources. But the city is likely to have to kick in at least some portion.

That cost would compete against any funding the city might provide toward renovations or a new Browns stadium but it seems unlikely that the poorest big city in the nation will have much more to give.

The city’s 2022 budget includes $62 million more in spending than revenues will cover and the city is already considering how it may participate in $1 billion plans to renovate or replace the Justice Center which houses city and county courthouses not to mention the financial impact of where the county chooses to build a new jail.

In an interview on cleveland.com’s “Today in Ohio” podcast leading up to the election reporter Seth Richardson asked now-Mayor Justin Bibb what he would do if the Browns asked the city to subsidize a new stadium or renovations like The Guardians had recently secured.

At the time Bibb said he considers the city’s major sports teams “a great asset and a great boon to our regional economy” but he would not support subsidizing sports stadiums unless the investments can be recouped and leveraged for more economic development.

“If we can find a way to raise nearly half a billion dollars to support Progressive Field and their renovations then surely we can also find a way to have the same level of investment to support our neighborhoods” Bibb said at the time.

Though the city and county have partnered to fund other arenas – each picking up a third of the tab for $202.5 million in renovations to Progressive Field as part of a lease agreement with The Guardians – it’s unlikely that the city would be able to turn to the county for support either. Cuyahoga County Council is already weighing plans to spend $550 million on a new jail $1 billion on a court facility and $30 million or more on planned renovations to the Global Center for Health Innovation.

According to NEOtrans’s reporting sources contend the revenues generated by the lakefront development plan could offset a significant portion of the building costs for a new stadium even if it were moved to a new location. The post referenced two potential sites under consideration: either where the Main Post Office currently stands at 2400 Orange Ave. southeast of downtown or near the Federal Bureau of Investigation building at 1501 Lakeside Ave. E.

They also say a stadium with either a permanent dome or retractable roof would also be able to generate revenue year-round providing space for concerts shows or other major events. The current open-air stadium is used only about a dozen times a year.

It appears the Haslams have just been waiting on final waterfront redevelopment plans to pull the trigger on plans for an upgraded stadium according to reporting on the Browns’ official website.

“The city and The (Greater) Cleveland partnership has taken over the waterfront development piece and we have committees working on that” Dee Haslam said in March. “Our part now is how we bring the stadium up to a better standard so I think we’ve started interviewing and thinking about architects and consultants.”"

However UPL was quick to dismiss the reports stating “promoters — the Shroff family — are completely aligned and committed to the company’s future growth.”

“We are a beautiful company and people have many aspirations when they see beautiful things” says Jai Shroff Global CEO UPL the second-generation promoter. Established in 1969 UPL has done over 40 acquisitions in the past 25 years expanding its presence to over 138 countries.

“UPL is a shopoholic company and we like to shop” says Shroff  adding that it is currently in talks with 70 different start-ups for testing technologies and in discussions with another 50 firms for collaboration.

After acquiring Arysta LifeScience from Platform Specialty Products Corporation for $4.2 billion in 2019 UPL has kept up with its shopoholic image with the latest being the buyout of OptiCHOS a bio-solutions product platform from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.

The Arysta deal catapulted UPL to the fifth slot among the top ten global agrochem firms with annual revenue exceeding $5.2 billion. A large player in the post-patent crop-protection market UPL has a robust portfolio consisting of biologicals seeds traditional crop protection solutions bio solutions pre- and post-harvest solutions soil and water technologies with more than 14000 registrations. In fact the company doubled its share in the global crop protection market over the past five years to around 8 per cent in FY 2022 from 4 per cent in FY 17. The company expects to increase it further to 9-11 per cent by FY27.

Robust growth

For FY22 UPL registered a 19 per cent revenue growth at ₹46240 crore and 26 per cent profit growth at ₹3626 crore. The robust growth was driven by strong demand for herbicides and insecticides in Latin America North America and India among other markets. In the current year UPL is eyeing over 10 per cent revenue growth which it believes will be driven by factors such as strong commodity prices and the higher cost and reduced availability of fertilisers favouring the use of bio-solutions a key focus area for the company.

“The integration of Arysta is complete and the company has reorganised itself to focus on growth” says Shroff adding that UPL has got better ability to price the products. With significant investments in manufacturing marketing and distribution UPL is probably the most backward integrated player in the industry worldwide.

The company has diversified its raw material sourcing strategy by reducing dependence on China while increasing from other geographies including India where it has an expanding supplier base of over 15 major companies like Deepak Fertilisers Aarti Industries and Laxmi Organics which are being encouraged to expand their capacities. Sourcing of raw materials from China has reduced from 37 per cent in FY17 to 31 per cent in FY22. At the same time sourcing from India has improved from 34 per cent to 38 per cent and rest of the world from 29 per cent to 31 per cent during this period.

UPL has been gaining market share in the past 10 years and expects to grow at thrice the industry average. It expects to sustain the trend of doubling revenue every five years.

""UPL has consistently gained market share through a combination of low-cost manufacturing and portfolio expansion and gaining scale through inorganic play. With food inflation rising on account of geopolitical tensions and supply disruption we expect demand for crop protection products to remain robust"" says Anil R Sr. Research analyst at Geojit Financial Services.

Collaborate to grow

UPL which strongly believes in collaboration to drive growth has entered into a string of partnerships through its OpenAg platform to expand its product portfolio and geographical footprint besides setting up a new global business unit Natural Plant Protection that comprises both natural and biologically derived inputs to tap the fast-growing bio-solutions business. In fact the company is the largest player in the bio solutions space. UPL saw encouraging volume-led growth in its differentiated and sustainable (D&S) solutions portfolio which grew 19 per cent during FY 22.

“We believe UPL’s strategy to expand its D&S solutions and focus on increasing penetration in the high-growth crops segments and markets is expected to drive sustainable growth and margin expansion” said analysts Rohit Nagaraj and Ayush Chaturvedi of Emkay Global in a note.

Notable partnerships include the likes of the one with Chr Hansen a bio-product company in Denmark; with FMC Corp for manufacture and supply of chloratraniliprole (CTPR) an insecticide in India; with Mitsui Chemicals Agro Inc (Meiji) of Japan for introducing Flyupyrimin an insecticide in the Indian market among others.

Through OpenAg UPL is focused on accelerating progress for the food system and building a network that’s reimagining sustainability. At the same time the company has been trying something new — assuring an outcome to the farmers for using the company’s services or solutions. “We are transforming the industry from a ‘selling products business’ to an outcomes business” says Shroff.

Such outcome-based offerings to farmers are being implemented through its agri-technology platform Nurture.Farm and by selling crop specific solutions under the ProNutiva package. UPL’s ProNutiva integrates bio-solutions with conventional crop protection products to reduce the use of inputs while enabling better crop growth and climate resilience. Through ProNutiva UPL is assuring increase in yields and better prices for growers of crops such as groundnut and sugarcane among others. The area serviced with ProNutiva package of solutions has increased to 1.7 million acres in FY22 from 0.1 m acre in FY20. Besides helping increase farmers income by an average of 15 per cent ProNutiva has pushed up yields by 35-40 per cent in crops like groundnut in Gujarat.

Fetching better prices

“Farmers have signed up in over 4500 villages where they use our platform from the beginning to the end. Farmers are not just buying for the sake of buying products but want to get better quality produce and fetch better prices. The concept is working well and over the next five to six years it will have a huge impact” Shroff adds.

UPL’s ProNutiva has generated a lot of interest not only among the farmers but also among the food companies. “A lot of food companies are partnering with us because they want traceability” Shroff adds.

With focus on expanding bio-solutions and sustainability high on agenda the CEO of the world’s fifth largest agrochemical firm believes farmers should be rewarded for following sustainable practices. Last year he announced a gigaton challenge to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide equivalent 1 gigaton by 2040 leveraging sustainable methods. The Gigaton Challenge will create a new carbon credit to incentivise and support farmers for adopting sustainable and regenerative practices.

“If adoption of electric vehicles can be incentivised why not reward the farmers” asks Shroff while stating that Nurture.Farm platform it is exactly doing that. Nurture which has been instrumental in preventing the stubble burning in north India has also been able to generate and forward sell about 20000 agri-related carbon credits from its dry seeded rice project for methane reduction. Nurture which has taken up widespread spraying IARI’s Pusa bio-decomposer on paddy straw in about 4.2 lakh acres has not only prevented air pollution but also helped increase the carbon content in soil while maintaining soil health. The UPL investee company is targetting to help Indian farmers generate one million carbon credits by 2023.

Interestingly UPL completed a ₹1100 crore share buyback programme recently. Besides the buyback the promoters have also been increasing their stakes in the company through open market purchases. The promoters' stake has increased to 28.4 per cent at the end of March 2022 from 27.9 per cent in September 2021. It remains to be seen whether there’s any correlation between the company’s buyback the promoters increasing their shareholding and the reports of the company being a take-over target.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The lawsuit accuses the automobile company of contaminating the water soil groundwater vegetation and the air in the area in Ringwood New Jersey as well as selling part of the land to the state without disclosing to them the damage that they had caused there.

The lawsuit is pursuing action on eight counts including negligence and trespassing.

According to the lawsuit in 1965 Ford purchased 400 acres of Ringwood Mines for the purpose of disposing of its waste from the automobile plant built a decade previously.

The Ringwood Mines area has nearly 50 residential units and about 200 residents.

Starting 1967 for seven years the company used the space to throw away “tons of toxic paint sludge and drummed waste and other non-liquid hazardous waste”.

Meanwhile around 1970 the company sold off parts of the land to numerous entities including a non-profit and other government institutions without disclosing the full extent of the damage they had caused on the land.

“Bottom line is that Ford demonstrated little to no regard for the environment” said the acting attorney general Matt Platkin when announcing the lawsuit on Thursday.

“They turned a blind eye to the risks that their actions have imposed on the lives of 200 residents who live here which includes Native Americans who are historically and disproportionately exposed to environmental harms” he said according to a video of the announcement shared on Facebook.

Vincent Mann chief of the Ramapough Lenape Nation’s Turtle Clan and New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection Shawn M LaTourette were also present at the announcement.

“Today is one of those days that we’ll remember when the state of New Jersey and [attorney general] understands the impact of our community they understand the loss of not just our families but the loss of our lands” Mann said.

LaTourette who is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit told the Guardian that at this time there isn’t an estimate for how much is being demanded in compensation.

“The full scope of damages and potential compensation will be better characterized in the discovery phase of the lawsuit” he said.

The lawsuit is currently demanding compensation for damages done to natural resources and punitive damages or penalties for its “wanton and willful disregard” of the local residents.

LaTourette added that he hopes this will be an answer to a decades-long struggle the local community has been put through especially the Ramapough Lenape population.

“My hope is that we restore the wetlands waters lands and cultural resources that have been degraded for decades including through restoration projects that benefit the people who rely upon these resources and have been deprived of their benefits including the people of the Ramapough Lenape Nation” he said.

Here are a few who have.

Ettore and Jean Bugatti

Ettore Bugatti never thought himself artistically gifted despite being born into an artistic family. Entering the German auto industry in 1902 as an engineer he began designing race cars as well as road cars in Molsheim Alsace France in 1909. He never felt as gifted as his brother Rembrandt even though his cars belie that notion.

Ettore's oldest son Gianroberto commonly known as Jean did have the talent joining the company and creating some of the marque's finest models but he died in a crash in 1939 driving a Type 57. He was 30 years old. Eight years later Ettore died at age 66 and the brand folded after fewer than 8000 Bugattis were built. Volkswagen Group revived the marque in 1998.

Henry and Edsel Ford

There is no father-and-son team more renowned than that of Henry Ford and his son Edsel. Henry established the Ford Motor Co. in 1903 after his first company failed and the second nearly did. Yet the third time proved providential and by the 1920s the Ford Model T accounted for one of every two automobile sales.

But while Henry loved to tinker Edsel had the taste to design cars. His touch can be seen in 1930s-era Fords and the elegant Lincoln Continental.

Yet on May 26 1943 Edsel died of cancer and undulant fever at age 49. Henry took the reins at Ford once again despite being 80 years old. Edsel's wife objected and four years later her son Henry Ford II took over. Today Henry Ford's great grandson William Clay Ford Jr. runs the company.

Wilhelm and Karl Maybach

While the Maybach name may be familiar for its current use by Mercedes-Benz its place in history starts with Karl Daimler. Wilhelm Maybach was Daimler's chief design engineer who created the first four-cylinder automotive engine and the first Mercedes in 1904. In 1907 Maybach left Daimler to build engines for Luftschiffbau Zeppelin maker of the famous airship. He founded his own company Maybach Motorenbau GmbH which was successful but he left in 1918 putting his son Karl at the helm.

Karl redirected the company to manufacture exclusive high-end luxury cars in 1922 which he built through the 1930s. Production ended in 1930s although the nameplate was revived by Mercedes-Benz in 2002 as a competitor to Rolls-Royce and Bentley.

Ferdinand and Ferry Porsche

Ferdinand Porsche had already spent three decades designing cars before establishing his design firm in 1931 in Stuttgart Germany. Having landed the contract to develop the Volkswagen (originally the KdF-Wagen) for Adolf Hitler he used that design as the basis for his own car the 1950 Porsche 356 after surviving a postwar stint in prison for his association with the Third Reich.

While Ferdinand died the following year at age 75 his son Ferry sustained the brand's image through racing and engineering excellence creating such cars as the 911 914 and 944. Retiring from Porsche in 1993 he dieed in 1998 survived by his sons Butzi Gerhard Peter and Wolfgang. Today Porsche once an independent company is owned by the Volkswagen Group.

Lloyd and Mark Reuss

While not household names this father and son have proven influential at General Motors. Lloyd Reuss joined GM as an engineer in the late 1950s before going on to other assignments before being named general manager of Buick and GM vice president in 1980. He was promoted to manage Chevrolet-Pontiac and GM Canada in 1984 adding Saturn a year later. By 1990 he was president of GM before falling victim to a boardroom coup in 1992.

Ironically his son Mark now holds the same title at GM a post he has held since 2019. Like his father Mark is an engineer having joined the company 1983. He is also a certified industry pool test driver on the North Course of the Nürburgring in Germany and is licensed for FIA C and IMSA Road Racing.

Kiichiro Shoichiro and Akio Toyoda

Kiichiro Toyoda was the son of Sakichi Toyoda founder of the Toyoda Automatic Loom Works. Sakichi encouraged his son to seek his own path and Kiichiro looked to automaking. When a recession forced Toyota to lay off workers which led to a strike Kiichiro resigned dying two years later in 1952.

Although Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda was named president and managing director in 1967 it wasn't until 1983 that Kiichiro's son Shoichiro became president. Under Shoichiro Toyota developed the Prius gas-electric hybrid and the Lexus brand and expanded production outside of Japan. He served until 1992 when his son Akio was named vice president of Toyota in 2005 becoming president in 2009. He is still at the helm today.

Despite being one of four players tied for the lead at the ATB Classic presented by Volvo Edmonton the 24-year-old from Mexico kept his eyes on the business at hand during third round play at the Edmonton Petroleum Golf and Country Club.

Adding to the degree of difficulty was Villar’s playing partners—Jonathan Hardee and Joe Highsmith—who also top the chart at 14-under. Danny Walker is the fourth of the quartet sharing lead after 54 holes at the second PGA TOUR Canada event of the young season.

“I tried to avoid looking at the leaderboards today” said Villar who joined Hardee and Highsmith in shooting 66s Saturday matching the tournament’s low score of the day. “We were on the clock for the last five holes so I didn’t have time to look at it.”

Good thing perhaps as it takes a little time to sort things out in the tightly contested tournament. Among the chasers there are plenty of players still in contention for top honors and the accompanying 500 Fortinet Cup points.

“The difference between first and fifth is so minimal” Hardee said. “But that’s why we work hard and that’s why we’re here.”

Birdies were in rich abundance for Hardee who made eight of them Saturday during sometimes rainy conditions. He also added three bogeys two of them coming on his back nine that prevented him from moving ahead outright.

Highsmith a PGA TOUR University graduate is taking full advantage of his first PGA TOUR Canada tournament. Highsmith made six birdies against one bogey. Walker produced a 68 on the strength of six birdies and three bogeys.

Challengers poised to battle the frontrunners included four players who are just one stroke back. The group includes local favorite Wil Bateman Jeffrey Kang and Trent Phillips at 13-under. Bateman clearly enjoys playing in his hometown. In 2019 at PGA TOUR Canada’s 1932byBateman Open he shot four consecutive sub-70 rounds on his way to a tie for 10th at Edmonton Country Club. Bateman shot a 3-under 68 Saturday at Edmonton Petroleum Golf and Country Club. He made a late bogey at No. 17 but had a nice finish birdieing the par-5 18th to close.

Phillips is another PGA TOUR U. product. He made in succession three of his six birdies on his front nine starting at No. 4 on his way to a 4-under 67. Canadian Jared du Toit and Americans Carter Jenkins Samuel Saunders and Dalton Ward follow at 12-under. Parker Coody (PGA TOUR U. as well) Chris Crisologo second-round leader Ian Holt Derek Oland and Rhett Rasmussen are next at 11-under.

Including Yi Cao Spencer Cross Kyler Dunkle and David Kim at 10-under there are 16 golfers within four shots of the lead.

Did you know China’s Yi Cao put himself in position to make a run at victory Sunday with his bogey-free 5-under 66 Saturday? Cao made three birdies on his opening nine and added two more on the back. He’s at 10-under for the tournament.

How the Canadians are faring

Wil Bateman and Jared du Toit continue to lead the Canadian contingent. Bateman is tied for fifth with du Toit tied for eighth. Chis Crisologo posted a 66 for the second straight round to keep making progress. He will enter the final round three behind the leaders.

Jorge Villar has quite a streak going. He’s not had a bogey in 45 consecutive holes. “I’m following my gameplan that I did on the practice rounds trying to keep the ball on the fairway and being aggressive just hitting the greens” Villar said. “I’ll have many opportunities to make birdies but I’m just letting it go.”

Trent Phillips a recently turned pro had two amateur victories in 2021. He won the collegiate Williams Cup by six strokes. His most-prestigious triumph happened one year ago Sunday when he won the Sunnehanna Amateur on Father’s Day taking down Ian Siebers by a stroke. In February Phillips who played collegiately at the University of Georgia and reached as high as No. 10 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking finished regulation at the Florida Gators Invitational tied with Ryan Hall and Andrew Kozan with Kozan winning the title in overtime.

Derek Oland is a Korn Ferry Tour member from Highlands Ranch Colorado. Unable to get in the field this week at the Wichita Open Benefitting KU Wichita Pediatrics in Kansas Oland is making his PGA TOUR Canada debut. He’s tied for 12th through 54 holes. Oland has only played one Korn Ferry Tour tournament this season missing the cut at the Veritex Bank Championship in Arlington Texas in April. Oland had an interesting two days at Texas Rangers Golf Club. He opened with a 5-over 76 then rebounded with a 63 only to miss the cut by two shots.

Canada’s Chris Crisologo tied for 10th in the Fortinet Cup standings after one tournament has had a solid start to his season. After shooting four par-or-better rounds to qualify at the Tour’s Qualifying Tournament in suburban Tacoma Washington in April Crisologo had three under-par rounds and a final-round even-par 70 at the season-opening Royal Beach Victoria Open. He’s been under-par in each of the first three rounds this week (70-66-66).

Through five holes of his third round former Clemson star Bryson Nimmer was 2-over with a pair of bogeys and three pars. He turned it on after that. Playing the Edmonton Petroleum Golf and Country Club’s back nine first he made four consecutive birdies starting at No. 16 then added additional birdies on Nos. 4 and 6 and on his closing hole No. 9. His 5-under 66 helped him improve 28 scoreboard positions into a tie for 21st heading into the final round.

Another big mover was Cameron Sisk who joined Nimmer in moving up 28 positions with a third-round score of 66. The former Arizona State Sun Devil tied eight others for the lowest round of the day. He’s now 9-under and in a tie for 21st place.

Once again inclement weather played a role in the day’s play. “The weather never really got warm. It’s nice now but early it was a little cooler a little more wind” said Trent Phillips. “There’s some tough flags. I think that all kind of factored in.”

Parker Coody joined PGA TOUR Canada two ways. He enjoyed a tie-for-sixth finish at the Dothan Alabama Qualifying Tournament in mid-March to ensure he had a place to play this summer. The former Texas Longhorn then finished 13th in the final PGA TOUR University rankings. His twin brother Pierceson was the No. 1-ranked player on the PGA TOUR U. standings and is currently on the Korn Ferry Tour. While Parker is tied for 12th in Edmonton Pierceson is tied for 10th at the Korn Ferry Tour’s Wichita Open Benefitting KU Wichita Pediatrics. He is seven shots behind 54-hole leader Norman Xiong.

The Players say…

In recent years many companies have turned to M&A to address different goals over both short and extended time horizons. Goals have included moving closer to customers leaving challenged sectors and speeding up digital transformation. Whatever the objective the market can be impatient and one of the fastest ways to accelerate transformation is through M&A.

Not every business opts to transform through an outright acquisition. Some prefer to strike a joint venture or to divest a business unit instead.



Joint ventures can be attractive alternatives because they remove the pressure that most public companies face in making deals work on a cost/synergy basis. Many JVs take a page from private equity firms which look ahead to an exit strategy of assuming control or spinning off the unit within a few years.



Divestitures can help executives focus their attention and resources on more profitable units. They also allow companies to group together business units that share similar growth stories. And they can generate capital that can then be redeployed into the core business.



Recent high-profile examples of transformative M&A deals include:

His name was Roland R. Conklin — and he was a visionary in the early days of the automobile. He put all the comforts of home on wheels — and in dramatic style.

Conklin introduced in 1915 the first full-scale motor home dubbed the ""Gypsy Van."" He then led a crew of eight on a spirited cross-country tour aboard the tricked-out Packard pick-up truck from Huntington Long Island to the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco.

The trip took two months a testament to the poor quality of American roads at the time.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO CREATED THE ‘CLEAN WHOLESOME’ CORN DOG

The stunning vehicle featured room for 17 passengers. It had electricity cold drinking water incandescent lights bath shower stove pantry phonograph book case closets and roof deck among other luxuries.

""This transport was a marvel of technology and chutzpah"" Smithsonian Magazine enthused.

Millionaire industrialists Thomas Edison Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford at the same time ventured on high-profile road trips across America generating national headlines for their celebrity glam camping — helping to popularize Model Ts and rubber tires along the way.

""Each year the announcement of their latest summer excursion sparked endless speculation about where they might venture next"" wrote author Jeff Guinn in his 2019 book ""The Vagabonds: The Story of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison’s Ten-Year Road Trip.""

Ford and friends traveled in a fleet of luxury cars.

But neither Ford nor Firestone names synonymous with the American auto industry had the foresight to put a home on wheels and hit the road.

American cultural phenomenon

Conklin was a New York City financier real estate mogul and early auto enthusiast.

""This transport was a marvel of technology and chutzpah.""

His Gypsy Van ""gave the upper class a play home that combined some of the appeal of a yacht or a private railroad car with the flexibility of the automobile"" American Heritage magazine reported in 1985.

Conklin created more than just a new set of wheels. He inspired a largely American cultural phenomenon.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED LIGHT BEER

Today the recreational vehicle (RV) industry is set to produce nearly 550000 vehicles in 2022 according to GoRVing.com.

Meanwhile 11.2 million households — nearly 10 percent of all U.S. homes — own an RV. Roughly 400000 Americans live full time in an RV according to the RV Industry Association in Reston Va.

The U.S. accounts for more than half the global RV market said Darryl Searer president of the RV/MH Hall of Fame in Elkhart Ind. GoRVing even put the figure at 60 percent.

""I don’t think [Conklin] realized that he was unlocking America for so many people"" former NFL star Keith Sims told Fox News Digital.

The Georgia resident purchased a motor home in 2015 and has spent as many as 100 days a year since then traveling the road with his wife Tia and homeschooling their three boys KJ 13 Jayson 11 and Justin 10.

""When you fly from point to point"" he said ""you miss all the amazing stuff in between.""

Two months across America

The man who put the luxury home on wheels Roland R. Conklin (1858-1938) was born in Urbana Ill. He attended the University of Illinois and appeared to be a skillful business opportunist.

He launched his real estate career in Kansas City with his older brother Stanley and his business partner Samuel Jarvis forming the Jarvis-Conklin Mortgage & Trust Co. in the 1880s.

Conklin helped build Cuba's transportation network after the U.S. victory in the Spanish-American War.

The Conklins moved their offices in the early 1890s to 40 Wall St. in New York City now the site of the downtown Manhattan Trump Building.

There ""Roland R. Conklin became interested in the automobile and became an active member of the Automobile Club of America"" reported Coachbuilt a trade publication that calls itself ""the encyclopedia of coachbuilders and coachbuilding.""

BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO RV TRAILERS

His company was wiped out by the Panic of 1893 but it reorganized as the North American Trust Co. according to the National Cyclopaedia of American Biography.

Good fortune soon followed: ""In 1898 this company was appointed fiscal agent for the U. S. government in Cuba being the first American company to begin business on that island after the war with Spain."" Conklin's company helped build Cuba's transportation infrastructure.

He then created the Roland Gas-Electric Vehicle Corp. in 1913 to capitalize on America's growing obsession with the automobile.

The drudgery that Conklin's team and only a select few others ever experienced changed the course of American transportation.

The New York-to-California trip which took Conklin two months is now covered by commercial airliner in less than six hours. The drudgery that his team and only a select few others ever experienced changed the course of American transportation.

Young Army officer Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a similarly difficult ordeal four years later. He embarked on a trip from Maryland to California with an Army convoy in 1919. The excursion took 62 days.

The Lincoln Highway in Utah proved ""one succession of dust ruts pits and holes"" Eisenhower wrote.

The dreadful journey on wheels across the American continent as a young man contrasted sharply with the awe General Eisenhower felt at the magnificent German autobahn during the defeat of the Nazis in 1945. The Allies turned the highways against the Germans late in the war quickly flooding the fatherland with men and equipment.

His experiences as both a junior and senior officer inspired President Eisenhower in the 1950s to create the Interstate Highway System which now bears his name.

Wide paved and limited access highways soon made every state in the lower 48 accessible to the average American family. The motor home pioneered by Conklin had found its medium.

‘Tin Can Tourists’

All motor homes are recreational vehicles. But not all RVs are motor homes.

Recreational vehicles in industry parlance also include towed trailers which pre-date Conklin’s Gypsy Van motor home by at least a couple of years. The vast majority of RVs today are towed.

The Pierce-Arrow Touring Landau which debuted at Madison Square Garden in 1910 kicked off the RV industry. But it looked like little more than an SUV by today's standards — while ""the 1915 Gypsy Van is the first full-sized RV"" claimed MotorBiscuit.com a sentiment shared with other industry sources.

The Earl Travel Trailer dates from 1913 and is on display at the RV/MH Hall of Fame in Indiana. It's ""believed to be the oldest non-tent travel trailer in existence.""

""As soon as motorized cars came along people found ways to bring the comforts of home with them.""

""The Conestoga was the first RV"" joked GoRVing executive Karen Redfern noting that the horse-drawn wagons that settled the west essentially transported entire homes.

""But as soon as motorized cars came along people found ways to bring the comforts of home with them.""

Conklin’s Gypsy Van elevated the activity to a new level of leisure. It helped turn road-tripping a hobby for the elite into something more mainstream.

""The Tin Can Tourists named because they heated tin cans of food on gasoline stoves by the roadside formed the first camping club in the United States holding their inaugural rally in Florida in 1919 and growing to 150000 members by the mid-1930s"" Smithsonian reported in 2010 in its 100-year retrospective of the RV industry.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO GAVE US THE DONUT

Hallmarks of American culture such as college football reflect the same passion with the motor home and RV today.

The sea of RVs at Penn State University on game day to cite one example appears to stretch out beyond eyesight over the undulations of the rural hills that surround its 107000-seat pigskin palace Beaver Stadium.

The arena's motor home lot is so large it’s known as RV City on Google Maps. Its roads have their own unique grid-street designations. Tailgaters in RV City might park their vehicle at the intersection of RV West 3rd Avenue and RV Main Street for example.

The COVID-19 pandemic only fueled America’s fever for the open road said Redfern.

RV shipments skyrocketed during the crisis from 406000 in the pre-pandemic year of 2019 to a record 600000 during the height of the scare in 2021 a spectacular increase of 48 percent in just two years. The average age of a first-time buyer dropped by a decade to 33 years old.

""Being outdoors in a controlled environment with your family seemed like the safest place to be"" said Redfern of GoRVing.

The shocking rise in gas prices over the past year has failed to dampen America’s enthusiasm for taking their homes on the road say industry experts. But it has changed habits.

The RV community notably is staying closer to home the Sims family among them.

""The road is in my DNA."" — RV enthusiast John Ratzenberger

""Instead of driving somewhere like South Dakota we’re driving around Georgia"" said Sims the former Miami Dolphins Pro Bowl performer.

His boys were wowed by a recent trip to Georgia's stunning Providence Canyon State Park dubbed ""The Little Grand Canyon"" for its deep natural ravines.

Actor John Ratzenberger mailman Cliff Clavin of the classic sitcom ""Cheers"" — and more recently the memorable voice in nearly two dozen Pixar films — is among the nation’s most notable celebrity RV enthusiasts.

""The road is in my DNA"" Ratzenberger told Fox News Digital noting that his father was a truck driver for 36 years and that his children Jim and Nina spent much of their lives exploring the country with dad’s RV trailer in tow.

""They’re no strangers to truck stops"" the actor quipped.

Ratzenberger said he often hits the road to answer fan mail in person knocking on doors across the country. He and son Jim showed up unexpectedly at one man’s door and ended up helping him install new kitchen cabinets.

""We just have fun on the road seeing what happens"" Ratzenberger said

Conklin’s end of the road

Roland Ray Conklin the man who first conceived of America’s home on the road died of pneumonia at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan in 1938. He was 79 years old. He is buried at Huntington Rural Cemetery on Long Island.

""Was a motor bus advocate"" declared a headline in The New York Times obituary of him.

The article noted that ""he had not been active in business"" since 1922.

Conklin sold his motorbus company in 1921 to ""Chicago taxicab king"" John D. Hertz according to Coachbuilt.com.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO HONORS THE MEMORY OF 200000 FALLEN WAR HEROES

Yes that would be the namesake of modern rental car giant Hertz. The windfall from the deal apparently afforded Conklin the luxury of retirement at age 63.

His iconic contribution to American culture was lavished as the ""Motor Land Yacht"" in his obituary.

The Lost vet — who has not acted in nearly a decade — broke his silence over the weekend about his decision to leave showbiz. Fox also revealed why he recently decided to hit pause on his retirement to star in Peacock’s upcoming apocalyptic drama series Last Light.

More from TVLine

“I kind of had a bucket list in my mind of things that I wanted to accomplish in the business and after I did [the movie] Bone Tomahawk in 2014 that had kind of completed the bucket list” he told reporters (per Variety) Saturday at the Monte-Carlo Film Festival where Last Light had its world premiere. “I wanted to do a Western. It’s a very odd Western but it’s a Western. And so that sort of completed the bucket list.”

Another factor Fox said was family. “At that time in my life our kids were at an age where I felt like I needed to really reengage” he explained of his two children with wife Margherita Ronchi. “I had been focused on work for some time and [my wife] Margherita had been running the family so beautifully but I felt like it was time to be home and I really felt like I was retiring from the business and working on other creative elements that are really personal to me — some music and writing.”

Last Light which co-stars Downton Abbey‘s Joanne Froggatt brings Fox — who also serves as an EP on the series — back to TV for the first time since Lost ended in 2010. The thriller imagines a world plunged into crisis when oil suppliers are jeopardized. A Peacock premiere date is TBD.

“I kind of got to a point where I thought that maybe the bucket list included executive producing” he said of being lured back to acting. “I’d never done that before. The opportunity to be involved in Last Light came along and so I wanted to give it a shot. And it felt like the right time.”

Fox’s retirement also came amid a turbulent time in his personal life. In 2011 he was accused of assaulting a female bus driver in Cleveland Ohio. He denied the allegations and prosecutors ultimately opted not to charge him. A subsequent civil suit filed was withdrawn by the bus driver. Fox’s Lost co-star Dominic Monaghan added fuel to the fire tweeting in May 2012 that Fox “beats women. Not isolated incidents. Often.”

In an October 2012 interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Fox acknowledged that “it’s been a very tough year for me and my family” adding “It’s difficult to be accused of something you did not do.”

Public reputation is essential for any big business. It takes years of hard work and good decision making for a business to build a positive reputation. But only one mistake can tarnish that perception forever. The company with the worst reputation in America is The Trump Organization.

Some of the most well-known businesses in America have learned of the importance of reputation the hard way. Several major multi-billion dollar brands are largely disliked by Americans for a number of different reasons including producing lackluster or harmful products having poor customer services or being involved in high-profile scandals.

To determine the companies with the worst reputations in America 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 2022 Axios Harris Poll 100 reputation rankings. The report used a 2022 poll of over 33000 Americans to determine the 100 most well-known companies. Respondents scored companies on an index of several key factors including trust ethics products/service and culture.

Many of the companies with the worst reputations operate in a handful of industries that share the same issue. For example several tech companies have been embroiled in major controversies about misinformation and an overall negative impact on users’ mental health. For some companies some of these issues became so significant they chose to rebrand. These are the companies that changed their names after scandals.

The list of the best-known companies with the worst reputations also features several cable and internet providers an industry that regularly has the lowest customer satisfaction scores as a whole. Several oil and gas exploration companies with high-profile oil spills are featured on the list as well as are several fast food establishments.

Other seemingly unrelated businesses also feature on the list because of their political affiliations. Several businesses that are regularly in the news for their conservative political slant connections or donations feature on this list with among the worst scores for trust and ethics according to Axios-Harris Poll respondents. These are the companies bankrolling members of congress who didn’t certify the election.

The railroad said the problem was the result of an illegal job action by the union representing locomotive engineers.

The engineers don't currently have a collective bargaining agreement.

NJ Transit said the number of engineers who called out on Friday was triple the average number for a weekday.

""We intend to explore all legal remedies in response to this illegal and irresponsible action.""

In a tweet on Saturday morning NJ Transit said it expected engineers to return to work and for the railroad to resume service.

In recent years many companies have turned to M&A to address different goals over both short and extended time horizons. Goals have included moving closer to customers leaving challenged sectors and speeding up digital transformation. Whatever the objective the market can be impatient and one of the fastest ways to accelerate transformation is through M&A.

Not every business opts to transform through an outright acquisition. Some prefer to strike a joint venture or to divest a business unit instead.



Joint ventures can be attractive alternatives because they remove the pressure that most public companies face in making deals work on a cost/synergy basis. Many JVs take a page from private equity firms which look ahead to an exit strategy of assuming control or spinning off the unit within a few years.



Divestitures can help executives focus their attention and resources on more profitable units. They also allow companies to group together business units that share similar growth stories. And they can generate capital that can then be redeployed into the core business.



Recent high-profile examples of transformative M&A deals include:

His name was Roland R. Conklin — and he was a visionary in the early days of the automobile. He put all the comforts of home on wheels — and in dramatic style.

Conklin introduced in 1915 the first full-scale motor home dubbed the ""Gypsy Van."" He then led a crew of eight on a spirited cross-country tour aboard the tricked-out Packard pick-up truck from Huntington Long Island to the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco.

The trip took two months a testament to the poor quality of American roads at the time.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO CREATED THE ‘CLEAN WHOLESOME’ CORN DOG

The stunning vehicle featured room for 17 passengers. It had electricity cold drinking water incandescent lights bath shower stove pantry phonograph book case closets and roof deck among other luxuries.

""This transport was a marvel of technology and chutzpah"" Smithsonian Magazine enthused.

Millionaire industrialists Thomas Edison Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford at the same time ventured on high-profile road trips across America generating national headlines for their celebrity glam camping — helping to popularize Model Ts and rubber tires along the way.

""Each year the announcement of their latest summer excursion sparked endless speculation about where they might venture next"" wrote author Jeff Guinn in his 2019 book ""The Vagabonds: The Story of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison’s Ten-Year Road Trip.""

Ford and friends traveled in a fleet of luxury cars.

But neither Ford nor Firestone names synonymous with the American auto industry had the foresight to put a home on wheels and hit the road.

American cultural phenomenon

Conklin was a New York City financier real estate mogul and early auto enthusiast.

""This transport was a marvel of technology and chutzpah.""

His Gypsy Van ""gave the upper class a play home that combined some of the appeal of a yacht or a private railroad car with the flexibility of the automobile"" American Heritage magazine reported in 1985.

Conklin created more than just a new set of wheels. He inspired a largely American cultural phenomenon.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED LIGHT BEER

Today the recreational vehicle (RV) industry is set to produce nearly 550000 vehicles in 2022 according to GoRVing.com.

Meanwhile 11.2 million households — nearly 10 percent of all U.S. homes — own an RV. Roughly 400000 Americans live full time in an RV according to the RV Industry Association in Reston Va.

The U.S. accounts for more than half the global RV market said Darryl Searer president of the RV/MH Hall of Fame in Elkhart Ind. GoRVing even put the figure at 60 percent.

""I don’t think [Conklin] realized that he was unlocking America for so many people"" former NFL star Keith Sims told Fox News Digital.

The Georgia resident purchased a motor home in 2015 and has spent as many as 100 days a year since then traveling the road with his wife Tia and homeschooling their three boys KJ 13 Jayson 11 and Justin 10.

""When you fly from point to point"" he said ""you miss all the amazing stuff in between.""

Two months across America

The man who put the luxury home on wheels Roland R. Conklin (1858-1938) was born in Urbana Ill. He attended the University of Illinois and appeared to be a skillful business opportunist.

He launched his real estate career in Kansas City with his older brother Stanley and his business partner Samuel Jarvis forming the Jarvis-Conklin Mortgage & Trust Co. in the 1880s.

Conklin helped build Cuba's transportation network after the U.S. victory in the Spanish-American War.

The Conklins moved their offices in the early 1890s to 40 Wall St. in New York City now the site of the downtown Manhattan Trump Building.

There ""Roland R. Conklin became interested in the automobile and became an active member of the Automobile Club of America"" reported Coachbuilt a trade publication that calls itself ""the encyclopedia of coachbuilders and coachbuilding.""

BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO RV TRAILERS

His company was wiped out by the Panic of 1893 but it reorganized as the North American Trust Co. according to the National Cyclopaedia of American Biography.

Good fortune soon followed: ""In 1898 this company was appointed fiscal agent for the U. S. government in Cuba being the first American company to begin business on that island after the war with Spain."" Conklin's company helped build Cuba's transportation infrastructure.

He then created the Roland Gas-Electric Vehicle Corp. in 1913 to capitalize on America's growing obsession with the automobile.

The drudgery that Conklin's team and only a select few others ever experienced changed the course of American transportation.

The New York-to-California trip which took Conklin two months is now covered by commercial airliner in less than six hours. The drudgery that his team and only a select few others ever experienced changed the course of American transportation.

Young Army officer Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a similarly difficult ordeal four years later. He embarked on a trip from Maryland to California with an Army convoy in 1919. The excursion took 62 days.

The Lincoln Highway in Utah proved ""one succession of dust ruts pits and holes"" Eisenhower wrote.

The dreadful journey on wheels across the American continent as a young man contrasted sharply with the awe General Eisenhower felt at the magnificent German autobahn during the defeat of the Nazis in 1945. The Allies turned the highways against the Germans late in the war quickly flooding the fatherland with men and equipment.

His experiences as both a junior and senior officer inspired President Eisenhower in the 1950s to create the Interstate Highway System which now bears his name.

Wide paved and limited access highways soon made every state in the lower 48 accessible to the average American family. The motor home pioneered by Conklin had found its medium.

‘Tin Can Tourists’

All motor homes are recreational vehicles. But not all RVs are motor homes.

Recreational vehicles in industry parlance also include towed trailers which pre-date Conklin’s Gypsy Van motor home by at least a couple of years. The vast majority of RVs today are towed.

The Pierce-Arrow Touring Landau which debuted at Madison Square Garden in 1910 kicked off the RV industry. But it looked like little more than an SUV by today's standards — while ""the 1915 Gypsy Van is the first full-sized RV"" claimed MotorBiscuit.com a sentiment shared with other industry sources.

The Earl Travel Trailer dates from 1913 and is on display at the RV/MH Hall of Fame in Indiana. It's ""believed to be the oldest non-tent travel trailer in existence.""

""As soon as motorized cars came along people found ways to bring the comforts of home with them.""

""The Conestoga was the first RV"" joked GoRVing executive Karen Redfern noting that the horse-drawn wagons that settled the west essentially transported entire homes.

""But as soon as motorized cars came along people found ways to bring the comforts of home with them.""

Conklin’s Gypsy Van elevated the activity to a new level of leisure. It helped turn road-tripping a hobby for the elite into something more mainstream.

""The Tin Can Tourists named because they heated tin cans of food on gasoline stoves by the roadside formed the first camping club in the United States holding their inaugural rally in Florida in 1919 and growing to 150000 members by the mid-1930s"" Smithsonian reported in 2010 in its 100-year retrospective of the RV industry.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO GAVE US THE DONUT

Hallmarks of American culture such as college football reflect the same passion with the motor home and RV today.

The sea of RVs at Penn State University on game day to cite one example appears to stretch out beyond eyesight over the undulations of the rural hills that surround its 107000-seat pigskin palace Beaver Stadium.

The arena's motor home lot is so large it’s known as RV City on Google Maps. Its roads have their own unique grid-street designations. Tailgaters in RV City might park their vehicle at the intersection of RV West 3rd Avenue and RV Main Street for example.

The COVID-19 pandemic only fueled America’s fever for the open road said Redfern.

RV shipments skyrocketed during the crisis from 406000 in the pre-pandemic year of 2019 to a record 600000 during the height of the scare in 2021 a spectacular increase of 48 percent in just two years. The average age of a first-time buyer dropped by a decade to 33 years old.

""Being outdoors in a controlled environment with your family seemed like the safest place to be"" said Redfern of GoRVing.

The shocking rise in gas prices over the past year has failed to dampen America’s enthusiasm for taking their homes on the road say industry experts. But it has changed habits.

The RV community notably is staying closer to home the Sims family among them.

""The road is in my DNA."" — RV enthusiast John Ratzenberger

""Instead of driving somewhere like South Dakota we’re driving around Georgia"" said Sims the former Miami Dolphins Pro Bowl performer.

His boys were wowed by a recent trip to Georgia's stunning Providence Canyon State Park dubbed ""The Little Grand Canyon"" for its deep natural ravines.

Actor John Ratzenberger mailman Cliff Clavin of the classic sitcom ""Cheers"" — and more recently the memorable voice in nearly two dozen Pixar films — is among the nation’s most notable celebrity RV enthusiasts.

""The road is in my DNA"" Ratzenberger told Fox News Digital noting that his father was a truck driver for 36 years and that his children Jim and Nina spent much of their lives exploring the country with dad’s RV trailer in tow.

""They’re no strangers to truck stops"" the actor quipped.

Ratzenberger said he often hits the road to answer fan mail in person knocking on doors across the country. He and son Jim showed up unexpectedly at one man’s door and ended up helping him install new kitchen cabinets.

""We just have fun on the road seeing what happens"" Ratzenberger said

Conklin’s end of the road

Roland Ray Conklin the man who first conceived of America’s home on the road died of pneumonia at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan in 1938. He was 79 years old. He is buried at Huntington Rural Cemetery on Long Island.

""Was a motor bus advocate"" declared a headline in The New York Times obituary of him.

The article noted that ""he had not been active in business"" since 1922.

Conklin sold his motorbus company in 1921 to ""Chicago taxicab king"" John D. Hertz according to Coachbuilt.com.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO HONORS THE MEMORY OF 200000 FALLEN WAR HEROES

Yes that would be the namesake of modern rental car giant Hertz. The windfall from the deal apparently afforded Conklin the luxury of retirement at age 63.

His iconic contribution to American culture was lavished as the ""Motor Land Yacht"" in his obituary.

The Lost vet — who has not acted in nearly a decade — broke his silence over the weekend about his decision to leave showbiz. Fox also revealed why he recently decided to hit pause on his retirement to star in Peacock’s upcoming apocalyptic drama series Last Light.

More from TVLine

“I kind of had a bucket list in my mind of things that I wanted to accomplish in the business and after I did [the movie] Bone Tomahawk in 2014 that had kind of completed the bucket list” he told reporters (per Variety) Saturday at the Monte-Carlo Film Festival where Last Light had its world premiere. “I wanted to do a Western. It’s a very odd Western but it’s a Western. And so that sort of completed the bucket list.”

Another factor Fox said was family. “At that time in my life our kids were at an age where I felt like I needed to really reengage” he explained of his two children with wife Margherita Ronchi. “I had been focused on work for some time and [my wife] Margherita had been running the family so beautifully but I felt like it was time to be home and I really felt like I was retiring from the business and working on other creative elements that are really personal to me — some music and writing.”

Last Light which co-stars Downton Abbey‘s Joanne Froggatt brings Fox — who also serves as an EP on the series — back to TV for the first time since Lost ended in 2010. The thriller imagines a world plunged into crisis when oil suppliers are jeopardized. A Peacock premiere date is TBD.

“I kind of got to a point where I thought that maybe the bucket list included executive producing” he said of being lured back to acting. “I’d never done that before. The opportunity to be involved in Last Light came along and so I wanted to give it a shot. And it felt like the right time.”

Fox’s retirement also came amid a turbulent time in his personal life. In 2011 he was accused of assaulting a female bus driver in Cleveland Ohio. He denied the allegations and prosecutors ultimately opted not to charge him. A subsequent civil suit filed was withdrawn by the bus driver. Fox’s Lost co-star Dominic Monaghan added fuel to the fire tweeting in May 2012 that Fox “beats women. Not isolated incidents. Often.”

In an October 2012 interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Fox acknowledged that “it’s been a very tough year for me and my family” adding “It’s difficult to be accused of something you did not do.”

The railroad said the problem was the result of an illegal job action by the union representing locomotive engineers.

The engineers don't currently have a collective bargaining agreement.

NJ Transit said the number of engineers who called out on Friday was triple the average number for a weekday.

""We intend to explore all legal remedies in response to this illegal and irresponsible action.""

In a tweet on Saturday morning NJ Transit said it expected engineers to return to work and for the railroad to resume service.

Last month Franklin Templeton agreed to buy Alcentra one of Europe’s largest credit managers from BNY Mellon for up to $700mn. The deal marked the latest in a string of acquisitions in one of the hottest areas of the asset management industry: private assets.

Traditional asset management groups have been racing to expand their offerings in these alternative investments — a broad spectrum that includes private equity private debt infrastructure real estate venture capital growth capital and natural resources.

For the fund managers private assets are appealing because they typically command higher fees and lock up investors’ capital for several years. But robust client demand is also a tailwind as investors seek to juice up their returns and diversify away from their core holdings in equities and bonds now that the 60/40 balanced approach — previously a mainstay of investment portfolios — is facing some serious strain.

Amid a similar trend sweeping across the US European groups including Amundi Schroders Fidelity International Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management and Abrdn have flagged private assets as a key area for expansion. They are turning to acquisitions and aggressively hiring resulting in a fierce talent war between mainstream asset managers alternatives specialists and pension funds that are trying to build expertise in-house.

The business case for the traditional houses is clear: they need to boost profitability and tap into new avenues of growth at a time when cheaper exchange traded funds are taking market share and a downward pressure on fees is eating into their margins.

$18tn-$30tn Estimated size of private capital industry by 2026 up from $10tn in 2021

“Private assets are an area of high client demand” says Georg Wunderlin. global head of private assets at Schroders which last year bought a 75 per cent stake in renewable energy specialist Greencoat for £358mn and vowed to double the size of Schroders Capital its private capital business to £86bn by the end of 2025. “It’s important in terms of asset allocation. Alternatives have stopped being alternative — they are core for our clients.”

Data provider Preqin predicts that the overall size of the private capital industry will grow from over $10tn last year to almost $18tn by 2026. Goldman Sachs forecasts that it could even grow to as much as $30tn by then noting that the retail and wealth markets are key areas where fund managers could make inroads with private capital strategies.

For example Fidelity International bought a minority stake in Moonfare a digital investment platform for high quality private markets funds and has signed a distribution partnership to allow banks family offices and their advisers to access private markets funds on behalf of their clients.

On the institutional side these strategies are well-suited to customisation for clients — such as liability matching or targeting non-financial goals for an investment like social impact.

The opportunity set of potential investments within private capital has surged over the past decade or so.

Since the financial crisis there has been a structural shift in how the economy is financing itself. “Large parts of the economy are now financed by the balance sheets of asset managers and private equity in a way that used to be financed by the banks” says David Hunt chief executive of investment management business PGIM. “This has resulted in huge opportunities in private assets for investment managers.”

Meanwhile companies are staying private for longer and the war in Ukraine has accelerated the urgency for the renewable energy transition with huge opportunities for private capital to step in and help finance the shift.

Fund managers are also touting some private assets strategies as a hedge against rising inflation. “With inflation becoming a theme again these strategies keep their pricing power” says Christophe Caspar chief executive officer Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. He pointed to real estate debt strategies that can increase their rents to keep up with rising interest rates or infrastructure debt funds where a part of the debt is linked to inflation offering some protection for investors.

But sceptics caution that the push by mainstream asset managers into private assets is fraught with potential challenges.

It puts them into competition with private equity groups such as KKR Blackstone and Apollo which have long track records after building up vast diversified businesses over decades. In a gold rush to make inroads in private assets valuations have surged and traditional groups risk overpaying for deals or talent.

“We’re entering a stage where valuations and activity levels have been high” says Andrew McCaffery global chief investment officer at Fidelity International which entered the private credit market last year and has been expanding the team. “This is more of a challenging world.”

Others point out that culturally mainstream asset managers are very different to private capital businesses with different pay structures timeframes and decision-making processes.

“Private assets are much less liquid and so if you buy badly you’re stuck with bad investments for much longer” says Julia Hobart a partner at consultant Oliver Wyman in London. “The ramifications of getting it wrong are much higher.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL25ld3MuYml0Y29pbi5jb20vMTAway1idGMtcHJlZGljdGlvbnMtcGV0ZXItc2NoaWZmLW9uLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1hbmQtYml0Y29pbi1iaWxsLWdhdGVzLXNsYW1zLW5mdHMtYml0Y29pbi1jb20tbmV3cy13ZWVrLWluLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$100K BTC Predictions Peter Schiff on Recession and Bitcoin Bill Gates Slams NFTs — Bitcoin.com News Week in ...,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS90ZXNsYS1jZW8tZWxvbi1tdXNrLWNvbmZpcm1zLWhlbGwta2VlcC1idXlpbmctYW5kLXN1cHBvcnRpbmctZG9nZWNvaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla CEO Elon Musk Confirms He'll Keep Buying and Supporting Dogecoin – Altcoins Bitcoin News,,,,,,,

So Garmin Did. (Corrected),"In the world of mass production things 25000 is not a very big number. It’s about an hour’s worth of iPhone production and an eyeblink in the trillions of metal oxide transistors that make gadgets like that possible. Ford makes that many F-150s in about 10 days and Tesla does a few more than that of its popular electric cars. But in the still pond of aviation where we’re just barely past bashing airplanes together with rubber hammers and pry bars 25000 is a stupendously huge number.

So it was altogether fitting that Garmin last week announced it has delivered 25000 integrated flight decks which if laid end to end would easily reach across town to where BendixKing used to have its headquarters. I just made that up but it seems plausible and even if it isn’t that’s a lot of avionics over 19 years and it doesn’t include the mega-selling GNS boxes. “Integrated” means the G1000 and its evolutionary progeny the G3000 and G5000 which increasingly find their way into turboprops and bizjets. They don’t quite own the latter market but you can imagine them getting there.

I have had the good fortune of watching all this unfold in real time over the past … let’s see 30 years. By tech standards that is a glacial pace when you consider that when Garmin was founded in 1989 Windows 3 had just arrived and the Intel 80386 chip was the hot system to run it. The Macintosh classic with its single clunky disc drive0 was the competition. What cellphone did you have then? You didn’t. They were a few years over the horizon.

There are several remarkable aspects of this story but the defining one—it’s really more of a question—is why so few companies emerged to persistently compete with Garmin. BendixKing was ideally positioned not to be overrun by an upstart. In 1990 it dominated the OEM market with the Silver Crown system. You expected to see it in new aircraft and buyers perusing used aircraft ads in Trade-A-Plane breezed past offerings if they didn’t mention Silver Crown. Garmin’s capture of the market was gradual and it started with portable GPS.

Gary Burrell had been an engineer at King Radio and before that at Allied Signal and along with Taiwanese-born Min Kao he launched Garmin in 1989. Kao was an expert in the Kalman filtering technology that makes modern accurate GPS navigation possible. The inaugural product was the ProNav 100 with ProNav being the original name of the company. Because of trademark issues they changed it to Garmin a portmanteau of their first names. The product became the GPS 100. I still have mine. It’s a brick with sentimental value.

For a time there in the mid-1990s it looked like GPS would be a vital and highly competitive market. It was the golden age of the GPS portable. In a 1996 report I wrote this: “Although glutted and confusing one thing is certain about the portable GPS market: If you don’t like the current models wait around a couple of weeks something else will come along shortly. With any luck it might even better or at least cheaper than the current crop.” Besides Garmin Lowrance IIMorrow Magellan and Trimble were all flogging GPS although Garmin always seemed to be a step ahead.

When panel mount GPS came into view around 1994 Garmin still had competition from IIMorrow Northstar BendixKing Trimble and Magellan. Remember Narco? Of course you don’t but it was out there pitching a panel mount called the StarNav and even pre-dated Garmin’s entry into the market with the GNS line. From out of the blue a GPS survey company called Ashtech popped up with a stunning color navigator called the AV-12. That was in 1995 three years before Garmin introduced the GNS 430 and later the 530. Avidyne beat Garmin to the market with big glass in the Cirrus and so did ARNAV which pioneered the first large moving map display in the original SR20. Although it was crude by modern standards it was out there first. ARNAV is gone but Avidyne still represents credible competition for Garmin at least in the aftermarket.

Yet on its way to multiple thousands of integrated panels not to mention many multiple thousands of discrete panel navigators indicators and lately electronic flight instruments Garmin steamrolled over the lot of them sometimes with products not necessarily better than the competition. For a time during the 1990s I taught a traveling GPS training show for AOPA and my favorite easiest-to-teach box was the Trimble TNL 2000. It was easier to use than Garmin’s GPS 155.

So why did Garmin succeed so brilliantly where the others stumbled? In my view several reasons all wrapped up in one word: will. Garmin always had a single-minded focus on new product introductions. Trimble did two dedicated portables IIMorrow (later UPSAT) did a couple as did Magellan. Lowrance was more prolific but none of them managed either the cadence of introductions or the features Garmin rolled out in no fewer than 15 portables. When the first color portables appeared from Garmin in 2004 it was pretty much game over for the rest.

From the beginning Garmin was a technical/engineering-focused company always on the hunt for young talent. I forget who told me this—might have been someone at Garmin—but the company was famous for hiring “20-20s.” Engineers who were 20-something years old at $20000-something a year. Whether that’s true or not–Garmin’s Carly Hysell says it isn’t–that was the buzz then and it explained why Garmin always had technical projects simmering while BendixKing never seemed to. When Garmin arrived with portables capable enough to display real time aircraft attitude it was a tour de force no other company matched and it wouldn’t be matched until iPads starting using inexpensive portable AHRS.

Garmin has been relentless in its marketing with persistent in-house prepared promotion and customer and technical support and a laser-like focus on the OEM business. That explains why the vast majority of new aircraft are equipped with Garmin glass. Don’t want a full-blown G1000? OK fine how about a G3X Touch then? Still too much? Whatsamatter with the aera 760 or GI 275 gyros with GTN navigators? You simply can’t escape a Garmin solution that works. As one of their salespeople told me once “We won’t stop until we get all of your money.” Grim truth maybe but of such stuff is success made.

Garmin also did something wise about diversification. Trimble and Ashtech for instance were GPS survey companies and they diversified—halfheartedly—into aviation which was already well served and a small market. Garmin went the other way leveraging its aviation-derived expertise into the marine outdoor and fitness segments the latter two of which were driven by an energetic demographic bubble. It paid off. According to Garmin’s annual report aviation accounts for $712 million of its $4.9 billion revenues with a profit of $192 million. Not too long ago aviation had the highest percentage profit margin but now the outdoor market at nearly twice the revenue of aviation shows a higher margin at least for 2021. I don’t know if these are standalone business units responsible for their own internal capital but if you’re trying to develop new products it’s much better to be in a highly profitable company than in one that isn’t.

The first time I visited Garmin maybe around 1991 or 1992 the company was housed in one of those office strips of the sort small medical practices have. Now Garmin HQ is two feet short of being the tallest skyscraper in Olathe Kansas. I’m pretty sure if you stacked up a few days worth of G1000 production you could easily reach the top.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY2tldC1saW50LmNvbS9maXRuZXNzLXRyYWNrZXJzL2J1eWVycy1ndWlkZXMvZ2FybWluLzE1NDU2OC1iZXN0LWdhcm1pbi1lZGdlLWJpa2UtY29tcHV0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Garmin Edge bike computer: All the models compared,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY2tldC1saW50LmNvbS9maXRuZXNzLXRyYWNrZXJzL2J1eWVycy1ndWlkZXMvZ2FybWluLzE1NDU2OC1iZXN0LWdhcm1pbi1lZGdlLWJpa2UtY29tcHV0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5leHRwaXQuY29tL2dhcm1pbi12ZW51LXNxLTItc21hcnR3YXRjaC1ncHMtbGF1bmNoLWJhdHRlcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin to launch Venu Sq 2 smartwatch with improved battery life,"It doesn't look like Garmin will stop releasing smartwatches any time soon. This week an FCC filing was spotted detailing the unannounced Venu Sq 2. The upcoming GPS smartwatch is a follow-up to Venu Sq launched in Q3 2020 with a square display. Seemingly the new smartwatch could bring better battery life like the Garmin Forerunner 255 and 955 Solar .

TL;DR

Garmin is close to launching the Venu Sq 2 smartwatch.

The Venu Sq 2 with GPS is spotted with a slightly larger battery.

Venu Sq 2 could be introduced along with Vivomove Trend later this year.

Square display and minor battery improvement for the Garmin Venu Sq 2

You like squarish display smartwatches like the recently launched Amazfit Bip 3 or Apple Watch Series 7? It looks like Garmin will have a new option for you soon other than it's already rather dated Venu Sq: Based on recent documentation the company is likely to introduce the 2nd gen. Venu Sq soon.

There has been little information about the specs and features of the Venu Sq 2 except for the battery capacity and connectivity features. It is listed that the Venu Sq 2 will boast a 205 mAh battery which is slightly more than the 195 mAh of the Venu Sq with its 6 days rated use. Considerably this is a negligible change but overall runtime could still be extended if the slightly larger battery is paired with more efficient sensors and updated software.

Variants and features of Venu Sq 2

In addition NFC and Bluetooth are also in tow. It's a rather safe bet that Garmin will also unveil the Garmin Venu Sq 2 Music edition that will feature an extra storage for audio tracks on top of the added Wi-Fi connectivity.

As for the fitness and health tracking features the usual heart rate and SpO2 monitoring capabilities are expected together with a wide support for different physical activities already found on the original Venu Sq. We will only find out if barometric altimeter sensor and the new HRV and monitoring report will come to aforementioned smartwatch.

When is the launch of Garmin Venu Sq 2 / Venu Sq 2 Music?

Along with the Venu Sq 2 series Garmin is rumored to launch two more smartwatches later this year. One is a possible rugged entry with the code name Austin while the Vivomove Trend could be a better version of the Vivomove Style or this year's Vivomove Sport.

There is no pricing information for Venu Sq 2. In contrast the base model Venu Sq was launched for $200 and $250 for the music-ready variant. On the other hand the latter smartwatch and the Venu 2 are now discounted from Amazon and Garmin's website suggesting an imminent replacement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtcmV2aWV3cy9nYXJtaW4tdmVudS0yLXBsdXMtcmV2aWV3LTc5NzcwNzQv0gFhaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGVjaC1yZXZpZXdzL2dhcm1pbi12ZW51LTItcGx1cy1yZXZpZXctNzk3NzA3NC9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Venu 2 Plus review: Packed with fitness and smart features,"Finding the right fitness watch can be a challenge for many users. There are several preferences to keep in mind. Do you prefer form over features? Is there a budget limitation? What are the essential smart features that you would not compromise? What about the fitness features?

My preferred smartwatch is one with a sleek fit accurate steps and fitness tracking and some smart features. The Garmin Venu 2 Plus which I’ve used for two weeks is one such device that fits the bill. But is it the right fitness watch for you? Here’s my review

Garmin Venu 2 Plus review: Yes it’s expensive

The Garmin Venu 2 Plus is not a watch for those looking to get a budget fitness device. This is for someone looking for a premium fitness watch and wants something that looks good. The version I got for review has a striking gold stainless steel bezel with an ivory case and a silicone band. There’s also a Silver and Slate coloured version for those who find the gold overwhelming.

I liked the gold and ivory colour tones given it is a break from the monotonous black smartwatches I end up reviewing. It looks stylish enough to wear with an evening outfit say even when I wear a sari etc. The only thing I don’t like about the Venu 2 Plus is that it looks a little big for my wrist size. The company says this is suited for those with 135 mm to 200 mm wrists but it looks a bit larger on mine (139 mm wrists I measured).

Still the 1.3-inch diameter display (416 x 416 pixels resolution) is one of the best you’re getting and there’s plenty of space to view notifications messages etc. This is a coloured AMOLED display with an Always-On mode.

Garmin Venu 2 Plus review: The smart features

It also comes with some smart features including the ability to take calls on the watch. I took quite a few on this and the audio quality can sometimes be a bit iffy. However people on the other side heard me clearly on most occasions though my colleague pointed out that my voice did sound different. The watch must stay connected to your phone. This one does not have LTE. But as long as the phone is within range the call audio should be fine. I used this with an iPhone 12 Pro Max.

The Garmin Venu 2 Plus will also show notifications from your device though you can only clear them from the device. There is no option for quick replies as such. This is something I don’t mind given I view the Garmin device as more geared toward fitness. Plus I’ve never been entirely comfortable responding to notifications from a smartwatch.

You can also store some songs from Spotify on the device but doing this can be a tedious task. (Image Source: You can also store some songs from Spotify on the device but doing this can be a tedious task. (Image Source: The Indian Express / Shruti Dhapola)

It can connect to WiFi on its own. You can also control music from the watch and install Spotify on the device. I could control Spotify music playing on my iPhone from the watch though you will have to link it via the Garmin Connect app. You will need a premium account on Spotify to access some features.

You can also store some songs from Spotify on the device (650 in total). But this proved to be quite a task no matter what I did. The app kept insisting that I need to set up WiFi to download music to the watch. No matter how much installing-uninstalling I did nothing seemed to fix the issue. For the record when connecting WiFi the watch showed the connection was successful. Eventually I just gave up on this downloading music bit. I’m assuming there’s some technical reason why this didn’t work for me because it worked fine with other Garmin devices I’ve reviewed earlier.

Garmin Venu 2 Plus review: The fitness bit

There’s no doubt that this is an excellent fitness watch. There are several modes here to keep the average user happy. From swimming to running to treadmill strength training to golf workouts the watch covers more than enough for users. Step tracking is largely accurate and yes the watch will remind you if you’ve been stationary for too long. This is something I’ve needed more of in the last week as I recover from yet another viral. The watch can also track stress levels and it is mostly accurate. It figured out I was getting stressed while trying to sort out this WiFi issue. It can track period cycles hydration levels etc for those who like to get in deep.

The Garmin Venu 2 Plus comes with several fitness tracking modes. (Image Source: The Indian Express/ Shruti Dhapola) The Garmin Venu 2 Plus comes with several fitness tracking modes. (Image Source: The Indian Express/ Shruti Dhapola)

I used the watch for swimming sessions and found the data largely accurate. It would sometimes add a jump to the distance count even when I was still though the final number it reflected for the total distance I swam was accurate. It was accurate with data around walks and hikes. The auto-detect feature is spot-on especially when you are out on a walk. The one bit that got the watch confused was the number of floors I climbed. While I was out during a trip to the mountains in Himachal the watch was convinced I was climbing a lot of floors. I wasn’t I was just on a very slow rickety drive uphill.

Yes the watch can also detect your blood oxygen level which has become a must-have feature in today’s times. You can access this via the Health Snapshot feature on the watch.

Garmin Venu 2 Plus review: Software battery

I’ve reviewed several Garmin watches now and I can safely say the user interface hasn’t grown over me. It can get confusing for me. You can swipe down on the home screen and access all your stats for the day. You can press the top button once to start a new exercise session and keep your favourite exercise options on top of the list. All of this is fine. But I would have appreciated a simpler way to access all the apps and settings. For instance I have to long-press the bottom button to get to the Settings. Just give users the option to go to Settings without having to jump around so many hoops. With this watch I still find myself unsure of how to access some stuff which is not ideal.

The battery life will easily last week for heavy-duty users. Garmin promises 11 days of battery life. This is all assuming you are not keeping GPS on for long durations. With GPS on all day and no music the battery life promised is 22 hours.

Garmin Venu 2 Plus review: Should you get it?

The Garmin Venu 2 Plus is a good premium fitness smartwatch. It is stylish comes with useful smart features will let you take calls if needed and the battery life should suffice for most users. This is meant for someone who does not want the same old Apple Watch or the Samsung Galaxy Watch Series which is based on WearOS now. If you take your fitness game seriously and don’t mind spending a premium on the device in question the Garmin Venu 2 Plus is a stylish one to consider. There’s also the Garmin Venu 2S which is slightly cheaper but doesn’t come with the option for taking/making calls.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYmVzdHJldmlld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2VsZWN0cm9uaWNzL3dlYXJhYmxlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvZWxlY3Ryb25pY3MtZ2FybWluLXNtYXJ0d2F0Y2gtdnMtc2Ftc3VuZy1zbWFydHdhdGNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin smartwatch vs. Samsung smartwatch,"Are Garmin or Samsung smartwatches better?

Smartwatches are highly popular due to their versatility as both stylish and technologically sophisticated accessories. However with so many smartwatches on the market how do you go about choosing the right one?

Garmin and Samsung are two of the most reliable brands and although you can’t go wrong with either one the right model for you will boil down to the features you value most. Knowing the key differences between the best models each brand offers will help make your decision easier.

Garmin smartwatch

Garmin is known for their high-quality electronics and now manufacture some of the best smartwatches. Garmin smartwatch models differ in terms of features but they all feature a robust and durable design in terms of style.

The most expensive Garmin smartwatches can cost upwards of $600 but you can find some budget-friendly models for as low as $130.

Garmin smartwatch pros

Garmin smartwatches are arguably superior fitness trackers as many customers report accurate fitness health and sports tracking results as well as a precise and responsive navigation system. For that reason they’re a highly popular choice among outdoor fitness enthusiasts and golfers.

Garmin smartwatches also have a sturdier build than Samsung smartwatches and although they’re heavier they’re much more durable and resistant to scratches and dings. They also tend to have exponentially superior battery life over Samsung watches which should be a key consideration for wristwear.

Garmin smartwatch cons

While Garmin has the edge over Samsung in terms of functionality they’re much less aesthetically appealing and have a robust build that some may find heavy or uncomfortable. Others also might find the user interface clunky and that the display isn’t as refined or bright as those found on Samsung smartwatches.

Samsung smartwatches are optimized for Android smartphones offering less functionality when paired with devices running other operating systems such as Apple’s iOS.

There is some debate as to how accurate the fitness and health tracking metrics are on Samsung smartwatches. For the most part Garmin smartwatches have the edge in this department as their design is focused primarily on sports and athletic tracking.

It’s also worth noting that Samsung smartwatches have small screens making navigating menus somewhat frustrating. They also don’t offer nearly as much battery life as most Garmin smartwatch models.

According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission TJX Companies Inc. is recalling more than 30000 nest swing egg chairs.

The recall alert says the swing chairs sold under the Tommy Bahama and Martha Stewart brands can tip over or collapse when a person is seated posing a fall hazard.

The agency reports a firm has received 27 reports of the chairs collapsing or tipping over resulting in 19 injuries that included people suffering cuts scrapes soreness broken ribs and a collapsed lung.

The chairs have a metal circle base that attaches to a metal pole from which the oval-shaped wicker chairs hang by hook and chain. The chairs were sold with a round cushion for seating. Eight of the nine styles were also sold with an additional decorative pillow.

Consumers were urged to stop using the recalled chairs immediately and return them to any Marshalls T.J. Maxx HomeGoods or Homesense stores for their choice of either a full refund or a refund in the form of a store gift card.

Consumers can also contact TJX for instructions on how to disassemble and dispose of the chair to receive a full refund or refund in the form of a store gift card.

Chances are that you have already seen the Gartner’s report infographics presenting a demand for IT Developers. According to these the demand for software engineers is and will be infinite. It is so heavy that there are even some initiatives aiming at further automation. For instance startup DeepMind has created an AI capable of writing code. All that tells us that a well-thought base in a form a low-code platform is a future for any applications development while having an opportunity to build a comprehensive business process — or prospects for a quick plug&play of readymade components — would be crucial and a significant competitive advantage.

Currently banks can neither exist nor plan their future without their IT departments. It is simply too risky from both business and regulative perspectives. However given the surge of pressure for digitalization we can see that their approach to building strategic applications is slightly different. Still they either do it using internal resources or buy an external readymade solution. But all of them want to make the most of available modern technologies — a market proven framework that is possible to build on their own.

Our experience tells us that banks are always open to dedicated solutions for particular areas such as lending or factoring. At the same time they are treating the internet and mobile banking exceptional. While for the former two it is rather a matter of know-how and best practices digital banking is believed to be the segment in which banks desire to establish much deeper cooperation with suppliers.

Customers will always be the king or queen of any business. And this age-old mantra which focuses on the importance of customers or consumers in every business is taking on a larger meaning in the context of evolving technology increasing customer needs and expectations tough competition.

In an article by management consulting firm Gartner it was shown how the field of customer experience or CX management is on the rise and there is no sign of it stopping.

It revealed that more than 5000 organizations worldwide in 2019 now have a dedicated CX leader nearly half of whom report to the CEO.

Gartner distinguished VP analyst Ed Thompson emphasized that this increasing level of CEO oversight shows the importance of CX to the bottom line hence the need for measurement.

The article revealed that most large organizations with revenue of more than $1 billion have more than 50 CX metrics with some as many as 200 all owned and managed by different people in different parts of the organization.

CX metrics have several uses. The same article explained that they can be used to communicate the rationale for previous investments validate whether improvements have taken place set goals and targets for future improvements or intervene when remedial action is needed.

According to Thomson the five main types or categories of CX practices are customer satisfaction customer loyalty/retention/churn advocacy/reputation/brand quality/operations and employee engagement.

Meanwhile Forrester Research noted that CX improvements can translate into revenue growth for companies with auto manufacturers hotels wireless service provides and big box retailers netting the biggest sales gains.

But what is the ROI of customer experience?

In an article published in forbes.com one of the biggest obstacles change-makers face in pushing their organizations towards customer centricity is convincing executives that the investment will yield a return because compared to things like sales and marketing CX is often seen as a softer part of business.

But the article emphasized that the return of investment of CX is actually quite staggering.

It revealed that customer-centric companies are 60 percent more profitable than companies that do not focus on customers while brands with superior CX bring in 5.7 times more revenue than competitors that lag in CX. Meanwhile 84 percent of companies that work to improve their CX report an increase in their revenue.

The article written by Blake Morgan stressed that investing in CX builds a powerful lifeline between customers and the company. Companies that are not customer-centric tend to send messages they think customers want without actually getting their input or feedback. This approach it said can lead to huge amounts of wasted resources on marketing and products that simply do not resonate with customers.

It added that CX helps companies proactively deliver great products and prevent future issues. As customers call the contact centers with issues about a product representatives send that information o the product designers so they can adjust the product. If numerous customers are reporting a glitch or a confusing part of a product the team can make adjustments to make the product more effective and in line with what customers actually want. The article emphasized that most customer-centric companies utilize feedback loops between customer support and product design teams.

Unhappy customers it said cost more to serve and instead of spending money to recover from a bad experience proactively spending money to create positive experiences pays off incredibly.

One chief executive who does not need convincing as to the importance of CX is Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT) and Smart Communications president and CEO Alfredo Panlilio.

During PLDT’s recent 2022 annual shareholders’ meeting Panlilio said that building on the legacy of PLDT chairman Manuel Pangilinan which has enabled the company to achieve historic growth he is determined to further establish the group as a leading-edge company that focuses on what significantly contributes to excellent customer experiences.

Panlilio revealed that with their recently launched strategic transformation and evolving fintech ecosystem in place the PLDT Group is well positioned to be the best in CX and maintain its growth momentum. He added that PLDT is committed to continuously improve on service metrics and operations using automation with technologies to empower its people and processes.

PLDT unveiled its 2025 vision earlier this year with the goal of being the best in connectivity markets ICT markets and capital markets. Hinged on a more holistic view of the business officials said that the transformation will further elevate customer experience improve PLDT and Smart’s standing as a premier workplace in the country establish industry-leading operational excellence growth profits through new businesses and capabilities and turn the group into the region’s leading ESG telco.

Coming off the group’s record-breaking revenues last year Panlilio remains optimistic on the company’s growth momentum amid the shifting industry landscape adding that last year’s exceptional performance sets the foundation for 2022 “as we continue to leverage on our strengths as the Philippines’ largest and most diversified fully integrated telecommunications company.”

Phoenix Petroleum president Bong Fadullon recently shared in a LinkedIn post how he personally had a better experience with the after-sales service offered by a company that sells a $300 watch compared to another company that sells a $17000 watch brand.

“Both are good watches but how can one that is downright simple and straightforward get it so right while the other – flashy full of drama heritage among others – can get it so wrong. The personal experience is a great lesson on brand and how people can make a whole of of difference. Never fail to show your customers how grateful you are for their business” he said.

Fadullon brought the expensive watch which he bought from abroad for adjustment to the brand’s flagship store here. He said that except for the technician who was pleasant and helpful the sales lady was purely transactional and had no warmth. “The sales lady brought out a magnifying lens to intensely scrutinize the warranty card and the watch as if insinuating that something was amiss” he said adding that he thanked the lady afterwards but never got a response.

On the other hand he brought the $300 Japanese watch of his son to the store to have it fixed. Though nearing closing time the sales lady accommodated the servicing needs which took only five minutes. Fadullon described the experience as quick easy warm and grateful.

For some companies in fact they look at after-sales service as something that is income generating something that will help squeeze more money out of the customer. For some it is an inconvenience especially if still covered by the warranty period.

Next-gen game loading explained,"Although games certainly benefit from high-speed storage devices like SSDs diminishing returns kick in pretty quickly; It’s hard to tell the difference between an old SATA SSD and a cutting edge PCIe Gen 4 SSD in most games. In order to take advantage of increasingly faster SSDs like never before Microsoft launched DirectStorage for the Xbox Series X and now DirectStorage is making its way to PC.

While DirectStorage is certainly exciting for game developers what it means for gamers isn’t quite as exciting at least not at the moment.

What is DirectStorage?

DirectStorage is basically a new piece of software that enables games to take advantage of fast NVMe SSDs. This isn’t just to reduce loading times though. As games become increasingly complex better hardware is needed to run them and that’s not limited to CPUs and GPUs: Fast SSDs are becoming increasingly important for good gaming performance.

Get your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!

Modern game engines are developed from older technologies that were designed to load in a lot of data all at once which played to the strengths of hard drives. But nowadays game developers want to load many small pieces of data over a longer period of time. For example in many games far-away objects are not loaded in full detail in order to make the game run better. SSDs are really good at handling many requests for data also called IO requests and devs are beginning to optimize for SSDs.

The key weakness of DirectStorage’s predecessors is that there is a limit to how many times a game can make IO requests of the storage. Because HDDs were bad at handling lots of IO requests this limitation wasn’t important until devs wanted to harness the power of modern NVMe SSDs which are very good at handling thousands or even tens of thousands of IO requests per second. DirectStorage fixes this limitation at least for the foreseeable future.

How? A big part of DirectStorage is GPU file decompression. Most game files are compressed to reduce the install size and your CPU usually handles the decompression work. It turns out GPUs are really good at small file decompression and DirectStorage taps into that. It improves loading times while according to Microsoft massively reducing CPU overhead.

DirectStorage requirements

First and foremost to see the full benefits of DirectStorage you will need an NVMe SSD. You’ll probably want a PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 NVMe SSD though as games with DirectStorage are being developed with these kinds of SSDs in mind.

Secondly DirectStorage is an API-level technology tied to DirectX 12 which means it’s exclusive to DX12 games. Thankfully it is possible for older games to get DirectStorage through an update. For example The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is receiving an update later this year that introduces DX12 ray tracing  and DirectStorage.

Most CPUs and GPUs made within the past decade should be able to meet the minimum requirements for DirectStorage which is just DX12 compatibility. When it comes to graphics cards Nvidia GPUs since the 900 series and AMD GPUs since the 200 series all support DX12. Upcoming Intel GPUs will also support DX12.

All Intel CPUs since 3rd Gen and all AMD CPUs since Ryzen 1000 support PCIe 3.0 the minimum requirement for NVMe SSDs. Intel 11th Gen 12th Gen and Ryzen 3000 through 6000 (with some exceptions) support PCIe 4.0 which is the fastest speed for currently available SSDs. Finally upcoming PCIe 5.0 SSDs will be supported by Intel’s 12th Gen CPUs and AMD’s upcoming Ryzen 7000 CPUs.

Is DirectStorage any good?

It’s too early to say definitively how good DirectStorage is since no currently available games use the technology. However the developers for the upcoming game Forspoken recently demoed how DirectStorage improves loading times. On NVME SSDs DirectStorage reduced loading times by up to half a second while on SATA SSDs the loading times were reduced by just under a full second. Although the loading times were certainly low it’s very easy to get underwhelmed with how little improvement DirectStorage provided.

However it’s important to keep in mind that DirectStorage is brand new and Forspoken is going to be one of the first games ever to use it so there’s probably some room for optimization. More importantly DirectStorage is for more than just loading screens: It’s going to be used to make games look better without compromising on performance and will make faster storage more meaningful for gaming. Developers will be able to load in textures and objects more freely and creatively. This could mean higher resolution textures and more complex and detailed 3D things like people and scenery all without frequent loading screens or long hallways that disguise loading screens.

It usually takes a while to reap the rewards of new API-level technology. DX12 came out in 2015 and it wasn’t instantly important for all gamers but in the seven years since DX12 came out we can definitely say it was a crucial update because it enables stuff like raytracing. DX12 proves one thing pretty conclusively: Build it and they will come. If game developers can take advantage of new technology they will.

It's also something of a last hurrah for the surprisingly long-lived AM4 platform which debuted back in 2017 and outlasted half a dozen Intel generations as Ryzen CPUs improved in leaps and bounds.

So what exactly is a 3D V-Cache anyway? Let's start with the basics. You can think of a processor's cache as a place to store data it's currently working on - a bit like RAM but because it's inside the CPU it is an order of magnitude faster to access and an order of magnitude smaller in terms of the amount of data it can store. Modern processors typically use three levels of cache - L1 L2 L3 - with L1 cache being the fastest to access but the smallest L2 being slower but larger and L3 being slower and larger again. It's this third level of cache that AMD has changed moving from a traditional 2D design to a 3D design a stack of cache that takes up more vertical space. This allows for way more data to be stored inside the CPU at once thus increasing the chances that the data needed is already inside and speeding up any subsequent processing.

AMD is slated to use this technology for its future Zen 4 processors but in the here and now it's just this one special 5800X3D an upgraded version of the Ryzen 7 5800X that launched back in 2020. Compared to the 5800X the 5800X3D trades a bit of frequency and some overclocking controls for a significantly larger 96MB L3 cache - triple the size of the 5800X's.

Before we get into the first test results let's briefly cover the rig we're using. For the AMD side we're using an Asus ROG Crosshair 8 Hero while 11th-gen Intel gets an Asus ROG Maximus Z590 Hero and 12th-gen gets the Asus ROG Z690 Maximus Hero - all high-end boards for their respective platforms. DDR4 motherboards used G.Skill 3600MT/s CL16 memory while 12th-gen Intel got the benefit of faster but higher-latency Corsair 5200MT/s CL38 RAM.

The AMD and 11th-gen Intel CPUs were cooled with an Eisbaer Aurora 240mm AiO while the 12th-gen testing was conducted with an Asus ROG Ryujin 2 360mm AiO. (And to answer the obvious question: 240mm and 360mm AiOs tend to provide equivalent performance based on our testing - especially for an open air test bench in cool (21C) ambient conditions. The only difference tends to be fan speed which is higher on the 240mm than the 360mm.) Our rig was completed with a 1000W Corsair RM1000x power supply from Infinite Computing.

In order to reduce run-to-run variance and ensure we're CPU-limited as much as possible we're using the Asus ROG Strix 3090 OC Edition. This is a massive three-slot triple-fan design that keeps the card surprisingly cool and quiet.

One of the biggest questions over the 5800X3D is exactly where that upgraded cache will come in useful - because if a game or other application doesn't fit a specific performance profile it may see no performance advantage at all running on the 5800X3D - and indeed it may even run worse due to the clock speed that AMD has sacrificed to make the design work.

To find out we've tested the 5800X3D in a range of content creation and gaming scenarios - against the original 5800X and a number of other recent AMD and Intel processors. We're hoping to see some big performance increases especially in video games but we'll start with a couple of quick content creation benchmarks: a Cinebench R20 3D render and a Handbrake video transcode.

CB R20 1T CB R20 MT HB h.264 HB HEVC HEVC Power Use Core i9 12900K 760 10416 70.82fps 29.26fps 373W Core i7 12700K 729 8683 57.64fps 25.67fps 318W Core i5 12600K 716 6598 44.27fps 19.99fps 223W Core i5 12400F 652 4736 31.77fps 14.70fps 190W Core i9 11900K 588 5902 41.01fps 18.46fps 321W Core i5 11600K 541 4086 29.00fps 13.12fps 250W Ryzen 9 5950X 637 10165 70.28fps 30.14fps 237W Ryzen 7 5800X3D 546 5746 42.71fps 19.10fps 221W Ryzen 7 5800X 596 6118 44.18fps 19.50fps 229W Ryzen 5 5600X 601 4502 31.75fps 14.43fps 160W

Neither content creation result is particularly impressive for the 5800X3D which outperforms the 5600X and Intel 12400F but falls behind its erstwhile competitors like the 12900K 12700K and 5800X (the latter by between two to six percent). This isn't a massive surprise - neither task would logically benefit from having larger cache so you only see the effect of the new CPU's lowered core clocks compared to the standard 5800X. However the results aren't disastrous either; this is still a perfectly capable CPU for these tasks that handily outperforms prior generations just not a class-leading one.

The poignant film which will be released on social media shares the message of empowerment focusing on the father-daughter bond.

The film highlights the unbreakable bond between a father and a daughter and portrays how he works hard not only to protect her and give her a secure future but also empowers her and strengthens her resolve to pursue her dreams and aspirations. He supports her dare to dream attitude and nurtures her efforts to carve her own unique path to success. He continues to teach her the true values of independence and to fight for what she believes in driving the message of living life on her terms rather than adhering to the straitjacketed and sometimes outdated social constructs of society.

Fathers are always extra special in daughters’ lives. They are their children’s first teachers sometimes their first sport coaches pillar of guidance and best friends while growing up.

Acer Chromebook Spin 513 MSRP $616.00 Score Details “The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 hits all the marks as a premium Chromebook with all the bells and whistles.” Pros Solid productivity performance

Strong battery life

Excellent 3:2 IPS display

Comfortable touchpad

Affordable Cons Keyboard was behind the curve

Display bezels are large

Chromebook convertible 2-in-1s have completely caught up with their Windows competition. Active pen support taller 16:10 and 3:2 displays and higher resolutions screens — they’re finally up to snuff.

Acer’s updated Chromebook Spin 513 is a classic example offering an efficient and quick MediaTek ARM processor and a 3:2 display that’s bright and sharp. Acer wanted us to mention our review unit’s model number the CP513-2H noting that it’s the model’s second generation.

My review unit is priced at $615 and includes the MediaTek Kompanio 1380 8-core CPU and a 13.5-inch 3:2 2K (2256 x 1504) IPS display. I found the 2-in-1 to be a fast contender in the Chromebook space with enough battery life to stand out. It’s a solid offering for Chrome OS fans who want the option of flipping their display into tablet mode and writing or sketching on the display.

Design

A combination of sandblasted and anodized aluminum in the chassis’ top and bottom covers and plastic in the keyboard deck creates a laptop that’s meant to be durable on the outside but lightweight. I found the lid slightly bendable the keyboard deck to demonstrate some flex and the bottom chassis sturdy.

It wasn’t egregious though and the overall build quality was quite robust for a $600 laptop. It’s equal to similarly priced Chromebooks like the slightly larger Acer Chromebook Spin 514 while it’s less robust than the slightly more expensive HP Chromebook x360 14c. The hinge was loose allowing the lid to be opened with one hand but being a little wobbly in a couple of its four modes: Clamshell tent media and tablet.

Aesthetically the Chromebook Spin 513 is a bit plain with a unicolored dark grey chassis with zero adornments and straightforward lines. The rear edge is angled and there’s a flair at the front sides but otherwise this is a typical laptop design. The Chromebook Spin 514 is a little sharper in its silver color but it too is minimalistic. It seems that’s the trend with Chrome OS laptops (and laptops in general frankly) as the HP Chromebook x360 14c is another that’s simplistic in its aesthetic.

The Chromebook Spin 513 doesn’t have minimal bezels particularly on the bottom where the chin is massive by contemporary standards. Given the slightly larger 13.5-inch 3:2 display it’s quite a bit deeper and a little wider than other 13-inch laptops . It’s 0.64 inches thick and weighs 2.83 pounds which is thin and light enough to be easy to carry around.

Ports

Connectivity is solid with two USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 ports a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 port a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD card reader. Wireless connectivity is slightly behind the curve with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1.

Performance

The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 is built around the eight-core MediaTek Kompanio 1380 CPU paired with an Arm-Mali G57 MC45 five-core GPU. The CPU is intended to be fast enough for the lightweight Chrome OS while offering long battery life. My review unit was also configured with 8GB of RAM a ton of memory in a Chromebook and 128GB of slower eMMC storage.

We can’t run many of our benchmarks in Chrome OS but I was able to test the Chromebook Spin 513 in the Android version of Geekbench 5 and the Speedometer 2.0 web benchmark. In Geekbench 5 the MediaTek CPU achieved 936 in single-core and 3438 in multi-core. That’s quite competitive with other ARM-based Chromebooks such as the HP Chromebook x2 11 with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c that scored 599 and 1718.

I found the Chromebook Spin 513 to be plenty speedy at everything I threw at it.

Of course Chrome OS laptops with Intel Core processors were faster including the Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 with a Core i5-1135G7 that scored 1190 and 4151. However the Chromebook Spin 513 wasn’t far off which is a solid showing. In Speedometer 2.0 the Acer hit 76 well above the Chromebook x2 11’s 45 and below the Chromebook Clip CX5’s 163.

Subjectively I found the Chromebook Spin 513 to be plenty speedy at everything I threw at it. I could open multiple Chrome tabs and run a few Android apps without things slowing down largely due to the large amount of RAM . Even Android gaming was quick with titles like Asphalt 9 playing without noticeable stutter.

Display and audio

One of the laptop’s more impressive features was its 13.5-inch 3:2 2K (2256 x 1504) IPS display. The taller aspect ratio is great for productivity and the panel was sharp enough that I had to look for pixels. My colorimeter isn’t supported in Chrome OS so the following are my subjective impressions.

First I found the display more than bright enough for all my working environments with only outside in direct sunlight being unusable. Acer quotes 360 nits for the display and I believe it’s hitting that number if not higher. Next colors were plentiful and seemed natural with no oversaturation. Finally the contrast seemed high enough that blacks looked black and not grey and text on a white background popped.

Tablet mode works great thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio.

The display was comfortable in tablet mode thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio that’s closer to a sheet of paper. The display is touch-enabled and worked well and there’s optional USI pen support.

Sound is delivered via two downward-firing speakers on the front bottom of the chassis. It was average in volume with clear mids and highs and zero bass. You’ll want headphones or external speakers for your Netflix bingeing and music listening pleasure.

Keyboard touchpad and webcam

The Chromebook Spin 513’s keyboard is nicely sized with keycaps that are just big enough and plenty of key spacing. The switches have a solid click and require more pressure to engage than most. There’s a comfortable bottoming action and plenty of travel. Overall it’s a serviceable keyboard that may not be among the best you’ll find on premium laptops  but it’s the equal of most laptops I’ve tried that are less $1000.

The touchpad is adequately sized for a 13-inch laptop although there’s room for a larger version. It’s covered with Corning Gorilla Glass which is a nice touch at this price point and it’s smooth and comfortable with precise support for the full complement of Chrome OS multitouch gestures. The buttons have a responsive snap that’s just the tiniest bit too loud.

While the laptop industry is heading toward Full HD webcams you don’t necessarily expect that from a budget laptop. Accordingly the Chromebook Spin 513’s webcam is a 720p model although it still provides clear and bright images.

Battery life

Chrome OS is an efficient operating system and the MediaTek CPU also promises greater efficiency. That should result in strong battery life even given the relatively small 36-watt-hour capacity.

In our web benchmark that runs through a series of popular and complex websites the Chromebook Spin 513 made it to just over 11 hours a strong showing that’s behind the HP Chromebook x2 11 with its slower Qualcomm CPU. It’s much longer than the Intel-based Chromebooks in our comparison group could manage. Next in our video test that loops a local Full HD Avengers trailer the Chromebook Spin 513 lasted for about 12.75 hours another strong score that led the pack.

Battery life was a real strength of the Chromebook Spin 513.

Our take

The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 provides a compelling balance of performance and battery life. It’s neither the fastest Chromebook you can buy nor the longest-lasting but it’s a Chrome OS 2-in-1 that doesn’t force you to compromise.

The laptop had few outright weaknesses with a build quality that was good enough given the $616 price a really nice display and an attractive if somewhat plain aesthetic. It’s a great option for anyone in the market for a Chrome OS 2-in-1.

Are there any alternatives?

I’m unaware of any Chromebook 2-in-1s in the same price range and with the same 3:2 high-res display. Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is one option even though it’s a bit older more expensive and is stuck with Intel’s 1oth-gen CPU.

The HP Chromebook x360 14c is another option coming in at about the same price with decent performance but less battery life and it’s still running with a 16:9 Full HD display.

Finally if you want to go the detachable tablet route consider the HP Chromebook x2 11. It’s less expensive has a smaller and sharper 11-inch 3:2 2K display and also has good battery life. However its performance can’t quite keep up.

How long will it last?

The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 was robust enough to last for years of typical use and its components should keep up with Chrome OS. Its one-year warranty is typical and fine for a laptop in this price range.

Should you buy it?

Yes. The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 provides an attractive combination of speed longevity and value.

The U.S. military budget is the largest in the world and by a wide margin. The Biden administration recently submitted a defense budget of $773 billion for fiscal 2023 – which is more than the combined budgets of the next 10 highest-spending countries combined.

While the size of America’s military budget is an enduring subject of political controversy the latest budget has allocated some funding to initiatives that even some defense industry critics can get behind – such as pay raises for service members improved housing for military families and support for Ukraine (Here is a look at how the U.S. is arming Ukraine).

If history offers any lessons however it is almost certain that some share of America’s military spending in fiscal 2023 will go to waste and end up as sunk costs – funding for projects that will ultimately go nowhere.

24/7 Wall St. reviewed some of the weapons programs in recent decades that have wasted the most taxpayer money. Programs are ranked on rough estimates of government expenditures not adjusted for inflation.

Among the weapons programs on this list estimates of wasted spending range from hundreds of millions to tens of billions of dollars. In most cases the wasted money resulted from research and development projects that did not achieve their desired results. Notably the fiscal 2023 military budget includes $130 billion for research and development – the highest amount ever allocated to R&D in a single year.

While there will always be some risk of waste associated with R&D in many of the programs on this list the wasted spending was often avoidable resulting from any number of problems including unrealistic goals corporate influence in Washington short-sighted strategic thinking and evolving geo-political goals. Ironically several of these projects were initially pursued as a way of saving taxpayer money in the long term. Here is a look at the companies profiting the most from war.

It is important to note that while each of these weapons projects did not turn out as planned not all of them were for nothing. In several cases lessons and technological developments that emerged from them proved useful in other applications.

> Est. cost: $500 million The 70A Arapaho armed reconnaissance helicopter was to be the replacement for the U.S. Army’s aging Bell OH-58D Kiowa Warrior a special purpose helicopter that had been in operation since the 1980s. The Army contracted Bell Helicopters to build the new choppers in 2005 with an order for 368 units to the tune of $2.2 billion. However concerns over limited progress and rising expenses – as per-unit cost estimates nearly doubled from the original estimates – caused the Army to ultimately terminate the program in 2008 with only four prototypes to show for the project and an estimated half a billion dollars spent.

> Est. cost: $885 million The Advanced SEAL Delivery System or ASDS was a mini-submarine specially designed by Northrop Grumman to transport Navy SEALs into combat areas. Though ASDS Boat 1 successfully completed key operational tests in Pearl Harbor in 2002 problems arose the following year when a Congressional Budget Office study cited several major problems including noisy propellers and batteries that depleted faster than anticipated. The rising costs led to cancellation of orders for additional submarines in 2006 and in 2008 the existing mini-sub was so severely damaged by a fire that it was deemed too expensive to repair.

> Est. cost: $1.8 billion In the late 1970s the U.S. Army was in need of a drivable anti-aircraft system capable of traveling with tanks to protect them from attack helicopters. Two companies defense contractor General Dynamics and automaker Ford were awarded contracts to produce prototypes and although by many accounts the General Dynamics submission was superior Ford was ultimately awarded the development contract for between 276 and 618 vehicles. There were many problems with Ford’s M247 Sergeant York including slow target engagement times failures in distinguishing between helicopters and trees ineffective counter-counter measures and a top speed that could not match that of the tanks it was designed to protect. After only 50 vehicles had been built the project was canceled in 1985.

> Est. cost: $2.2 billion The XM2001 Crusader artillery system was intended to replace the M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzers that had been in use since the 1960s. The Crusader project was taken on by United Defense and General Dynamics in 1995 with plans to enter the system into service in 2008. The Crusader was well equipped with an automatic reloading 155 mm howitzer cannon capable of firing 10 rounds a minute as well as a 1500 horsepower engine. The project was ultimately canceled by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 due to the vehicle’s excessive weight which gave way to mobility issues as well as other shortcomings with the artillery system. Still the venture was not a complete waste as technologies that evolved from its development are used in other artillery systems today.

> Est. cost: $2.7 billion The Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System or JLENS was effectively a radar blimp that was being designed to provide early warnings for any number of threats including missiles drones and surface vehicles. Ultimately however it proved to be ineffective and expensive. Problems with the system included its ability to distinguish between friendly and adversarial aircraft communication software glitches susceptibility to bad weather or enemy fire and overall low reliability. Though there were several attempts to terminate the program defense contractor Raytheon which was awarded the project in 1998 lobbied successfully to keep it afloat until it was finally discontinued in 2017 – nearly 20 years and over $2.7 billion later.

> Est. cost: $3.2 billion Transformational Satellite Communications System or TSAT was an Air Force program that was envisioned as a secure integrated communications network for the DOD NASA and the intelligence community. The program was canceled in 2009 however as the Obama administration sought to reduce defense spending. Though $3 billion had been invested in TSAT at the time of its cancellation not all of it was fully lost as many innovations that came out of the project proved useful and relevant for different applications.

> Est. cost: $3.3 billion In the 1980s the Marine Corps was seeking a replacement for its aging Assault Amphibious Vehicle which had multiple weaknesses including in its range and top speed. An ideal replacement would have a top speed of 25 knots on water and 45 mph on land have a range of 500 kilometers enough space for 17 fully armed troops – in addition to three crew members – and a 35mm gun with a stabilized turret. Defense contractor General Dynamics took on the project of meeting those specifications in what would be known as the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. The vehicle was projected to achieve full operational capability by 2025. However in 2011 the Marine Corps terminated the program citing ballooning costs. The vehicles were also not ideal for use in post-9/11 combat missions which were defined in part by IEDs and necessitated heavier armor that all but negated the vehicle’s advantages in water.

> Est. cost: $3.0 billion The 11 helicopters that comprise the fleet known as Marine One – those that shuttle the president of the United States – are well past their prime. Most are derivatives of the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King which has been in service since 1961. The Pentagon issued a request for proposal or RFP in 2003 in search of a replacement and in 2005 awarded the bid to Italian contractor AgustaWestland. Only two years into development costs were ballooning and by 2008 initial estimates had nearly tripled. When the price hit $13 billion in February 2009 the program was canceled by the Obama administration. In total the federal government spent an estimated $3 billion on research and development for the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter.

> Est. cost: $5.0 billion The U.S. Army historically relied on two camouflage patterns for its uniforms: one for the desert and one for woodland environments – until 2004. That year the Army switched to a single new uniform that bore a so-called Universal Camouflage Pattern or UCP. The pattern quickly proved inadequate for use in Afghanistan and not optimal in nearly any other environment either. The $5 billion development of UCP was criticized further as many argued the money would have been better spent on vehicle and body armor. Deemed a failure UCP has now been replaced by a pattern known as Operational Camouflage Pattern or OCP.

> Est. cost: $5.0 billion The U.S. Navy has announced plans to scrap all nine of its Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ships in fiscal 2023. The plan to scrap the ships is as the ships were designed to be at sea for 25 years yet none of those on the chopping block are close to hitting that milestone including five that are less than a half decade old. Though the ships have advanced technology they have limited practical application and a problem-prone propulsion system. A failed anti-submarine mission package was also a factor. While the ships manufactured by Lockheed Martin cost $5 billion to build and outfit their decommissioning will save a projected $4.3 billion in projected maintenance and upgrades.

> Est. cost: $5.8 billion The NPOESS or National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System was a failed attempt at a civil-military weather satellite program. NPOESS’s functionality would include ozone mapping and infrared imaging. The program began during the Clinton administration as a way of combining the needs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Air Force and ultimately be a cost savings. Overrunning its initial budget by billions of dollars the program proved to be anything but. Development of NPOESS was contracted to Northrop Gruman and after a series of delays and an estimated $5.8 billion spent the Obama administration scrapped the project in early 2010 favoring two separate polar orbiting systems one civil and one military.

> Est. cost: $6.9 billion Following six years of planning at the height of the Cold War the Army issued an RFP for an all new state-of-the-art helicopter in 1988. This new helicopter was to perform a multitude of functions including attack reconnaissance and surveillance. It would also have stealth capabilities and be able to fly across an ocean. Ultimately Boeing and Sikorsky were awarded the contract and work began in 1991. The Army ultimately wanted a fleet of 1200 of these Comanche helicopters with delivery to begin in 1996 – a date that was pushed to 1997 and then 2002. The litany of problems included those associated with radar signatures antenna performance gun system function target detection software and questions around whether the 10000 pound helicopter could even get off the ground. When the project was scrapped in 2004 in favor of UAVs or drones it spanned 22 years and cost nearly $7 billion.

> Est. cost: $18.1 billion Future Combat Systems or FCS was an ill-informed concept involving an integrated set of both manned and unmanned vehicles that at the time development began in 1999 was meant to be the cutting edge of battlefield technology for the 21st century. Ultimately however it culminated into little more than an $18 billion waste. Poorly conceived initially the project changed course following the terror attacks of Sept. 11 2001 to better align with new military priorities. However continued technical problems and rapidly rising costs coinciding with expenditures during the Iraq War proved insurmountable. By the time the project was canceled in 2009 eight prototype vehicles were all the FCS had yielded.

> Est. cost: $20.0 billion In hindsight much of the Cold War arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union was a waste of taxpayer money to say nothing of the inherent risk of nuclear weapon proliferation. One example of potentially wasteful spending in the U.S. during the Cold War was Project Nike – an initiative to build batteries of two or three anti-aircraft missiles around key cities and military sites across the country. There were over 200 Nike surface-to-air missile sites across the country in 1963 ready to eliminate any threat a Soviet bomber might pose. However by the 1970s and the widespread adoption of intercontinental ballistic missiles the Nike sites were effectively rendered obsolete having never once been used. In the brief period that the Nike program theoretically acted as a defense system against a Soviet attack the Pentagon spent an estimated $20 billion or more on the project. What’s more six soldiers and four civilians were killed when an Ajax missile exploded at a New Jersey Nike site in 1958. Today Nike sites are either abandoned or have been repurposed.

> Est. cost: $23.5 billion The Zumwalt DDG-1000 class destroyer is one of several examples on this list of a conceptual vision that lay beyond the reach of what was practical or achievable. The destroyer was intended to be a land attack vessel with a minimal radar presence and highly advanced weapons requiring a small crew thanks to automation. However its weapons systems have proved to be less effective than anticipated while its radar presence was greater than the less expensive Ohio-class cruise missile submarine. Additionally the destroyer required over 50% more crew than initially promised. Even the ship’s advanced hybrid propulsion system has presented challenges as the first DDG-1000 broke down in the Panama Canal in 2016. The Navy initially sought to commission 32 DDG-1000s to replace the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. Now production will end after just three ships – each of which cost $4.5 billion on top of the $10 billion in initial development.

> Est. cost: $30.0 billion One of the most controversial – and expensive – investments made in the interest of national security was the Strategic Defense Initiative or SDI. Announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 SDI was to be a network of lasers in outer space that would protect the United States from any attack from a Soviet-launched nuclear ICBM. Derisively known as Star Wars the program was ridiculed for the litany of technical hurdles many of which were thought to be insurmountable by experts. The program was never fully realized and by the time it was sidelined by President Bill Clinton in 1993 the government had poured an estimated $30 billion into it.

> Est. cost: $4.6 billion The KC-46 Refueling Tanker is a fixed wing aircraft manufactured by Boeing. It is one of several aircraft on this list to have seen its full deployment delayed by technical problems. The aircraft has several deficiencies classified as category 1 a Pentagon term reserved for the most serious technical problems. At least two of the issues are with the plane’s remote vision system which does not function properly in all conditions and is essential for mid-air refueling. Boeing has agreed to redesign the system at no charge to the U.S. taxpayer. The Air Force meanwhile is using federal money to fix the aircraft’s service actuator which does not meet specifications to refuel certain key aircraft. Currently the aircraft will not be deployed in combat for anything short of an emergency and full rate production is delayed until at least 2024. Cost overruns have already nearly matched the initial contract amount of $4.9 billion.

Two F-35C Lightning II aircraf... ( CC BY 2.0 ) by Official U.S. Navy Page 1. F-35

> Est. cost: $1.7 trillion The F-35 is a multirole combat aircraft manufactured primarily by Lockheed Martin. A fifth-generation fighter the F-35 is the result of a program launched in 2001 and is intended to be a single-unit replacement for a wide range of aging inventory including F-18s F-16s Harriers and F-22s – and ultimately a cost savings for the Pentagon. However the do-it-all aircraft may have proven to be a bit of a reach conceptually and the program’s lifetime cost from research and development to operation and fleet maintenance is projected to hit $1.7 trillion. The program to develop the F-35 has been plagued with problems from the start. Problems include part failures software glitches damage to the aircraft when firing the main gun and at least one incident of a jet catching fire on the runway before take off. Though the jet has some impressive capabilities and over 800 have been delivered to customers world wide its usage will likely be far more limited than initially anticipated.

The new ship is being named after Gunnery Sgt. John Basilone who received the Medal of Honor and the Navy Cross for his heroism in the Battle of Guadalcanal and Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II.

At the ceremony there were multiple speakers such as Gov. Janet Mills Sen. Susan Collins David Basilone a brother of John the principal speaker Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Troy E. Black and more.

Ryan Manion president of the Travis Manion Foundation and Amy Looney Heffernan vice-president of the Travis Manion Foundation are the ship’s sponsors.

“Make no mistake that when you see this ship and you see the name that it bears the warrior spirit of Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone and every generation of Marines who like me and countless others have followed in his footsteps lives within the soul of this vessel” said Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Troy E. Black. “This name represents the perseverance of America the legacy of the Marine Corps and the grit of our enlisted Marines.”

Chuck Krugh president of General Dynamics Bath Iron Works told the gathering of roughly 2000 shipbuilders family members and invited guests that Gunnery Sgt. John Basilone understood that expertise comes through constant effort and that this ship will honor the national hero for decades to come.

“Today at Bath Iron Works we’re not going to the front lines ourselves but our work is” Krugh said “and we will do everything we can to make sure that the ships that sail down the Kennebec will be the best built to protect the men and women of our Armed Forces.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcm15cmVjb2duaXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvYXJteS1uZXdzL2FybXktbmV3cy0yMDIyL2Rpc2NvdmVyLW5leHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1hbWVyaWNhbi1tYWRlLW0xLWFicmFtcy1tYnQtbWFpbi1iYXR0bGUtdGFua9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discover Next Generation American-made M1 Abrams MBT Main Battle Tank,"According to a video published on the new website of General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) the next generation of American-made M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank will be unveiled during the AUSA the U.S. Army Association Defense Exhibition that will be held in Washington D.C. from 10 to 12 October 2022.

General Dynamics Land Systems is teasing the Next Generation of American-made M1 Abrams MBT Main Battle Tank. (Picture source Screen Shot GDLS Video)

The teaser video published by GDLS (General Dynamics Land Systems) does not provide much information about the new specifications of this new version of the M1 Abrams MBT (Main Battle Tank). Citing information from ""The Drive"" website this version is not related to the upgraded M1A2 System Enhanced Package Version 4 (SEPv4) variant which is now under development for the U.S. Army.

The hull and the turret of the Next Generation M1 Abrams seem to have a new design. The new tank could be powered by a hybrid propulsion system.

In terms of armament the teaser video of the Next Generation M1 Abrams seems to show that the tank is equipped with a Kongsberg Protector RS6 Remote Weapon Station (RWS) armed with a variant of the 30mm M230 automatic cannon mounted on top of the turret. This type of weapon could be used to provide short-range protection against aerial threats such as drones.

Citing information from ""The Drive"" website the Next Generation M1 Abrams could be armed with the XM360 main gun a new generation of 120mm cannon able to fire new ammunition MRM (Mid-Range Munitions) AMP (Advanced Multi-Purpose) and AKE (Advanced Kinetic Energy).

The Next Generation M1 Abrams is fitted with an APS (Active Protection Systems) which is integrated into the hull and the turret. The roof of the turret is fitted with an improved gunner and commander sights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvanVuLzE5L2ZvcnQtc21pdGgtZGlyZWN0b3JzLWNvbnNpZGVyLWJ1aWxkaW5nLW1vcmF0b3JpdW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fort Smith directors consider building moratorium to aid in F-35 decision | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



FORT SMITH -- City Directors are considering temporarily halting residential building surrounding the Fort Smith Regional Airport to conduct a sound study and potentially modify area building codes in preparation for the Foreign Military Sales program.

The program is expected to house aircraft louder than those the airport currently has.

Ebbing Air National Guard Base -- which is at the airport -- was selected last year as the Air Force's preferred location for a pilot training center for Singapore and other countries participating in the Foreign Military Sales program. The proposal would accommodate up to 24 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft and move 12 General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons from the Singapore air force currently at Luke Air Force Base at Glendale Ariz.

City Administrator Carl Geffken explained at the directors' study session on Tuesdaythe sound study would keep the city from expanding building codes unnecessarily.

""So in order to make sure that we don't waste builders' time by trying to put in triple paned glass or putting in extra sound insulation that's not needed"" he said.

Geffken said the moratorium wouldn't impact residents building up to a 25% addition to their home. He said the city would use the study as part of its environmental impact statement for the Foreign Military Sales program. The Foreign Military program could pick the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township Mich. if the city allowed building that had a negative impact.

City Attorney Jerry Canfield said the moratorium would expire no later than Dec. 31 2023 and could expire earlier if regulation information is received and the city modifies the building codes.

""It does not apply to the residential uses in areas other than the moratorium area"" he clarified. ""It does not apply even in the moratorium area to accessory residential uses or to commercial or industrial uses. The ordinance especially recognizes that the Planning Commission and Planning Department together with developers may continue to work on developments but any developments and any approvals must be conditioned on the possible regulations and on the requirement of those building permits being issued during the moratorium period.""

Ward 4 Director George Catsavis asked if the city is trying to purchase properties that would be impacted by the moratorium.

Geffken said it was considered but it would deplete the city's treasury and the temporary moratorium is a more prudent solution. He said less than 10 projects are far enough along in the process that they will still be able to get built during the moratorium adding he doesn't think it will impact Fort Smith from being selected for the Foreign Military Sales program.

At-large Director Neal Martin asked if the sound study results will affect homes in the area in any way.

Canfield said it depends on what code regulations the city develops.

Two individuals spoke about being impacted by the moratorium during the study session.

John Alford a legal representative for Massard Commercial Park Development said Massard was planning to develop duplexes on 20 acres of the land which was expected to bring $25 million-$30 million worth of residential housing to Fort Smith. He said Massard will lose money if unable to go forward with the development.

""Building costs -- I know for raw materials -- has just skyrocketed in the last couple of years"" At-large Director Robyn Dawson said. ""However in residential building if your client is permitted to build after the moratorium and it is at a higher price -- which most likely it will be -- would he not just pass that higher price onto the customer of the home? So it didn't impact your client directly it would actually be passed on to the buyer.""

""We're talking about rents and affordability"" Alford said. ""There is competition throughout the city. There's a project I think you all may have approved not too long ago that is going to be building a multiphase of different types of housing. So if they're allowed to start their project now and we have to wait a year -- it's all about the lease of rents and affordability.""

Dawson asked what Alford's suggestions are that wouldn't impact the military sales program.

He suggested trading property with the city or compensation that would allow Massard to build warehouses on that land instead.

Kyle Parker president and CEO of the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education said the school's plan is to building 146 apartments for students in some of the moratorium area. He asked whether the city could contact other city planning departments that have F-35s and see what building codes they have and implement those without doing their own sound study.

Ward 2 Director Andre Good reiterated he's concerned any residential development might cause Fort Smith not to be chosen for the program.

""I would just encourage the city to actively and quickly work in that direction to try to do something that would accommodate"" Ward 3 Director Lavon Morton said. ""I think that's fair.""

""Right now we need to know the data and the facts in order to make an informed decision before I ask the board to spend millions of dollars potentially"" Geffken said. ""Because that's relocation be it residential commercial or industrial.""

The moratorium is on the directors' agenda for consideration at their next regular board meeting on Tuesday.

A military display greets travelers on Thursday June 16 2022 inside the Fort Smith Regional Airport terminal in Fort Smith. City Directors are considering adopting a temporary residential building moratorium for areas surrounding the airport in order to complete a sound study for F-35 Air Force jets and see if any recommendations are needed for new builds in the area.

Japan Tweets “Incredible Image” Of Hatsuyuki-Class Destroyers Lined-Up & Sailing Next To Each Other,"The official Twitter account of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) recently shared a stunning image of 11 of the 12 Hatsuyuki-class destroyers sailing next to each other in a formidable stance.

The warships can be seen perfectly aligned according to their hull numbers in the photo. The Hatsuyuki-class destroyers were among the first battleships in the Japanese Navy in the early 1990s.

The JMSDF did not provide a specific date or time for the photo. However the appearance of the Hatsuyuki class’s oldest ship DD-122 in the image indicates that it was taken before the ship was decommissioned in 2010.

This would also imply that the photograph was shot more than a decade ago.

The Hatsuyuki-class warships were developed under a collaboration between different manufacturers including Hitachi Zosen Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

The Hatsuyuki-class fleet consisted of 12 destroyers with hull numbers ranging from DD-122 to DD-133. The construction of the first ship in the class the JS Hatsuuki (DD-122) was started in 1979.

Soon the ship was launched in 1980 and was eventually commissioned in 1982. The remaining 11 ships were also launched and commissioned before the end of the 1980s owing to a fast ramp-up in production.

These frigates were the first in Japanese service to be categorized as general-purpose or DD. The term DD is used for the warships that are capable of surface subsurface and anti-air warfare.

Before the advent of the Hatsuyuki class JMSDF destroyer classes were classified as DDA for anti-aircraft and DDK for anti-submarine capabilities. Hatsuyuki was also the first destroyer class in the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force to deploy a combined gas propulsion system.

The system had two Kawasaki-Rolls-Royce Tyne RM1C gas turbines for cruising and two Kawasaki-Rolls-Royce Olympus TM3B gas turbines for reaching its top speed of 30 knots.

Detailed Specification

During the Cold War Japan assessed the JMSDF’s destroyer fleet concluding that more work was needed to compete with hostile nations’ technological advancements in the 1970s.

The USSR’s much stronger naval fleet was a major source of concern for Japan.

After a thorough examination Tokyo implemented the “eight ships eight helicopters” strategy. That means that each flotilla would comprise one helicopter destroyer two guided-missile destroyers and five of the newly designed general-purpose destroyers.

The hull structure was modeled on the shelter deck design used in the Isuzu class with a lengthy forecastle that truncated the back end. The shape beneath the water line is similar to JDS Amatsukaze.

Prairie-Masker a radiated noise reduction system was placed after the third ship to minimize noise and was later also retrofitted to the first and second ships.

The Hatsuyuki-class warships are around 426 feet in length and have a displacement of 3000 tonnes.

During the Falkland War Argentina sunk a British warship with a light aluminum alloy structure with an anti-ship cruise missile attack. Using this combat lesson as a reference the eighth warship of this class (Yamayuki) and the following units were upgraded with structural materials such as steel and the displacement was slightly increased.

The warships were equipped with various armaments to balance the anti-submarine anti-warship and anti-aircraft tasks as well as landing room for the anti-submarine helicopter on the back deck.

Also the destroyers were capable of conducting target distinction chase and weapon employment electronically. This class of warship was the first in the Japanese Navy to be outfitted with the Sea Sparrow missile system.

These vessels are equipped with a 76 mm OTO Melara naval gun two 20 mm General Dynamics Phalanx Close-In Weapon System point-defense guns and Boeing-made Harpoon anti-ship missiles.

Aside from that there are eight RUR-5 anti-submarine rockets and their launchers on board and two HOS-301 triple torpedo tubes for Mk-46 torpedoes. These warships however have been discontinued due to budget constraints and technological inadequacies.

The OYQ-5 Tactical Data Processing System (TDPS) is the heart of the combat system consisting of one AN/UYK-20 computer and five OJ-194B workstations that can automatically receive data from other ships through Link-14 (STANAG 5514).

The JS Hatsuyuki was the first ship of its class to be decommissioned in 2010. Six more ships were decommissioned between 2010 and 2016 with the remaining five decommissioned between 2020 and 2021.

However this was not the final destination for the Hatsuyuki class as four of the ships were reconfigured into training boats between 1999 and 2016."

The edibles are specifically designed to appeal to children using trusted brands like Oreos and Fruit Loops and familiar characters such as Trix’ Silly Rabbit and Cheetos’ Chester Cheetah.

The lookalike bags are inexpensive and readily available online which are then stuffed with products coated with THC the active ingredient in marijuana and sold on various e-commerce sites and specialty shops. Those illicit products are making their way into homes and in some cases ending up in the wrong hands and harming children.

“This should be troubling for all of us because what this packaging is clearly designed to do is to trick consumers” said Attorney General Mark Brnovich. “Our kids look at this and think ‘this looks like the breakfast cereal I eat’ and they consume something that could be very dangerous to them.”

The FDA issued a warning last month after nationwide reports that more than 1 harming00 young people were hospitalized from accidentally eating the copycat THC edibles. In addition to the hospitalizations the agency cites tens of thousands of calls to poison control in regards to kids and unintentional exposure to the packaged THC products.

AGTV spoke with William Miller Chief Intellectual Property Counsel for General Mills about what major consumer brands are doing about the problem.

SEATTLE Washington––Costco Wholesale Corporation better known as just Costco in 2016 introduced a novel strategy to wring profits out of the necks of chickens.

Now Legal Impact for Chickens a recently formed San Francisco-based nonprofit is pursuing a novel legal strategy to try to stop or at least mitigate the Costco practices.

Costco meanwhile appears to be “playing chicken” with a variety of threats ranging from shareholder dissatisfaction with the use of $4.99 rotisserie chickens as a “loss leader” to entice customers at increasing economic cost to the risk of avian influenza wiping out the whole Costco corporate strategy.

“Do the right thing”

Lawsuits and other pressure tactics applied by a range of animal advocacy labor and environmental organizations may be the least of current Costco corporate concerns but the public credibility of the Costco motto “Do the right thing” may be in trouble.

Right now the allure to average customers of $4.99 rotisserie chickens appears to be sufficient to keep Costco profits near an all-time high. But if for any reason those chickens become unavailable in sufficient volume to meet demand or the price goes up to $5.99 or higher Costco may discover that putting all of its chickens into underpriced plastic boxes was not the great longterm business plan most of the corporate board of directors thought it was.

That is when customers might start going down the street to closest rivals Walmart and Whole Foods Market instead whose practices may be little better for the chickens involved but keep the consequences of exploitive corporate behavior farther from coming home to roost.

“The farmers are not responsible”

Legal Impact for Chickens is hardly the first animal advocacy group to challenge Costco.

The Humane League Mercy for Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals among others have already buzzed Costco in recent years.

Mercy for Animals hit particularly hard in February 2021 with undercover video of cruel and gruesome practices on farms working under contract to Costco and the Costco subsidiary Lincoln Premium Poultry formed in 2016 to ensure Costco a steady supply of $4.99 rotisserie chickens.

The Mercy for Animals video clips were broadcast without specific identification of the farms involved because explained Mercy for Animals’ executive director Leah Garcés “The farmers are not responsible in the sense that they are not dictating the type of breeds they are not dictating the space etcetera. This is all being dictated by Costco. Ultimately we are asking people to hold Costco accountable.”

“Law compliance comes ahead of profit-seeking”

Holding the Costco board of directors responsible is the direct aim of the Legal Impact for Chickens lawsuit based on a legal theory propounded by Leo E. Strine chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court from 2014 to 2019.

Wrote Strine in a 2010 article entitled Loyalty’s Core Demand: The Defining Role of Good Faith in Corporation Law:

“For a corporate director knowingly to cause the corporation to engage in unlawful acts or activities or enter an unlawful business is disloyal in the most fundamental of senses.

“A publicly chartered corporation becomes a legal citizen imbued with rights and responsibilities. When directors knowingly cause the corporation to do what it may not—engage in unlawful acts or unlawful businesses—they are disloyal to the corporation’s essential nature.

“Law compliance thus comes ahead of profit-seeking as a matter of the corporation’s mission” Strine emphasized “and directors owe a duty of loyalty to that hierarchy.”

Washington vs. Nebraska & Iowa

In the Legal Impact for Chickens case Costco shareholders Krystil Smith and Tyler Lobdell acting “derivatively on behalf of Costco Wholesale Corporation” are suing the 17 Costco directors and the Costco Wholesale Corporation itself.

Smith a Costco stockholder since 2020 and Lobdell a Costco stockholder since 2016 ask the Superior Court of the State of Washington King County/Seattle division to declare that “Costco’s poultry production practices violate the laws of Iowa and Nebraska finding the Individual Defendants liable for breaching their fiduciary duty to act lawfully which they owe to Costco” and finding “the Director Defendants liable for breaching their fiduciary duty of loyalty to Costco.”

Further Smith and Lobdell ask the court to order the defendants “to ensure that henceforth all applicable laws and regulations regarding the treatment of animals (including the Iowa and Nebraska laws detailed herein) are followed; permanently enjoining the Individual Defendants and their successors agents representatives employees and any party acting in concert with them from engaging in conduct that causes Costco to violate Nebraska’s animal neglect laws;” with an identical enjoinment from “engaging in conduct that causes Costco to violate Iowa’s animal neglect laws.”

Seeking right to do surprise inspections

The individual defendants would be ordered “to take on behalf of Costco all necessary actions to reform and improve Costco’s policies procedures and practices to comply with applicable laws” and to allow Smith Lobdell “and each of their chosen representatives to conduct random and unannounced inspection of any property where Costco’s birds are kept to ensure compliance with this Court’s orders.”

Persuading the Superior Court of the State of Washington King County/Seattle division to do any such thing will require Bellingham Washington animal rights attorney Adam Karp representing plaintiffs Smith and Lobdell to clear several high legal hurdles.

Karp in effect is asking a lower court in Washington to both interpret and enforce state laws in Nebraska and Iowa which the courts of Nebraska and Iowa have so far not enforced either against Costco and Lincoln Premium Poultry or any other major agricultural producer.

Precedent suggests that even though Costco and almost all of the Costco directors reside within King County the King County court will find that the initial complaints about cruelty and neglect should be brought in Nebraska and Iowa where agricultural producers enjoy broad exemptions from cruelty and neglect laws.

Precedent also suggests that any case involving multi-state issues is likely to end up in federal court.

RICO case?

There are established legal mechanisms for pursuing cases in federal court in which a corporate entity allegedly pursues criminal activities in a jurisdiction where the local authorities are unwilling or unable to enforce laws. The 1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act better known as the RICO Act is probably the best known such mechanism; others exist in civil rights law.

The Legal Impact for Chickens case against Costco is structured somewhat like a RICO Act case but differs both in being pursued as an action among shareholders internal to the company and in having been filed at the state level making no allegations pertaining directly to interstate commerce.

The language of the case however spells out allegations against Costco which might stick in the “court of public opinion” even if not advancing in a court of law.

Loss leader

Explains the pleading “A widely-known and prominent feature of Costco’s business model is to use low-priced rotisserie chickens as a loss leader to lure foot traffic to its store. Public reports show this loss-leader strategy resulted in 106 million rotisserie chickens sold” in 2021 up from 64 million sold five years earlier in 2016.

“To execute this prominent feature of its business model and hold firm on the $4.99 price its rotisserie chickens have been sold at for over a decade despite rapidly rising input costs and general inflation” the lawsuit charges “Costco set up a vertically integrated poultry production business to supply itself with a large quantity of cheap chicken meat.”

In that connection the case contends “Costco’s directors and officers have violated their fiduciary duty by knowingly causing Costco to neglect and abandon chickens in violation of state laws” as “an integral part” of the Costco “poultry production strategy.”

“Illegal in Nebraska and Iowa”?

Like other major poultry producers “Costco knowingly propagates chickens bred to grow so fast that many of them cannot stand under their own weight” Legal Impact for Chickens alleges.

“Costco then sends millions of these fast-growing birds to dirty crowded factory farms where “disabled birds slowly die from hunger thirst injury and illness” the lawsuit summarizes.

“Despite Costco’s directors’ and officers’ knowledge of the Company’s illegal animal neglect and abandonment the directors and officers have caused and allowed Costco to continue its current treatment of chickens in violation of their fiduciary duties.”

Asserts the lawsuit “Costco’s practices—which cause birds to suffer and die without proper care—are illegal in Nebraska and Iowa” though Nebraska and Iowa courts have yet to so rule.

Corporate sharecropping

The part of the Legal Impact for Chickens lawsuit that may be most damaging to Costco is a succinct summary of business practices that appear to amount to corporate sharecropping:

“Costco working through Lincoln Premium Poultry encourages its growers to sign 15-year contracts. The factory farms and equipment within them are built according to Costco’s specifications. As a result as a practical matter it would be nearly impossible for a contract grower to profitably repurpose his or her barn should the grower end his or her relationship with Costco.

“Costco’s recruits typically must take out large loans in order to finance the building of the new factory farms according to Costco’s specifications.

“As a result of the debt growers must take on the fifteen-year contracts they sign the fact that they end up with expensive factory farms which are hard to profitably repurpose and the fact that the contract growers often have no prior chicken growing experience the contract growers are vulnerable to Costco’s decision making and virtually incapable of ending their relationship with Costco.”

360000 chickens at a time

In consequence of all of this the lawsuit details “A single grower may have as many as 360000 chickens at a time. Given these birds’ health problems” plus “the immense financial pressure placed on contract growers it is essentially impossible for a single Costco contract grower to take proper care of 360000 birds—many of whom are severely injured or wounded. Costco is aware of this impossibility.

“By leaving tens of thousands of its birds at a given contract-grower factory farm in Nebraska or Iowa where Costco knows the birds will not receive adequate care Costco is both abandoning and neglecting its birds in violation of the law.”

This contention may be difficult to prove in a Washington court let alone to the satisfaction of a Nebraska Iowa or federal court.

National Chicken Council

On the other hand according to a 2021 Costco Wholesale Statement Regarding Broiler Welfare “With respect to our dedicated suppliers: all broilers are raised uncaged in barns where they are free to move about without restriction. The minimum standards followed in these barns are based on those developed by the National Chicken Council” which “represents companies that account for approximately 95% of broiler chicken production in the United States. For our dedicated suppliers” Costco said “compliance with National Chicken Council standards is tested by third-party auditors who are independent of Costco and the producers.”

However contends the Legal Impact for Chickens case “Even the National Chicken Council has sought to distance itself from the description of Costco’s chicken neglect” published on February 6 2021 by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof based on the Mercy for Animals video.

“The National Chicken Council responded by saying ‘[t]he conditions described in the article are not an accurate representation of the health and welfare of today’s broiler chickens.’

“Contrast this” the lawsuit says “with Costco’s response to the undercover investigation which stated that much of the investigation footage simply depicts ‘normal and uneventful activity.’”

Antibiotic use

Even if the Legal Impact for Chickens case is quickly dismissed shareholder activism has reportedly changed Costco corporate practice at least once before.

“As the biggest competitor with Whole Foods selling $4 billion in organic foods Costco has been wooing shoppers who care about the source of their food for years” recounted Civil Eats on December 11 2018. “In fact the company just announced that it would tighten its standards around antibiotic use in all the meat it supplies thanks in part to an ongoing effort by shareholder activists.”

On the other hand a Civil Eats update mentioned that “In September 2019 a coalition of 10 local groups called calling for a moratorium on ‘concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and the extreme vertical integration of animal agriculture’” in direct opposition to Costco expansion plans in Nebraska.

Instead of complying Felix Behr of Mashed.com reported on February 22 2021 the Costco subsidiary Lincoln Premium Poultry “expanded its workforce from 600 to over 1100” while “Local contractors tasked with raising the chickens built 440 out of 520 [planned] barns.”

H5N1 is biggest threat to Costco

Meanwhile the most imminent threat to the Costco business model centering on $4.99 rotisserie chickens remains the H5N1 avian influenza. Both Iowa and Nebraska experienced outbreaks in March 2022.

Recalling that a 2015 H5N1 outbreak “led to nearly 5 million laying hens being euthanized at six farms in Dixon County Nebraska” Lincoln Journal Star reporter Matt Olberding observed that “An outbreak now could be even more devastating in Nebraska as the state has since added dozens of operations raising millions of broiler chickens for the Costco processing plant in Fremont” which by itself supplies more than a third of all the $4.99 rotisserie chicks that Costco sells.

They should also see their profession as a call to meet the health needs of patients as demonstrated by Jesus ""who went about healing the sick and showing compassion to society.""

Dr Nkrumah-Mills was speaking at the fifth conference of Methodist Health Professionals in Takoradi in the Western Region.

The surgeon advised: ""Know who you are: love patients have faith in the things you do for patients and above all love your patients in order to give them the best of care especially as Christian professionals who are imitating Christ.”

The conference is organised annually to reflect on the performance of the various health facilities discuss national issues and mobilise support to assist in community health care.

Dr Kenneth Sagoe the General Director of Social Services of the Methodist Church Ghana urged them to model their services after the will of Christ.

""You know as Christians our activities and services to humanity is a must; and we must continue to serve the needs of the marginalised in society to inherit the blessings that come with that"" he added.

He also advocated integrated regulatory services rather than separating services from the Regulatory Agencies that cost them time and resources.

The Conference discussed laws governing the sector which protected the health of the population and guided them from several health risks.

They pledged to ensure compliance and delivery of safe health care services and deliver as expected of them.

Dr Peter Yeboah from Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) said law and order should serve as enabler of effective performance rather than hindrance to service delivery.

Mr Abu Sumaila  the Regional Director of the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) urged the professionals to look out for adverse drug reactions and report them to improve drug quality.

Mr Emmanuel Okyere the Western Regional Director of National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) advised providers to improve upon service delivery to meet the health care needs of the people.

The Celestiq which will share battery cells motors and other components with the Cadillac Lyriq is slated to begin production in the Detroit suburb in late 2023 according to AutoForecast Solutions.

The vehicle will be hand-assembled in extremely low volumes — around 400 units a year according to AFS.

GM declined to confirm production volumes or the start of production.

""If done properly the Celestiq could become the kind of top-of-the-line model that used to make Cadillac the choice of celebrities and royalty"" said Sam Fiorani AFS vice president of global vehicle forecasting.

GM said the Celestiq which is expected to sell for well over $100000 will be the first production vehicle built at the Warren Tech Center which was designed by famed Finnish architect Eero Saarinen and his father Eliel Saarinen and opened in 1956.

The Celestiq will use more than 100 3D-printed components including both structural and cosmetic parts printed in polymer and metal the company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wNi90aGUtMjAyMy1jaGV2eS10cmFpbGJsYXplci1pcy1ub3ctdGhlLW1vc3QtYWZmb3JkYWJsZS1nbS12ZWhpY2xlLXlvdS1jYW4tb3JkZXIv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIyLzA2L3RoZS0yMDIzLWNoZXZ5LXRyYWlsYmxhemVyLWlzLW5vdy10aGUtbW9zdC1hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWdtLXZlaGljbGUteW91LWNhbi1vcmRlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 2023 Chevy Trailblazer Is Now The Most Affordable GM Vehicle You Can Order,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2022/06/the-2023-chevy-trailblazer-is-now-the-most-affordable-gm-vehicle-you-can-order/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wNi90aGUtMjAyMy1jaGV2eS10cmFpbGJsYXplci1pcy1ub3ctdGhlLW1vc3QtYWZmb3JkYWJsZS1nbS12ZWhpY2xlLXlvdS1jYW4tb3JkZXIv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIyLzA2L3RoZS0yMDIzLWNoZXZ5LXRyYWlsYmxhemVyLWlzLW5vdy10aGUtbW9zdC1hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWdtLXZlaGljbGUteW91LWNhbi1vcmRlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU5MjYxMC9odW1tZXItY2FkaWxsYWMtZXZzLWV1cm9wZS_SAUFodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWV2cy5jb20vbmV3cy81OTI2MTAvaHVtbWVyLWNhZGlsbGFjLWV2cy1ldXJvcGUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hummer And Cadillac EVs In Europe? GM Is Reportedly Considering It,"GM currently has almost no presence in Europe. 5 years back the firm sold its Opel and Vauxhall brands to the group now known as Stellantis. Since then the only GM products officially sold in Europe have been the Cadillac XT4 and Chevrolet Corvette - albeit in very small numbers in a handful of countries.

However things could be about to change. According to Automotive News GM is considering launching the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq in Europe. Such a move would greatly raise GM's European presence but there are undoubtedly several issues with the idea.

The potential problems lie mainly with the GMC Hummer EV. Firstly it's ginormous - far bigger than any other passenger vehicle currently available in Europe. The Hummer EV is 216.8"" long and 86.7"" wide. Driving one around narrow European streets built hundreds of years ago for horses could be a challenge. It also weighs 9063 lbs (4110 kg) meaning it would not be classed as a passenger vehicle by EU law but instead a commercial truck. This means you'd need a CDL to drive one in Europe as a regular EU driver's license only allows you to operate vehicles weighing less than 7716 lbs (3500 kg).

There are also no GMC dealerships in Europe so they would need to be set up. There are however a handful of Cadillac dealers mostly in Germany and Switzerland. Overall it seems to make a lot more sense for GM to bring the Lyriq to Europe and forget about launching the Hummer EV across the pond.

The Lyriq is reasonably sized - many Europeans would consider it a compelling alternative to the Model Y iX3 and Q4 e-tron on the more premium end of the electric crossover segment. It also has superb range and great tech. Plus building brand awareness in Europe should not be too much of an issue for Caddy. Cadillac is an iconic and respected name even in markets where its presence is low. Pricing should be pretty attainable too. Sure the Lyriq wouldn't be as affordable as it is in the US ($61795) but it still should be within reach for a lot of the European upper middle class.

APPLE is warning users over fake iPhone camera replacements that have a negative effect on your photos.

Listings online are marketing fake versions of iPhone replacements at a cheaper price but Apple says they’ll end up doing more harm than good.

2 Apple is warning users not to use fake iPhone camera replacements as they can hinder your camera usage Credit: Getty

“If you need to replace your iPhone camera it's important for a trained technician who uses genuine Apple camera parts to repair it” said the company on its website.

Apple warns that iPhone cameras are tested to meet quality and performance standards in ways that third-party products aren’t.

The company recommends visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts as it’s the safest option.

“Repairs performed by untrained individuals using nongenuine parts might affect the safety of the device or might cause improper function or issues with image quality. Apple camera parts are designed to fit precisely within the device”

These third-party repairs also run the risk of improperly replaced screws that could leave behind loose parts and damage the phone’s battery and cause overheating or even result in injury.

If an iPhone device detects a third-party camera part installed the camera might not be able to focus properly.

Portrait mode will not have the subject in focus and images won’t be as sharp.

Third-party apps that use the camera might also freeze or quit unexpectedly and previews in those apps might appear blank or get stuck.

If you believe that you might have a non-genuine Apple part that is affecting your phone you can get your iPhone camera replaced - in our out of warranty - by visiting an Apple Store depending on your location.

You can also visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider or ship your iPhone to an Apple Repair Center.

“Genuine Apple parts are also available for out-of-warranty repairs from Independent Repair Providers or through Self Service Repair.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

To offer this service the airline will use UATP’s technology the global payment network for the airline industry which allows a fast integration process. Thanks to this alliance Vueling will become the first low-cost airline in Europe to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method. This service will be available at the beginning of 2023 at www.vueling.com and for individuals only.

Ticket prices will be displayed in Euros and customers will be able to pay for their flight from more than 100 wallets and choose between 13 different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Dogecoin (DOGE) Ethereum (ETH) Litecoin (LTC) Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

Paying with cryptocurrencies is a push transaction meaning the user sends the exact amount rather than a withdrawal like traditional credit or debit cards eliminating transaction fraud and phishing.

The cohesive experience of contactless payments with their inherent convenience speed and enhanced security features are a major reason for rapid adoption by consumers merchants issuers and payment processors the report noted.""Through the pandemic contactless payments recovered faster than other forms of face-to-face payment due to greater consumer ease and safety"" noted the report.""“The rapid adoption of contactless payments in the past few years is testament to the rise in acceptance of safer and faster forms of cashless payments across consumer segments. We have observed that the key drivers of contactless growth – availability convenience utility and security – will continue to aid adoption at scale as contactless cards become ubiquitous. We are confident that it is a sustainable payment solution for seamless face-to-facetransactions and will help greatly in reaching the goal of a less-cash society"" said Sunil Rongala Senior Vice President Strategy Innovation and Analytics Worldline India.The report noted that in India T is a higher adoption rate for contactless and card-on-delivery options among affluent cardholders with digital-focused personas such as ecommerce and electronic shoppers luxurytravellers and avid wallet users for whom convenience and time are important.The report noted that globally there may already be more than 2 billion contactless debit and credit cards issued and the global contactless payment market size is expected to reach $6.25 trillion by 2028."

Keegan Bradley fought his putter on Sunday at the US Open ending his chase for the trophy. But after capping a seventh-place finish with a final-round 71 he saluted a crowd that had his back the whole way.

BROOKLINE — A round that sent him to his hands and knees ended with his fists raised high.

The gallery saved the most meaningful tributes for last. Hundreds around the 18th hole showered him with more “Kee-gan! Kee-gan!” thunder as he walked to the green. This was the week Bradley felt like a Boston sports hero.

“Man I’ll remember that for the rest of my life” he said. “It was really special. I’m happy that my family was here to see that and it was just amazing.”

Bradley flanked by his 4-year-old son Logan during a postround interview had family friends and high school teammates in attendance. Bradley and his family live in Jupiter Fla. but plan to spend the summer up here — Bradley mostly being a dad.

“There’s a part of me that’s still happy that it’s over” Bradley said. “I’m tapped out. What a week. I had the best time. I’m so thankful for the fans of New England and Boston. I’m proud of the way I played. I wish I had putted a little better today but that’s the way it goes.”

Starting in a tie for fourth (2 under) Bradley fell off the leaderboard after bogeying his first three holes. The undulating greens bedeviled him his putter failing him early.

Bradley is more deliberate than most in lining up his short strokes. He straddles his line. He studies his pointer finger to read the break. He is not a quick worker. At times it may have felt like he was prolonging the agony.

He was in the sand on No. 1 but gave himself a chance for birdies on 2 and 3. He rolled each of his putts over the edge of the cup.

That was right in line with his starts earlier in the week. Bradley started 3 over in each of the previous two days. On Friday he finished with six birdies in the final 12 holes. Saturday saw him card five birdies in that stretch. On Sunday he birdied 7 8 11 and 17 but couldn’t keep pace with the lead pack.

“I got off to bad starts the last three days in a row like horrible horrible starts and I sort of battled back” Bradley said. “I told my caddie on — I think it was the 12th hole — I’ve got to really try to enjoy this coming in. Something I never really take a second to do because I may never really get this opportunity again and I did that.”

He was muttering to himself on 14 after missing a 22-footer for birdie but handed out a dozen or so fist-bumps to the crowd on the way to the par-4 15th. There he sank to all fours after sending his approach into the bunker. He carded a bogey.

He got back into the top 10 with that birdie on 17 getting back to 1 under total. He could have had a top-five finish if he had made a 24-footer on 18 but he finished with a par. His 70-69-69-71 earned him a prize of $515934. Adam Hadwin and Denny McCarthy also tied for seventh.

Bradley ranked 47th in the world registered his second-best US Open finish following his T-4 at Pinehurst in 2014. He did not play the tournament last year after four cuts in five years. His last result at the US Open was T-60th at Erin Hills in 2017.

He is still searching for his second major 11 years after his 2011 PGA Championship win. Clearly he would love another chance to earn some hardware in Brookline.

“I think it’s one of the best golf courses in the world and alongside probably the best sports fans in the world. Combine those two and you get this out here” he said. “The Country Club is spectacular. I absolutely loved it. It’s my favorite US Open venue I’ve ever played. Any time you get to play a tournament in Boston it’s electric. The fans are the best.”

OMAHA — In its College World Series opener Friday against Texas A&M Oklahoma’s pitching plan went almost exactly according to plan.

Sooners coach Skip Johnson got a quality start from left-hander Jake Bennett. He got a brief (too brief actually) relief appearance from David Sandlin. And he got 2 ⅔ strong innings from Trevin Michael for his 10th save of the season.

The only hiccup was Sandlin a starter all season who made his first appearance out of the bullpen. Even if Sandlin’s appearance “didn’t go as smooth as planned” Johnson said getting Sandlin even a little work in Omaha “gets him acclimated to the environment” for a pending third start later in the tournament.

It’s likely that when Cade Horton takes the hill for the Sooners (43-22) against Notre Dame (41-15) on Sunday (6 p.m. ESPN2) Johnson will have much the same pitching plan: Horton for six or seven innings then perhaps a situational reliever followed by Michael for the save.

That’s not necessarily Johnson’s first choice.

“No I’d rather him go nine innings and throw a hundred pitches” Johnson said with a laugh. “That’s what we envision but you never know what’s gonna happen.”

Horton will need to sustain what he’s already established this postseason. For OU to beat the Irish and take control of the bracket he’ll need to execute his big curveball and locate his fastball and work in the strike zone.

“The only thing you can control” Johnson said “is throwing the ball at the target. You can’t make ‘em swing and miss. You just can throw the ball at the target.”

After coming back from Tommy John surgery last year that knocked him out his entire freshman season Horton began this season in the bullpen and at third base.

But he hasn’t been a regular in the field since mid-April focusing instead on pitching. It’s paid off as he’s become the Sooners’ third starter behind Bennett and Sandlin.

In the postseason Horton has elevated that with three straight quality starts: 5 ⅓ innings against Texas 6 ⅓ against Florida and 6 against Virginia Tech. In those three starts his earned run average is 2.55 with 25 strikeouts and just five walks.

“All of his pitches” said catcher Jimmy Crooks “if they’re working it’s gonna be hard to hit him.”

In addition to being the top high school baseball player in the state Horton was also a quarterback at Norman High School – a fact that Johnson often points out. He has a rare quality that got him elected as a captain this year.

“As a freshman you don’t really see that a lot” Michael said. “But a guy with his leadership caliber he just pushes guys and he truly walks around like a senior and shows guys the right way to do things. I mean his energy on the mound is kind of similar to Jake Bennett with guys responding to him pitching. Whenever he’s on the mound you know we’re gonna have a really good chance to win that day.”

As a closer Michael has benefited as Horton has developed in the starting role.

“Yeah he’s really learned how to pitch — especially in the last month or so I’d say” Michael said. “He had a couple rough outings in the beginning but he’s really worked with Skip and some guys like me and Jake Bennett and David Sandlin and Ben Abram have kind of watched him throw in the bullpens and kind of given him some pointers and stuff.”

Michael said it was Abram who taught Horton the finer points of throwing a cut fastball – while they were shagging balls in the outfield before an early game at Globe Life Field.

“It’s kind of funny” Michael said. “ ... He just has the pitchability. He understands pitching really well and he’s able to adopt stuff like that.”

Michael said he also had Tommy John surgery at a young age and didn’t bounce back nearly as quickly as Horton has.

“He just carries himself like he should like a starting pitcher for a big school should” Michael said. “He always gives us a chance to win.”

Crooks agreed.

“Oh he’s been awesome ever since the recovery process with him” Crooks said. “He’s just been a dog — in the weight room and just in practice in general. And with him in the games he’s been that bulldog on the mound just throwing strikes and doing his thing.”

“You’ve got to deal with adversity” Johnson said. “And it makes some men break makes others break records.”"

Even before COVID-19 turned homes into makeshift offices several mega-trends made it more difficult to achieve work/life balance.

One factor is technological advancement which has improved communications tremendously but has blurred the lines between personal time and work time. Another factor is demographic change as numerous couples of the ""sandwich generation"" struggle to cope with caring for their aging parents on the one hand and their children on the other. This situation places an even more tremendous strain on the growing number of single parents.

A negative work/life balance can cause burnout stress health problems and pressure on marital and family relationships. Because these issues can significantly affect worker productivity and output many progressive organizations are prioritizing addressing the topic of work/life balance. They have implemented policies and procedures to encourage employees to achieve it.



The finance industry is infamous for struggling to create a positive work/life balance because of its long hours and intensely competitive nature.

Achieving work/life balance includes being proactive in requesting flexibility with work hours remote work and time.

Job seekers should look for companies that encourage work/life balance.

Fostering a culture of work/life balance is crucial for attracting and retaining good employees

Remote work may allow for more opportunities to have a work/life balance.

Work/Life Balance in Finance

The finance industry is infamous for being one of the most difficult sectors in which to achieve work/life balance because of its long hours and intensely competitive nature. For example financial analysts routinely work more than 40 hours per week.

Junior employees at investment banks may clock as many as 100 hours per week according to a study done by Goldman Sachs in 2021. Though financial analysts and investment and banking professionals enjoy above-average compensation and growth prospects as with any other demanding profession there is a cost in terms of high-stress levels and limited time for self and family.

Work/life balance is a global issue. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) maintains data on work/life balance for 41 countries as part of its Better Life Index. The OECD ranks the U.S. 29th out of these nations for work/life balance.

U.S. workers work an average of 1767 hours per year well above the OECD average of 1687 hours while 10.4% of U.S. employees work ""very long hours"" (i.e. more than 50 hours per week). The U.S. also scores low on the work/life balance scale because it is the only OECD nation without a national paid parental leave policy although certain states provide such payments. In contrast Canada ranks 14th for work/life balance with Canadians on average working 1644 hours per year and only 3.3% working more than 50 hours per week.

95+ The number of hours Goldman Sachs first-year analysts reported working in a February 2021 survey. A month later Goldman announced it would better enforce its ""Saturday rule"" which stipulates that junior staff should not be expected in the office between 9 p.m. Friday and 9 a.m. Sunday.

What Employees Can Do

The results of a 2022 Pew Research study revealed the extent of difficulty faced by working people in juggling work and family life. 58% of working mothers and 43% of working fathers said they found it very or somewhat difficult to balance these responsibilities. But there are ways in which one can work toward achieving work/life balance.

Make Work/Life Balance a Priority

Before signing up for yet another arduous assignment that will involve working an 80-hour week ask yourself whether you really need to take it on or whether you would be better off spending some of that time with your family. Though choices like these may be easier for senior professionals high up in the corporate hierarchy an enlightened company will not penalize an employee for turning down an assignment that involves putting in long hours. Or at least management will try to work with them to develop a more reasonable timeline or get extra help.

Likewise being proactive in asking your company for some flexibility with work hours to care for a young child for example is likely to make you a happier and more productive employee.

Look for Companies That Encourage Work/Life Balance

Most of the biggest and best companies encourage work/life balance because retaining talented employees is a critical part of their growth strategy. But it's not just the Fortune 500 companies that offer this balance. Numerous smaller companies do so as well so focus on this aspect while conducting your job search.

Glassdoor.com for instance releases an annual list of their top companies for work/life balance based on employee feedback. While technology firms dominated the list U.S. finance-related firms and consulting companies also found spots in the top 20 in 2022 including Veterans United Home Loans.

Be a Leader for Change

Deloitte Dads is a support group for working fathers that was started by a couple of consultants in the accounting and consulting giant Deloitte LLP. The group got its inspiration from Career Moms which was organized in 2007 by another Deloitte consultant to help working mothers. If your company does not yet have someone to champion work/life balance consider taking the lead.

There are numerous ways in which companies and employers can develop perks to make work more palatable. These include telecommuting flexible work schedules mandatory vacations elective sabbaticals access to child care and workplace facilities such as gymnasiums and subsidized cafeterias.

What Employers Can Do

Though retaining the best employees is a perpetual challenge for most companies it is proving to be especially so for financial firms in recent years. One of the consequences of the 2008 market meltdown was that the financial industry came under an increasing degree of regulatory scrutiny while compensation levels in areas related to capital markets also declined. As a result Wall Street is no longer the default destination of choice for talented young people. Many have opted to start their own fintech company or consulting firm instead.

So what can employers do? Fostering a culture of work/life balance is crucial for attracting and retaining good employees because an increasing number of people may prefer the flexibility and low-stress nature of such an environment to the rigidity and stress associated with a more conventional workplace. Some companies are experimenting with a four-day workweek. Wildbit a small software company founded in Philadelphia in 2000 offers a four-day workweek as of 2017 and made it permanent.



Though there are undoubtedly costs involved for a company that offers these benefits the return on such investments—in terms of better productivity lower absenteeism recruiting talented employees retaining them and developing greater commitment to corporate goals and objectives—will more than justify the expenses in most cases.

Example of a Company Encouraging Work/Life Balance

Flexible working hours appear to be one of the benefits most valued by employees. TD Bank Group (TD) one of Canada's largest banks has received numerous kudos and awards for its culture.

TD offers its employees a variety of flexible work options such as an employee share ownership plan flexible work hours an Employee and Family Assistance program mental health awareness training and emergency childcare according to its benefits page.



What Does Work/Life Balance Mean? Work/life balance refers to the amount of time you spend doing your job compared with the amount of time you spend with your family and doing things you enjoy—the equilibrium between professional career/paid activities and personal life.

How Many Hours Do Financial Analysts Work? Most financial analysts work full time and some work more than 40 hours per week according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics but industry experts say that is on the low end especially for junior analysts.

Do Financial Analysts Make a Lot of Money? The median annual wage for financial analysts was $81410 in May 2021. The lowest 10% earned less than $48740 and the highest 10% earned more than $163640.

The Bottom Line

Though maintaining work/life balance is a challenge for most professionals in the finance industry where working long hours is the norm employers need to foster a work/life balance culture to attract and retain talented employees.

The negative effects of an adverse work/life balance include physical and emotional health problems and interference with family and relationships. Conversely the positive effects of a healthy work/life balance include higher productivity lower absenteeism and decreased employee turnover thereby benefiting all parties involved—employees employers and families.

Proper work/life balance benefits everybody: employees by reducing stress levels and increasing downtime; employers by improving productivity reducing absenteeism and attracting/retaining good employees; and families which benefit from increased parental involvement and more time with each other.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF0bGFudGljLmNvbS9pZGVhcy9hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjIvMDYvc2hlcnlsLXNhbmRiZXJnLWxlYXZpbmctbWV0YS1sZWFuLWluLWZlbWluaXNtLzY2MTI5MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sheryl Sandberg and the Crackling Hellfire of Corporate America,"This article was featured in One Story to Read Today a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.

In publishing there are some books that are too big to fail. Very early on you get the message that this is a Major and Very Important Book. In 2013 that book was Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In: Women Work and the Will to Lead which sold more than 1.5 million copies in its first year. She was the chief operating officer of Facebook back when most of us had no understanding of the platform’s fearsome powers—in the halcyon days when we thought it was just for sharing pictures of the grandkids and ruining marriages. The book was about how women can make it to the top. It was a sort of “work-life balance” category buster because she was telling women to pretty much forget about the “life” part.

In the weeks before the big rollout I was contacted by editors at several publications asking if I would write something about it. I knew exactly what they wanted—not the main article which would be a rapturous announcement of this bold American visionary. They wanted some crank to pump out a “What About the Children?” sidebar pointing out that to lean into work you have to lean away from your family to lend a spirit of objectivity to their 21-gun salutes to author and book. Trust me around 2013 I was the top crank for that kind of thing.

But when I looked through the galley the whole thing was so manufactured and B-school-ish that I just wanted to put my head on the keyboard and have a little nap. Still I myself had been leaning in to the lucrative book-reviewing space for a long time and I could tell there was money on the table because these Sheryl Sandberg packages were obviously going to be lavish. If I played my cards right I could be looking at one large. Where to get it?

Read: How Sheryl Sandberg lost her feminist street cred

Time Inc. as it turned out. It was a purely meretricious transaction but I didn’t phone it in. I did the honorable thing and read the book closely. Almost immediately I saw that its main problem wasn’t the children. This was a book about how women in corporate America could—and should—strive to get the most money and the most power. But where should they seek such power? In the crackling hellfire of C-suite America.

Sandberg invoked the name Goldman Sachs multiple times—in a good way. Mind you this book was published five years after that despicable outfit played a major role in almost bankrupting the country. She tells us it was a “seismic event” when in the late ’90s Goldman Sachs made a woman named Amy Goodfriend head of its U.S. derivatives team; she stayed at the company until 2001. “Amy’s a bitch but an honest bitch” one man said about her. If I ever write one of these books I’ll call it A Few Honest Bitches and explain that if we can get the right kind of women inside these places we might be able to burn them down.

Why were the progressive worlds of publishing and journalism embracing this junk as some kind of giant step toward equality? It will surely go down in history as one of white feminism’s greatest achievements.

I didn’t send Time a book review so much as a red-flag warning. Time had published a cover story in the midst of the financial crisis called “The Price of Greed”; Lean In was a return to Greed is Good. But the editors didn’t care about Cassandra in the sidebar. The copy was clean and they slapped on a title they liked (the title was “What About the Children?”) and I decided to act very Goldman Sachs about the situation. I cashed the check the day it arrived.

Sheryl Sandberg announced this month that she’s resigning from Facebook—now called Meta—to focus on her philanthropy. Her work there is done.

During her 14 years at the company she’s done so much damage to our society that we may never recover. The simple truth is that you cannot simultaneously dedicate yourself to making untold fortunes for a giant corporation and to championing a social good. Facebook—supposedly a wondrous no-charge gift to the world—was made of you and me. It needed our baby pictures our religious and political affiliations; it needed the names of our high schools and employers and favorite movies and hometowns. It let us set up shop as the very particular and special individuals we are—and it was all free. In fact it was ruinously expensive. As the saying goes “If you’re not paying for the product then you are the product.” There we were: suckers lambs to the slaughter. It didn’t even occur to us that all of that information wasn’t “safe.” We didn’t want it to be safe! We wanted our long-lost friends from Brownie Troop 347 to be able to find us! When we realized what we’d done it was already too late.

During the Trump campaign we got a taste of what a giant mysterious corporation can do with all of that information. A political consultancy called Cambridge Analytica had gotten hold of the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users. That data was used in service of the “psychological warfare” that Steve Bannon wanted to wage against the American public. It sent voters down just the right rabbit holes; it whispered in their ears. It was a fooling-some-of-the-people-all-of-the-time operation.

“We made mistakes and I own them” Sandberg eventually said about the Cambridge Analytica scandal. “They are on me.” The impression was of radical transparency a Harry Truman of the C-suite: The buck stops here.

Read: The Cambridge Analytica scandal in three paragraphs

But according to The New York Times the buck was about to embark on an Oh the Places You’ll Go! journey to the bottom of the Earth. Sandberg oversaw the company’s bizarre damage-control efforts. It was an old-school dirty-tricks campaign combined with the unimaginable power of Facebook. That campaign included hiring “a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros” and lobbying “a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.”

Excuse me—Facebook did what?

But more interesting is the way that Sandberg deployed some of her personal power. In Lean In we were power-posing assuming male levels of self-confidence asking for the big money and knowing we deserved it. But when The Daily Mail attempted to publish something unflattering about Sandberg’s then-boyfriend the Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick she seemed more like the head cheerleader standing up for the captain of the football team. On two separate occasions she is said to have contacted The Daily Mail and successfully kept the information out of the paper. (The source of the critical story recanted some of it and Sandberg denied pressuring the paper The Wall Street Journal reported.)

(Look I fully understand that as the result of this article I’m going to wake up next to a horse’s head and all I ask is that it not be one of the weeks when I’m using the paisley sheets.)

Now we learn that Meta has been investigating Sandberg for possible misuse of company resources. The Wall Street Journal reported that some of her colleagues think she may have broken Securities and Exchange Commission rules by having Facebook employees work on her pet projects. These include her Lean In foundation; her second book Option B: Facing Adversity Building Resilience and Finding Joy; and even her upcoming wedding to a consultant named Tom Bernthal. (The Journal reported that a Meta spokesperson declined to comment and that a spokesperson for Sandberg denied that she had inappropriately used company resources in connection with her wedding.)

I should have left well enough alone but I couldn’t help myself and I Googled the fiancé’s company’s website which reads “From Manila to London we help Facebook with their most pressing Communications and global Brand Strategy challenges.” So this is a match made in heaven.

(It’s going to be my own head bleeding out on the sheets I realize now. Will have to pin a note to my pillow reminding the night caller of what Michael Clayton said: “I’m not the guy you kill. I’m the guy you buy!”)

One lesson I learned in the Berkeley of my 1960s and ’70s youth has never failed me: Huge corporations are never ever on the side of the people. You can’t take your eyes off of them for a second because any time you look away they’ll do terrible things like make napalm (Dow Chemical) or Agent Orange (Monsanto) or get desperately impoverished women in developing countries to use expensive baby formula instead of breastfeeding (Nestlé).

Today’s young people have been forced to learn that old lesson because they are the inheritors of 40 years of corporate greed private equity’s smash and grab bank deregulation and the collusion of the very rich and the U.S. government to squeeze every penny it can from the middle class and move it into the counting houses of billionaires. They know the game isn’t rigged against them; they know the game was lost long before they were born.

Corporations are now faced with labor shortages and there are rumblings from the owner class about the demise of the great American work ethic. But corporations are the ones who killed it. Young people today know that work is not your life; it’s how you pay for your life. It’s an exchange of money for labor and they are not interested in devoting a jot of extra energy to jobs that pay minimum wage and offer no health insurance or savings plan for employers who show no loyalty to their workers.

Charlie Warzel and Anne Helen Petersen: How to care less about work

These are signs that a real labor movement may be growing in this country. Here’s another old lesson from my misspent youth: If workers organize they become more powerful than the men—or lean in! women—who own the companies.

So farewell to Sheryl Sandberg. But maybe her departure is finally the moment to answer the question Time magazine asked me so long ago: What about the children?

I’ve heard a number of young people lately say they won’t have children because of the climate crisis. That’s a tremendous sacrifice and a principled position. A Pew Research Center survey from November found that 44 percent of adults without kids say that they probably won’t have any up from 37 percent in 2018 the last time Pew asked the question. But often when you talk with these young people after the climate comes a whole lot of reasons the choice isn’t a sacrifice at all. Children seem like a hassle and an impediment to a fun life.

To them I say Hold on. That’s the corporation speaking which seeks to cleave you from human experience and sees you only as a worker a unit of production. That’s the corporate demand that you lean in to work and lean away from your family. “For some women a career is their baby” said Business Insider in its article on the Pew results.

Staying home with very small children—Jesus Christ! There’s no way to explain the amount of labor tedium and occasional desperation it includes. Especially if you also work from home. Nothing is going right the kids are running around and you really can be brought to tears by mud tracked across a clean kitchen floor. Nothing to recommend it on that front.

But here’s the thing. Ask any older person when the happiest time in their life was and they will always always say it was when their children were young.

A few weeks ago I came up with the absurd project of digitizing all of the photographs of my children taken from the pre-iPhone half of their lives. I bought the scanner and the cord to attach it to my computer. I hauled up the cardboard boxes and opened one—and the whole endeavor stalled out.

My children thank God are healthy young men living their adult lives—they are twins 24 years old. But when I opened the box I saw the faces of those little boys who aren’t here anymore the ones who lived with me in the dreamtime of early childhood. My husband worked I stayed home and five long days a week we did things I knew they would never remember. Like the first time they heard the music of an ice-cream truck. I bought them each a Pokémon popsicle and here’s the mind-blowing thing: They had no idea what was inside those wrappers until I took them off. When I gave them those astonishing perplexing never-before-seen popsicles (“My popsicle is raining” one of them said in confusion when it started dripping) they looked at me the way they often did in the dreamtime: as though I was the most wonderful and kind and important person in the whole world. In the corporation of their love I was at the top of the power structure.

There is no greater joy in this life than having a baby. Here is a person who has been uniquely designed to love you. And here is Goldman Sachs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTgveW91ci1tb25leS9lc2ctaW52ZXN0aW5nLXN0b2Nrcy1lbG9uLW11c2suaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Think About E.S.G. Investing in a Falling Market,"Any time the stock market falls investors are likely to rethink nearly everything.

The current gut check comes at a point in the evolution of the investing industry when assets in so-called E.S.G. funds have risen 38 percent in the past year to $2.7 trillion by the end of March according to Morningstar Direct. Professionals overlay all manner of rules and screens for the investments they pick using climate diversity or other data to construct what are now over 6000 funds worldwide.

There is a cost for consciousness: The funds often have high fees that can reduce returns if the investments don’t do better than whatever alternatives you reject. And there’s a fair bit of confusion about what the term E.S.G. — short for environmental social and governance — means in practice.

That can lead to episodes like one last month when Elon Musk called the entire industry a “scam” after S&P Global had the temerity to remove Tesla from an E.S.G. index. S&P did this it said in part because of accusations of racial discrimination and other worker mistreatment.

Fulop 2025: A Developing Rivalry and What it Means,"In the 2017 gubernatorial pre-season Ras Baraka supported Steven Fulop the two big city North Jersey mayors bound by a common sense of an enemy festering in South Jersey. But now with Fulop reigniting his ambition for the governorship and Baraka’s allies prodding him toward his first statewide run the mayors of Jersey City and Newark respectively appear headed for a 2025 collision.

After winning a third term with – by all appearances – a no-sweat effort last month Baraka last week helped secure

a seat for handpicked ally Dupre “DoItAll” Kelly in the June 14h West Ward runoff to maintain a 5-4 edge on the city council.

It was what he needed to do to look strong enough to withstand the inevitable Essex chatter about how he won’t win the party line in his own county if he runs for governor the consequences perhaps of a lifelong distrust for party authority. But as Fulop worked the phones early in anticipation of another bid for governor trying to soften sceptics with a more veteran set of arguments than last time and dangling a PAC with $6 million in it as proof of his seriousness Baraka faced spurious diner booth criticism about low turnout in that May 10th Newark election.

“Anemic” establishment sources groaned eyes glazed over by the 12% turnout figure in Essex on Election Night as if looking for ways to nullify the impression of Baraka as an urban superstar even before he figures out whether he will actually undertake a run for governor.

But as Baraka gears up to try to muscle out Fulop (more on that in a minute because there is some bad political blood there too; and some comparison with other statewide seeking players) the context of his win and alleged inability to “inspire” voters merit closer inspection.

First of all Baraka – running on a record of having secured new lead-free water lines for Newark leading during the pandemic and overseeing new development some of it or much of it wholly congruous with the arts scene Baraka loves – crushed his opponent by a greater margin (83-17%) than any other past foe. The mayor’s allies point out that Sheila Montague emerged as a challenger only because no one else saw a way to win. So with a nonexistent threat level Baraka never had to campaign as hard as one who might have actually had to bench press more voter base.

But it goes even deeper.

Remember former Mayor Sharpe James – a one-man circus who did time for corruption – wanted to run for an at-large seat in this last cycle.

Now the law forbade him from doing so according to the state Attorney General – but he went out there and harvested ballot petitions anyway to get on the ballot and stimulated a connected resistance culture with those other nascent candidates looking to get on the ballot to challenge the Baraka Machine.

A charismatic figure who still engenders a lot of goodwill James could easily have turned the season into the Sharpe Show which if unchecked and unregulated could have degenerated the cycle into bedlam for Baraka and his allies. Left to their own devices the anti-Baraka contenders squirmed like so many sections of unsegmented polar ice floes. Sharpe envisioned connecting all of them to a reanimated Ringling Brothers with him as megaphone-wielding octogenarian ringmaster. The Barakas – Ras and his brother Middy – had to be careful. They didn’t want to too strongly rough up James – again still an icon in political and some community circles – but they also didn’t want to risk letting his ego explode back onto the scene complete with victimization lifeline when inevitably the local clerk ruled against his appearance on the ballot on the strength of that AG judgement against him. James basically cracked up on his own in the end the clerk waving that letter of then-AG Anne Milgram to defuse what could have turned into a movie starring Sharpe with the Barakas in supporting roles. They couldn’t happen.

But in letting the law prevail and failing to secure a presidential pardon in time for the election – it’s absurd yes but these were the abiding conversations at the start of the cycle – the Barakas contributed – wittingly if not with any aggressive augmenting of Milgram’s legal ruling – to a more flattened political atmosphere. James ejected meant no at-large contest and no at-large contest meant more reason for voters not to go to the polls. Irritating in the final analysis with 12% turnout in Essex? Maybe. But worse would have been having to endure the flamboyant Sharpe on wheels attempting to ride and platform-shoe his way back to City Hall.

That would have been a disaster.

So by letting James smother himself they froze out a portion of the cycle and contributed to lower turnout. Bothersome yes but necessary.

Finally the point is don’t look at the bottom line of Newark/Essex turnout and read too much into it without considering two glaring contributing factors to why it ended up that way: no competition in the mayor’s race and no competition in the at-large race.

Baraka had a process beef too.

From NJ.com’s Steve Strunsky:

“The day before Newark Mayor Ras Baraka’s landslide re-election changes in election districts and polling places prompted his campaign to file a lawsuit asking a judge to let voters cast ballots at any polling place in the ward where they lived.

“But the solution was not as simple as the campaign envisioned and Superior Court Judge Robert Gardner denied the request at a hearing Monday afternoon.

“In an angry victory speech after polls closed the next night Baraka denounced the judge’s ruling and the election officials who had imposed the changes which the mayor said disenfranchised thousands of voters who went to the wrong polling places or could not get to their new ones.”

Now back to the developing Baraka-Fulop rivalry.

Sources say the mayor of Jersey City is already pursuing the 2025 governorship: making phone calls rebuilding relationships underlining successes and leading on the progressive front with heavy-impact measures like the following:

“Mayor Steven M. Fulop announced today [Friday] the creation of a $20 per hour Living Wage Statute for all full-time Jersey City employees to provide an adequate standard of living and help offset nationwide historic inflation and increased cost of living while retaining employees.

“As part of the City’s 2022-2023 fiscal year budget the Living Wage Statute will boost salaries for hundreds of current and future Jersey City residents and workers from $17 (already one of the highest minimum wage rates in the nation) to $20 per hour – which is $7 more than New Jersey’s current hourly minimum wage.

“’In Jersey City we already set the highest minimum wage standards and we are taking it a step further to provide our residents and workers with a decent standard of living so that they don’t have to decide between feeding their children dinner or making rent’ said Fulop. ‘By introducing a living wage we are raising the bar putting upwards pressure on salaries offsetting historic federal inflation levels and cost of living increases improving employee retention and sustaining our local economy.’”

If Baraka has lead pipe eradication Fulop it seems has living wage bar-raising.

While Fulop prepares for another stab at Drumthwacket Baraka too teases Trenton Tinseltown.

This from InsiderNJ a week ahead of the May 10th election:

“At a Kenyatta Stewart fundraiser tonight in Paterson Newark Mayor Ras Baraka all but explicitly said he’s running for governor after Tuesday’s mayoral election.

“He chose his words carefully but those words turned heads dramatically in the packed room at the Art Factory Studios amped as Democratic State Party Chairman (and Essex County Democratic Chairman) LeRoy Jones gave his full-throated endorsement of Baraka for a third term as mayor of Newark.

“Baraka basked in the chairman’s praise.

“He built up those other members of Team Baraka.

“Then:

“’A lot of you are putting a target on my back’ said the mayor in pursuit of his third term. ‘I’m not dodging that target. I’m not here to talk about that. [But] if we do that thing I’m going to come find you. Newark is going to decide where I’m going to go. If there is a fight out there I’m not afraid.’”

“A source in the room interpreted ‘that thing’ as governor 2025.”

So it’s on. Baraka v. Fulop; Fulop v. Baraka – the intrigue intensified by the fact that Baraka originally backed Fulop for governor ahead of 2017 before the Murphy mudslide of support in North Jersey engulfed the Jersey City mayor shaking loose his supposedly strong base of support while Baraka stood by him only to find himself on the losing side as Fulop very suddenly tapped out. A visibly ruffled Baraka subsequently showed up at an endorsement ceremony for Murphy. Maybe ironically the Newark mayor would turn into one of Murphy’s staunchest local allies the confluence of Newark’s need for state funds and the outsider tag of progressive street poet and Wall Street progressive in the static underworld of New Jersey establishment antics improbably turning Baraka and Murphy into political allies.

If Fulop hated South Jersey machine Dems his 2017 gubernatorial foray characterized by heavy sparring with George Norcross and fellow contender then-Senate President Steve Sweeney he found a willing ally in Baraka who defeated the South Jersey-infused Essex County machine when he first won the mayoralty in 2014. As Murphy found himself tested by South Jersey in the early days of his governorship and outright opposed at every turn by a bitter Sweeney who not only suffered losing the governorship to Murphy but then couldn’t convince Murphy to rein in the NJEA which wanted him out of commission Baraka got closer to Murphy.

Wall Street’s bad but not as bad as that GN3 Camden helipad.

Speaking of South Jersey Sweeney – already an announced candidate for governor in 2025 and nursing

the wounds not just of his 2017 statewide freezeout but the deflating feeling of having won the most expensive legislative contest that same year only to get gonged out of office four years later – must feel somewhat deviously elated by the spectacle of an entangled Fulop and Baraka. North Jersey fractured remains the study South Jerseyan’s only shot at the top. The trouble is that arguably none of the party machines sees Fulop or Baraka as serious contenders right now for an organization line which means both of them might end up – if one can’t knock off the other – running for the progressive vote out in the cold like a pair of refashioned Frank Pallone and Rush Holt statewide duds.

Sweeney can laugh all he likes.

Out of office mired in the state’s red voter zone and certainly in no stronger position statewide than he was when he ran with the force of the senate presidency on his side he seems less likely to project than Baraka or Fulop.

“Do you think he runs for his senate seat in 2023?” an insider asked last week in an eatery.

“Yes” was the reply. He needs the office under him to credibly go after the governorship in 2025.

But the other man shook his head in disagreement.

“If he loses he’s truly washed up and he can’t risk that [against his conqueror 3rd District state Senator Ed Durr] now that the district’s less Democratic” said the source.

With Sweeney floundering to find a way back in (LG running mate on a GOP fusion ticket??) Fulop

financially equipped and with a progressive Jersey City story to tell but the hangover of 2017 putting past allies in cautionary postures around him and Baraka boasting a progressive Newark success story but with the heavy Democratic Party caveat in an organization state of his defiant self-representation as his own man which sends shivers up the spine of every organization-molded cog in the machine from the allies of Speaker Craig Coughlin to the basement dwellers in Senate President Nick Scutari-world to the plush suburban climes of Bergen – what does it mean?

It means the likes of U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11) remain favored contenders for the office. Essex County Democratic Party Chairman (and NJ Democratic State Committee Chairman) LeRoy Jones likes her and can pull another county or counties with her as the statewide candidate on the strength of her general election prospects.

Downside?

She alienates Baraka also from Essex County with a real base in Newark who wants the job; as well as sitting LG Sheila Oliver also of Essex who also might want the job.

“Poor LeRoy” a rival cackled from the comfort zone of another county.

Any others?

U.S. Rep. Josh Gotheimer’s (D-5) name comes up but only because he has a lot of money. Most party sources say the Bergenite tacked too far to the right in his conservative district to be of any use in a Democratic Party Primary. Coughlin’s name remains in contention too but mostly as leverage for Middlesex’s play for senate president with one of three close allies in the state senate: Joe Vitale Joe Cryan and Vin Gopal.

“It’s too fragmented” a party source groaned on Friday to InsiderNJ his head all but in his hands as he presumably contemplated another Goldman Sachs panic button to level the statewide field with cash the way Jon Corzine and Murphy did in 2005 and 2017 respectively to chase away the prospect of a mangled field and the prospect of party organizations doing something they dread: working for a candidate to actually connect with voters. In the meantime that’s something Fulop and Baraka do well better than anyone else in fact according to their allies and if you ask either one of them better than each other. The self-nullifying properties of their would-be candidacies already have some North Jersey sources examining the possibility of Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh emerging as a prospect. After all he too just won reelection in a supposedly ungovernable city and did so while ensuring that a former mayor who did jail time for corruption and trying to get back in the game stayed firmly affixed to the sideline – all with a progressive pot legalization-friendly story tell just like some other people in the party you may have heard of out there on the North Jersey urban landscape who view themselves as keenly aspirational executive members of the Democratic Party.

HARTFORD Conn. — Two people are dead and another was injured after a triple shooting Hartford police said was fueled by a feud over a dog.

The shooting happened just after 9 p.m. outside an apartment building on Franklin Avenue a short distance away from Maple Avenue and Hartford Hospital.

""Preliminary investigation shows that this was a personal neighbor dispute over a dog"" said Hartford Police Chief Jason Thody.

Christina Dang 27 and the man she lived with 39-year-old Chase Garrett were shot to death after Garrett reportedly shot at a neighbor. The neighbor's dog had reportedly scratched Dang according to another neighbor who asked not to be identified.

The dog's owner a woman in her 20s was rushed to the hospital for treatment. Police said she underwent surgery for her injuries and is listed in critical condition as of Monday morning.

""They started arguing and they went inside and then they came outside and somebody got shot"" said the anonymous neighbor.

The neighbor told FOX61 that right after Garrett shot his next-door neighbor he and Dang were shot by someone else while Dang was holding their 6-month-old child.

Thody said that the Department of Children and Families (DCF) came in and now has custody of the child.

According to investigators a suspect vehicle was quickly found by officers and a fourth person who police believe was at the scene has also been identified.

""Another example of a very personal dispute that escalated into violence unnecessarily"" said Thody during a press conference regarding the shooting. ""[...] We have to find better ways to resolve our conflicts in non-violent ways and deescalate and have some patience.""

Thody said situations like the one that happened Sunday night are tragic and hard for the officers because the situations are hard to predict and prevent.

There have already been 20 homicides in Hartford in 2022 police said. There were 19 all last year.

""So in 2012 on Oct. 20 my only child was Hartford's 20th homicide [of the year]"" said Janet Rice an anti-gun violence advocate from Hartford. ""That was 55 days before Sandy Hook.""

Rice was part of a community violence intervention group's round table at Hartford Public Library on Monday. The group met with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pushing hard for stronger gun violence legislation and federal funding.

""We need to help these young guys with better ways of conflict resolution"" Rice said.

Her son was Shane Oliver. Since his death she's also lost a nephew and a godson to gun violence. Rice now works in behavioral health.

""Once that bullet leaves the chamber and it hits a major artery and that person dies that's forever"" Rice emphasized.

Police said they do have the vehicle of the person they believe is responsible for killing the couple and they have that person of interest squarely on their radar.

Hartford earned a penalty in the 31st minute after Efraín Morales brought down Andre Lewis in the box. Corey Hertzog took his penalty shot down the middle and ATL UTD 2 goalkeeper Justin Garces dove to his right saving the shot with his left foot.

The visitors opened the scoring in the 42nd minute through Luka Prpa. A loose ball bounced around the Atlanta penalty area before falling to Logan Gdula which the defender volleyed toward net. Gdula’s effort hit off captain Tom Brewitt and into the feet of Prpa who took a touch before finding the back of the net with his left foot.

Joel Johnson doubled Hartford’s advantage in the 75th minute. Prince Saydee moved with the ball down the left wing and laid off a pass for Lewis who found Rashawn Dally on the right side of the Atlanta box. Dally played a one-touch pass for Johnson who put his left boot through a shot that Garces got a palm to but was unable to keep out of the net.

The third and final goal for Hartford came in the 80th minute. Rashawn Dally powered a shot toward Garces and the Atlanta goalkeeper made a reaction save; however Brewitt swept up the rebound and touched the opportunity into the goal.

ATL UTD 2 (3-11-1 10 points) returns to action Saturday June 25 in Oakland California at Laney College Football Stadium against Oakland Roots (10:30 p.m. ESPN+).

However the officials said it is important for residents and businesses to note that this year there are two different tax rates: A rate of 32.46 mills was set for motor vehicles and the Town Council set the tax rate at 40.68 mills for real estate and business personal property according to officials. The cap on the tax rate for vehicles is allowed by state law. The real estate and business personal property tax rate dropped to 40.68 mills from the previous level of 42.42.

Further the council approved a two year phase-in for the Oct.1 2021 real estate revaluation; the phase-in applies to properties that have increased in value according to officials.

“For the first year of the phase-in July 1 2022 and January 1 2023 tax bills the tax bill is calculated by multiplying the mill rate by only a portion of the new assessment” officials said in a statement. Here’s more on that phase-in.

“Real estate is billed in two installments. The first installment is due July 1 2022 and covers the period of July 1 2022 through December 31 2022. The second installment is due January 1 2023 and covers the period of January 1 2023 through June 30 2023.”

Officials noted that motor vehicle tax bills are for vehicles registered as of Oct. 1 2021 and cover the time from October 1 2021 through September 30 2022.

Officials said that payments postmarked after August 1 2022 incur interest at a rate of 1.5% per month calculated back to July 1 due date.

The town said it offers these options to pay:

1. Pay online. Pay by electronic check ($0.90 processing fee) or by credit card (2.95% processing fee). Go to https://www.westhartfordct.gov/tax and click on the button: PAY TAXES NOW

2. Pay by mail. Insert your check and payment stub in the provided envelope. (the New Britain address is correct. This is where the town’s bank processes payments.)

3. Pay by Secure Deposit Box. Payments can be placed in the Town Hall secure deposit box located on the outside wall to the left of the Town Hall entrance. The sign above the box says “Town Hall Business.”

4. Pay in person at Room 109 at Town Hall; office hours are Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

Officials said tax relief programs are available to veterans and income eligible residents over 65.

Hasbro famous owners of Nerf and Death Row Records have introduced a new mascot to market their popular foam dart-maker.

Made up of many many Nerf darts and rocking an orange basketball jersey with matching orange shoes Murph (who uses they/them pronouns) will be the toy brand's first-ever mascot. The marketing campaign titled 'Unleash the play in you' will have Murph appearing in everything from ads stores and across Nerf’s social media channels — so you can't avoid Murph even if you really wanted to.

According to AdWeek the faceless anthropomorphic character is described as “a playful spirit and gifted athlete.” In a press release from Adam Kleinman global VP of Nerf’s parent company Hasbro he said that Murph ""represents this ageless unbridled fun that lives in all of us and creates a physical embodiment of that feeling you get when you play with Nerf.""

Reactions to Murph have been strong with people across the internet describing them as “nightmarish” “terrifying” and downright creepy. There hasn't been a mascot that has captured the attention of Twitter so well since Gritty. If the Philadelphia Flyers mascot was able to win the hearts and minds of the internet then so can Murph.

If you’ve yet to read the full story you can do that here but today we wanted to spotlight a member of the East Midlands Ghostbusters Toby Canham-James who was the key hand behind crafting George his very own unlicensed nuclear accelerator.





Upon watching George being gifted the pack my initial reaction was “That’s an incredible scratch-built scaled-down prop!” It turns out that while a ton of work went into the build it’s a HEAVILY modified rendition of the roleplay toy that Hasbro released last year with two being nearly unrecognizable from one another.

Given all the changes I’m also lost as to where to begin from the new textured paint application the addition of a ribbon cable hoses wires proper ion arm and even a Clippard valve and custom-made brass elbows.

Speaking with Toby he admits they he may have gone “a little overboard on it” even going as far as cutting partitions of the pack off including the plastic molded vacuum hose sanding down the visibly molded wires and adding additional sculpted detail.

While Toby was the craftsman behind the project he did mention his wife lent a hand making the kidney pads and ALICE straps out of an older adult-sized pair which were then attached to a frame made of plumbing pipe. Interior electronics were done by Ben of the Berkshire Ghostbusters who rigged up a custom configuration just for George.





Much like the pack the Neutrona Wand is also a heavily modified Hasbro roleplay toy the standard release of the Proton Blaster with vent holes wiring additional labels and decals all being added.

Good afternoon

On Sunday June 19 Americans will celebrate Juneteenth the oldest celebration of the end of slavery in the United States. As described on Juneteenth.com  “Juneteenth commemorates African American freedom and emphasizes education and achievement. It is a time for reflection and rejoicing. It is a time for assessment self-improvement and for planning the future.” Sometimes referred to as Juneteenth Independence Day or Freedom Day Juneteenth became the 11th federal holiday when President Biden signed a bill on June 17 2021 and will be observed this year on Monday June 20.

Trevor now 17 was living with his grandmother in Page County at the time; they settled in the Gloucester County community of Hayes in 2021. Because of addiction issues in the family she had full custody of him and his three siblings and was scraping by as a single guardian by cleaning houses.

MHS is a free private boarding school in Hershey Pennsylvania for boys and girls from lower income families. The program covers not only tuition but housing medical dental psychological food and clothing expenses for 2000 students from pre-kindergarten through high school.

Trevor’s best guess is that a sympathetic neighbor wanted to help. “Someone thought I’d be a good fit at the school” he said. “It was so lucky.”

Trevor applied to MHS was accepted and started there in seventh grade. Now a rising senior he is part of the construction/carpentry track in MHS’ Career and Technical Education (CTE) Program. He returns to Virginia for summers and school breaks.

This past year Trevor and 17 classmates built an entire small house from the ground up guided by their carpentry teacher. The 24-foot-long Tiny House with two sleeping lofts and a living room kitchen and bathroom will serve as lodging for future guests of the school.

“It was awesome to see it come together” Trevor said. “I always liked working with my hands and being outside but I learned that I can do more than I ever thought.”

Famed chocolatier Milton Hershey and his wife Catherine founded MHS in 1909 after they couldn’t have children of their own and decided to devote their fortune to youth education. The school is about a seven-hour drive from Gloucester Point.

Students live in more than 180 homes on campus each housing between eight and 12 kids of the same gender and approximate age. Every home is managed by a married houseparent couple with childcare experience.

During their senior year students move into apartment-style residences with adult support focusing on life skills such as budgeting and time management. MHS also helps many graduates with college tuition and transitional support to higher education or full-time careers.

Today Trevor’s sisters Lilee 12 and Aubree 9 attend MHS as well. His grandmother recently submitted an application for her 5-year-old grandnephew Noah — the other kids consider him their brother — who otherwise would start kindergarten at Abingdon Elementary School in Hayes.

“This school immediately changed Trevor’s life” said Trevor’s grandmother asking to be identified only by her first name Bekket. “Not only did it get him away from that cycle of addiction it completely turned him around with academics. He never would have gotten this far.”

By late elementary school in fact Trevor was struggling with reading and losing interest in all of his classes Bekket adds: “His thought process was ‘It doesn’t matter.’ He was so defeated. Now it’s ‘Yeah I can do this. I can figure it out.'”

CTE students in carpentry and construction classes tackle major projects every year including building candy houses for Hersheypark. “We have so many resources and opportunities that most high school kids don’t have” said Joe Fick Trevor’s carpentry teacher at MHS. “It’s such a blessing.”

For the maroon-and-white Tiny House students tackled walls framing roofing siding windows doors stairs railings crown molding painting and trim work. They installed flooring cabinetry appliances sinks and a toilet learning electrical and plumbing skills along the way.

Before going to MHS Trevor’s only building experience was using hammers saws and nails to make bike ramps. “There was so much equipment I never even knew existed” he said.

After graduation Trevor is considering going to college to study construction management. Another option is a full-time job in construction or carpentry either in Hershey or near his grandmother in Hayes.

Bekket is now a full-time parent to Noah thanks to Trevor’s grandfather figure a welder in Newport News who came into the family’s life about five years ago. And she is forever grateful for that mysterious mailbox flyer.

“Trevor and the girls love coming home and showing us what all they can do” she said. “Our story has been so filled with heartbreak for so long but MHS is taking us a different way.”

We asked this silicon photonics startup,"Science fiction is littered with fantastic visions of computing. One of the more pervasive is the idea that one day computers will run on light. After all what’s faster than the speed of light?

But it turns out Star Trek’s glowing circuit boards might be closer to reality than you think Ayar Labs CTO Mark Wade tells The Register. While fiber optic communications have been around for half a century we’ve only recently started applying the technology at the board level. Despite this Wade expects within the next decade optical waveguides will begin supplanting the copper traces on PCBs as shipments of optical I/O products take off.

Driving this transition are a number of factors and emerging technologies that demand ever-higher bandwidths across longer distances without sacrificing on latency or power.

If this sounds familiar these are the same challenges that drove telecommunication giants like Bell to replace thousands of miles of copper telephone cables with fiber optics in the 1970s.

As a general rule the higher the bandwidth the shorter the distance it can travel without the assistance of amplifiers or repeaters to extend the reach at the expense of latency. And this is hardly unique to telecommunications networks.

The same laws of physics apply to interconnect technologies like PCIe. As it doubles its effective bandwidth with each subsequent generation the physical distance the signal can travel shrinks.

“In a lot of cases long distances are now defined as anything more than a few meters” Wade said. “As the PCIe bandwidths are going higher and higher you can no longer escape the server board without putting a retimer on the board” to boost the signal.

“Even if you can get the bandwidth from point A to point B the question is with how much power and with how much latency” he adds.

Ayar Labs takes optical I/O to the centimeter scale

This is exactly the problem that Ayar Labs is trying to solve. The silicon photonics startup has developed a chiplet that takes electrical signals from chips and converts them into a high-bandwidth optical signal.

And because the technology uses chiplet architecture it’s intended to be packaged alongside compute tiles from other chipmakers using open standards like the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCI-express) which is currently in development.

The underlying technology has helped the company raise nearly $200 million from tech giants like Intel and Nvidia and secure several high-profile partnerships including one to bring optical I/O capabilities to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s high-performance Slingshot interconnect fabric.

Near-term applications

While Wade firmly believes that optical communication at the system level is inevitable he notes there are several applications for optical interconnects in the near term. These include high-performance computing and composable infrastructure.

“Our claim is that the electrical I/O problem is going to become so severe that computing applications are going to start to get throttled by their ability to shift bandwidth around” he said. “For us that's AI and machine learning scale out.”

These HPC environments often require specialized interconnect technologies to avoid bottlenecks. Nvidia’s NVLink is one example. It enables high-speed communication between up to four GPUs.

Another area of opportunity for optical I/O Wade says is the kind of rack-level composable infrastructure promised by Compute Express Link’s (CXL) latest specs.

CXL defines a common cache-coherent interface based on PCIe for interconnecting CPUs memory accelerators and other peripherals

The CXL 1.0 and CXL 2.0 specs promise to unlock a variety of memory pooling and tiered memory functionality. However the open standard’s third iteration expected to be ratified later this year will extend these capabilities beyond the rack level.

It’s at this stage of CXL’s development that Wade says optical’s advantages will be on full display.

“Even at the CXL 2.0 level you're very limited to the degree in which you can scale out because the moment you hit something like a retimer you start to incur latencies” that make memory pooling impractical he said.

However for at least the first generation of CXL products Wade expects most if not all will be electrical. “There's a lot of software stack work that has to get done to really enable these kind of disaggregated systems” before CXL will be ready for optical I/O he said.

But as the applications for optical I/O become more prevalent Wade predicts the supply chain economics will make the technology even more attractive from a cost perspective. “It's our belief that we're gonna see an optical I/O transformation start to hit throughout almost every market vertical that's building computing systems.”

Challenges aplenty

Of course getting there won’t be without its challenges and one of the biggest is convincing customers the technology is not only more performant and economically viable but mature enough for production environments.

This is specifically why Ayar Labs is focused on optical interconnects as opposed to co-packaged optics. One of the reasons that co-packaged optics haven’t taken off is their splash radius in the event of failure is significantly larger. If the optics fail on a co-packaged optical switch the entire appliance goes down. And many of these same concerns apply to optical I/O.

“Whenever you have a heavily commoditized standardized risk-averse application space that is not a place to try to deploy a new technology” Wade said. However “if you have a high-value application that highly benefits from increases in hardware performance then you're obviously going to take more risk.”

By focusing its attention on HPC environments Ayar believes it can refine its designs and establish a supply chain for components all while racking up the substantial field-operating hours necessary to sell to more mainstream markets.

Sci-Fi optical computers still more than a decade away

For customers that are ready and willing to risk deploying nascent technologies optical I/O is already here.

“The customer that we're delivering to right now has already replaced their board-level links with our optical I/O” Wade said. “Every socket-to-socket link is an optical I/O link and that's even at the board level.”

As the technology matures the question then becomes whether the optical waveguides will ever get integrated into the PCB — ala Star Trek.

“Will we see the optical waveguides getting integrated into the boards? I do think we’ll see some of that emerge actually within the next decade” he said. “As the volume of optical I/O solutions start to get massive it’ll make it more attractive for some of these solutions.”

Once you start shrinking beyond the board level the future of optical I/O gets a bit murkier. The next logical step Wade says would be using optics to connect the individual dies that make up the chip.

However he doesn’t expect this to happen anytime soon. “As you go into the millimeter scale electrical I/O has I think a healthy roadmap in front of it” he said. “Beyond 10-15 years we might see… optical communication start to enter the millimeter scale regime.” ®",,,,,,,,,,,,

The relaxed low-key setting featuring swaying palm trees and dreamy blue waters regularly filled my head throughout my childhood. Plus the island is one of the easiest in the Florida Keys to reach as its northern location in the chain means it boasts proximity to action-packed Miami.

You could easily fly into Miami International Airport (MIA) take a short 90-minute road trip south and enjoy a long weekend visit on Key Largo. The same can't be said for Key West which is roughly 100 miles farther from Miami making it a much longer haul unless you fly to Key West itself. Those routes often require a connection and cost considerably more though making Key Largo the better bet overall.

Like many tropical islands Key Largo offers its fair share of hotels and resorts. You'll have plenty of full- and limited-service options to choose from though two properties are especially popular with points-savvy beachgoers and relaxation-seekers: Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo Curio Collection by Hilton and Playa Largo Resort & Spa Autograph Collection. This duo of beachfront resorts from Hilton and Marriott offers an array of perks ideal for lounging by the water while taking advantage of elite status benefits.

So when I decided to finally book that bucket list trip to Key Largo I naturally considered Baker's Cay and Playa Largo when picking accommodations. However choosing between the two proved difficult. I couldn't bring myself to go with one over the other so I opted to split our stay and sample both properties. Although I enjoyed each resort there were noticeable differences between them making each quite distinct.

Here's a head-to-head look at Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo and Playa Largo Resort & Spa on sunny Key Largo.

First impressions and booking basics

Given their locations on idyllic Key Largo Baker's Cay and Playa Largo cater to travelers seeking an island escape. While Hilton-affiliated Baker's Cay has been around decades longer both properties offer a fresh modern take on a Florida beach resort.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Featuring 200 rooms and suites 13-acre Baker's Cay originally debuted as the Hilton Key Largo in 1985.

However it reinvented itself when it reopened in 2018 after a multiyear closure. Now part of Hilton's Curio Collection the property pays homage to its history as a pineapple plantation owned by captain Ben Baker through its name and use of pineapples throughout.

As you may expect the reimagined resort offers a mix of old and new. Numerous areas appear chic and contemporary while other spaces feature decor and architectural details common in the 1980s. You don't have to be a renovation expert to quickly gauge how much time effort and money went into the refurbishment.

During our Memorial Day weekend visit cash rates were around $1000 per night so we used 90000 Hilton Honors points per night to pay for our junior suite which cost the same as a standard room. It was a fantastic use of Hilton points as we netted more than 1 cent in value per point spent double what I bought them at. Another bonus: Because we paid with points the $45 nightly resort fee was waived.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

Following some development in the 1980s and early 1990s Key Largo fell into a bit of a new-construction drought until Playa Largo opened its doors in 2016.

Situated on 14 1/2 acres this sprawling Autograph Collection outpost is home to 177 rooms suites and bungalows plus a three-bedroom beach house with a private pool.

While the entire resort overlooks the beach its centerpiece is the large zero-entry pool which sits front and center and is a clear hub of activity.

Like Baker's Cay cash rates at Playa Largo were high for our travel dates because of the holiday weekend. In fact it's not uncommon to see them creep close to $1000 per night. So instead of paying around $600 for our one-night stay we used 60000 Marriott Bonvoy points to cover the cost of our two-queen balcony room. However we still had to pay the $55 nightly resort fee even though we redeemed points for our room an annoying downside to award stays at Marriott hotels.

The lobby

While it isn't the end-all-be-all of a vacation who doesn't love a nice space to start your stay or relax with a newspaper and a cup of coffee in the morning? A lobby does not make or break a hotel but it does set the tone for what you can expect during your visit. If done right it can really wow you with its design and atmosphere.

Odds are high that you will feel like you are in for quite a treat when you walk into the massive lobby at Baker's Cay. Offering floor-to-high-ceiling windows everywhere you turn the sleek space features a cool coastal vibe with modern light fixtures fresh furniture and even a fun library with a pool table. It's the perfect place to curl up in when you have some time to kill especially on days when rain showers make an appearance outside.

Playa Largo Resort's lobby had a number of highlights too. The swinging chairs were a hit with the kids and the pool and ocean views from the balcony couldn't be beaten. I also loved the complimentary welcome drink I received when we checked in.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Overall this wasn't a bad spot to start and end the trip. However there was a strong seemingly intentional scent that I wasn't fond of and the space felt surprisingly dated despite the hotel being less than 10 years old. In the end even with the included drink the lobby here couldn't live up to the modern welcoming space found down the road at Baker's Cay.

Rooms

A lobby is a passing fancy but rooms are key to a memorable stay. This is where new construction often sets itself apart from older properties.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

While being able to book a junior suite at the same award rate as a standard room was undoubtedly a major plus the property's accommodations felt older despite being renovated to look nice.

The room wasn't a bad space by any stretch but it was very narrow and a bit dark. Not to mention the pullout couch the kids used left something to be desired. The bathroom was cute but relatively cramped especially when compared to other options in the area. Perhaps the standard rooms feel a bit brighter and fresher but the junior suite certainly lacked the fresh feel I look for in a hotel room thanks in part to the layout.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

A much-appreciated contrast to the dated rooms at Baker's Cay the rooms at Playa Largo didn't just look fresh bright and airy — they felt that way when inside them.

There was plenty of counter space and outlets as well as a bathroom thoughtfully designed to be just as functional as it was beautiful. I loved the modern decor in white tan and blue hues which felt like an updated version of your stereotypical beach hotel. The comfortable beds were a welcome bonus too.

The beach

Now we're getting to the good stuff.

Although the Florida Keys are not known for their beaches as they're generally small and human-made they feature beautiful blue water that's ideal for snorkeling and diving.

While both of these resorts technically have beaches they're not quite the same as what you'll find in the 30A area near Destin and other parts of Florida.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Baker's Cay has a private beach that was very lively and popular from sunrise to sunset ... and beyond.

At first glance the beach looked fairly traditional with a gently sloping white-sand shore and mostly calm water. However there were some welcome surprises too including a few nooks with hammocks accessible via a trail that led guests away from the main beach area.

There were ample chaises though the lack of shade was a bit of a drawback. Unless you get there early and claim one of the few loungers under a tree you'll find yourself directly in the sun. Additionally there was an outdoor tiki bar serving a variety of cool drinks.

Away from the sand you can take advantage of the resort's nonmotorized water toys which the resort fee mostly covers. You can also cast a line off the property's dock with the loaner fishing equipment.

No matter what your ideal beach day looks like you'll want to make sure you come back at sunset as the view was truly breathtaking.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

A useable beach area is also available at Playa Largo but it may be a bit different than you are used to.

You can't walk from the sand directly out into the water as it is supported by a concrete wall. There are some handy stairs that you can use to easily get from dry land to water and back again but it's not a zero-entry beach where you and your toddler can sit with your legs at the edge of the water and build sandcastles.

Still the beach had a standout feature I wasn't expecting: a fire pit. I really enjoyed that area especially at sunset when it came alive as a hangout space.

Pools

In an oceanfront destination where beaches are not the main draw such as the Florida Keys you best believe there are noteworthy pools to offset that potential con.

Fortunately both Baker's Cay and Playa Largo offer pools. Unsurprisingly they're very different from each other.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

At Baker's Cay there are two waterfall grotto pools which sit back to back in a far corner of the resort. One is designed with families in mind while the other is an adults-only sanctuary.

We didn't spend any time in the pools but we did pop over to take a peek. There was some discoloring at the bottom of the main pool giving me the sense that this space was excluded from the more recent round of renovations. Considering rooms cost $1000 per night here the pools felt like a major letdown.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

Playa Largo by contrast only offered one pool but it was more in line with what I look for at a pricey beach resort.

While empty early in the morning it got quite crowded later in the day. There were lots of cabanas you could rent for a fee as well as a DJ and poolside food and beverage options. It may not be what you're looking for if you're seeking peace and quiet but its size location and beach views made it our clear favorite.

Restaurants and bars

On vacation eating out should be part of the fun. Both of these properties offered some standout moments when it came to food and beverages though one excelled over the other.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

You have your pick of a few different spots for snacks and meals at Baker's Cay.

There's Calusa the slightly more upscale option where modern American fare with a Creole-Caribbean twist is on the menu. Dishes here highlight locally sourced seafood and produce making the eatery feel right at home in the Keys.

We pretty much annihilated Calusa's Skiff seafood platter ($40) with shrimp oysters tuna tartare and smoked fish dip which felt like a decent deal overall. The Tuna Tower ($22) and complimentary bread were good enough too but we were more impressed with the Cucumber Cooler cocktail made with gin lemon juice and ginger ale ($14) and the Key lime pie ($10) which had a crumbly graham cracker crust white chocolate coconut meringue and guava glaze.

During our stay we also visited the more casual Dry Rocks establishment. The part-restaurant part-bar venue had live music and a laid-back vibe that fit perfectly with the open-air setting.

Standouts here were the breakfast pizza served on naan with fried eggs arugula and salsa ($14) the huevos rancheros ($16) and the fresco tacos ($18).

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

Dining options at Playa Largo are also plentiful. In addition to the casual outdoor bar there's Las Olas — a ceviche bar we didn't get a chance to try — plus Mediterranean-inspired La Marea and seafood-focused Sol by the Sea.

We tried La Marea for breakfast and found the standard morning fare to be solid. It was perfectly fine for a buffet breakfast though it didn't offer anything particularly noteworthy.

At night we dined at the open-air Sol by the Sea restaurant for dinner but our visit started off on the wrong foot. Despite making a reservation for a patio table for four we were seated on the sand at a table for two which was not going to work given how many of us were there and my extreme susceptibility to bugs. It took a fair amount of pushback on our part to get moved but we were ultimately accommodated.

Once we got past the seating debacle we ordered a few seafood dishes though they were OK at best. The average taste of the food wasn't worth the cost hassle or slow service.

Elite status perks

Given the properties' ties to major hotel chains they are both decent options for those with elite status. However despite the close race between the two when comparing the perks they give loyal guests one ultimately came out on top by offering a more favorable approach to hotel elite status benefits.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Hilton offers two tangible perks to those with mid-tier Hilton Gold status (which is blessedly very easy to earn).

The first isn't actually status-related but is connected to the loyalty program so I'll include it. By not charging resort fees on award stays members can save a considerable amount of money simply by using points. In the case of Baker's Cay that meant saving $45 per night which quickly added up for our multinight stay.

Additionally guests get a food and beverage credit of $36 per day (or $18 per person per day for up to two people) to apply toward any meals and drinks charged to their room. It's not the free breakfast Hilton Gold and Diamond members used to get in the U.S. so I ended up spending more on food than I used to since breakfast for four cost about $100 per day but it did help cover a couple of evening cocktails.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

Like Baker's Cay Playa Largo offers a food and beverage benefit to guests with at least Marriott Platinum Elite status. At this property that meant complimentary breakfast and two evening cocktails during the resort's nightly sunset celebration.

Although the breakfast certificates we received technically said we could enjoy the Light Mercata breakfast for two people for free we were actually given the full breakfast for all four of us without any extra charges though we may have gotten lucky during our visit. That combined with our free pina coladas at night — which my 12-year-old and I loved (one was a mocktail of course) — probably saved us about $100 during our one-night stay.

Since the waived resort fees at Hilton properties is not a listed elite benefit I'll give the edge to Playa Largo.

Activities and amenities

If you get bored at either resort you're probably doing it wrong ... unless of course that's your goal. In that case relax away.

Should you crave a bit more action during your stay there's one resort that seemed to have more going on than the other.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Despite spending a lot of our time away from the property boating and snorkeling we still kept running into all kinds of fun things to do on site including nighttime outdoor movies (with free full-size candy!) morning fishing with bait late-night s'mores by the fire pit and daytime races with remote control cars.

It was really adorable seeing how many guests took part in the property's activities. The availability and participation in these events gave the resort a feeling of cohesiveness and togetherness that was not only charming but timeless.

Amenities were abundant at Playa Largo with everything from water activities to multiple indoor play spaces to a spa.

However even with our limited time at the property every member of my family that walked through the kids areas immediately wanted to walk out. During our visit they were unstaffed a bit dirty and felt a little abandoned and far from welcoming despite their bright colors.

There was a calendar of events available to guests but given the limited options we weren't that disappointed to be missing out on them during our one-night stay. Baker's Cay had many more things going on than Playa Largo.

Winner: Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Bottom line

There's no denying that my family and I had a great time at both resorts so don't let any nitpicking dissuade you from booking a stay at either property. If you are going for at least a long weekend you may even want to try both out like we did so you get two vacations in one.

Baker's Cay offers a fantastic selection of restaurants activities and common areas though its pools and rooms leave a lot to be desired. Conversely Playa Largo had a phenomenal pool modern accommodations and a terrific breakfast benefit but its dining options and beach were a bit underwhelming.

Regardless of which property you choose — if you limit yourself to one — be prepared for sticker shock especially if you're expecting a high-end feel when spending close to $1000 per night. To lessen the blow consider cashing in points to cover at least some of your stay. That way all that's left to worry about is which swimsuits and pairs of flip-flops to pack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdG9waG90ZWwubmV3cy9kb3VibGV0cmVlLWJyYW5kLW1vdmVzLWludG8tbW9yb2Njby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DoubleTree brand moves into Morocco - THP News,"Left to right: Zaid Ali (chairman of Marina Agadir) and Jochem Jan Sleiffer (president Middle East Africa Turkey at Hilton) – Imagery © 2022 Hilton.

Belinda Bencic has made it through to a second consecutive German Open final after getting the better of Maria Sakkari 6-7(6) 6-4 6-4 in a real battle of the wills encounter.

The eighth seed recovered from a set down to emerge victorious in a gruelling contest that lasted three hours and seven minutes.

Speaking to Amazon Prime after the match Bencic reflected: “I really don’t know how it happened. I mean it was such an even match and we really gave it all. We didn’t give each other any presents.

“And it was really long! We fought our best and the crowd was really electric so thank you very much for being so into it.

“Maria played really well – she’s a top player and she has played so many grand slam semi-finals so she knows how to go deep. She didn’t give me anything.”

After losing the 2021 final to Liudmula Samsonova Bencic was asked what she will do different this year when she meets either Ons Jabeur or Coco Gauff in Sunday’s final.

Bencic responded: “The difference is that I can turn it around and be the winner but I’m really happy about today first of all.

“I’m really excited to be in the final I didn’t imagine about playing two finals in a row here in Berlin so I must really like it here.”

The Swiss had to dig deep after surrendering a set point at 6-5 in the first-set tie-break as the second seed Sakkari recovered with a thrilling backhand winner before hitting a return winner off the netcord.

Bencic wasn’t going to be denied however and she took control of the second set by converting a fifth break point with a return winner as she took the match into a decisive third set.

She held her nerve ending the stalemate in the 10th game by converting her third match point followed by a strong backhand with a put-away winner.

In the other semi-final Ons Jabeur beat Coco Gauff 7-6(4) 6-2 to join Bencic in the final.

After an early exchange of breaks a tie-break was needed to settle the first set. Jabeur quickly led 6-2 before Gauff erased two set points but the Tunisian star finished with a strong ace to take the opener.

Jabeur raced into a 5-1 lead in the second; the world No. 4 didn’t allow it to get as tight as the first winning 6-2 to close the match in straight sets and set up a final tie with Bencic.

Jabeur - who had lost three of her four previous meetings against Gauff had the match wrapped up in 1 hour and 17 minutes in their first grass-court encounter.

The top seed is looking to land her second grass-court title after becoming the first Arab woman to win a Hologic WTA Tour singles title last year as she claimed the trophy on the Birmingham lawns.

ROSWELL Ga. — Roswell firefighters are being celebrated after coordinating a complex rescue of a Home Depot employee.

The City of Roswell Fire Department was called to the home improvement store Tuesday after an employee was reportedly suffering a traumatic injury.

Crews rushed to the store along Holcomb Bridge Road and learned a woman was impaled by a 5-foot-long pry bar through her abdomen and was wedged between a forklift and a cardboard compactor according to the department.

A paramedic at the scene called for a ladder truck and specialized equipment for the technical rescue operation RFD said in a news release. Firefighters then started their efforts to carefully extricate the patient while providing medical care.

She enters all relevant information including billing delivery address and credit card details and then hits send. As the data is transmitted from her server to the Home Depot server an attacker captures the information.



The attacker uses the information to duplicate the order and changes the delivery address. Margie gets her credit card bill and is shocked to find the double order. The attacker has new furniture and Margie has to call the bank. 8 Ways to Prevent Replay Attacks I’m going to use the word session quite a bit here so let’s start with what that is exactly. In the context of replay attacks a session is two devices acknowledging each other via a network connection for the purposes of data sharing or transmission. The session ends when one or both devices terminate the connection or if times out due to inactivity. Think of a phone call — one person calls another and the call (session) ends when one party hangs up or the call drops. Just as a third party can listen in on a call to gain private information cybercriminals can intercept sensitive account information during a session. Replay attacks may be as simple as spamming an inbox with repeat emails or more advanced like committing identity fraud. Fortunately you can use the following methods to protect all of your session data and avoid replay attacks: Require a Session Key Session keys can only be used once within a specific time period to encrypt and decrypt data. When the message is sent the session key is randomly generated. This way only the sender and receiver have access to the communication. Any subsequent sessions require a different session key. The use of session keys is beneficial because even if attackers discovered the key it’s useless. Duplicating it doesn’t make sense as the key is for one use only. Encrypt Your Online Traffic The use of 256-bit AES encryption for all data transmission is one of the best ways to help prevent replay attacks. Encrypting the traffic between your device and chosen server hides your data by scrambling it so no one can interfere with your connection. A VPN is one of the best ways to encrypt your traffic as it travels between client and destination (VPN) servers. Reliable VPNs use military-grade encryption to scramble your data and secure VPN tunneling protocols like OpenVPN and WireGuard®. VPN protocols protect your traffic as it moves between your device and the server your session interacts with. That way even if a cybercriminal gains access to your session data they can’t decrypt it. Use Private Internet Access to secure your connections with 256-bit AES encryption and stay safe from replay attacks. Encrypt Your Traffic Now Create Timestamps A timestamp is a digital record that can include the time and date of data transmission. Most documents and images include a basic timestamp including the creation date and when they were last edited. Timestamps are created by the sender device system or a trusted third party. Timestamping Authorities (TSAs) use a public key infrastructure (PKI) to enable data encryption and signing which ensures that timestamps are legitimate and unaltered. A timestamp allows you to track: ✅ When an account/file was last accessed or edited ✅ The validity of financial transactions ✅ The quality and integrity of data ✅ When documents were signed Secure timestamps assign a sequence order for sessions. That way you can void a session immediately if a failure occurs. For example evidence of tampering or someone attempting to duplicate a session transaction. Use One-Time Passwords (OTPs) If you’ve ever forgotten the password to your email you’ve probably used an OTP. The process is simple: you get a code on your recovery email or phone so you can access your account. Single-use passwords can consist of characters numbers and punctuation marks. OTPs like session keys are usually only valid for a short amount of time. OTP is also used as a form of two-factor authentication which is one of the methods used by companies for SRA network connections. Types of OTP Tokens Type Method Example Soft Token SMS Message Text with an OTP common for password recovery sent to a mobile phone often used for TFA. Soft Token Push Notification Prompt sent when accessing email from an unknown device often sent to a phone often used for TFA. Soft Token Email Verification Email containing an OTP commonly sent to recovery email mostly used for password reset. Hard Token USB-Connected Key fob or smart card used to gain secure access physical token. Hard Token Biometrics Using a fingerprint voice or retinal to gain secure access to sensitive data often used for TFA. Hard Token Contactless Recognizes you via a Bluetooth device associated with the account to gain secure access often used for TFA. Pay Attention to Security Protocols Enable SSL and/or TLS in your browser settings. These protocols generate the equivalent of four session keys between the origin and destination servers during transmission which makes it harder for attackers to use replay attacks. You can enable these protocols in your browser easily using the instructions below. How to Enable SSL/TLS In Your Browser



Chrome: Open the browser > Press Alt F > Settings > Scroll to Advanced Settings> Scroll to System > Click Open Proxy Settings > Select the Advanced tab > Scroll to Security > Check ‘SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.2’ > Press OK > Close browser > Restart the browser.



Safari: New Safari versions automatically use TLS 1.2 SSL is unavailable.



Firefox: Open the browser > Type ‘about:config’ in the address bar> Press Enter > Type ‘TLS’ in Search > Find ‘security.tls.version.min’ and double click > Set integer to 3 for TLS 1.2 > Press OK > Close Firefox > Restart Firefox.



Edge: Open the browser >Internet Options > Internet Properties > Advanced > Security > Select ‘Use SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.2’ > Press OK > Close browser > Restart the app. Using a VPN is easier than modifying your browser settings especially if you change devices a lot. VPNs offer tough security protocols like OpenVPN and WireGuard® for secure data transfer. A VPN encrypts your traffic for maximum protection against replay attacks. The added benefit is that it covers everything not just browsers. Get Private Internet Access for secure access to all your apps anywhere. Try Private Internet Access Ask for a Digital Signature Use digital signatures to authenticate and verify a message or transaction’s origin status and validity. A digital signature is encrypted by its creator using a private key so only the recipient (signer) receives a linked public key. One key is useless without the other ensuring the intended party is the only one who can access the contents protected by the private key. I’ve given a brief overview of some of the most common digital signature methods below. PINs OTPs or SMS codes for authentication A PIN is used the same way one uses OTPs and SMS codes to authenticate access to networks files and accounts. Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) A CRC is an error-detecting code that’s used for verification on storage devices and digital networks. It detects any modification of raw data such as reversed bits or bits lost during transmission. Bits are the smallest unit of data measurement so in theory nothing slips past CRC. If an anomaly is found an error window pops up with the text ‘Data error (cyclic redundancy check)’. Digital Certificates Digital certificates are managed by certificate authority (CA) verification to avoid the creation of false digital certifications. Timestamps are commonly included on digital signature certificates and are highly traceable making it harder for replay attacks to occur. The infrastructure of digital signatures follows a standard PKI method so vendor keys are made and stored securely. This ensures they are legally valid and makes them incredibly popular as a form of securing sensitive information worldwide. Three classes of digital signature certificates exist: Class 1 Class 2 and Class 3. Classes of Digital Signature Certificates Class Security Level Example Proofing Process Use Case 1 > Basic E-signing documents. Validated via email ID and username. Low risk of data manipulation or compromisation. 2 > Moderate Taxes E-filing. Authenticates signers identity against a verified database of users. Moderate risk of data compromise. 3 > Maximum Court filings E-tendering Requires the signer to identify themselves in front of certifying authorities. High-risk threat to data or consequences of security breach. Secure Your Network Connections A rise in remote work and office locations makes it more important than ever to secure any network connections you use. Many home networks aren’t adequately secured and most companies do little to stress the importance of SRA. The easiest way to ensure secure access to network resources remotely is a VPN. VPNs scramble your data with high-level encryption and use the toughest most secure tunneling protocols during transmission. Stay Vigilant to Prevent Replay Attacks Access management requires vigilance especially in the remote office era. Otherwise you leave your company yourself and your co-workers open to replay attacks and other cyber threats. Using methods like SMS authentication or OTPs isn’t enough. You need to make sure your networks (remote and physical) are adequately protected. That includes properly protecting data traffic during transmission.

A replay attack is when an attacker invades a transmission or communication between the client server and the destination server. The attacker delays or replicates the valid transmission. Replay attacks are passive attacks that happen in real-time and are difficult to detect due to a lack of data alteration. Counter the attack by protecting your data during transmission with a VPN that provides high-level encryption. VPNs also provide strong stable connections using protocols like WireGuard®. Is a replay attack a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack? Yes. Replay attacks fall into the category of MitM attacks. Replay attacks happen while servers are communicating with each other. Any attack where hackers intercept traffic as it’s traveling between two servers is considered an MitM attack.

So it was altogether fitting that Garmin last week announced it has delivered 25000 integrated flight decks which if laid end to end would easily reach across town to where BendixKing used to have its headquarters. I just made that up but it seems plausible and even if it isn’t that’s a lot of avionics over 19 years and it doesn’t include the mega-selling GNS boxes. “Integrated” means the G1000 and its evolutionary progeny the G3000 and G5000 which increasingly find their way into turboprops and bizjets. They don’t quite own the latter market but you can imagine them getting there.

I have had the good fortune of watching all this unfold in real time over the past … let’s see 30 years. By tech standards that is a glacial pace when you consider that when Garmin was founded in 1989 Windows 3 had just arrived and the Intel 80386 chip was the hot system to run it. The Macintosh classic with its single clunky disc drive0 was the competition. What cellphone did you have then? You didn’t. They were a few years over the horizon.

There are several remarkable aspects of this story but the defining one—it’s really more of a question—is why so few companies emerged to persistently compete with Garmin. BendixKing was ideally positioned not to be overrun by an upstart. In 1990 it dominated the OEM market with the Silver Crown system. You expected to see it in new aircraft and buyers perusing used aircraft ads in Trade-A-Plane breezed past offerings if they didn’t mention Silver Crown. Garmin’s capture of the market was gradual and it started with portable GPS.

Gary Burrell had been an engineer at King Radio and before that at Allied Signal and along with Taiwanese-born Min Kao he launched Garmin in 1989. Kao was an expert in the Kalman filtering technology that makes modern accurate GPS navigation possible. The inaugural product was the ProNav 100 with ProNav being the original name of the company. Because of trademark issues they changed it to Garmin a portmanteau of their first names. The product became the GPS 100. I still have mine. It’s a brick with sentimental value.

For a time there in the mid-1990s it looked like GPS would be a vital and highly competitive market. It was the golden age of the GPS portable. In a 1996 report I wrote this: “Although glutted and confusing one thing is certain about the portable GPS market: If you don’t like the current models wait around a couple of weeks something else will come along shortly. With any luck it might even better or at least cheaper than the current crop.” Besides Garmin Lowrance IIMorrow Magellan and Trimble were all flogging GPS although Garmin always seemed to be a step ahead.

When panel mount GPS came into view around 1994 Garmin still had competition from IIMorrow Northstar BendixKing Trimble and Magellan. Remember Narco? Of course you don’t but it was out there pitching a panel mount called the StarNav and even pre-dated Garmin’s entry into the market with the GNS line. From out of the blue a GPS survey company called Ashtech popped up with a stunning color navigator called the AV-12. That was in 1995 three years before Garmin introduced the GNS 430 and later the 530. Avidyne beat Garmin to the market with big glass in the Cirrus and so did ARNAV which pioneered the first large moving map display in the original SR20. Although it was crude by modern standards it was out there first. ARNAV is gone but Avidyne still represents credible competition for Garmin at least in the aftermarket.

Yet on its way to multiple thousands of integrated panels not to mention many multiple thousands of discrete panel navigators indicators and lately electronic flight instruments Garmin steamrolled over the lot of them sometimes with products not necessarily better than the competition. For a time during the 1990s I taught a traveling GPS training show for AOPA and my favorite easiest-to-teach box was the Trimble TNL 2000. It was easier to use than Garmin’s GPS 155.

So why did Garmin succeed so brilliantly where the others stumbled? In my view several reasons all wrapped up in one word: will. Garmin always had a single-minded focus on new product introductions. Trimble did two dedicated portables IIMorrow (later UPSAT) did a couple as did Magellan. Lowrance was more prolific but none of them managed either the cadence of introductions or the features Garmin rolled out in no fewer than 15 portables. When the first color portables appeared from Garmin in 2004 it was pretty much game over for the rest.

From the beginning Garmin was a technical/engineering-focused company always on the hunt for young talent. I forget who told me this—might have been someone at Garmin—but the company was famous for hiring “20-20s.” Engineers who were 20-something years old at $20000-something a year. Whether that’s true or not–Garmin’s Carly Hysell says it isn’t–that was the buzz then and it explained why Garmin always had technical projects simmering while BendixKing never seemed to. When Garmin arrived with portables capable enough to display real time aircraft attitude it was a tour de force no other company matched and it wouldn’t be matched until iPads starting using inexpensive portable AHRS.

Garmin has been relentless in its marketing with persistent in-house prepared promotion and customer and technical support and a laser-like focus on the OEM business. That explains why the vast majority of new aircraft are equipped with Garmin glass. Don’t want a full-blown G1000? OK fine how about a G3X Touch then? Still too much? Whatsamatter with the aera 760 or GI 275 gyros with GTN navigators? You simply can’t escape a Garmin solution that works. As one of their salespeople told me once “We won’t stop until we get all of your money.” Grim truth maybe but of such stuff is success made.

Garmin also did something wise about diversification. Trimble and Ashtech for instance were GPS survey companies and they diversified—halfheartedly—into aviation which was already well served and a small market. Garmin went the other way leveraging its aviation-derived expertise into the marine outdoor and fitness segments the latter two of which were driven by an energetic demographic bubble. It paid off. According to Garmin’s annual report aviation accounts for $712 million of its $4.9 billion revenues with a profit of $192 million. Not too long ago aviation had the highest percentage profit margin but now the outdoor market at nearly twice the revenue of aviation shows a higher margin at least for 2021. I don’t know if these are standalone business units responsible for their own internal capital but if you’re trying to develop new products it’s much better to be in a highly profitable company than in one that isn’t.

The first time I visited Garmin maybe around 1991 or 1992 the company was housed in one of those office strips of the sort small medical practices have. Now Garmin HQ is two feet short of being the tallest skyscraper in Olathe Kansas. I’m pretty sure if you stacked up a few days worth of G1000 production you could easily reach the top.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc2luZm90ZWNoLmNvbS90b3AtNS1wcmVzc3VyZS1zZW5zb3ItbWFudWZhY3R1cmVycy1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 5 Pressure Sensor Manufacturers in the World,"Top 5 Pressure Sensor Manufacturers in the World Here we have enlisted the top 5 pressure sensor manufacturers in the world;

Weekly Recap: Pratt Industries and HP Siegwerk and EFI Lead This Week’s News

The most viewed news on our site for the week ended June 17 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi93ZS10b29rLWEtc2hvdGd1bi1yaWRlLWluLXRoZS0zMDAtaHAtMjAyMy10b3lvdGEtZ3ItY29yb2xsYS1hbmQtd2VyZS10b3RhbGx5LWltcHJlc3NlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We Took A Shotgun Ride In The 300 HP 2023 Toyota GR Corolla And We're Totally Impressed,"Toyota has a reputation for being a bit boring but the company is trying to change that by embracing a sportier and more exciting lineup.

We’ve already seen the fruits of their labor as the GR86 is a wonderful driver’s car while the GR Supra can tear things up on the track.

However they’re just getting started as the 2023 GR Corolla aims to combine thrills with five doors. After one lap at the Eagles Canyon Raceway it appears the company has succeeded.

We’ll have to wait a little longer to get behind the wheel ourselves but the car was undeniably impressive in the hands of a professional racing driver. While they can make virtually anything look good the GR Corolla seemed unflappable during our brief ride along.

Thanks to all-wheel drive and a turbocharged 1.6-liter three-cylinder engine developing 300 hp (224 kW / 304 PS) and 273 lb-ft (370 Nm) of torque the hatch has plenty of power and the traction to make the most out of it. On the topic of all-wheel drive the GR-Four system is adjustable and offers front/rear power splits of 60:40 50:50 and 30:70. This means the car can be front biased neutral or rear biased at the twist of a knob.

While that’s a trick party feature the all-wheel drive system has other benefits as well as it helped the hatch to stay remarkably composed even after hopping the curb and heading for the grass. Furthermore the GR-Four system provides plenty of grip and it’s aided by Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires that are wrapped in 18-inch gloss-black wheels.

The latter are backed up by a beefy braking system that features four-piston calipers and 14-inch (356 mm) discs up front as well as 11.7-inch discs (297 mm) and two-piston calipers out back. These are a massive upgrade over the standard model’s discs that measure 11.5 inches (292 mm) front and 10.5 inches (267 mm) rear. Thus the GR Corolla has impressive stopping power as well as enough endurance to handle repeated laps. However with dozens of journalists eager for a ride Toyota had to break out the leaf blowers to cool things off between runs.

We’ll have a lot more to say about the GR Corolla in the future but the car seems to have a firm but comfortable ride. It’s also worth noting that after a day of driving Supras and Lexus LCs I was relieved to find the GR Corolla offers plenty of headroom even when wearing a helmet. The sport seats also provide supportive bolstering while the three-cylinder engine and triple exhaust have a sporting note that sounds better than expected.

In 1997 Del Mar acquired its first permanent public artwork A River Of Time — a bronze and redwood sculpture by acclaimed artist James Hubbell funded by an anonymous donor through the Del Mar Foundation.

On June 3 2022 community members gathered to observe the unveiling of two bronze plaques identifying the artwork. Del Mar resident Susan Childs had recently noticed that the Hubbell sculpture lacked identifying information and she generously donated to DMF for these plaques so that information about this significant artwork is available to those viewing the sculpture.

The reception at the Del Mar Library sponsored by DMF and Friends of the Del Mar Library brought together city and library officials representatives of the Ilan-Lael Foundation founded by the Hubbells Del Mar Garden Club members who are responsible for the garden where the sculpture is located and supporters of public art. Together attendees celebrated the artist the donor who made the artwork possible and the collaborative efforts in 1997-99 that made this first public art acquisition possible.",,,,,,,,,

Beach volleyball: Brandie Wilkerson and Sophie Bukovec are vice world champions

Brandie Wilkerson and Sophie Bukovec claim a pair of silver medals at the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships in Rome Italy on Sunday. In just their fourth tournament together the duo climbed the second step of the podium after falling to Brazil’s Eduarda (Duda) Lisboa and Ana Patricia Ramos.

With a perfect record of seven wins leading up to the gold medal match the Canadians did not experience the same success in the final match as their reign of supremacy came to an end. Brazil won the championship in straight sets of 21-16 21-19. Nevertheless Wilkerson and Bukovec had a tough fight against their opponents where a few small details made all the difference.

Visibly nervous the Canadians did not get off to a strong start dropping seven of the game’s first nine points. Wilkerson and Bukovec gradually found their rhythm but the gap was too difficult to overcome in the first set. The second was a much better show of good exchanges and strong attacks. The two teams went neck and neck until Brazil won three in a row to take a 14-10 lead.

After recovering their serve Canada managed a challenge on the next point. While the referee had awarded the point to the Brazilians Wilkerson asked for a review for a final touch on the net. The video replay proved her right and the gap was only a single point rather than three. The Canadians followed that up with two more straight points to take the lead for the first time in the game. The momentum seemed to have changed sides.

However Duda and Ana Patricia took a timeout to cut the pace. They won the next two rallies to regain the lead and then confirmed their victory a few minutes later on an efficient attack from Ana Patricia.

In Saturday’s semifinals Canada dominated the first set but Germany’s Svenja Müller and Cinja Tillmann stormed back in the second set to force a tie-break. In the end Germany could not hold off Canada’s pressure and early lead. Canada won 2-1 (15-21 21-15 12-15) to land in the gold medal match.

In the other women’s semifinal match Brazil’s Duda Lisboa and Ana Patricia Ramos defeated Heidrich and Vergé-Dépré of Switzerland 2-0 (21-19 21-13) to earn the opportunity to play for gold.

This marks the second consecutive time that Canada has a team in the finals of the women’s World Championships. In 2019 Olympians Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes won the championship in identical straight sets of 23-21 23-21 for Canada’s first-ever medal in the tournament.

The Saginaw City Council will weigh establishing an obsolete property rehabilitation district for 12 years at the 12-story Huntington Bank building at the intersection of Genesee and North Washington.

The planned vote during a Monday June 20 meeting would create state tax benefits to curb redevelopment costs at Saginaw’s tallest building.

No redevelopment plans are set in stone but the council’s blessing would represent one of several obstacles overcome as Michigan Community Capital officials continue to consider purchasing and repurposing the property said Eric Hanna president and chief executive officer of the Lansing-based nonprofit.

“We’ve made strong incremental progress but there’s still lots of continuing and ongoing due diligence” he said. “The building is 170000 square feet so the financial side of this and the physical side of this are going to take some time. There’s a bunch of work left to do with lenders and other funders to confirm that the sufficient amount of capital — and the right kind of capital — is available to do this project.”

His nonprofit’s application for the obsolete property rehabilitation district designation revealed some details of the prospective redevelopment but Hanna said those specifics could change before a purchase.

“There’s a high degree of volatility in interest rates and the public sector’s resources; and on the construction side lumber prices have been swinging like a yo-yo and all the metals and commodities prices have been insane” he said.

“It’s going to take us another six to eight months to dial all the numbers together. So there are all sorts of details that need to be worked out but we’re still marching forward.”

City records show Michigan Community Capital’s tentative plans would include investing $45 million in gutting and remodeling parts of the building in time for opening 120 units to tenants in May 2025.

The project would not involve affordable housing units Hanna said. The apartments would include one- and two-bedroom units as well as studio-style residences. He said his organization was investigating the need for developing parking space for potential tenants as well.

Michigan Community Capital features a history of transforming legacy buildings into apartment complexes.

One of its projects moving forward is a $14 million rehabilitation of a century-old Ludington building — that once housed a factory — into a 65-unit apartment complex with some retail space. The apartments will open to tenants this August he said.

Hanna said if his nonprofit green-lit the Saginaw project Huntington Bank would hand over ownership but remain a tenant in the building even as construction commenced.

Today Huntington Bank operates a branch on its first floor. Floors two through 12 stand vacant.

Renovating that space would require a costly and complex undertaking Hanna said in part because of the historic nature of the 162-foot-tall building. Construction finished there in 1925.

The structure remains one of the tallest in mid-Michigan. Closer than Flint the only building reaching higher heights than the downtown Saginaw site is Bay City Hall at 180 feet.

The tallest apartment complex in the region meanwhile is Rosien Towers in Saginaw at 125 feet according to Emporis a website that serves as a database of information about buildings.

If the Huntington Bank site transforms into apartment space it would land residents in a downtown district within walking distance of entertainment venues restaurants retail a medical corridor and a new Saginaw high school campus set to open in the coming years.

“I really appreciate how committed the community seems in getting this done” Hanna said. “I’m really grateful to all the support we’ve gotten locally and I’m looking forward to having a project in that community.”

The council’s Monday meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. at Saginaw City Hall 1315 S. Washington.

Residents unable to attend can watch the gathering televised live on Charter Spectrum’s channel 191; or on the city’s YouTube channel. The YouTube channel also provides an archive of the council meetings.

The buildings are from left The Centennial The Rockefeller Building and 45 Erieview (Millennia & KJP). CLICK IMAGES TO ENLARGE THEM

Buildings to add nearly 1700 apartments

This summer renovations to a trio of large former office buildings in downtown Cleveland are due to get underway that will convert their combined 2+ million square feet into mixed uses that will add 1671 housing units Class A office and co-working spaces plus unique restaurant retail and residential amenities. Total investment is projected to be $687 million for all three projects — The Centennial 45 Erieview and The Rockefeller Building.

If they lease out quickly as most of the high-rent urban core residential developments in Cleveland tend to do these three buildings will add approximately 2500 residents to downtown. But unlike other recent new-construction towers downtown including the 23-story City Club Apartments now under construction at 776 Euclid Ave. these buildings are not expected to command top-of-the-market rents. Indeed thanks to their physical design or their financing most of the residential units in these buildings will be marketed primarily as “workforce” housing — for bartenders waiters secretaries nurses and others who want to be at the center of city life but haven’t been able to afford it.

That will start to change in two to three years as the renovation work ends and the apartments come on to the market. But that would mean that renovations would have to start on the three buildings very soon. Indeed they will as it appears right now.

The distinctive feature of 45 Erieview is its glassy curving wall facing toward East 9th Street and Lake Erie. This is what that façade looked like from the inside when it was an office building. These big windows will instead offer views to future apartment dwellers of the building (CBRE).

45 Erieview

The project scheduled to start first is 45 Erieview at the southeast corner of East 9th Street and Lakeside Avenue. Renovation work is scheduled to begin shortly before a July 12 “groundbreaking” ceremony said Zak Baris President of Comprehensive Zoning Services a real estate due-diligence and environmental firm based in Cleveland that worked on the project to help get it to this point.

“We’re excited to get the project underway” said Baris who expressed his appreciation to the project’s developers Bluelofts Inc. and Wolfe Investments both of Texas. Leopardo Companies of Chicago is the project’s construction manager. The developers won a $5 million historic tax credit from the state last December to help them round out their financing package.

“We can’t wait to get started on converting this big empty building into much-needed housing” said Ike Bam co-founder of Bluelofts with John Williams in a written statement.

“This building will add to the heart of booming downtown Cleveland” said Kenny Wolfe president at Wolfe Investments. “This is our third joint venture with Bluelofts.”

The $102 million project will include converting the 16-story 1983-built former Ohio Bell headquarters into 362 apartments above co-working spaces on the first and second floors and below a rooftop swimming pool. There will be retail a restaurant and a coffee shop on the ground level but the commercial tenants have yet to be publicly identified. The property includes a neighboring 348-space parking garage plus 32 parking spaces under 45 Erieview. Also in the basement will be an eSports (competition using video games) venue. The 492864-square-foot building features a distinctive curving glass façade that offers views north to Lake Erie and west to East 9th Street.

The other two projects don’t have groundbreaking dates nailed down yet but both are expected to start renovations in or about mid-August according to sources connected to each development but who weren’t authorized to speak publicly about them.

The big daddy of downtown renovations is The Centennial whose massive bank lobbies the largest in the world when the building opened in 1921 will be renovated into restaurant and museum spaces so the public can continue to visit and admire their grandeur as this artist’s rendering shows (Millennia).

“It’s probably going to be before Labor Day” said one of the sources referring to the groundbreaking ceremony for The Centennial 925 Euclid Ave. This $465 million project is certainly the largest if not the most complicated of the three. The 1.3-million-square-foot 21-story 101-year-old building with its massive interior lobby and barrel-vaulted ceilings was the former bank headquarters for the Union Trust Bank Union Commerce Bank and most recently a regional headquarters for Huntington Bank.

Developer Millennia Companies is finalizing the multiple layers of financing for the project including two huge state tax credits. One is a $40 million Ohio Transformational Mixed-Use Development (TMUD) tax credit awarded earlier this year and the other a $25 million “catalytic” historic tax credit granted in 2015 when the property was under the ownership of Hudson Holdings. But difficulties in adding other layers of financing due to the building’s many non-revenue-generating spaces kept the project from moving forward testified Millennia CEO Frank Sinito before a legislative committee in 2019 on the need for creating the TMUD credit program.

“Of the 1300000 square feet in The Centennial over 350000 square feet of the building is non-income producing circulation and other space” he said. “The rents from the other income-producing areas of the building simply are not sufficient to subsidize the costs associated with these very large but non-income producing areas of the building. So given these realities it is very important to see — and I think it becomes quite clear — that existing buildings often have an even greater need for the type of financial assistance that SB 39 (TMUD legislation) is intended to provide than new construction does.”

A couple of weeks before it was vacated in November 2011 this is what part of Huntington Bank’s lobby at 925 Euclid Ave. looked like when it was still used as a bank. The other wing of the lobby extends off the to right and out of view. It has remained vacant ever since except for occasional special events (KJP).

Also supporting the project are federal historic tax credits and low-income housing tax credits so that all of the housing units at The Centennial can be offered at below market rate. Based on 2020 data rents could range from $665 to $1064 for an efficiency $712 to $1140 for a one-bedroom apartment $855 to $1368 for a two-bedroom unit and $988 to $1588 for a three-bedroom suite according to Millennia.

In addition to undisclosed private financing the state has committed a $5 million brownfield loan. Plus there’s a $5 million loan from Cuyahoga County and a $15 million loan from the City of Cleveland said Tom Mignogna Millennia’s project manager on The Centennial. He said the renovation work will take about 36 months to complete. A joint venture of Marous Brothers and Gilbane Inc. is serving as the project’s construction management.

Also planned for The Centennial is 21978 square feet of retail office spaces for several hundred workers a 16607-square-foot museum called the Cleveland Exposition Center and a ground-floor 7411-square-foot restaurant with two private dining rooms called The Century Club. Sinito and his wife Malisse created the successful Marble Room restaurant out of another Gilded Age bank lobby nearby on Euclid Avenue. On The Centennial’s 21st floor will be a 5032-square-foot indoor event space with kitchen plus private meeting rooms and a library.

A mix of modern and historical architectural features exist throughout the Rockefeller Building. The historic brass marble and wooden features will be preserved and restored while many of the modern features will be redesigned to accentuate the historic features (KJP).

The Rockefeller Building

Another Gilded Age structure is due to go under the knife by the end of August — the $120 million renovation of the Rockefeller Building built at the direction of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller. The former office building at 614 W. Superior Ave. with its first phase constructed in 1905 and the second in 1910 measures 17 stories tall and 261264 square feet. The building has fallen into disrepair over the decades but still features much of its original marble iron brass and woodwork.

It will be reborn under the guidance of developers Realty Dynamics of Cleveland and Wolfe Investments. The latter is a partner in 45 Erieview mentioned earlier. Overseeing the renovation work and managing the Rockefeller Building is Geis Companies of Cleveland and Streetsboro. Geis has a track record with historic renovations downtown. They include converting the former May Co. department store into apartments and the old Cleveland Trust Bank rotunda and neighboring buildings at Euclid and East 9th Street into The 9 a 29-story mixed-use complex including a Heinen’s grocery store.

The Rock as it is affectionately called will see floors 5-16 redeveloped into 436 apartments including 273 micro-unit apartments whose small size will make them more affordable to a wider market. The ground floor will have 12000 to 15000 square feet of retail be it shops barber/salons restaurants and/or food hall. Floors 2-4 will have renovated offices according to Conrad Geis director and managing partner of Geis Companies.

“When you walk in you’re going to know you’re in a Rockefeller building” Geis said. “We’re going to stay in line with the design look and feel of this building to ensure the preservation of the building and the meaning behind it.”

Acquisition and development of The Rock was driven by Sherwin-Williams’ decision to build its new $300+ million global headquarters across West 6th Street. So were two other nearby $80 million renovation projects now underway. One is the redevelopment of the 1958-built 22-story 55 Public Square into 205 apartments 62295 square feet of modern office space and ground-floor retail/restaurants. K&D Group and Cleveland Construction Inc. are on track to complete the project in 2023. Renovations are also underway at the Marriott’s Renaissance Cleveland Hotel on Public Square. Updating of the 104-year-old Hotel Cleveland the first building in the Cleveland Union Terminal complex (today’s Tower City) is due to be finished next year.

What do we alert on? How do we define the KPIs that we care about? Are we setting thresholds too high or too low? What are the best practice alerts?

These questions are often mired in ever-growing amounts of confusion and ambiguity. At IBM we decided to create a revolutionary new approach and make alert configuration intuitive and intelligent with something we call Smart Alerts.

This new IBM Instana™ Smart Alerts feature provides the ability to automatically generate alerting configurations using relevant KPIs and automatic threshold detection for use cases like website slowness or website errors. Combined with the power of Unbonded analytics Smart Alerts is the first alerting mechanism that automatically generates alerts based on use cases designed for the environment at hand.

End the guessing game

The experience of creating and managing alerts has historically been an abysmal experience relegated to a grizzled team of operations engineers who most people have been afraid to speak with. If you’ve ever felt like setting up alerts for your applications which have been a slightly less exciting version of whack-a-mole then hold on because we have redefined the process by which engineers decide why they’re startled out of bed at 2 AM. With our new blueprints configuring meaningful alerts has been distilled into three distinct easy-to-use steps.

Step 1: Choose a blueprint

Blueprints are the curated and contextualized alerting plans that have been generated based on not only our experience with alerting but our clients as well. These plans are designed with specific use cases in mind and will automatically choose the proper KPIs and create baseline performance thresholds from the historical and seasonal patterns present in your environment. The historical and threshold determination is displayed in real-time while defining your new alert. Amazingly you can see exactly when your alert would trigger based on historical data so that you can tune your thresholds just right—not too many alerts not too few. Further customization can be defined in Step 2 where the scope is confirmed.

Step 2: Confirm the scope

Smart Alerts gives your team the ability to quickly and easily refine your alert configuration with our Unbounded analytics filtering. This ability effectively allows you to narrow the alerts down to scenarios that you’re ultimately responsible for. For example it’s trivial to define the scenario where only the performance is analyzed for the users accessing your application while on mobile Safari and your production or test environment. Defining these constraints becomes an interactive and transparent process as each change is graphed and visualized in real-time.

Step 3: Choose the alert channel

The delivery of alerts is simplified by our wide selection of integration partners. After all what good is an alert if it isn’t delivered reliably to your engineering team? The IBM Instana platform integrates directly with the industries’ leading alert management vendor tools (including PagerDuty and Opsgenie) along with open-source monitoring tools (such as Prometheus). Alternatively you can even send an email or post directly to a webhook.

What are blueprints?

You may think of blueprints as a prefabricated design for a house. While not entirely finalized these plans allow for individualized customization to suit your taste. Don’t like those bathroom fixtures? Update them. Prefer to measure on the 99th percentile instead of the 90th? No problem. While the goal of Smart Alerts is to eliminate the difficulty in deriving reliable thresholds for performance metrics we understand that our users may want to customize their alerting expectations.

In addition to being able to modify the aggregation percentile IBM Instana software will calculate baselines from algorithms based on either daily or weekly seasonality. We’ve also included the ability to specify time-based thresholds which enable trigger conditions that require certain requirements to be met including but not limited to the number of violations within a time window or a certain number or percentage of users being impacted.

The future of alerting

We built Smart Alerts because we know that with the increased complexity and size of modern application environments a smarter and more intuitive approach to alert management was a requirement. Today’s application owners deserve a modern and automated approach to alerting and performance monitoring.

With this announcement we’re planning to introduce Smart Alerts and blueprints throughout the entire IBM Instana ecosystem. In addition to incorporating this radical new alerting approach to cover all functional areas within the IBM Instana platform we’ll continuously introduce blueprint capabilities as we analyze how our clients are constructing their own custom alerts.

You could spend a lot of money trying to find one transport it and refurbish it. But of course most of us will settle for an emulator. While there are great emulators out there most of the time you aren’t interested in running just the bare machine — you want the operating systems the compilers and the other software that made these machines so interesting. Running your three lines of machine code isn’t as much fun as playing hunt the wumpus or compiling some Fortran IV code. Unfortunately finding copies of all this old software can be daunting. But thanks to the efforts of [Rattydave] you can do it with no problems at all. The secret? Pre-built docker images that have everything you need in one place.

In addition to IBM’s MVS VM370 and TSS you can also run Multics — the predecessor to Unix — on a collection of computers from DEC HP and DG and even a Cray 1 supercomputer. There are good instructions although some of the machines do take a little work. For example the TSS image notes:

This is not a ready to run system. You need to IPL 250 and then you can control via the telnet connection. (If you dont know what IPL 280 means then this container is not for you.)

We aren’t sure if both of those are supposed to be 250 or both 280 or if that sentence even makes sense as-is. It has been a long time since we IPL’d an IBM computer. We think they both should be 250.

The collection has a lot of SIM-H machines including the Altair 8080 with and without a Z80 CPU an IBM 1130 and many others that probably still need some attention to get working.

Of course you still need to know how to work the computer in question although the notes for each image will help you get at least a foothold. You probably ought to know a little about docker too although just to use it it isn’t all that hard. Plus if you start using docker you’ll find a lot of different uses for it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvdGFrdS5jb20uYXUvMjAyMi8wNi90aGlzLWN1c3RvbS1idWlsdC1taW5pYXR1cmUtaWJtLW1vZGVsLWYta2V5Ym9hcmQtaXMtYW4tYWJzb2x1dGUtd29yay1vZi10ZWNoLWFydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Custom-Built Miniature IBM Model F Keyboard Is An Absolute Work Of Tech Art,"Even having grown up using Commodore 64s Apple IIs and IBM PCs I have no fondness for mechanical keyboards. I’m most happy with a set of short-travel chiclet-style laptop keys under my fingers but even I can feel myself being lured to the cult of mechanical keyboards by this impressive compact recreation of a classic IBM Model F keyboard.

Although modern mechanical keyboards draw inspiration from the myriad of keyboards and input devices used in the ‘70s and ‘80s (for electric typewriters and the earliest personal computers) there are two specific models that stand out as the driving force behind today’s obsession with keyboards loud enough to wake the dead: the IBM Model F and its follow-up the Model M. Both used a patented buckling spring mechanism inside paired with other moving components — including a tiny hammer — to produce a distinct feel and sound when the keys were pressed. Some loved it while others are glad that noise cancelling headphones are now affordable and effective.

A member of the Deskthority forums who goes by “Durken” recently shared a custom build that looks like a perfect recreation of an IBM Model F keyboard but scaled to 40% of its original size losing the numpad and even the wide space bar in the process. To make it look and feel as much like the original as possible Durken used keys with authentic buckling spring switches and even referenced a Model F’s PCB in order to design their own more compact alternative. Just like IBM’s it has a slight curve when installed inside a 3D-printed enclosure which Durken also heavily puttied sanded and painted to give it a perfect ‘80s beige finish.

As if the buckle spring switches weren’t already loud enough Durken added an extra level of optional haptic feedback with the addition of a solenoid inside that fires every time a key is pressed making the keyboard sound more like working on a mechanical typewriter. To keep the solenoid feature a secret it’s covertly activated by pressing the IBM logo which is normally nothing but a foil sticker but here functions as an additional mechanical button.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZnJvbnRvZmZpY2VzcG9ydHMuY29tL3dpbGwtemFsYXRvcmlzLXJhcGlkLXJpc2UtZnJvbS1hbm9ueW1pdHktdG8tbWFzdGVycy1jb250ZW5kZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Zalatoris’ Rapid Rise From ‘Anonymity’ to Masters Contender,"Before last year’s Masters Will Zalatoris was a relative unknown in mainstream sports. That weekend he had a career breakout finishing as the runner-up and one stroke short of catching Hideki Matsuyama for the green jacket.

Zalatoris followed that up with a T-8 finish at the PGA Championship at Kiawah eventually earning PGA Tour Rookie of the Year honors for the 2020-21 season. The 25-year-old is currently No. 29 in the Official World Golf Ranking and No. 22 in the FedEx Cup standings.

He’s had three top-six finishes since the calendar turned to 2022 but is still chasing his first Tour win.

This year Zalatoris has teamed up with IBM to promote the company’s 25th season partnering with the tournament. IBM provides insights to players as well as fans through the Masters Fantasy Game in the Masters app.

FOS sat down with Zalatoris to talk about being part of the PGA’s youth movement his sudden rise to fame and how he wants to improve at this year’s Masters.

When did you first realize you could make a career as a pro golfer?

I was fortunate enough to play a lot of golf with Scottie Scheffler and Jordan [Spieth] all the way through junior golf. I qualified for U.S. Junior when I was 12 and I saw Jordan win the U.S. Junior when he was 15. Seeing the success of all the guys around me made me better.

I knew that I wanted to play professional golf my entire life but I really knew that I could be where I’m at today once I made a Walker Cup team and played with the best players in the world. That was a big turning point for me.

Seeing Jordan set the bar at such a young age — and then obviously Scottie and I have been playing together literally since we were nine — I knew that if we kept doing what we were doing we were gonna be here today. So this has been on my horizon for a long time. It’s obviously pretty fun to do it when you’ve got friends that are out there with you. We’ve pushed each other at every level going from junior to professional golf so hopefully we’ll keep doing that.

What’s it like being part of this huge wave of young talent on the Tour right now?

I think from the outside looking in a lot of people are like “Man this is amazing. These guys are doing it this young.” And I think you really have to blame Tiger [Woods] for that. Because we’ve watched Tiger dominate from when he was 21 to when he won the Masters at 40-plus. So seeing him come out and dominate at a young age it really set the bar for us especially when it comes to the Masters.

Obviously I made my run last year. We’ve seen Jordan play well there basically every year. I think seeing someone that you’ve grown up with have success at the highest level only gives you confidence that you can do it too.

In your first career Masters start you held on to second place for the last three rounds. How did you keep your cool with that kind of pressure?

The part that I find so funny is that people ask me “Oh man how’d you handle that pressure?” and I answer “I’ve got nothing to lose.” As a golfer your life goal is to win a major. Every kid who pretends that they’re making a putt to win a tournament — it’s usually to win the Masters.

I put myself in that situation last year and thought “I did the hard part I got here. Why shy away from it now?” I was five or six back and I just had to go make birdies. It’s as simple as that. I’ve got nothing to lose here. I want to win a green jacket. Finishing second means as much as finishing 30th.

I tried to enjoy the moment as much as I possibly could early in the week and then just got back to business. It didn’t matter to me — and still doesn’t — whether I finished second or last after making a cut or whatever. The job is to go out and try to win a green jacket. And so I think that attitude is actually very freeing.

What about Augusta National plays to your strengths?

This goes for tough golf courses in general: Of course everyone talks about how tough the greens are and how fast and how undulating they are but hitting them in the correct spots and giving yourself the most opportunities makes it so much easier.

Learning where you can and can’t miss depending on certain pin locations favors good ball-strikers. So the fact that I am a very good ball-striker I’m going to have better looks more often than an average ball-striker. And it’s not about proximity it’s just about missing it in the correct spots.

Last year I made sure to try to give myself as many looks as I could. The putter got hot a few days and it paid off. So just making sure I don’t stymie myself from the middle of the fairway is really important.

What if anything are you going to do differently this time around?

Last year I thought I did a really nice job on all the other holes with the exception of 13. I need to play that hole a minimum of two-under or better. I made a couple of really nice up-and-downs the last day especially coming down the stretch. But I think the biggest thing for me is to play the par-fives a little bit better. I played 15 great but I think playing 2 and 13 a little bit better is going to be important.

How do you ignore your early successes and focus on the task at hand?

Looking at the macro instead of the micro. My job every week is to get better at my game and not getting lost with trying to win this tournament or trying to get this award or this ranking. I know that if I improve on the things that I’ve been trying to improve on over the past year the sky’s the limit. Looking at it as more of a process instead of results is what will carry me to getting my first win and hopefully my first major.

How would you describe the growing pains of the PGA Tour?

Last year before the Masters I had general anonymity when it came to golf. Diehard golf fans knew who I was but the average golf fan really didn’t. And then after that week I go from being the guy who’s teeing off last of each wave on Thursday and Friday to the very next week at Bay Hill playing with DJ [Dustin Johnson] and Billy Horschel. I’m getting paired with Rosie [Justin Rose] and DJ at the British [Open]. And I love that. I love playing with the best players in the world — they make me play better.

I think if anything it was just the fact that it was so fast. I had to appreciate going from being a top-50 player in the world to suddenly being a household golf name if you will. There’s some growing pains but at the same time that just comes with the territory of the things that I want to accomplish in this game.

It took me a little bit of time to get used to it. I went from people not really knowing who I am to People magazine picking up my engagement. That one to me was like “Man I haven’t won anything yet what’s the big deal? Why are people suddenly interested in who I am?”

What are your goals for the 2022 season?

I think getting my first win would be awesome. I’ve been trending in the right direction since the start of the calendar year. I had a nice offseason put on some weight. Of course my career goal is to win a major but you’ve got to focus on what you’re doing and not try to overwork toward one specific goal. I thought last year after the Masters I did a really poor job pressing to try to get that first win as opposed to letting it come to me.

I’ve only really been in contention once so far this year but my bad days have gotten better. The good days are still there but I think it’s just making the bad days a little bit better. It’s something I admire most about the top players in the world.

DJ at The Players was a prime example. He was out of it the first couple of days and all of a sudden he shoots 63 and finishes in the top 10. That’s what makes you a world-class golfer — consistency.

So I try to take a page out of their book where even in a week where they’re kind of off they still have great weekends and make the most of it. Basically don’t let one bad day turn into a bad week.

You teamed up with IBM this year. Can you describe some of their innovations for the season?

IBM is taking 120000 shots over the last six years to create scoring predictions. IBM Watson has analyzed over 3 million articles to give insight into players which you’ll see in the Masters app this year.

Last year I used the app before every round to see how holes were playing. If the technology ever helps with stuff like club selection sign me up — that’s gonna take some stress off of me and my caddie that’s for sure.

There’s also the fantasy side of things which is going to help fans. Maybe they didn’t know who Will Zalatoris was in 2021. This insight can help them find this year’s guy for their fantasy lineups. I’m a big stats guy so even as a player I’m looking at it too.

Do you ever consider picking yourself for the Masters Fantasy game?

[laughs] I wish I could but we can’t do any of the fantasy stuff because it’d be a little bit of a conflict. But of course selfishly I’d want to pick myself every week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAyMi8wNi8xOS9hLWJveS1hbmQtaGlzLWF0b20taXMtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1zbWFsbGVzdC1tb3ZpZS5odG1s0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9ib2luZ2JvaW5nLm5ldC8yMDIyLzA2LzE5L2EtYm95LWFuZC1oaXMtYXRvbS1pcy10aGUtd29ybGRzLXNtYWxsZXN0LW1vdmllLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Boy And His Atom is the world's smallest movie,"A Boy And His Atom earned the Guinness World Records record for the ""World's Smallest Stop-Motion Film.""

Norbert J. Kott US Army DEVCOM-GVSC Materials Additive Manufacturing (Detroit Arsenal Warren MI) reports in an article that appeared on the SME’s website that they US Army is working with LFAM 3D printer manufacturers Ingersoll (part of the Camozzi Group) and Virginia-based MELD Manufacturing on the Jointless Hull project. Goal of the project is the development of a metal 3D printer that is capable of producing parts as large as an entire vehicle.

The goal of the Jointless Hull project is to fabricate hulls of vehicles that required fewer welded joints during manufacturing directly increasing the durability of the hull against underbody attacks. Psast attempts using forging forming and welding proved that these legacy manufacturing processes are not well matched for vehicle program needs. Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies on the other hand present new opportunities in material processing and flexible fabrication that provide a compelling avenue for producing new vehicle hull concepts.

In the article Kott correctly points out that “AM system capabilities for creating large metallic components such as whole vehicle hulls are still in their infancy. Some metal AM capabilities have been demonstrated that have dimensional restrictions large in one plane or axis. Commercially available off-the-shelf systems for metal AM technologies generally have maximum build volumes on the order of 1 x 1 x 1 m and can enable many application opportunities.”

Some of the largest such systems include the EBAM machines from Sciaky and large-size DED systems from the likes of DMG Mori and Trumpf. These systems can produce large parts yet costs remain high because they are based on metal powder feedstock. Printing large parts requires a large amount of material and handling of the feedstock for the process is another major consideration. While powder-fed (or blown powder) directed energy deposition systems have demonstrated the ability to scale to some larger sizes technologies based on powder beds have not. The development of these technologies for larger-scale systems is ongoing however the inherent challenges related to handling and processing metal powders will remain and will be magnified as systems scale to larger sizes. Other large area additive manufacturing (AM) systems (up to 7 meters in length) have been demonstrated in recent years most prominently for processing polymeric and fiber-reinforced materials and therefore limited mainly to tooling applications.

“Scaling the available technology and machine capabilities to larger platforms to enable a versatile capability to access a broad range of large-scale applications especially in metal is needed” Kott concludes.

ASTRO America ALMII and the US Army DEVCOM-GVSC are working together on the Jointless Hull project as a sponsored program to develop a large-scale metal AM system for the US Army’s Rock Island Arsenal in order to make large-scale metallic parts more common in Army ground vehicles. The program’s vision is to combine large format machine tools that have been historically proven in various industries with additive manufacturing technologies to reduce production lead times. The resulting capability will enable metal additive manufacturing on a previously unseen or unavailable scale not only for ground vehicle systems but for all large-scale applications. The ability to print such large metal parts will open up new applications and expand the uses of additive manufacturing processes.

The Jointless Hull project will create and deliver two distinct machines. The first machine will be capable of printing and machining parts up to 1 x 1 x 1 m in size. This machine will be used for process development print strategies and print path planning for parts up to the size limit of the machine as well as parts that will be built on the second larger machine. The second larger machine will be able to print and machine parts within its 10 x 6.5 x 4 m build volume (length x width x height). This will be the largest metal AM system publicly available.

The large size system’s base architecture will be provided by Ingersoll Machine Tools (part of the Camozzi Group) the company that has developed the largest composite AM systems currently on the market. Ingersoll uses Siemens components and software to run its giant gantry systems which can produce parts as long as 7 meters. The Siemens team also selected to participate in this program focuses on multi-axis CNC-based applications and process simulations.

MELD Manufacturing Corp the developer of the MELD process (also referred to as additive friction stir deposition) is producing and delivering the deposition systems that will enable the additive component of these large metal AM machines. Their patented processing technology utilizes wrought feedstock material in a solid-state process that relies on severe plastic deformation to deposit the material at the point of deposition.

For the Jointless Hull project all commercially available metal additive technologies were considered. The large-scale machine is configured as a traversing gantry machine with the metal printing and machining tool directly mounted on one axis (Z-direction). This configuration is suitable for handling large (heavy) metallic components and allows for flexible manipulation of manufacturing methods.

The unique friction stir-based additive process developed by MELD Manufacturing was chosen as the most promising to meet the size and material requirements of our large-scale system. The method employs a hollow rotating shoulder through which material is fed and deposited onto a substrate. Lower temperature AM methods were considered in order to reduce the stress and build-up created during the process.

The MELD process is a solid-state additive manufacturing (AM) technology for depositing and processing material at temperatures below its melting point. Because MELD fabricated parts are fully dense no secondary processing is required to remove volumetric defects such as voids or porosity. The system does not require a specialized chamber because the material is printed at temperatures below melting. Undeveloped next-generation materials could provide even better performance.

The ultimate goal of the Jointless Hull project is to develop a system that can rapidly fabricate large metallic structures for a wide range of applications that require metallic material properties.

The pricing includes VAT but is way above the 1030 RMB MSRP that was disclosed for the Chinese market.

Intel Arc A380's First Custom Design Graphics Card On Sale In China For Over $500 US PCB & ACM-G11 GPU Get Close Up Shots

GUNNIR has become a very popular graphics card manufacturer in the Asian Pacific OEM & Pre-built PC segment. They have been amongst the first to offer custom flavors of the DG1 graphics card in custom flavor and they are now back with the first custom DG2 graphics card the GUNNIR Arc A380 Photon which features 6 GB of GDDR6 memory and the full ACM-G11 GPU from Intel. The first close-up shots of the graphics cards have now been published by MyDrivers.

The Intel Arc A380 graphics card will be an entry-level design featuring the full ACM-G11 GPU that utilizes the Alchemist Xe-HPG architecture. It houses the full GPU configuration making use of 8 Xe-Cores or 1024 ALUs. The graphics card also features 6 GB of GDDR6 memory running at TBP rated at around 92W. The maximum frequency for the card is rated at 2450 MHz which shows that Intel is taking full advantage of TSMC's 6nm process node. The GUNNIR custom model features a VRAM clock of 15.5 Gbps for 186 GB/s bandwidth. The memory speeds were quietly updated by Intel for its reference design too.

Interestingly the card does utilize the 'K4ZAF325BM-HC16' memory dies which operate at 16 Gbps but Intel seems to have lowered the memory specs probably to conserve power which makes no sense for a desktop variant. The custom variant already features a higher TBP of 92W and has an 8-pin connector so it shouldn't have any problem running the memory at 16 Gbps speeds. But it is likely that even board partners traded memory clocks in favor of GPU clocks.

It is not known if the card uses a custom PCB or a reference design but it does come with a single 8-pin power connector to boot and houses a 2+1 phase VRM design. The shroud features the 'Intel Arc' logo on the side and has a GUNNIR Photon logo that lights up with LED illumination giving even the entry-level card a more premium look.

As for the graphics card itself the GUNNIR Arc A380 Photon comes in a standard box package that features the Intel Arc 3 XeSS and DirectX 12 Ultimate marketing logos. The graphics card itself is a dual-slot and dual-fan design which houses an aluminum heatsink underneath it. The shroud and backplate feature a nice dual-tone black+grey color theme plus the backplate extends beyond the PCB. There's a single 6mm nickel-plated copper heat pipe that runs through the heatsink.

There's also a blue and black colored trim on the backplate which enhances the looks of the card. Display outputs include three DisplayPort & a single HDMI output. The fans are two 90mm designs and the card measures 222×114×42mm.

The reference Intel Arc A380 graphics card has also been officially announced for the Chinese market. The card features a dual-slot and single-fan design. Compared to the GUNNIR variant which rocks an overclocked design the reference model features a 2000 MHz clock speed plus a TBP of 75W which means that it won't require any external power connector. The graphics card ships this summer in various pre-built from leading manufacturers such as ASUS MSI Gigabyte ACER etc plus will also be available in DIY custom flavors such as the GUNNIR model above.

While the GUNNIR Arc A380 Photon 6 GB graphics card has been made official we expect the card to remain an Asian-market only GPU offering with other manufacturers bringing the Arc A380 and the rest of the higher-end lineup to the market by later Summer in other regions. The graphics card was meant to launch close to the 1030 RMB MSRP but is nowhere close to it. More so the card has already been listed as 'Sold Out' over at JD.com. Intel touted the card to offer 25% better price to perf ratio (in Yuan) versus the AMD Radeon RX 6400 at MSRP but since this is over 3x the MSRP the whole point of this graphics card is invalidated.

It’s safe to say that move has been transformative for the Mac range.

Apple not only has greater control over the production line but is also able to deliver a faster performance than the likes of AMD and Intel making its Macs more appealing compared to Windows-based machines.

It’s been a nightmare move for Intel and AMD which have missed out a huge chunk of revenue since Apple no longer requires their components. But the situation could become even worse for the duo in the next couple of years.

AMD and Intel can at least be glad there’s no chance of Apple supplying its processors to other manufacturers. Apple will want to keep the M1 and M2 chips (and so on) for itself to make the brand as appealing as possible. But it looks like the success of M1 chips may have inspired another company to copy the same tactic.

Qualcomm has been making computer chips for several years now. You’ll find its Snapdragon processors inside laptops such as the Samsung Galaxy Book Go Acer Chromebook Spin 513 and Samsung Galaxy Book S. But due to restrained performance and compatibility issues with Windows we’ve only really seen these processors prove popular in Chromebooks – they’ve hardly been successful enough to make AMD or Intel sweat.

But now Apple has shown the world that chips with Arm architecture can indeed offer high-end performance it looks like Qualcomm is keen to replicate the success of the MacBook.

Galaxy Book S with Snapdragon chip

During an interview with CNET Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon confirmed that the company plans to launch a new range of Arm-based Nuvia processors for laptops. Such chips will differ to the current Snapdragon range as they will target a high performance for both the CPU and GPU – sound familiar?

“We’re aiming to have performance leadership in PC on the CPU period” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon reportedly said during the interview. Qualcomm isn’t just aiming to play catch up with AMD Intel and Apple but to leapfrog the trio with the world’s fastest laptop chip.

It’s an incredibly ambitious goal but I’d be hesitant to bet against Qualcomm. After all its acquisition of Nuvia back in 2021 has ensured it has chip manufacturers on the team who previously worked for the likes of Arm Apple and Google. I also remember people being sceptical about Apple’s hopes to release one of the most powerful laptop processors on the market but nobody’s doubting Tim Cook now.

AMD and Intel have every right to be worried about Qualcomm’s plans. Apple’s move to M1 was a big setback but the duo’s loss of market share was at least limited to the Mac ecosystem. If Qualcomm proves successful it’s possible that major AMD and Intel clients – such as Acer Asus Dell Lenovo and more – could be tempted to use the incoming Nuvia chip rather than those from the next generations of Intel Core and AMD Ryzen.

MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip

Of course AMD and Intel both have time on their side. The Qualcomm Nuvia isn’t expected to arrive until the end of 2023. And even once the Nuvia processor is available it would take a long time for third-party manufacturers to switch over due to the strong relationships they have with the current chip suppliers.

As AMD has found no matter how powerful its mobile processors are it’s still incredibly difficult to displace Intel as the main chip supplier. You still can’t buy a Dell XPS laptop with an AMD processor and Razer only launched its first ever AMD-powered Blade in 2021.

Regardless of the performance power on offer it’s going to take a long time for Qualcomm to make a dent in the market. But if Qualcomm can produce a chip as impressive as Apple’s M1 range then it has every chance of becoming a serious competitor to both AMD and Intel.

After delays leaks and lots of speculation the first Intel Arc graphics card has appeared on sale—in a manner of speaking. The card is listed with a price and specifications though at the time of writing it was listed as sold out over at JD.com a Chinese retailer.

The price is err interesting. It’s listed at ￥3999 including VAT which is roughly $595 USD (£488 AU$897). That’s simply light years above the official ￥1030 price that was revealed last week indicating this is either a placeholder or a retailer hoping to cash in from curious early adopters (and first-past-the-post tech reviewers).

The retailer listing is for the Gunnir Intel Arc A380 proton 6G. The full product page for the card is online giving us an official look at the first discrete Arc graphics card to go on sale. Specifications include 8 Xe cores or 1024 shader units clocked at up to 2450MHz 6GB of GDDR6 memory and a 92W total board power rating. With specs like these it's definitely an entry level offering.

The card itself looks good in my opinion. It features a subtle back shroud and small Intel Arc logo. The Gunnir logo is backlit and other than the contrasting aluminium heatsink it doesn’t look cheap. The card has a standard set of video outputs almost certainly made up of 3x DP 1.4 and HDMI 2.1 ports. Those four video outputs could see it earn favour among users looking for triple monitor support a feature that’s distinctly lacking from AMD’s RX 6400 and RX 6500 models.

The folks over at My Drivers (via WccfTech) obtained a card and took pics of the card from all angles. They also removed the cooler giving us a look at the PCB. It’s pretty basic as you’d expect from a cheap card. The use of an 8-pin power connector seems like overkill. It features what appears to be a simple 2+1 phase VRM and 16Gbps GDDR6. The GPU die looks small too so Intel’s bill of materials shouldn’t be high for this card.

We’re yet to see reliable benchmarks for the A380 so its difficult to draw conclusions. One thing is for sure it will sink like a stone if that￥3999 price is even remotely accurate. At ￥1030 (around $150 USD) it should find itself a niche among uses playing older or web games HTPC users (thanks to full AV1 support) and workstation users who want multi monitor support more than 3D grunt.

Intel’s low-key Chinese launch would indicate that it’s somewhat testing the waters ahead of a wider global launch. The early benchmark leaks showing the performance of an A730M mobile GPU weren’t all that impressive. It's no surprise that Intel wants to take as much time as it can to make sure it can extract the maximum performance from its cards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHJhcHRvci5uZXQvZ2FtaW5nL2d1aWRlcy9maW5hbC1mYW50YXN5LXZpaS1yZW1ha2UtYmF0dGxlLWludGVsLWd1aWRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Final Fantasy VII Remake Battle Intel Guide,"Final Fantasy VII Remake is out and while players are already out and about exploring Midgar you've likely come across Chadley in the Sector 5 slums on your first visit.

Condition: Use unique abilities on staggered enemies and charge the ATB gauge 10 times.

New Materia: First Strike Materia - Increases how full the ATB gauge is at the start of the battle.

How to Earn: The wording on this report is a bit confusing but what you need to do is stagger an enemy and then do enough damage with a character's unique ability (their Triangle attack) in order to build up a portion of your ATB gauge. This will be easiest to complete with Cloud as his Unique Ability is fast-paced.



Tips: You can waste your ATB on non-damaging abilities and healing items so as to not waste any enemy health and maximize how much ATB you can regain

Report 4 The Stagger Effect Pt. 2

Condition: Stagger 15 enemy types

New Materia: ATB Boost Materia - Doubles ATB when activated. It cannot be used continuously. Press L1 + R1 to activate.

How to Earn: For this you need to just deal enough damage to 15 different enemy types to stagger them. If you Assess an enemy and bring up their stat sheet on the left in the yellow text will be battle strategy recommendations. This will normally include tips to stagger the enemy faster.



Tips: This Report also escalates with Report 14 where you ultimately need to stagger 40 enemy types so even after completing this keep staggering enemies to be prepared

Report 9 Monster Variants Pt. 1

Condition: Defeat monsters of 3 unique varieties

New Materia: Synergy Materia - Allows an ally to follow the leader's attack command with an attack from linked materia. Works with fire ice lightning wind and poison materia.

How to Earn: As you progress through the game you will encounter special variant monster species they are most commonly encountered when completing side quests. If you are completing quests as the game progresses you'll get this early. Some monster variants appear in the wild during the end game.



Tips: This Report also escalates in Report 19 where ultimately you need to defeat monsters of 10 unique varieties.

Report 10 Combat Simulation: Fat Chocobo

Condition: Defeat a fat chocobo

New Materia: Fat Chocobo Materia - Allows you to summon a fat chocobo.

How to Earn: From Chadley select VR Missions and complete the Fat Chocobo battle.



Tips: This is also the easiest place to complete Report 12 if you want to take out two birds (one really fat one) with one stone then check the guide for Report 12 below.

Report 11 Monster Bio Pt. 3

Condition: Assess 20 enemy types

New Materia: Item Master Materia - Increases the effectiveness of items used in battle.

How to Earn: The first time you ecounter Chadley he will give you the Assess Materia. To complete this you need to equip the Assess Materia to a character and use it on an enemy to learn more about them. Use Assess on 20 unique monsters to earn this.



Tips: This Report also escalates with Report 16 where you ultimately need to Assess 40 types of enemies. Continue Assessing enemies as you come across them for easy completion of Report 16.

Report 12 The Staggering Effect Pt. 3

Condition: Increase stagger damage bonus to 200%

New Materia: Parry Materia - Guards against enemy attacks and allows you to quickly unleash your next move. Hold R1 and press Circle to activate. Deals a small amount of damage.

How to Earn: The best place to complete this Report is actually in the Fat Chocobo fight because of its high defence and long stagger time.



At the start of this battle you will change to Tifa and start fighting the Fat Chocobo. You want to make sure you have two ATB guages filled on Tifa but before the Fat Chocobo is staggered you want to use her ability Unbridled Strength twice. Each time you use Unbridled Strength Tifa's Unique Ability (Triangle Attack) will level up in power this also increases how much it increases the stagger guage.



Once the Fat Chocobo reaches stagger use Tifa's Triangle attack three times in a row each hit will get less powerful but the Fat Chocobo will likely reach 200%+ stagger. If it doesn't get to 200% then you have more than enough time to repeat the steps above.



Tips: If you find you're killing the Fat Chocobo before you can get to 200% stagger then try giving your characters weaker equipment

Report 13 Refocus Analysis

Condition: Trigger Refocus 2 times

New Materia: ATB Assist Materia - Slightly fills teammates' ATB gauges when ATB commander are used back-to-back.

How to Earn: When you have Aerith join your party she will have the Refocus Materia equipt. This will allow your ATB gauge to be split into three instead of two. Simply use this materia twice as Aerith or whoever has it equipt reaches Limit Break state.

Report 14 The Stagger Effect Pt. 4

Condition: Stagger 40 enemy types

New Materia: ATB Stagger Materia - Increases ATB when staggering an enemy.

How to Earn: For this you need to just deal enough damage to 40 different enemy types to stagger them. If you Assess an enemy and bring up their stat sheet on the left in yellow text will be battle strategy recommendations. This will normally include tips to stagger the enemy faster.

Report 15 Combat Simulation: Leviathan

Condition: Defeat Leviathan

New Materia: Leviathan Materia - Allows you to summon Leviathan.

How to Earn: From Chadley select VR Missions and complete the Leviathan battle.

Report 16 Monster Bio Pt. 4

Condition: Assess 30 enemy types

New Materia: Enemy Skill Materia - Gives you a chance to learn certain enemy techniques that you've endured and use them as abilities. These abilities can only be used when the materia is set to your equipment.

How to Earn: The first time you encounter Chadley he will give you the Assess Materia. To complete this you need to equip the Assess Materia to a character and use it on an enemy to learn more about them. Use Assess on 30 unique monsters to earn this.

Report 17 Weapon Abilities

Condition: Acquire all 16 Weapon abilities

New Materia: Skill Master Materia - Slightly fills the ATB gauge when multiple ATB commands are performed.

How to Earn: Each weapon you earn during the game will have a special ability that can only be used initially when that weapon is equipt. e.g Cloud's Iron Blade has the Triple Slash ability



By using a weapons ability you increase your Proficiency in it once you reach 100% then that ability is the characters to use whenever they want. You only need to use the ability at most 10 times so even after earning a new weapon it's an easy process to use your new special attack. After doing this for 16 weapons you'll earn this Report.



Tips: There are more than 16 weapons in the game but likely you'll be earning these abilities through regular play regardless.

Report 18 MP Consumption

Condition: Master all 12 types of magic materia

New Materia: MP Absorption Materia - Allows you to recover MP when unleashing an attack of the linked materia's type. Works with fire ice lightning wind poison enemy skill deadly dodge and parry materia.

How to Earn: Each of the 12 Magic Materia earns AP after battles this is used to level them up. For this Report you need to level at least one Materia of each of the 12 types to their max level. You will encounter each Materia through play so even if you don't see 12 different types by the time you get this Report you soon will.



The 12 Magic Materia Types are as follows:

Healing Cleansing Revival Fire Ice Lightning Wind Poison Barrier Binding Subversion Time



Tips: Later in the game you'll get a Pedometer Materia that requires you to walk 5000 steps. If you complete that requirement the Pedometer Materia will turn into the AP Up Materia this will increase the amount of AP that a linked materia receives. This will help you speed up development on ones you're still missing.

The S&P 500 has been higher only 43.5% of all trading days in 2022 a gloomy marker according to Bespoke Investment Group.

Meanwhile it said the Fed is facing a ""policy error"" in focusing on headline inflation that's swayed by high gas prices.

This year's dismal performance in US equities worsened this week as a post-Fed rally fizzled and investors cemented the S&P 500 to one of its shabbiest mid-year showings in decades all taking place with poor economic data piling up.

That was the finding from Bespoke Investment Group in a note published Thursday about the ""one-step forward and two-steps backward market"" investors are experiencing this year. The S&P 500 sank deeper into a bear market with its daily loss of 3.3% a day after the Federal Reserve announced it would raise interest rates 75 basis points. None of the index's 11 sectors moved higher and the energy group led losses as it slumped almost 6%.

The fall on Thursday left the S&P 500 higher only 43.5% of all trading days in 2022.

""While that may not sound all that extreme in the post-WWII period there have only been seven other years where the percentage of up days in the first half of the year was lower"" said the independent investment firm.

The only two years where the percentage was lower than 40% in the first half of a year were 1962 and 1970.

The downbeat milestone comes as investors flee so-called risk assets as the Fed ramps up interest rates in a bid to tame hot inflation. Inflation in the world's largest economy stepped up to 8.6% in May a 41-year high fronted by a nearly 4% jump in energy prices.

Stocks climbed Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the size of its latest interest rate hike — 75 basis points — shouldn't be common during this cycle as the Fed continues to battle inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee projected its fed funds rate will sit at 3.4% by year's end. It currently stands at a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.

But the next day investors sent stocks tumbling fearing that the fast pace of large rate increases will push the economy into a recession.

""Making matters worse economic data this morning was very weak as Housing Starts Building Permits Philly Fed Initial Jobless Claims and Continuing Jobless Claims all came in weaker than economic forecasts"" said Bespoke.

It noted housing starts dropped 14.4% in May with the Commerce Department's report arriving a day after the Fed lowered its economic growth forecasts and raised its forecast for the unemployment rate. Monetary policy makers now expects gross domestic product in 2022 to grow by 1.7% down from the previous 2.8% forecast.

""Given all the weakness it seems unbelievable that it has all come with the largest rate hike in nearly 30 years and promises of more to come in upcoming meetings"" the firm said. ""No one said coming out of COVID and all the stimulus programs would be easy but they didn't have 2022 in mind either.""

'Policy error'

In a separate note Bespoke said Powell indicated the central bank will pivot from focusing on core inflation to emphasizing consumer inflation expectations and the rate of headline inflation. Quantitatively both of those figures are driven overwhelmingly by gasoline prices at the pump the firm said.

Gas prices have topped $5 a gallon on average in the US for the first time ever AAA said this week.

""It's obvious that the only way the FOMC can effect change on gas prices is to suppress economic activity broadly and that is the message from the presser: that they will continue hiking aggressively until headline inflation (gas prices) start to drop"" Bespoke said.

""This sets the stage for a policy error and it is consistent with the Summary of Economic Projections that aggregates FOMC economic forecasts"" it said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL3doYXQtaXMtanVuZXRlZW50aC1hbmQtaG93LWRpZC1pdC1iZWNvbWUtYS11LXMtaG9saWRheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Juneteenth and how did it become a U.S. holiday?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Strategic divestitures and cost management reflect a proactive approach to market challenges.

Legal and regulatory hurdles pose potential risks to IFF's operational stability.

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

ADVERTISEMENT

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Story continues

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

Analyzing the Factors Limiting Growth,"Long-established in the Chemicals industry International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF Financial) has built a stellar reputation over the years. Recently the company experienced a daily gain of 3.83% alongside a three-month change of 12.16%. Despite these gains the latest insights from the GF Score indicate potential challenges ahead.

When her study – confirming a 1970s prediction that humanity’s unquenchable desire for economic growth would hit a wall and could spiral into civilization’s collapse around 2040 – first hit headlines last summer sustainability analyst Gaya Herrington had more pressing concerns.

“It was a very interesting time when it went viral as I had a less than two-month-old infant. I’ve done interviews while breastfeeding” she told The Independent. “In a way it passed me by a little bit.”

It doesn’t take much of an imaginative leap to understand why this academic paper published in the relatively obscure Journal of Industrial Ecology would catch fire now; when dark visions of the future seem less and less far-fetched in a world experiencing months-long wildfires back-to-back hurricanes devastating floods and heatwaves.

Ms Herrington former sustainability director at accounting multinational KPMG is vice president of environmental social and governance research at Schneider Electric a specialist in energy and automation which is ranked the world’s most sustainable company.

As part of her recent Master’s degree in sustainability at Harvard University she decided to review an iconic study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early Seventies. Researchers commissioned by European think tank the Club of Rome had been set this question: At what point will humanity’s consumption of finite resources and rampant industrialization outstrip the planet’s ability to cope?

Using computer modeling the MIT group generated future scenarios with a number of variables – population food industrialisation use of nonrenewable natural resources and pollution (which included carbon emissions).

Sustainability analyst Gaya Herrington ( Courtesy of Gaya Herrington )

The results published in 1972 as The Limits to Growth were sobering. The team discovered that a so-called “business-as-usual” approach to economic growth would drain the planet’s resources and lead to collapse within the 21st century.

While human civilization would not end people would be significantly worse off than previous generations amid tumbling food production industrial output and population numbers.

But not all future scenarios in Limits to Growth (LtG) were so bleak. The MIT team also discovered that a “stabilized world” was possible if society reconfigured priorities around the wellbeing of citizens used resources efficiently and cut pollution.

While the book went on to sell 30 million copies and was published in 30 languages the initial response was mixed. Some saw a prescient warning on the dangers of endless consumption and blithe ravaging of the natural world. Others were heavily critical of the research.

“The Limits to Growth is best summarized not as a rediscovery of the laws of nature but as a rediscovery of the oldest maxim of computer science: Garbage In Garbage Out” The New York Times economics editors wrote in a scathing review.

Five decades on Ms Herrington’s comparative analysis along with a number of studies in intervening years found that LtG has largely stood the test of time.

Her thesis compared four scenarios from LtG against the most recent empirical data available to find out if global society was still heading towards collapse.

Overall the new findings aligned closely with the 1970s study and concluded that civilisation can expect a halt to economic growth in the next 20 years and in the worst-case scenario see societal collapse around 2040.

“The strongest conclusion that can be drawn from my research therefore is that humanity is on a path to having limits to growth imposed on itself rather than consciously choosing its own. However my research results also leave open whether the subsequent declines in industrial and agricultural output will lead to sharp declines in population and welfare levels” Ms Herrington wrote in blog post in July.

In one way the results of her research were unsurprising she says.

Our generation is the first to experience climate change but we are also the last to be able to do anything about it. Gaya Herrington

“The idea that growth cannot continue on a finite planet is very intuitive. Nothing grows forever” the analyst told The Independent. However she added that it was “quite rare” for models to accurately predict decades into the future.

“It’s such a shame because if we had heeded the message [back] then we could have had a really smooth transition” she said of the original research. “My conclusion now is that we still have time but we’re fast running out of it. We have to make drastic improvements. It’s going to be a bumpy road.”

She added: “This upcoming decade is going to determine the rest of the century. It’s quite an extraordinary time. Our generation is the first to experience climate change but we are also the last to be able to do anything about it.”

A book based on her research titled Five Insights For Avoiding Collapse will be published later this year. The analyst who is an adviser to the Club of Rome is also part of a working group which will present a 50-year update to LtG at the United Nation’s Stockholm +50 meeting in June.

A promise to “build back better” from the pandemic has been the rallying cry of leaders of major economies but in reality this cleaner greener future has so far failed to take shape. Carbon dioxide and methane emissions the main drivers of the climate crisis caused by burning fossil fuels continue to rise.

In one sense the updated look at LtG offers a terrifying vision of the future. However the worst-case scenario is not inevitable Ms Herrington says even though the window is rapidly closing to chart a different course and will require dramatic change.

For example she says the focus solely on net-zero emissions targets is outdated and lacks ambition as does “thinking at the margins of taxes and pricing”.

“We need to completely re-envision what our role is in the world” she says. “Because what is the purpose? It’s to leave the world a little bit better than you found it.

I think we have to offer an alternative of what the vision could be.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyYW5pbnRsLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIyMDYxOTcxNzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Year After Election Papers Say Iran's Raisi Let Down The Nation,"Iranian newspapers Sunday marked the end of the first year since President Ebrahim Raisi's election on June 18 2021 with harsh criticism of his economic team.

Most columnists and commentators welcomed the recent resignation of Raisi's Labor Minister Hojjat Abdolmaleki but said that many more ministers will have to leave the cabinet.

Nonetheless some commentators including Reformist lawmaker Naser Ghavami said replacing current ministers with new ones cannot solve Iran's economic problems. He added that even the best economists cannot tackle the ongoing economic crisis because the underlying reason for problems is the political system itself.

Ghavami charged that the government has made Iran dependant on Russia and China adding that the two countries simply follow their own interests.

Former lawmaker Mohammad Reza Khabbaz asked: ""Do not these minister feel any shame even before their own conscience for accepting to be in charge of key ministries? On what basis has Raisi appointed them as ministers? And what do those who suggested these individuals think about the situation now?""

Khabbaz said that many more ministers from Raisi's cabinet need to go. Meanwhile he called those ministers who promised to create one million jobs or build one million houses every year ""liars."" He further asked: ""Isn't what they have been doing a waste of the country's resources and the nation's dignity?""

Protests in Tehran Bazaar against a steep rise in prices. June 11 2022

Columnist Mohammad Shadi wrote in a commentary in Jahan Sanat newspaper that his publication has been in the market for nearly two decades and it was evident for its journalists that Raisi's ministers were not fit for their jobs. Shadi opined that at least two more economic ministers should leave the government.

Shadi wrote that Iran needs to prove that its economic policies are consistent with international norms if it wishes to attract foreign investment.

The new reformist daily Arman Emrooz not to be mistaken with the very similar looking Arman Melli wrote that ""during the past ten months since Raisi took office he has issued a major directive every 9 days. However 3 out of every 4 orders have been ignored by those who had to carry them out.""

The daily added: ""Out of 37 official orders issued by Raisi 27 of them have not been carried out at all 6 have been carried out and another 4 have been abandoned halfway through their implementation.""

Meanwhile Tahmoures Hoseini wrote in an article in Toseh Irani newspaper: ""Because of the government's performance the divide between the people and officials has increasingly widened in recent years. The current government blames its predecessors and the members of the previous government blame the way elections are held in Iran.

The daily wrote that the rise in the number of protests is another indication of the government's failure while it keeps blaming the United States. The daily quoted Former lawmaker Gholamreza Jafarzadeh Imanabadi: ""I should say clearly that I doubt the honesty of Raisi's economic team. Raisi needs to reshuffle his government and try to meet the promises he made to the people for their votes.""

Economist Albert Boghossian wrote in Setareh Sobh that most of the complaints about the government have something to do with Raisi's broken promises. ‌Boghossian also added that neither Raisi nor his economic team can make any difference while the system does not allow for reforms.

Despite all this the administration-owned daily Iran says all is well and quotes Raisi as saying ""There is no problem in Iran that cannot be solved.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL2ltcG9ydGFudC10aXBzLXRyYXZlbGVycy1tdXN0LWtub3ctd2hlbi1hcnJpdmluZy1hdC10aGUtY2FuY3VuLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlycG9ydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Important Tips Travelers Must Know When Arriving At The Cancun International Airport,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

Cancun was the #2 most visited city in the world throughout the pandemic. Despite the rest of the world shutting down not only has Cancun airport stayed wide open the entire time but they’ve actually surpassed passenger numbers from 2019 breaking arrival records for incoming tourists. To put it plainly Cancun airport is a busy gong-show.

While the Cancun airport has some of the best direct flight connectivity in the world there is a price to pay for such easy access to paradise. Throughout 2022 all tourists flying to Cancun airport should be aware of delays crowds and a list of ‘covid-era’ travel requirements. This article breaks down simply what you’ll need to know about arriving at the Cancun International Airport in 2022 no matter if you’re a first-time visitor or a seasoned pro.

No negative test or proof of vaccination required

Tourists arriving at Cancun airport never have to show any proof of negative tests or vaccination simply because Mexico does not have any entry requirements. Throughout the entire pandemic Mexico has always remained wide open with no testing no quarantines and no proof of vaccination requirements.

The only thing ‘covid related’ is a digital form called the Vuela Seguro form which needs to be filled out by any arriving or departing passenger.

*Update: As of January 2022 the VuelaSeguro form is no longer required.

The flow of arrivals

When you land you will disembark the plane go through the immigration lineup then the baggage carousel potentially through customs if you have something to declare or if you are selected then out to the transportation pickup area.

Have your paperwork and passport in hand as you disembark the plane so you can get into the immigration lineup prepared. If you don't have everything ready you'll have to step aside to fill out papers and the line will fill up very fast ahead of you.

Prepare for immigration to be swamped

Since Cancun has smashed its arrivals records in 2021 customs and immigration are experiencing some serious backups. Depending on how many flights are landing at once you might be through immigration in as little as 10 minutes but we’ve seen lineups of over 3 hours. Be prepared for the worst and hope for the best.

To expedite your time through immigration and to ensure you don’t have to leave the line and re-enter there are things you’re going to want to have ALREADY filled out by the time you reach the line.

Your FMM paper/card either the paper copy handed out to you on the plane or a digital copy you did beforehand on the computer and printed out yourself.

Cancun airport has 4 terminals

The Cancun Airport has 4 different terminals but you will likely be flying into either 2 3 or 4. This is handy to know when booking your airport transfer but many of the companies will just ask you for your flight number as they are professionals at knowing what terminal to pick you up from.

Terminal 2 services many domestic low-cost Mexican airlines like VivaAerobus and Volaris but they also have international flights coming in from Latin America on airlines like Avianca and Copa and LATAM along with USA’s Alaska Airlines and Canada’s Swoop and Sunwing.

Terminal 3 is the busiest terminal for welcoming flights from the U.S. as American Delta JetBlue and United all arrive here. Canada’s Air Canada and Europe’s British Airways and Iberia also land at Terminal 3.

Terminal 4 is a mix of domestic and international being the hub for Mexico’s Aeromexico flights along with many from the U.S. Canada and Europe. From the States Sun Country Southwest and Frontier come into Terminal 4. Canada’s WestJet and Air Transat flights also arrive here with European carriers like Air France Eurowings and Lufthansa.

The terminals that the flights come into are not set in stone and can change so be sure to check your boarding pass or your airline's app to ensure the most up-to-date information.

Please pre-book your transportation

Regardless if this is your first visit to the Cancun Airport or you’ve come many times before you’re going to want to pre-book your transportation from the airport to the hotel before your arrival.

When you clear customs you’re going to want to have your driver waiting in the pick-up area with your name on a signboard trust me on this. After a long flight and long lineups in the airport the last thing you’re going to feel like doing is negotiating with a cab driver who is going to try and either quote you an inflated price or is going to try and sell you a timeshare presentation in exchange for a ride. It’s stressful and will end up costing you more time or money. Just pre-book a ride.

I personally fly into Cancun airport 2x’s a month and I still pre-book every single time. The company I use is Van Travel and I am so incredibly happy with their service. They have budget and luxury options from private shuttle vans to Escalades. 3 passengers in a van costs $55 USD roundtrip which is a great price for the level of service and professionalism they provide.

So what if you totally forgot to pre-arrange a ride? Well you CAN get one at the airport but don’t say I didn’t warn you. A million people will pounce on you once they realize you haven’t pre-arranged and it can be quite overwhelming. Get ready to barter and don’t commit to any meetings or stops along the way.

I always use Van Travel's VIP pickup service at Cancun Airport in their Escalade

The ‘Shark Tank’ or ‘Running the Gauntlet’

Since we are on the topic of transportation this is really key information to know especially for first-timers. After you clear customs and before you’re outside to meet your driver at the pickup location you’re first going to have to walk through the ‘Shark Tank’ or ‘Gauntlet’ as it's commonly called.

This is an area with taxi stands and counters specifically time-share counters under the guise of transportation providers filled with people in uniforms who will shout stand in your way and try and get your attention. They will say things like “Sir! I am your shuttle driver! Please come with me!” but he is not your shuttle driver. He doesn’t even know who you are. He’s just trying to get you to come over and sign up for a timeshare presentation in which he will offer you a free or discounted ride.

The best thing to do when walking through the Shark Tank is just to keep your head forward and NOT engage with anyone who is yelling snapping their fingers or trying to get your attention. Keep walking until you see a big red sign on the ceiling that points to the ‘exit to all ground transportation services and taxis’ which is where the ride that you pre-arranged will be waiting for you.

Keep walking through the ‘shark tank' until you see this sign

Tourists may not automatically receive 180 Days on their visa

Nomads and long-stay travelers need to listen up: You might not get the standard 180-day tourist visa you were expecting.

For many years coming into Mexico and automatically receiving 180 days on a tourist visa was extremely standard practice. Before I became a resident of Mexico I probably came in more than 50+ times over 20 years and always got 180 days without blinking an eye. However a record number of reports have been coming out of Mexico throughout 2021 that Mexican Immigration Authorities are no longer handing out 180 days like candy and they are cracking down on tourists abusing longer stays. We’ve seen this first-hand throughout our circle of friends readers and peers who’ve sent in their FMM cards to us showing as little as 7 days received.

The reason behind this crackdown is Mexico wants long-stay tourists to properly apply for temporary residency instead of constantly renewing their tourist visa and it makes sense for people who have been doing border runs for years but the issue is it’s also affecting first-time tourists. We’ve had first-time European readers fly into Cancun expecting to stay 2 months but only receiving 21 days on their FMM card.

If you are coming for a 1 or 2-week vacation at an all-inclusive in Cancun you likely won’t have an issue at all – even if they issued you a few weeks tourist visa you’ll be back home by the time it expires anyway. However if you’re planning to stay for 2-6 months you’re going to want to slow the agent down at the immigration counter and explain your trip. Any longer-stay tourist should have proof of vacation rental bookings proof of onward travel once their trip is over and anything else to show you actually need the 180 days with the receipts to back it up.

What you should know about departing from the Cancun airport

Once your vacation is done and it’s time to go back home here is what you need to know about departing the Cancun Airport

Check your terminal

Ensure you know where your flight is departing from so your transportation or taxi takes you to the correct terminal.

Fill out and pay Visitax

A very new and quite frankly odd process of paying a tourism tax is now in effect for all departing tourists. All international tourists are supposed to visit the Visitax site prior to arriving at the airport and pay the 224 pesos tax per person online. Once paid it will generate a QR code and proof of payment which you will show agents just before you go through security.

Once again MANY people have said things like “They never checked so I never do it” but we can assure you they are stopping people and forcing them to do it on the spot before entering the security lineup which can be super stressful if you’re already late for your flight. If you want to gamble be my guest but if you want a smooth departure just fill it out and pay it online before you get to the airport.

Another word of warning there are many scam sites out there pretending to be the government's official Visitax site so please be careful and ensure you’re only using the correct link. In 2022 airport authorities are working to allow payments to be made in person with cash but for now the site is the only method.

Give yourself extra time

Since your airline at the Cancun airport is responsible for checking your negative covid test to return home the lineups are taking much longer than normal. If you are not flying business class give yourself at least 3 total hours from your flight's departure time as even if you’re not checking a bag you’ll still have to lineup in the general check-in line to verify your test results and/or vaccination status.

If you're flying business class you can give yourself less time because you have a shorter line at the check-in gate to verify documents.

The resolution seeks the funds from the City’s reserves.

Total inspection fees will exceed $5 million to be paid . The City allocated $800000 under the current budget however the department states the account is nearly “depleted”.

Plan check services are provided under a separate agreement to multiple consultants who are also due to have back invoices paid on the same council agenda. The city expects to spend close to $2.5 million in the current fiscal year and another $2.5 million next fiscal year.

The City provided a lengthy description of capital improvement expenditures during the May 24 regular city council meeting where both the mayor budget manager and former city manager all said the projects aren’t expected to be completed during the fiscal year they are approved.

The City’s mid-year budget review detailed a $22 million deficit. During the May 24 regular city council meeting the council gave City Manager Artie Fields $500000 signature authority to make payments during the two weeks there were no city council meetings (5/31 & 6/7).

Does the City need to come back and revoke Fields’ authorization? How would taxpayers know if he spent that money or not? Does the Finance Department even know for that matter?

Fields was due to report back to the council on how those funds were spent however he wasn’t present at the June 14 meeting. Based on the number of invoices on the June 21 agenda Fields doesn’t appear to have paid any of the vendors.

Particularly invoices related to the Intuit Dome which Mark Weinberg specifically referenced when he discussed the $22 million deficit at great length.

The mayor responded under his breath ”not gonna happen” when told about the upcoming financial obligation yet here it is on the agenda. You can click here to hear him say it.

Wait. Why are taxpayers paying for this? Has Ballmer actually purchased the land yet?",,,,,,,,,,,,
ISRG,Intuitive Surgical,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzE5LzUtc3RvY2tzLWNhbi1idWlsZC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uYWwtd2VhbHRoLWluLTI1LXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Surefire Stocks That Can Build Generational Wealth in 25 Years,"These industry leaders can guide investors to financial independence over the next quarter century.

It's been a trying year for the investing community. Since hitting their respective all-time closing highs within the past seven months the well-known Dow Jones Industrial Average benchmark S&P 500 and growth-dependent Nasdaq Composite have lost 19% 24% and 34% of their value as of June 16 2022.

Although big declines in the stock market can be worrisome historical data shows that buying during these dips is a genius move. Over long periods every notable decline in the major U.S. indexes has eventually been wiped away by a bull market. The key to success aside from buying stakes in innovative high-quality businesses is allowing time to work its magic.

With equities significantly below their all-time highs a number of innovative companies stand out as amazing values for patient investors. What follows are five surefire stocks that have the ability to build generation wealth over the next 25 years.

Intuitive Surgical

To begin with robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.46%) offers significant wealth-building potential for long-term investors thanks to its lasting competitive advantages.

When the first quarter came to a close Intuitive Surgical had installed 6920 of its da Vinci surgical systems in hospitals and surgical centers worldwide. This figure is many multiples higher than its next-closest competitor. But what's far more important to recognize is that the cost of these systems coupled with the training given to surgeons to operate them makes it highly unlikely that customers would ever switch to a competitor. Da Vinci system buyers effectively become a long-term cash stream for the company.

Intuitive Surgical's razor-and-blades operating model is its other big selling point. Although its surgical systems are costly they're intricate to build and therefore produce only mediocre operating margins. As the installed base of da Vinci's systems has grown the percentage of sales from instruments sold with each procedure as well as system servicing has grown. These segments generate considerably higher operating margins and are what can propel Intuitive Surgical's valuation much higher over the next quarter century.

Berkshire Hathaway

For more than 50 years few investments have been more ""surefire"" than riding the coattails of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Since becoming CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.41%) (BRK.B 0.30%) in 1965 the Oracle of Omaha has led his Class A shares (BRK.A) to an annualized return of 20.1% through Dec. 31 2021. On an aggregate basis we're talking about a return of 3641613%.

One of the biggest reasons for Berkshire Hathaway's overwhelming success is Buffett's affinity for loading his company's investment portfolio with cyclical businesses. Buffett is well aware that it's impossible to predict when a recession might occur. But he does realize that periods of economic expansion last substantially longer than recessions. By investing in sectors he knows well and buying stakes in businesses that'll benefit from long-winded expansions he's set his company up to thrive off of the natural growth of the U.S. and global economy.

Berkshire Hathaway's historic outperformance also looks to be a function of its mountain of passive income. Over the next 12 months Buffett's company is on pace to collect north of $6 billion in dividend income. Dividend stocks have a lengthy track record of outperforming their non-dividend-paying peers; and Buffett tends to hold these dividend-paying stocks for years or decades at a time.

Mastercard

A third surefire stock with the capacity to generate life-changing wealth over the next quarter century is payment processor Mastercard (MA 0.82%) which I'll add is a Berkshire Hathaway holding.

Mastercard is the perfect example of how long-term investors can play a simple numbers game and come out as winners. Though recessions usually result in lower spending by consumers and businesses economic contractions typically don't last long. Mastercard benefits from disproportionately long periods of economic expansion and the higher spending that accompanies them.

It's equally important to note that Mastercard strictly acts as a payment processor and not a lender. Despite having the opportunity to collect interest income and fees becoming a lender would expose it to loan delinquencies and charge-offs during periods of economic weakness. Not having to set aside capital is the big reason Mastercard bounces back from recessions faster than most financial stocks.

As a final note most global payments are still being conducted in cash. This gives Mastercard a sustainably long runway to push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions and faster-growing emerging markets.

Etsy

Assuming it doesn't get acquired specialty e-commerce retailer Etsy (ETSY 0.50%) has all the tools and intangibles necessary to build life-changing wealth in the next 25 years.

Whereas most online retail platforms are built solely for volume and lack much in the way of personalization Etsy's retail platform is designed with engagement in mind. The company's merchant network is almost entirely small businesses that produce unique or customizable products. While considerably larger e-commerce players exist none is a direct competitor to what Etsy can offer from a personalized/customized standpoint.

The other impressive aspect has been Etsy's ability to transform casual shoppers into habitual buyers. A ""habitual buyer"" is a term used by the company to describe someone who makes at least six purchases totaling $200 in aggregate over the trailing-12-month period.

Between the end of 2019 (i.e. before the pandemic) and end of 2021 the number of habitual buyers on the platform grew by 224%. This increase is what's allowing Etsy to charge merchants higher fees for advertising and analytics and is a testament that investments in its platform designed to drive user engagement are working.

Alphabet

Lastly even though it's already one of the world's largest public companies by market cap Alphabet (GOOGL 1.87%) (GOOG 1.85%) is a surefire stock that can build generational wealth over 25 years. Alphabet is the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.

The company's foundational segment is Google which has pretty consistently grown its sales by a double-digit percentage for the past two decades. Based on trailing-12-month data provided by GlobalStats Google accounts for 91% to 93% of worldwide search engine market share. If businesses want to reach users they're well aware that paying a premium to advertise with Google is their smartest option.

But what's even more exciting for Alphabet is the growth of its ancillary segments. The aforementioned YouTube is the second most-visited social site on the planet. Meanwhile cloud infrastructure service provider Google Cloud ranks third in global cloud spending. Google Cloud has been growing sales by roughly 45% to 50% annually and cloud service spending is still arguably in its early innings.

Taking into account that cloud service operating margins can leave advertising margins in the dust Alphabet's operating cash flow could take-off by mid-decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Saari who won this title in 2018 at the Marquette Golf Club and in 2021 at North Shore Golf Club near Menominee finished one stroke behind champion Joe Quinn of the Gladstone Golf Club.

Saari shot rounds of 75 on Monday and 77 Tuesday for 152 tying for runner-up just behind Quinn who had 75 and 76 for 151.

Saari tied Larry Bratonia of Gladstone GC who put together rounds of 76-76–152.

Saari came back from a 42 on his front nine in Tuesday’s second round putting together 35 on the back nine to get as close as he did to the title.

Finishing fourth another stroke behind Saari and Bratonia was Jeff McCall of the Escanaba Country Club with 79-74–153 while in fifth was Mark Ray of Highland Golf Club near Escanaba with 79-76–155. McCall’s 74 was the best round Tuesday among the dozen golfers in the championship flight.

One other Marquette County golfer was reported to have participated according to officials at Young’s. Steve Swentik of the Marquette Golf Club qualified for the first flight as there were 11 flights in addition to the championship flight. He shot 82-96–178 to place 11th in the flight and had missed qualifying for the championship flight by just two strokes.

Marquette County golfers have had a good history of winning this tournament over the past two decades according to information on the UPGA website www.upga.org.

Wawonowin’s Dale Bayer won this title in 2012 at the Marquette GC and in 2013 at the Gladstone GC while Ray O’Dea of Marquette GC took the title in 2009 when it was held at the Gogebic Country Club of Ironwood.

The UPGA lists several other major U.P. tournaments for later this summer including the U.P. Ladies Golf Association Championship on July 18-21 at Riverside Country Club in Menominee and the UPGA Men’s — technically open — Championship from Aug. 11-14 at Pine Grove Country Club near Iron Mountain.

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

Nevertheless Karma Ben-Johanan points out Vatican II did not address the fundamental theological implications of Nostra Aetate. If Jews were rejected by God and replaced by the Catholic Church until the end of history did they not need to accept Christ as their savior to achieve salvation? What does Jewish survival their covenant with God and the establishment of the State of Israel mean?

In Jacob’s Younger Brother Ben-Johanan a professor of Jewish-Christian Relations at Humboldt University at Berlin provides an extraordinarily sophisticated insightful and provocative examination of how Roman Catholics and Orthodox Jews addressed the prospect of reconciliation in the second half of the twentieth century. As she “extracts dominant trajectories out of a vast mixture of diverse phenomenon” Ben-Johanan argues that the secular liberal post-World War II order that facilitated Christian-Jewish dialogue pushed the Church to offer the faithful “a sense of belonging and an anchor of identity in this world more than salvation in the next.” And it empowered Orthodox Jews to highlight their profound differences with the Church but also see secularization “as a joint enemy that unites them with their Christian counterparts.”

A catalyst to reexamine fundamental Christian dogmas

For a few progressive post-Vatican II Catholics Ben-Johanan reveals the turn to Judaism was a catalyst for a reexamination of fundamental Christian dogmas. If Jesus really was a man of first-century Jewish Palestine Hans Küng asked was he “More than a prophet? More than the law? Is he even the Messiah? A Messiah crucified in the name of the law?” Veronica Wipes the Face of Jesus (credit: FLICKR)

Catholics across the theological spectrum acknowledged that the Holocaust undermined the conviction that Jews’ rejection of Christ doomed them to eternal damnation because the appalling punishment “vilified God’s morality.” Albeit in different ways however they gravitated toward claims that Jews were distant from God by their own choice but close to God by His choice. And Ben-Johanan writes to affirm that post-crucifixion Jews had a positive role in salvation “but keep that role a mystery.”

As if to underscore the challenge while Jews deemed comparisons between the crucifixion and Auschwitz abhorrent because genocide in gas chambers was neither voluntary nor in any sense redemptive Christians found the comparisons almost self-evident “and too valuable to completely relinquish.”

The existence of Israel forced Catholic thinkers to decide whether the Jewish state was a secular event or a stage in the Christian program of salvation. Most of them we learn vacillated between discomfort at the messianic interpretation Orthodox Jews gave the State of Israel and the sense that recent events fit well into their own messianic narrative.

AS THEOLOGICAL disputes threatened to sabotage Vatican II and undermine Catholic doctrines John Paul II transformed discussions of the Catholic-Jewish relationship. The Pope endorsed conservative positions inside the Church but communicated with the outside world “with acts and gestures personal meetings diplomatic contacts and the creation of shared memories” including highly publicized visits to Auschwitz and the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem.

By the end of his pontificate in 2005 Ben-Johanan notes the once traumatic and still unresolved controversies interested only a handful of Catholic theologians. Efforts by Benedict XVI to provide more precise answers “came too late after the sun of theology had already set.”

According to Ben-Johanan contemporary Orthodox rabbis Zionist and anti-Zionist in Israel and the United States perceive Christianity as idolatry and reject “more tolerant” halachic traditions despite their long history. She attributes the mainstreaming of more stringent positions less to a defensive response to secularization than to a conviction that Jews need no longer fear Christianity.

At a time in which many Christians and Jews renounced deicide charges Zvi Yehuda Kook quoted Maimonides’ statement that Jesus had been stoned and hanged in a rabbinic court – and endorsed his defense of the murder of idolatry. The real crime Kook declared was expressed “in its disgusting loathsomeness in the raising of ‘that personality’ as if it were divine as if it were essentially equal related obscurely foggily affiliated with the original and real selfhood of the Creator and leader of the universe.”

Continuing to see exile as a temporary phase the Kooks and their disciples could now exult “that the lion cub of Judea has been resurrected and established its state and the resurrection in its own right undermines the entire foundation of Christian faith.” The Six-Day War they proclaimed vindicated biblical prophecy and the validity of the covenant between the people of Israel and God.

At the dawn of the 21st century Ben-Johanan concludes the Catholic Church no longer threatens eternal damnation rarely made the claim that the church is the true Israel or that God’s covenant with the Jews had been withdrawn. Nor has the church specified “the theological meaning in these changes in the Christian worldview.”

While the church is searching for ways to rehabilitate itself Orthodox Judaism “wishing to rid itself of the sanctification of weakness” has harnessed itself “to the impossible project of cleansing from its sources all traces of relations with Christianity in a search for a pure and primordial form of Judaism.”

Jacob’s Younger Brother ends however with Ben-Johanan’s search for a silver lining. The dynamic of “Christian embrace met by Jewish pushback” she declares does not imply stagnation. Each religious community is “updating its tradition and extracting new principles” appropriate for its reading of signs of the times.

Ben-Johanan hopes that more Christians will recognize that the “reconciliation that brings an end to the old relationship with all of its problems is in itself… suffused with anti-Jewish elements.” And she seems pleased that the reconciliation with “inherent tensions between the Jewish and Christian traditions” is holding. 

Jacobs has had a solid three seasons with the franchise but will likely see a smaller role in the team’s offense in the upcoming 2022 season.

Jacobs reached the 1000-yard mark in his first two seasons but fell short in 2021. He is a heavy-hitting softy running back that has seamlessly transitioned from being a stellar running back from the collegiate level to the NFL.

Recently the Raiders made it known to the public that the front office did not plan on picking up Jacobs’ fifth-year option. This will make him a free agent following the 2022 season.

Now in a year that will have a heavy influence on what happens with Jacobs in free agency it appears as if his role as the lead back will shrink dramatically as the team’s offense moves toward a running back by committee.

Vic Tafur of The Athletic states the team’s offense is evolving and Jacobs as well as former Alabama running back Kenyan Drake will not be in the team’s long-term plans.

“Sounds to me like you have to use (Zamir White) this season. Jacobs and Drake will likely both be gone next year after playing out their contracts and there is probably a decent chance Ziegler and McDaniels already think White is better than them. A committee approach seems to make sense keeping everybody fresh and ideally available.”

Marcus Mosher of Raiders Wire explains how this will have an immediate impact on Jacobs.

“Jacobs was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2020 and he has eclipsed 1200 total yards in each of his three seasons in the NFL. But the Raiders aren’t convinced he is a game-changing running back that can stay on the field. “While he’ll likely still be the starter in 2022 it seems very unlikely that he will average 18 touches like he did last season. Instead look for Kenyan Drake and Zamir White to both eat into his touches during the year.”

Roll Tide Wire will continue to follow Josh Jacobs and other former Alabama players in the NFL.

The decision gave teams a 9-3 advantage with just two cases remaining to be heard next week involving New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge and Atlanta Braves left-hander Max Fried.

Richard McNeill Gary Klendellen and Fredric Horowitz made the decision on Stallings a day after hearing arguments.

Stallings traded to Miami in December hit .246 last year for the Pittsburgh Pirates with career bests of eight homers and 53 RBIs earning $1.3 million. He entered Saturday with a .199 average two homers and 21 RBIs.

Enthused about the offseason trade Stallings was thrilled to join the Marlins who were 28-34 before taking on the New York Mets on Saturday.

""I never thought that I would be [the centerpiece of a trade] even to this day"" Stallings said after the deal. ""I've said this before but I heard Derek Jeter say it I think in his Hall of Fame speech. He said 'When you're playing you're really only concerned with keeping a job and getting a job.' And that's really been my focus.

""Just trying to keep a job stay in the big leagues and reach my potential and just try to get better and be as good as I can be. So that's really my focus and always has been throughout my journey.""

No statistics or evidence from after March 1 are admissible other than contract and salary comparisons. The timing was set when Major League Baseball and the players' association agreed to the deal that ended the lockout.

Losing in earlier decisions were Atlanta outfielder Adam Duvall ($9275000) Braves third baseman Austin Riley ($3.95 million) injured Atlanta reliever Luke Jackson ($3.6 million) St. Louis outfielder Tyler O'Neill ($3.4 million) Kansas City infielder Nicky Lopez ($2.55 million) Miami right-hander Pablo Lopez ($2.45 million) Milwaukee right-hander Adrian Houser ($2425000) and Cincinnati pitcher Lucas Sims ($1.2 million).

Winning were Atlanta shortstop Dansby Swanson ($10 million) Seattle second baseman/outfielder Adam Frazier ($8 million) and Kansas City outfielder Andrew Benintendi ($8.5 million).

Arbitration hearings usually are held during the first three weeks of February but were delayed by the lockout.

Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared on Tuesday to be backing off her threat to force a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson this week though she signaled that she'll preserve her threat indefinitely -- keeping Johnson on a tight leash as he navigates a one-vote majority in the chamber.

The development comes after Greene and Johnson met on Tuesday afternoon -- their second meeting in as many days. The meetings came after Greene said she would force a vote to remove Johnson from the leadership post this week.

""I will tell you one thing I did say in there: I am so done with words"" Greene told reporters on the House steps Tuesday afternoon after the meeting with Johnson. ""For me it is all about actions. And that is all the American people care about.""

Ahead of the meeting with Johnson on Tuesday Greene shared her list of demands for the speaker. Her four requests included a return to the ""Hastert Rule"" which means no legislation is brought to a vote without the support of the majority of the majority party; no more funding for Ukraine; defund the special counsel's probe into former President Donald Trump; and avoid a government shutdown before the election by passing a continuing resolution to automatically enact a 1% spending cut.

Greene said she is not imposing a deadline for Johnson to comply with her four ""suggestions.""

""These are not complicated things that we're talking about and having the majority of Republicans support for bills that are brought to the floor. Yeah that's very reasonable"" Greene said. ""It's really simple. It's up to Mike Johnson to be our Republican speaker. And we'll see what he does. And again it's actions for me.""

Greene said she did not provide the speaker with a specific timeline on the demands but said ""it's pretty short.""

​​""That's up to Mike Johnson and it can't drag out"" she said. ""These are things that have to be done.""

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie Greene's chief ally in the quest to oust Johnson said the speaker has been open to the four demands ""but the question is what is he going to do to show that he is moving in that direction.""

At the weekly GOP news conference on Tuesday Johnson didn't rule out Greene's request to defund the special counsel's probe into Trump.

""We're looking very intently at it because I think the problem has reached a crescendo"" Johnson said.

Johnson has already passed government funding aid for Ukraine Israel and Taiwan and even a federal surveillance extension -- meaning that the House is mostly void of must-pass legislation. That gives Johnson the space to advance other Republican-led efforts as the next appropriations battle nears.

Greene has criticized Johnson for working with Democrats on several of those pieces of legislation. Johnson has fought back saying he's a lifelong Republican but must do his job to serve the entire House with an extremely thin Republican majority.

The Georgia congresswoman said last week she was moving ahead with her ouster effort despite pushback from many Republicans and a statement from Democrats that they would step in to help save Johnson. Trump has also weighed in on Greene's move to oust Johnson.

Trump spoke privately to Greene over the weekend and urged her to drop her push to oust Johnson a source close to the president confirmed to ABC News. During their discussion Trump told Greene that the party needs to be unified according to the source.

The former president's team has mulled over how best to show support for Johnson. Trump brought Johnson on stage at the RNC spring retreat luncheon over the weekend and praised him ""for his leadership and work in the US House"" emphasizing ""the need for party unity collaboration and expanding the GOP's House Majority"" according to the campaign.

Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L21pa2Utam9obnNvbi1tYXJqb3JpZS10YXlsb3ItZ3JlZW5lLWRlbW9jcmF0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Democrats warn Mike Johnson about private meetings with Marjorie Taylor Greene,"House Democrats are aghast as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) conducts a series of lengthy meetings with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) aimed at defusing her efforts to oust him. Why it matters: Democrats have already vowed to protect Johnson from Greene's motion – leading many of them to ask why he's still trying to appease her.

""He has to be careful here"" said one senior House Democrat telling Axios that ""if he looks like he's just simply going to try to capitulate to her that could affect [the way] some Democrats see him.""

House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said Tuesday: ""When Speaker Johnson meets with her for hours the American people should be asking 'what is Marjorie Taylor Greene extracting from the speaker?'""

Driving the news: Greene met with Johnson for several hours this week laying out demands that include no more aid to Ukraine and defunding special counsel probes.

Johnson told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday: ""It's not a negotiation okay this is how I've operated as speaker.""

After their meeting on Tuesday Greene said ""the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" and that she doesn't have a ""specific timeline."" She previously promised to force a vote this week.

What they're saying: ""I don't know what in the world they could be talking about for hours on end and I don't know why he would waste his time there. We have given enough indication we can help him get back to business"" Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.) told Axios.

Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) told Axios: ""You cannot placate her. The minute you try to appease her she's going to have new demands.""

""I worry that the Republicans are focused more on their internal battles and their culture wars than trying to do what's right for the American people as a whole"" said Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.).

Zoom in: House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) compared Johnson's talks with Greene to the deal former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) struck with hardliners last January.

Included in the deal was a rule allowing any member to force a vote on removing the speaker which led to McCarthy's ouster and now has empowered Greene to bring Johnson to the table.

Between the lines: Democrats are still broadly committed to saving Johnson said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) but ""three months from now that doesn't necessarily [have to] be the case"" for some of his less committed colleagues.

Another House Democrat told Axios: ""It's fine – sit listen it doesn't cost you anything. But at some point you say: discussion's over shit or get off the pot. This has already consumed way too much attention.""

The other side: Some Democrats see Johnson as just doing what he needs to do.

Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. met with Johnson behind closed doors for roughly two hours late Monday afternoon after promising last week to force a House-wide vote on his removal. They declined to give details to reporters immediately after the sit-down but said they would have a follow-up discussion with Johnson on Tuesday.

However Fox News Digital was told they are broadly seeking four points – including no more funding for Ukraine nor special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Trump.

They are also demanding that Johnson vow to block any legislation from getting a House-wide vote unless it has the support of a majority of the House GOP – a longstanding informal provision called the Hastert rule named after a former Republican speaker.

On government funding the conservatives are also pushing Johnson to adhere to the Massie rule which would require automatic federal spending cuts if an agreement is not reached on fiscal year 2025 funding by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Fox News Digital reached out to Greene Massie and Johnson's offices for comment. A spokesman for Greene declined to discuss the contents of a private meeting.

Meanwhile Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. the third GOP rebel who signed onto Greene's motion to vacate the chair – a resolution calling for a House-wide vote on removing the speaker – suggested to reporters on Monday evening that he wanted Johnson to have some more time to change course.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

""I don't think it's going to happen this week. I hope it doesn't happen this week"" Gosar told reporters. ""I think it would be nice to see him go back to regular order get things coming from committees you get a majority of the majority to get something on the floor.""

Greene is leading the push to oust Johnson amid conservative frustrations over his bipartisan work on critical legislation related to government funding and foreign aid. She and Massie pledged to force the vote sometime this week.

To do so she would have to notice her resolution as ""privileged"" – meaning the House would have two legislative days to vote on the measure itself or first vote on scuttling it via a procedure known as ""tabling"" the resolution.

Democrats have pledged to block the ouster vote by voting to table the resolution whenever it comes up something that could save Johnson while also likely raising more conservative frustrations.

Johnson told reporters on Monday evening that his meeting with Massie and Greene was ""lengthy"" but ""constructive.""

""We have discussed some ideas and we're going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said. ""I just want to say and I told them and I've said this repeatedly that I understand the frustration. I share it. I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin."""

That focus remains today.

""When I became a father I didn't know a whole lot"" Munoz said to his audience Sunday in the Pro Football Hall of Fame event center ballroom. ""I am just glad God let me be a father.""

Munoz was among featured speakers at the event which was arranged by the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls and the Fatherhood Festival.

Munoz who was enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998 was joined on the stage by his son Michael. The younger Munoz is employed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Anthony Munoz an offensive lineman during his National Football League career gave an example of a sacrifice he made for the sake of his son.

Decide between ESPN job and coaching son's team

The father had a job with ESPN to help broadcast football games but a conflict developed when the son asked Anthony Munoz to help coach his football team. Anthony Munoz approached ESPN with his dilemma. The network agreed to let Munoz out of his contract so he could help coach his son's team.

Anthony Munoz was ""able to make decisions with my kids in mind and not just me in mind"" he said. ""I am grateful for that.""

The Father's Day event which included a brunch attracted a near capacity crowd. The purpose of the program is help reinforce the importance of effective parenting on behalf of fathers.

""And also to help those kids that don't have a father figure in their life"" said Justin Batt of Nashville Tenn. who helped start the Daddy Saturday Foundation. ""A lot of outreach for the event was for single mothers foster children and low-income families.""

Sunday was the final day of the three-day Fatherhood Festival.

""We want to do this every single year here in Canton"" Batt said. ""Then it grows from Canton to all over Ohio and all over the nation. At this point fatherhood is a battleground. It is a fight.""

Shaun Alexander visits Canton

Another former NFL star who spoke was Shaun Alexander a running back with the Seattle Seahawks won the league Most Valuable Player Award in 2005.

""The individual awards don't mean as much as doing something that is going to impact generations"" Alexander said.

Alexander is the father of 10. He and his wife try to spend what he calls ""one-on-one time"" with each child.

Master of ceremonies at the event was Dennis Rebelo a professor at Roger Williams University in Bristol R.I. Also at the event Sunday was Dave Robinson a star defensive player with the Green Bay Packers during the team's championship years of the 1960s. Robinson also is enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

He fist-bumped Mikko Rantanen to thank him for the pass and skated to the bench.

He and the Avalanche are calm confident and rolling. They’re now two wins from dethroning the two-time defending champions.

Looking like by far the better team the Avalanche overwhelmed the Tampa Bay Lightning 7-0 in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Final on Saturday night to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

Coach Jared Bednar called it “as close to perfect of a game as you can get from your players.”

“I feel like we played to our identity to a ‘T’ tonight” Makar said. “We had some good goals and stuff like that. ... It was a little bit of a weird one tonight. Obviously we’re getting opportunities but guys were able to able to capitalize so that’s good part.”

Valeri Nichushkin scored his seventh and eighth goals of the playoffs and continued to be the best player on the ice in the final Game 1 overtime hero Andre Burakovsky beat Andrei Vasilevskiy again and even defensive defenseman Josh Manson and 35-year-old grinder Darren Helm got in on the fun with a goal apiece. Makar who didn’t even have a shot on goal in Game 1 scored twice in the third period inciting chants of “We want the Cup!” from a fired up crowd.

“They’re playing at an elite level right now — give them credit. We are not” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. “They’re two good teams. They’re just playing a much higher level right now than we are.”

Rarely have the Lightning been completely outclassed during this run of postseason success but they also hadn’t faced an opponent like the Avalanche who forced them into one uncharacteristic mistake after another. Colorado was dominant in every facet of the game to move two victories away from its first title since 2001 and the first by this core led by Nathan MacKinnon.

The Avalanche go to Tampa for Game 3 on Monday night up in the series despite no goals in the series from MacKinnon who at times has played like a man possessed in an effort to finally break though and hoist the Cup. They still became just the third team in NHL history to score three-plus goals in the first period of Games 1 and 2 in the final.

“We played a pretty good game” Helm said. “We just played a full 60-minute game.”

The dominant performance started by pouncing on an early mistake by typically reliable Lightning defenseman Erik Cernak when he bobbled the puck at the blue line on one of the game’s first shifts. It was all Avalanche after that.

Their aggressive forecheck led them to draw a penalty on veteran Ryan McDonagh score on the ensuing power play when Burakovsky fed Nichushkin for his first of the night. It wasn’t his last and Colorado poured it on with six of the game’s first seven shots and complete territorial domination with much of the game played in the Tampa Bay end.

With Vasilevskiy — whose play was the key to the Lightning’s incredible ability to bounce back after a loss in the playoffs — looking shaky and even dropping his head after letting Makar beat him clean on one of many 2-on-1 rushes the Avalanche made the most of all their offensive zone time. The highest-scoring team this postseason put on a clinic against the team that has played more hockey than anyone else over the past two years.

That may finally be taking its toll and it’s exacerbated by the blazing speed with which the Avalanche play. They again not only outskated the Lightning but used quick feet to force errors that turned into goals.

“We came out with a purpose” said forward Andew Cogliano who returned after missing Game 1 with a right finger injury. “We got to our game we skated from the drop of the puck and we just didn’t let up.”

Tampa Bay fell to 18-2 after a loss since the start of the first round in 2020. The streak of 18 in a row ended in the Eastern Conference final against the New York Rangers when the Lightning fell behind 2-0 before roaring back though it’s hard to see Colorado falling into the same trap.

The way the Lightning lost this one — by far their biggest blowout loss during this run — came as a surprise to just about everyone.

“Am I shocked that we lost 7-zip?” Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said. “I mean I don’t think we saw that coming.”

Even if players brush off the concept of momentum from game to game during a playoff series their romp over the champs combined with a 7-0 road record should fill the Avalanche with confidence. But they might again need to dip into their pool of depth because of injuries.

After getting Andrew Cogliano back from missing the season opener with a right finger injury the Avalanche lost Burakovsky again in the second period. Burakovsky blocked a shot in the first game in the West final and has been playing through pain since. Bednar said he would be re-evaluated ahead of Game 2.

Colorado is inflicting plenty of pain on Tampa Bay which resorted to some rough stuff after falling behind. Of course even MacKinnon was throwing hits in the third period despite the game being well in hand.

Darcy Kuemper was barely tested in net for Colorado picking up the shutout with 17 saves.

“He was just rock solid” Manson said. “He was exactly what we needed to be.”

Describe your position as the youth education program director for the Pro Football Hall of Fame?

My role is to develop direct and promote the Hall of Fame youth and education programs.

What's a typical day like?

We have a team of three that handles all the day-to-day responsibilities for the Youth & Education Department. One teammate oversees all of our onsite programs like our traditional field trips and our highly popular Get-Fit Training Camp presented by Panini which takes place for two weeks each May at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. This year we have nearly 6000 students and teachers registered to participate in this camp.

Another teammate oversees our national outreach programs like Heart of a Hall of Famer which requires some traveling. For example he just got back from Las Vegas. We led a national program from a school in Las Vegas with Hall of Famer Rod Woodson during the NFL Draft.

As for me in addition to overseeing all of our programs a big chunk of my day during the school year is spent connecting to classrooms across the country via Zoom and Google Meet. In 2021 we connected with 756 groups that represented more than 21000 students from 33 states as well as Canada and Hungary.

During the summer my focus switches to our Enshrinement Week programming which includes the annual Play Football First Play event presented by Panini where we line up more than 3000 youth from downtown Canton to the front steps of the Hall of Fame to kick off the celebration for the week.

More:Five questions with ... Lynn Shimko co-creator of 720 Market

What kind of activities does the Hall of Fame provide for the youth program?

We offer a wide range of programs. Some include traditional field trips virtual field trips college programming character programs camps online resources teacher enrichment days and many youth-focused events during Enshrinement Week powered by Johnson Controls.

Share your personal thoughts when it comes to getting youth involved with sports-related events and activities.

When we look at the number of our youth who love the game of football it makes sense to use this game to motivate and inspire our young people. That is why we use the game of football to teach different curricular areas like science social studies language arts careers and character.

What better way to teach a fifth graders about a zig-zag movement than watching a Barry Sanders highlight or seeing the science behind a Dwight Freeney spin?

In addition to all this we give teachers 17 opportunities to connect and interact either in person or via Zoom to our Hall of Famers through our Heart of Hall of Famer series connected by Extreme Networks. This series aims to inspire young people to achieve Hall of Fame success on and off the field.

Since the series began we’ve connected more than 100 Hall of Famers – Marshall Faulk Jerome Bettis and Jerry Rice to name only a few – to nearly 100000 students nationwide.

What are a few of the non-sports-related activities you participate in or places you like to visit around Stark County?

I’m a lifelong resident of Alliance so most of my activities take place around there.

I’m very active in my church at Alliance Christian Center and ministry at the University of Mount Union through the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. I also serve on the Sport Business Advisory Board at the University of Mount Union.

But when it comes my favorite places to take my family without a doubt Handel’s Ice Cream is at the top and we also love to walk through Silver Park. We live close to the park so we are there often. Another place we love to go is Beech Creek Botanical Gardens.

The opportunities for the financial services industry are inestimable today but perhaps the best analogue is the value created during the Renaissance.

Fidelity Investments has said that “the metaverse is the next evolution of the internet – a 3D model of the internet.” One of the most monumental periods in time for finance as well as science math and art – the Renaissance – did much the same thing. Greats such as Michelangelo and Alberti perfected that use of linear perspective as a means of depicting three-dimensional depth in art. Today’s metaverse puts us on the same trajectory and fintech very well could be the means to getting there.

Fintech redraws the lines of financial services

CB Insights recently reported that “2021 was venture capital’s biggest year ever: more than $621 billion invested worldwide – with $132 billion going to fintech companies.” That means one dollar out of every five invested in innovative ideas last year went to fintech. Catalyzed by a river of investor capital cheaper and more ubiquitous digital channels (such as smartphone adoption) and ever-increasing customer expectations for frictionless financial services across all industries we can argue we are living in the fastest most profound secular shift in the adoption of emerging financial services technology in history.

Innovative firms have replaced the metaphorical mattock approach financial services takes to developing new product and service delivery channels with technologies that streamline infrastructure and increasingly augment human intelligence. These smart fintech platforms enable client information to be much more efficiently and robustly aggregated and analyzed and also further leverage connectivity. This means financial services has been able to reach more clients more efficiently and with more targeted products than ever before. Admittedly there is much more to do here; however an important consequence of these efforts has been a future financial services industry with broader access marginal cost reduction and more transparency.

The shift to digital is accelerating

Fintech has made a consequential impact on the financial services and other industries. For example the banking industry has been undergoing a monumental shift in recent years with fintech shaking things up on all fronts. But it isn’t only our contemporary form of banking that appears to be transient.

Across the past decade and certainly accelerated by the global health crisis other areas of financial services such as payments custody and compliance institutional and retail investing real estate and insurance among many others have benefitted from innovative fintech solutions.

It is tempting to suggest that those companies and countries that have mastered the art of making financial transactions convenient and real-time have a competitive advantage going into this next decade of innovation. But that would be a miscalculation. It may well be that the emergence of the metaverse when combined with fintech has the real potential to improve almost every aspect of the financial industry.

The dramatic changes that have come to financial services appear to be moving in the direction of a new format entirely with the adoption of more digital technologies. In most corners of the financial services sector some if not all participants have advanced past analog to digital. In certain regions even legal tender – that is bills and coins – is being transformed by more efficient exchange methods such as CBDCs (central bank digital currencies).

The metaverse can reconnect the financial services sector

As a construct the metaverse seeks to be an interoperable digital world where people are conversing earning and spending and importantly merging real and virtual assets. Its mere existence requires new thinking on securing our identity conducting transactions and owning assets. Through its focus on interoperability Web3 and the metaverse may very well reconnect a financial services industry that still grapples with inclusivity back to its economic core albeit in an immersive online environment.

Blockchain is one technology that will underpin our emerging immersive world. While it has been held out by some as the cornerstone to the future of financial services it’s been some time coming. The use of clay cuneiform tablets and a chisel to make ledgers that kept count on loaves of bread or jars of olive oil has been around since at least Mesopotamian times.

More contemporaneously Institutional Investor magazine Editor Michael Peltz called it in 2015 when he wrote “The beauty of blockchain technology is the fact that you can do a transaction that is affirmed right away and in ten minutes the whole network is updated.” Unlike clay tablets or spreadsheets blockchain technology provides the immutable near real-time confirmation of ownership of assets or identity that is critical to a well-functioning boundless but integrated metaverse.

Programmable money will have a similar pivotal role in the metaverse as will the regulatory and legal constructs that define (or don’t) the new standards of consumer protection. As the metaverse crosses borders and engages in traditional financial transactions outside of the digital world like mortgages the integration of currencies that engender trust acceptance and stability are paramount.

It's challenging to forecast what the future of finance will look like yet one thing is clear; it won't be the same as today. However fintech and new technologies will drive us to a new digital future in one form or another. The metaverse may well be the center of financial services and fintech will help the new Michelangelos thrive.

While fiber optic communications have been around for half a century we’ve only recently started applying the technology at the board level. Despite this Wade expects within the next decade optical waveguides will begin supplanting the copper traces on PCBs as shipments of optical I/O products take off.

Driving this transition are a number of factors and emerging technologies that demand ever-higher bandwidths across longer distances without sacrificing on latency or power.

If this sounds familiar these are the same challenges that drove telecommunication giants like Bell to replace thousands of miles of copper telephone cables with fiber optics in the 1970s.

As a general rule the higher the bandwidth the shorter the distance it can travel without the assistance of amplifiers or repeaters to extend the reach at the expense of latency. And this is hardly unique to telecommunications networks.

The same laws of physics apply to interconnect technologies like PCIe. As it doubles its effective bandwidth with each subsequent generation the physical distance the signal can travel shrinks.

“In a lot of cases long distances are now defined as anything more than a few meters” Wade said. “As the PCIe bandwidths are going higher and higher you can no longer escape the server board without putting a retimer on the board” to boost the signal.

“Even if you can get the bandwidth from point A to point B the question is with how much power and with how much latency” he adds.

Ayar Labs takes optical I/O to the centimeter scale

This is exactly the problem that Ayar Labs is trying to solve. The silicon photonics startup has developed a chiplet that takes electrical signals from chips and converts them into a high-bandwidth optical signal.

And because the technology uses chiplet architecture it’s intended to be packaged alongside compute tiles from other chipmakers using open standards like the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCI-express) which is currently in development.

The underlying technology has helped the company raise nearly $200 million from tech giants like Intel and Nvidia and secure several high-profile partnerships including one to bring optical I/O capabilities to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s high-performance Slingshot interconnect fabric.

Near-term applications

While Wade firmly believes that optical communication at the system level is inevitable he notes there are several applications for optical interconnects in the near term. These include high-performance computing and composable infrastructure.

“Our claim is that the electrical I/O problem is going to become so severe that computing applications are going to start to get throttled by their ability to shift bandwidth around” he said. “For us that's AI and machine learning scale out.”

These HPC environments often require specialized interconnect technologies to avoid bottlenecks. Nvidia’s NVLink is one example. It enables high-speed communication between up to four GPUs.

Another area of opportunity for optical I/O Wade says is the kind of rack-level composable infrastructure promised by Compute Express Link’s (CXL) latest specs.

CXL defines a common cache-coherent interface based on PCIe for interconnecting CPUs memory accelerators and other peripherals

The CXL 1.0 and CXL 2.0 specs promise to unlock a variety of memory pooling and tiered memory functionality. However the open standard’s third iteration expected to be ratified later this year will extend these capabilities beyond the rack level.

It’s at this stage of CXL’s development that Wade says optical’s advantages will be on full display.

“Even at the CXL 2.0 level you're very limited to the degree in which you can scale out because the moment you hit something like a retimer you start to incur latencies” that make memory pooling impractical he said.

However for at least the first generation of CXL products Wade expects most if not all will be electrical. “There's a lot of software stack work that has to get done to really enable these kind of disaggregated systems” before CXL will be ready for optical I/O he said.

But as the applications for optical I/O become more prevalent Wade predicts the supply chain economics will make the technology even more attractive from a cost perspective. “It's our belief that we're gonna see an optical I/O transformation start to hit throughout almost every market vertical that's building computing systems.”

Challenges aplenty

Of course getting there won’t be without its challenges and one of the biggest is convincing customers the technology is not only more performant and economically viable but mature enough for production environments.

This is specifically why Ayar Labs is focused on optical interconnects as opposed to co-packaged optics. One of the reasons that co-packaged optics haven’t taken off is their splash radius in the event of failure is significantly larger. If the optics fail on a co-packaged optical switch the entire appliance goes down. And many of these same concerns apply to optical I/O.

“Whenever you have a heavily commoditized standardized risk-averse application space that is not a place to try to deploy a new technology” Wade said. However “if you have a high-value application that highly benefits from increases in hardware performance then you're obviously going to take more risk.”

By focusing its attention on HPC environments Ayar believes it can refine its designs and establish a supply chain for components all while racking up the substantial field-operating hours necessary to sell to more mainstream markets.

Sci-Fi optical computers still more than a decade away

For customers that are ready and willing to risk deploying nascent technologies optical I/O is already here.

“The customer that we're delivering to right now has already replaced their board-level links with our optical I/O” Wade said. “Every socket-to-socket link is an optical I/O link and that's even at the board level.”

As the technology matures the question then becomes whether the optical waveguides will ever get integrated into the PCB — ala Star Trek.

“Will we see the optical waveguides getting integrated into the boards? I do think we’ll see some of that emerge actually within the next decade” he said. “As the volume of optical I/O solutions start to get massive it’ll make it more attractive for some of these solutions.”

Once you start shrinking beyond the board level the future of optical I/O gets a bit murkier. The next logical step Wade says would be using optics to connect the individual dies that make up the chip.

However he doesn’t expect this to happen anytime soon. “As you go into the millimeter scale electrical I/O has I think a healthy roadmap in front of it” he said. “Beyond 10-15 years we might see… optical communication start to enter the millimeter scale regime.” ®",,,,,,,,,,,,

Born on April 1 1934 in Oshkosh WI to the late Margretta (Davies) and Warren Wood Woody was the youngest of two brothers. He went to school in Oshkosh and it was there that he made many lifelong friendships. He married Jane Hensel in 1957 and together they raised their three children. Woody worked at Kimberly Clark for close to 40 years forming close friendships. When he retired he swore he’d never wear another tie again. He was noted for his collection of “cool” t-shirts which were given to him by family and friends and gray socks with cutoff tops - personally customized by him for comfort and style! After retirement Woody volunteered at Jefferson Elementary School in Appleton for 24 years. Being there was truly his happy place. One of the greatest compliments he said he ever received was when after saying “hi” to a student in the hallway he heard another student ask “who’s the adult?” The student responded “that’s not an adult that’s Mr. Wood!”. Woody had an incredible knowledge of history music movies and sports and enjoyed golfing and bowling with friends. He loved the game of baseball; was a lifelong Cardinals (Stan Musial) fan loved Timber Rattler games and the NCAA DIII tournament when played in Appleton. He always kept his glove in the car just in case he got “The Call”. We will always remember his humbleness his quiet nature but strong presence his humor his games his love of movies and his interest in all things family. His love was always kind always supportive always selfless and unconditional. He kept it simple taught through connection and shared himself with fun loving energy. “ZANZIBAR!” A magnet for kids he made a difference every day and influenced generations. He was grateful gentle and peace-loving. We were blessed to have him in our lives and his memory lives on in all of us. We love you and we deeply miss you. We will always feel your presence simply because that’s what you gave. We are forever grateful. From K K and M: Thank you for everything thank you for being you and thank you for being Dad. Woody is survived by: Jane Koeffler; their children: Kathryn (Sam) Eustice Kevin (TerriBeth) Wood and Mark Wood; his grandchildren: Emily (Ben) DeMoulin Anna (Ben) Geyer Jena (Billy) Kratz Carli (Paul DesJardins) Wood Wilson Wood Nahani Wood Teale (Amos) Cook and Lander Wood. He delighted in his role as ‘Governor’ to his great-grandchildren: Hunter Reid and Levi DeMoulin Kolton and Rhys Kratz Leona Geyer and Kemmer Cook; Woody’s second wife Sharon Wood; and her children: Laura (Leif) Esbensen Howard ‘Skip’ Brown Michael (Jehan) Brown and Matthew (Karin) Brown; and grandchildren: Karyn (Alex) Dyble Rebekka and Celia Esbensen Ruby Leo Cora Zadie and Milo Brown. Woody is survived by his beloved soulmate Marcia Marks and her children: Connie Armstrong and Carrie Marks; and her grandchildren: Justin (Ashley) Stenerson and Ashlee Stenersen and Kaitlyn and Samantha Armstrong. Woody is further survived by his niece Bryce (Larry) Marine and nephew David (Carol) Wood and their families. Woody is preceded in death by his parents and his brother Dale Wood. The family would like to extend a heartfelt ‘Thank You’ to the staff at the Valley VNA in Neenah for all of their kindness and loving care for Woody. A Celebration of Life will be held on September 17 2022 1:00 pm at Mahler Park in Neenah. The family has established a memorial fund in Lynn’s honor to the Neenah Public Library where he spent many an hour to benefit children and others in the community. Westgor Funeral Home 205 W.

Jim was born in Oak Park Illinois on April 10 1948 to James Philip Bashleben Sr. and Joyce (Peyron) Bashleben. He had a unique family upbringing in Arlington Heights Illinois as his dad was part of the Bataan Death March and a POW in a Japanese prison camp for 3 years. As a result of is service and experiences during WWII Jim’s dad had an extraordinary appreciation for life and instilled that important perspective and many other crucial values in his two sons. These values included loyalty resourcefulness trustworthiness hard work compassion devotion to family and friends and forgiveness as values for a successful life. Throughout Jim’s life these core values drove his approach to all his business and personal interactions. Jim graduated from the business school of Valparaiso University in Indiana in 1970 and received a Masters degree from Baldwin Wallace College in Ohio. Over the course of his business career Jim worked for three companies - Kimberly-Clark Corp. Ameritel Corp. and Alta Resources in various parts of the United States and in different roles. He retired in 2002 and spent the last two decades working on church and community projects golfing traveling and spending time with family which was his number one priority. Those who knew Jim understood his sense of humor his loyalty and his loving dedication to his wife Deborah Dutton Bashleben whom he met at Valpo and married in 1972. Jim and Debi’s respect and forever and ever love for each other was evident during their nearly 50 years of marriage. They were blessed with three amazing children - Robert James Bashleben (Sierra Rose) of Palmer Alaska; Caroline Deborah Partridge (John) of Denver Colorado; and Elizabeth Deborah Sungar (Gannon) of Denver Colorado - and six loving grandchildren -Orion and Skylar Bashleben Quinn and Tucker Partridge and Declan and Hoyt Sungar who will be welcoming a baby brother in November whom Jim was excited to meet. After living 28 years in Neenah and Door County Wisconsin Jim and Debi moved to Denver in 2013 at the invitation of their children to be an integral part of their grandchildren’s lives in Denver and Alaska. Jim whom his grandkids called “Opa” introduced golf to each of them with the support of Colorado Golf Club in Parker Colorado and Quail Valley Golf Club in Vero Beach Florida. The Vero Beach community became part of Jim and Debi’s lives in 2002 as a favorite reprieve from Wisconsin winters. “Opa” Jim’s latest title in life was one he cherished and he performed admirably in this role of loving teaching and playing with his grandkids. All of his grandchildren completely adored him. Jim leaves behind a loving brother Jerry (Chris) Bashleben of Pleasant Prairie Wisconsin and a brother-in-law John Dutton (Judy) of Peoria Illinois who was part of his life since Valpo days along with nephews Craig (Amanda) Bashleben and their son Owen Scott Bashleben and niece Mandy Dutton. He also leaves behind numerous cousins Aunt Karen Peyron and many dear friends and golfing buddies who meant so much to him through the years. His love for his growing family of 14 and his faith in God gave him great joy and peace. Jim considered being a parent and role model to his family his most important job. And his family still can’t quite believe how lucky they were to have him lead the way. He loved his daughter-in-law Sierra and his sons-in-law John and Gannon as much as the core three - Rob Carly and Liss. All of his children – like so many others whose lives he touched – admired him sought his guidance and loved him fiercely. And his children knew every single second of their lives that their dad loved them. To say that Jim was beloved doesn’t begin to capture the impact he had on the people who were lucky enough to know him. He truly knew what mattered most in life and he behaved accordingly. He valued relationships and authentic connections and he was generous with his time and his heart. He believed in people and gave them the confidence to believe in themselves. He showed up and he listened and he asked questions and he cared. He had an amazing sense of humor that was quick and sharp yet everyone knew he would be a soft place to land if it was ever needed. He appreciated the little things - hot dogs root beer conversations over coffee errands quiet moments car rides phone calls and long hugs. He knew the little things were actually the big things. And as to the big things – he’d ask all the time “Who loves you the most?” And we all knew.

Any memorials can be given to your own special organization that embodies your values. “Let Me help you get through this day…You can choose to walk with Me along the path of Peace leaning on Me as much as you need. There will still be difficulties along the way but you can face them confidently in My strength. Thank Me for each problem you encounter and watch to see how I transform trials into Blessings.” - A “Jesus Calling” Devotional read the morning before Jim died - June 12 2022.

Posted online on June 19 2022 Published in The Post Crescent",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL3Nocmlua2ZsYXRpb24taXMtcmVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Shrinkflation’ is real,"AP – It’s the inflation you’re not supposed to see.

From toilet paper to yogurt and coffee to corn chips manufacturers are quietly shrinking package sizes without lowering prices.

It’s dubbed “shrinkflation” and it’s accelerating worldwide.

In the United States (US) a small box of Kleenex now has 60 tissues; a few months ago it had 65. Chobani Flips yogurts have shrunk from 5.3 ounces to 4.5 ounces. In the United Kingdom (UK) Nestle slimmed down its Nescafe Azera Americano coffee tins from 100 grammes to 90 grammes. In India a bar of Vim dish soap has shrunk from 155 grammes to 135 grammes.

Shrinkflation isn’t new experts say. But it proliferates in times of high inflation as companies grapple with rising costs for ingredients packaging labour and transportation. Global consumer price inflation was up an estimated seven per cent in May a pace that will likely continue through September according to S&P Global.

“It comes in waves. We happen to be in a tidal wave at the moment because of inflation” said consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts Edgar Dworsky who has documented shrinkflation on his Consumer World website for decades.

Dworsky began noticing smaller boxes in the cereal aisle last fall and shrinkflation has ballooned from there. He can cite dozens of examples from Cottonelle Ultra Clean Care toilet paper which has shrunk from 340 sheets per roll to 312 to Folgers coffee which downsized its 51-ounce container to 43.5 ounces but still says it will make up to 400 cups.

Dworsky said shrinkflation appeals to manufacturers because they know customers will notice price increases but won’t keep track of net weights or small details like the number of sheets on a roll of toilet paper. Companies can also employ tricks to draw attention away from downsizing like marking smaller packages with bright new labels that draw shoppers’ eyes.

That’s what Fritos did. Bags of Fritos Scoops marked “Party Size” used to be 18 ounces; some are still on sale at a grocery chain in Texas. But almost every other big chain is now advertising “Party Size” Fritos Scoops that are 15.5 ounces – and more expensive.

PepsiCo didn’t respond when asked about Fritos. But it did acknowledge the shrinking of Gatorade bottles. The company recently began phasing out 32-ounce bottles in favour of 28-ounce ones which are tapered in the middle to make it easier to hold them. The changeover has been in the works for years and isn’t related to the current economic climate PepsiCo said. But it didn’t respond when asked why the 28-ounce version is more expensive.

Likewise Kimberly-Clark – which makes both Cottonelle and Kleenex – didn’t respond to requests for comment on the reduced package sizes. Proctor & Gamble Co didn’t respond when asked about Pantene Pro-V Curl Perfection conditioner which downsized from 12 fluid ounces to 10.4 fluid ounces but still costs USD3.99.

Earth’s Best Organic Sunny Day Snack Bars went from eight bars per box to seven but the price listed at multiple stores remains USD3.69. Hain Celestial Group the brand’s owner didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

Some companies are straightforward about the changes. In Japan snack maker Calbee Inc announced 10 per cent weight reductions – and 10 per cent price increases – for many of its products in May including veggie chips and crispy edamame. The company blamed a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials.

Domino’s Pizza announced in January it was shrinking the size of its 10-piece chicken wings to eight pieces for the same USD7.99 carryout price. Domino’s cited the rising cost of chicken.

In India “down-switching” – another term for shrinkflation – is mostly done in rural areas where people are poorer and more price sensitive said head of corporate communications for Dabur India Byas Anand a consumer care and food business. In cities companies simply jack up prices.

“My company has been doing it openly for ages” Anand said.

Some customers who have noticed the downsizing are sharing examples on social media. Others said shrinkflation is causing them to change their shopping habits.

Alex Aspacher does a lot of the grocery shopping and meal planning for his family of four in Haskins Ohio. He noticed when the one-pound package of sliced Swiss cheese he used to buy shrank to 12 ounces but kept its USD9.99 price tag. Now he hunts for deals or buys a block of cheese and slices it himself.

Aspacher said he knew prices would rise when he started reading about higher wages for grocery workers. But the speed of the change – and the shrinking packages – have surprised him.

“I was prepared for it to a degree but there hasn’t been a limit to it so far” Aspacher said. “I hope we find that ceiling pretty soon.”

Sometimes the trend can reverse. As inflation eases competition might force manufacturers to lower their prices or reintroduce larger packages. But Dworsky said once a product has gotten smaller it often stays that way. “Upsizing is kind of rare” he said.

Professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University’s WP Carey School of Business Hitendra Chaturvedi said he has no doubt many companies are struggling with labour shortages and higher raw material costs.

But in some cases companies’ profits – or sales minus the cost of doing business – are also increasing exponentially and Chaturvedi finds that troubling.

He points to Mondelez International which took some heat this spring for shrinking the size of its Cadbury Dairy Milk bar in the UK without lowering the price.

The company’s operating income climbed 21 per cent in 2021 but fell 15 per cent in the first quarter as cost pressures grew.

By comparison PepsiCo’s operating profit climbed 11 per cent in 2021 and 128 per cent in the first quarter.

“I’m not saying they’re profiteering but it smells like it” Chaturvedi said. “Are we using supply constraints as a weapon to make more money?”",,,

At around 5 p.m. Friday a male suspect approached an Infiniti G37 sitting idle outside a Northfield Bank located in a shopping center on the 2700 block of Hylan Boulevard an NYPD spokeswoman said Sunday. The perpetrator forced a 75-year-old woman out of the car resulting in minor injuries and fled in an unknown direction police said.

The suspect is described by police as a male Hispanic with a light complexion standing about 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 220 pounds. He was last seen wearing a black baseball hat black shorts and a black shirt according to police.

Less than 24 hours later a male suspect brandished a knife while forcing a 54-year-old woman out of a white BMW 3 series in the parking lot of a CVS on the 2600 block of Hylan Boulevard. That incident was reported at around 10:30 a.m. Saturday.

Police are investigating a pair of carjackings reported less than 24 hours apart in a commercial section of New Dorp.

Police said the victim sustained minor injuries after being shoved to the ground.

The suspect in that incident was described by police as a male Hispanic with a light complexion standing about 5 feet 11 inches tall with a heavyset build. He was last seen wearing a gray baseball hat gray shorts and a white T-shirt police said.

The vehicle was driven southbound on Hylan Boulevard before it apparently was abandoned and recovered by police a different NYPD spokeswoman said Saturday.

NYPD helicopters were seen hovering overhead while K-9 officers were dispatched to investigate the vehicle.

Several police officers could be seen interviewing the victim and other individuals outside of the CVS.

No injuries were reported police said.

Corporeal Coley a security supervisor for Kimco Realty told the Advance/SILive.com that he was exiting the ShopRite across The Boulevard parking lot when he saw police arrive and quickly take off on foot toward the direction of the fleeing vehicle.

AN ONGOING ISSUE

Staten Island has unfortunately seen an increase in carjackings over the past two years.

On June 12 a 2007 black infinity was stolen from outside a deli on Port Richmond Avenue in Port Richmond. In that instance a struggle ensued with the thief and the victim was shot in the leg police said.

On April 9 an Eltingville man was arrested in connection with a 2021 carjacking during which police allege he threatened a 71-year-old victim with a knife before biting the man’s hand.

On April 29 an Amazon delivery driver was taken for his work vehicle after an individual jumped in the passenger seat and simply took off. The driver was able to escape without injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,

By Belul Beqaj

The fact that fake veterans are not ashamed of taking undeserved veteran’s pensions is understandable to me though unpardonable. The way the Verification Commission consented to the number of veterans being excessively tripled is reprehensible. But what is also completely incomprehensible and inexcusable is how true veterans are ashamed to report fake veterans! Moreover the artificial rise of the bogus number of veterans leads me to the conclusion that in addition to the members of the Verification Commission the motive of the war commanders who are an immediate factor of the pumped-up numbers was of a questionable nature!

An avalanche of mass protests was launched on Thursday for various reasons. Praise for KLA veterans the power corporation employees about 800 health workers education trade unionists who are constantly announcing the disruption of the teaching process and an enormous number of young people announcing a mass exodus.

This is all happening due to the exclusionary unrealistic and arrogant policy of Kurti’s government but there’s also a large number of those who believe that this is happening in collusion with the Kosovo opposition which hindered the work of the Kosovo Parliament on Thursday. One gets the impression that everyone rose against Kurti’s government because the internationally known festival (because of Dua Lipa who is the symbol of the festival) Sunny hill was moved from Pristina to Tirana! It is too much accumulated dissatisfaction for one to think it is happening – by accident.

But the promoters of this avalanche are KLA veterans who are wholeheartedly supported by the opposition. That is why I am addressing them in an open letter.

Dear veterans with the intention of you correctly perceiving my good intentions I will present some arguments that I assume not all of you are aware of. During the last war I was a political adviser to the KLA representative Adem Demaci during the war I had the same role at the KLA headquarters in Tirana and after the war I was a political advisor to the first prime minister of the interim government.

During the war I was a freelance reporter in Prekaze after the mass death of the Jashari family from Mlecane where Serb militants killed and threw an Albanian into a well I reported from Gornje Obrije about the tragedy of the Delijaj family I reported from Stutice after the Zeqiri family tragedy with the support and help of journalist Peter Snitzer (SAT 1) we saved the life of the wounded (Bytyqi) from Orlat I reported from Golubovac where 13 Albanians were shot by a firing squad following painstaking convincing I interviewed the only survivor from that group whom we evacuated outside Kosovo with the help of the Ambassador (V.P.)…

Dear veterans my engagement was even greater and more diverse but I told this short story for the sake of those veterans who think they have an exclusive property and the right to defend the purity of the correctness of the liberation war.

I shared this description for those veterans who do not acknowledge the contribution of others. For those veterans who know about the contribution of others but nevertheless think that they have a greater right to defend the „purity of the liberation war“ compared to others. For those veterans who are convinced that in our correct war there were no horrific cases described by the ICJ that is why ostensibly they are not afraid of facing the past.

For those veterans who did not put pressure on the Prime Minister at the time but accepted his pressure to form the ICJ while today they are putting pressure on those who were once against the formation of the ICJ.

For those veterans who think that the state of Kosovo can consolidate itself while under the mortgage of the international public. For those veterans who did not sign the petition when the legal sovereignty of the state was threatened (2015) while they signed the petition to „save“ individuals who veiled the Kosovo state with „black clouds“ which have yet to disperse. For those veterans who ignore the consequences and remarks of those we „stab in the back“ because they warn us to open our eyes so as not to fall into the abyss. For those veterans who by defending suspects for war crimes and potential criminal acts cast doubt on all veterans and honorable citizens and the state of Kosovo.

For those veterans who question the indispensable intervention of NATO while it is publicly known that the signatories of the Kumanovo Agreement with the Serbian Army were NATO officials not KLA representatives who today enjoy the status of real and fake veterans. For those veterans who purposefully confuse salary increases with pension increases…

Dear veterans instead of removing the „black premonitions“ that hang above Kosovo from war manipulators with the latest protests you are denigrating all citizens of Kosovo especially those who sincerely fought for freedom and justice. Finally you question the ideals of war heroes who gave their lives for freedom. Genuine veterans should not be afraid of truth and justice on the contrary they should be afraid of lies and injustice.

In the end one of the most significant KLA leaders with whom some other important commanders agreed once publicly stated that there are 12000-15000 veterans while this number tripled in the meantime?! Therefore dear veterans the fact that fake veterans are not ashamed of taking undeserved veteran’s pensions is understandable to me though unpardonable. The way the Verification Commission consented to the number of veterans being excessively tripled is reprehensible. But what is also completely incomprehensible and inexcusable is how true veterans are ashamed to report fake veterans! Moreover the artificial rise of the bogus number of veterans leads me to the conclusion that in addition to the members of the Verification Commission the motive of the war commanders who are an immediate factor of the pumped-up numbers was of a questionable nature!

Requests Prosecution

The Executive Chairperson of the Liberia Anti-corruption Commission Cllr Edwin Kla Martin has released several investigative reports to the public in which he called for the prosecution of several government officials for corruption.

Cllr. Martin told a news briefing that officials from the Ministry of Agriculture Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation and the Planned Parenthood Association acted against the laws in the discharge of their duties.

In presenting his elaborate findings the country's antigraft Chief in a press release said Agriculture Minister Jeanie Cooper awarded contracts to her brother Zubin Cooper and diverted agriculture materials for her personal use. She also awarded contracts to Farbrar- a company in which she has beneficial ownership.

At the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services the Executive Chairperson Cllr Martin informed the Liberian people that Director General Francis Wreh his deputies Wilmot Smith and Lawrence George violated several laws in the purchase of second-handed generators and the procurement of tablets for the upcoming census.

In the case of the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation the LACC has charged Deputy Managing Director Moseray Momoh with Economic Sabotage for illegally disposing of public assets and converting the funds to his use.

The LACC Executive Chairperson said the officials from the four agencies will be prosecuted on charges of conflict of interest theft of property abuse of office perjury and economic sabotage.

The country’s anti-graft Chief said his institution will continue to work to deal with incidents of corruption in Liberia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdrb2twb3N0LmNvbS90aGFpbGFuZC9nZW5lcmFsLzIzMjkwMDMva2xhLXNjcmFwLWJhbi1vbi1hbGNvaG9sLXNhbGVzLWZyb20tMi01cG3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kla: Scrap ban on alcohol sales from 2-5pm,"A man has a drink outside parliament in Bangkok on Feb 9 during a rally held to demand legal amendments to make it easier for small-scale distillers and brewers to operate.

The government should scrap the ban on alcohol sales from 2pm to 5pm to support the tourism recovery says Atavit Suwannapakdee secretary-general of the Kla Party.

The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act which limits the hours when alcoholic beverages can be sold needs to be revised as it remains an obstacle to tourism operators who have already been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic Mr Atavit said on Saturday after attending a meeting of the Asia Pacific International Spirits and Wines Alliance (APISWA).

No other countries in Southeast Asia have laws restricting the hours of alcohol sales he said.

“Thailand used to attract 40 million tourists a year generating 3 trillion baht in revenue but there has been a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol from 2pm to 5pm since 1972 for the outdated reason that drunk civil servants will not work productively” said Mr Atavit.

Now that the Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) has proposed allowing night entertainment venues to operate until 2am starting July 1 the law governing alcohol sales needs to be revised to be in line with the current situation he added.

The Kla Party led by former finance minister and longtime Democrat heavyweight Korn Chatikavanij has been raising its profile in recent weeks with members proposing various reforms including legalising gambling to spur the economy.

Provisions that prohibit authorised sellers from selling alcoholic beverages between 2pm and 5pm will not stop people from buying alcohol said Thanakorn Kuptajit a former chairman of the Thai Alcohol Beverage Business Association.

“Instead the authorities should seriously enforce the law that prohibits selling alcoholic beverages to customers aged below 20 and revise the zoning requirement to sell alcoholic beverages because this is no longer appropriate to the current situation” Mr Thanakorn said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmUta25vdy5jYS9yZWdpb25zL2Vhc3Qta29vdGVuYXkvY3Jlc3Rvbi1tYW4tbGFuZHMta2xhaXBzLWdyYW5kLXByaXplL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Creston man lands KLAIP's grand prize | East Kootenay,"Creston resident Allan Mather has won a $15000 Marlon Boat package from Jones Boys Boats of Woodbury the grand prize awarded annually by the Kootenay Lake Angler Incentive Program (KLAIP).

Allan Mather is a retired farmer and passionate angler who fishes almost weekly with friends in a large boat. Some of his fishing companions have been monthly KLAIP draw winners based on fish they caught from Alan’s boat.

“I’m thrilled with the prize!” Mather said at the prize presentation in Woodbury on June 14. “I’m proud to be involved in the Kootenay Lake Angler Incentive Program as I believe it’s essential to protect the lake for future generation.”

The end of May also marked the selection of our final $1000 monthly draw winner Scott Girdwood of Kaslo.

Scott is a fisheries technician and is very knowledgeable about the issues that are posing a challenge for the Kootenay Lake fishery which has motivated him to participate in the KLAIP program. As our May winner Scott chose gift certificates from Reel Adventures to be used for a fishing trip on the coast.

Kootenay Lake has traditionally been famous for its large Gerrard Rainbow Trout and Bull Trout. However their population increased so much that they forced their prey juvenile Kokanee Salmon to near extinction causing the predators to decrease in size and condition. Only by helping the Kokanee population recover can the Kootenay lake fishery be returned to its former glory.

The Kootenay Lake Angler Incentive Program inspires anglers to get out fishing and enjoy the outdoors. Anglers are encouraged to harvest predator rainbow and bull trout in the main body of Kootenay Lake and then turn in the heads to local depots for a chance to win prizes.

The Kootenay Lake Angler Incentive Program’s second year concluded on May 31. The third year of the KLAIP program has just been launched and more details including the youth derby will be announced shortly.

Kootenay Lake Angler Incentive Program is managed by the local West Arm Outdoors Club with support from B.C. Wildlife Federation Freshwater Fisheries Society of BC Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation Ministry of Forests and several local merchants from around Kootenay Lake.

The Ministry of Forests urges anglers to continue to participate in this program and harvest all of their catch within daily quota limits to reinforce improved juvenile kokanee survival and continue to support low in-lake survival for the youngest kokanee.

Cheese-lovers can now wear their favorite dairy product on their fingertips thanks to Velveeta and British nail polish brand Nails Inc.

A limited-edition set of two cheese-scented polishes will cost cheese fanatics $15 on the Nails Inc. website. It includes two shades: “Finger Food” a bright red and “La Dolce Velveeta” a creamy yellow color.

The polishes’ signature cheesy scent only appears when they are dry says Nails Inc.

“These highly pigmented shades provide full-cover payoff and are designed to be worn together for those confident enough to show the world they are living a big bold and unrestrained life” says Nails Inc. The collaboration is a part of Velveeta’s “La Dolce Velveeta” campaign “which is all about stepping out in a confident unapologetic way to show the world that you’re living a life filled with outrageous pleasure” according to a press release from the Kraft Heinz Company which owns Velveeta.

Although Velveeta’s products are not vegan the formulation of both colors is vegan and cruelty-free according to Nails Inc.

The collaboration also includes a set of Velveeta-themed nail stickers featuring gooey cheese graphics and the phrases “creamy” and “drip.”

“Veleeta is known for its rich creamy texture and cheesy melty goodness so what better way to bring this to life for our fans than with something equally as rich and creamy — nail polish” said Kelsey Rice senior brand communications manager at the Kraft Heinz Company in the press release.

First in November 2021 they launched their rebranding and ad campaign ""La Dolce Velveeta"" which according to AdWeek set out

to pivot Velveeta from a cheese-adjacent product to a lifestyle brand thanks to a nod to the Italian phrase ""the sweet life"" and an ad with consumers living their best lives with Velveeta cubed melted and more.

The ad campaign includes commercials like this one which ""depicts the glamour a Velveeta dish can bring to everyday settings."" The commercial highlights people engaged in activities of everyday life—an older woman in a floral dress mowing her grass on a riding lawnmower a young woman in a bathing cap and swimsuit coverup lounging in a lawn chair inside a blow-up pool in her backyard a group of young adults eating dinner in their living room.

As the camera pans in closer you see that in each vignette folks are enjoying Velveeta products. The woman on the riding mower holds a martini glass filled with Velveeta Shells & Cheese; the woman in the pool daintily eats Shells & Cheese out of a bowl with a tropical umbrella toothpick and one woman at the dinner party pours melted Velveeta out of a silver teapot into a china teacup on a platter while another sips the cheese with her pinky finger held high. According to AdAge set to the tune of ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" the ""60-second ad depicts the glamour a Velveeta dish can bring to the everyday setting."" With the soprano aria soaring in the background the ad's depiction of a technicolor slice of suburbia is I have to admit sort of engaging.

Now they're back with a product I first thought was a joke but in fact actually exists. The company recently launched a nail polish collaboration with Nails.INC. It's called ""Pinkies Out Polish"" and they describe it as a ""Creamy Smooth Cheese Scented Nail Polish Duo"". For $15 you can buy a pair of polishes— one shade is called ""La Dolce Velveeta yellow"" and the other is ""Finger Food red"" and both are ""inspired by your favorite VELVEETA."" The description of the product goes on to warn that ""While our polish is cheese-scented it is (unfortunately) not made of VELVEETA. Please don't eat it—that's what cheesy melty VELVEETA is for!"" (WELL THANK GOODNESS THEY WARNED ME!) and asserts that the nail polish is ""Designed to help you live every day PINKIES OUT.""

AdWeek provides more insight into the product:

""Velveeta is known for its rich creamy texture and cheesy melty goodness so what better way to bring this to life for our fans than with something equally as rich and creamy—nail polish"" said Kelsey Rice senior brand communications manager at the Kraft Heinz Company in a statement. ""Our Velveeta Pinkies Out Polish gives pleasure seekers everywhere an irresistible new way to show the world that they are living 'La Dolce Velveeta' by living pinkies out.""

More than 400000 bottles of Kroger and Walgreens brand aspirin acetaminophen and ibuprofen bottles have been recalled because they aren’t child-resistant.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the bottles failed to meet the Poison Prevention Packaging Act guidelines and could poison young children if swallowed.

The drugs were sold at stores nationwide from December 2021 through March 2022 for between $14 and $17.

The aspirin bottle is described as having a green and yellow label that says “Kroger Low Dose Aspirin 81 mg Delayed-Release Tablets / Pain Reliever 300 enteric coated tablets.” The bottle also has a green continuous thread gear closure.

The ibuprofen bottle is described as having a blue and white label that says “Kroger Ibuprofen Capsules 200 mg Pain Reliever / Fever Reducer 160 softgels.” The bottle also has a blue continuous thread gear closure.

The products’ packaging did not meet the child resistant packaging that is required by the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. This poses a risk of poisoning if the contents in the bottle are swallowed by young children.

Why it matters: It signals a shift in corporate America’s tolerance for gun violence. But individual companies like Dick's Sporting Goods have been at it for a while — and Dick's experience can give us an idea of what's ahead for the other companies.

Flashback: After the Parkland shooting in 2018 CEO Ed Stack told stakeholders “I don’t want to be part of the story anymore” and methodically pulled assault-style weapons from the shelves for good.

Dick's also removed high-capacity magazines and raised the purchasing age to 21 — and Walmart L.L. Bean and Kroger quickly followed suit.

Between the lines: It's obviously risky for a gun retailer to wade into the Second Amendment debate and these corporate actions initially cost the retailer millions but Dick’s made up for it over time through apparel sales according to a Harvard Business School case study.

Stack and his leadership team committed to the decision created a business plan to combat revenue loss and communicated their stance proudly across national news broadcasts.

“Ultimately the leader of Dick’s Sporting Goods followed his conscience and the strategy worked — largely because he resisted an impulsive move built consensus and communicated effectively” writes George A. Riedel the Henry B. Arthur Fellow and senior lecturer at Harvard Business School.

State of play: Dick’s has continued to lobby and donate to groups like Sandy Hook Promise and Everytown but a spokesperson declined to elaborate on future actionable steps beyond signing the letter.

Dick’s also declined to say whether the latest onslaught of mass shootings has caused the company to consider getting out of the gun business altogether — a notion Stack previously considered according to The Washington Post.

The bottom line: The current CEO letter has 50% more signatures than it did in 2019. It will be harder for other large consumer brands to dodge the issue as more executives weigh in and more companies like Dick’s take action.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndsa3kuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbG91aXN2aWxsZS1wYXN0b3Itd2Fsa2VkLW1hcnRpbi1sdXRoZXIta2luZy1qci1tYXJjaGVzLXBlYWNlLzQwMzM1Njgx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Louisville pastor who walked with Martin Luther King Jr. marches for peace,"After multiple homicides in a matter of days a civil rights icon is calling for an end to the violence in the Metro.

Viktor Muller Ferreira had a traumatic childhood. Growing up his father and mother—who had adopted him—split up. His mother later died of pneumonia and his aunt who raised him also passed away. The family didn’t have much money. At school children bullied Ferreira for his looks and his weird accent. As a result he didn’t have many friends.

One day when his aunt was out a neighborhood boy came round and told Ferreira that he was the fairy tale character Grey Shadow and he was going to “devour” him. “This scared me so much that I spent the entire day in a small box out on the balcony praying until my aunt came home.” As he grew older he worked in a garage took an interest in journalism and moved to Brazil to reunite with his estranged father and “restore my citizenship.”

Except according to authorities in the Netherlands none of that is true.

Dutch intelligence agency AVID claimed this week that “Viktor Muller Ferreira” is just a cover story and false identity for Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov an alleged Russian intelligence officer belonging to the GRU military unit. AVID said it caught Cherkasov applying to be an intern at the International Criminal Court at The Hague which is investigating potential war crimes in Russia’s wars against Ukraine and Georgia.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s definitely a rhetorical question in Southern Idaho a.k.a. ‘A Slice of Potato Heaven.’

By Brittany Anas on June 18 2022

Idaho — specifically the Southern Idaho region — is undoubtedly famous for its potatoes. But another way to quite literally slice it? The area boasts some phenomenal french fries!

Whether you’re a potato purist who prefers a traditional french fry with a crispy golden exterior or you like to elevate your fries with toppings (mmm Parmesan!) several local restaurants are bidding for your attention with fresh fries serving as staples on their menus.

So what makes the area’s potatoes (and thus french fries) so delicious?

“The region’s sandy volcanic soil is rich in trace minerals while mountain streams supply clear water to irrigation reservoirs that keep the potatoes perfectly hydrated” explains Curt Snyder the Twin Falls plant manager for Lamb Weston. “All in all the Snake River Valley is a slice of potato heaven.”

Plus the state’s growing season of warm days and cool nights help produce top-notch tubers and Idaho Russet potatoes are associated with crispier fuller french fries that shrink less and absorb less oil according to the Idaho Potato Commission.

Of course the economic impact of the region’s famed root vegetable is no small potato.

According to Snyder Lamb Weston is one of the largest employers in Twin Falls with more than 600 employees. In addition the company has a close relationship with farmers who grow potatoes on almost 40000 acres in the Twin Falls area. More than 1 million tons of potatoes are processed into french fries and other potato products at the plant each year then distributed to grocery retailers and fast-food restaurants throughout the country.

McCain Foods a frozen potato supplier that makes delicious fries and other snacks also has had a significant impact on the region with its recent $200 million expansion into Burley. The company employs more than 700 people at the facility and hundreds more when you consider growers and farmers says spokeswoman Tarah Arnold.

The perfect McCain fry she says is golden brown with a “crispy exterior and a delicious fluffy interior.”

Suffice to say; potatoes are a point of pride.

“We realize that potatoes are what made us famous” says Nathan Murray economic development director for Twin Falls. “But the area is also a big producer of beef.”

What he’s getting at? Be sure to pair those fries with a juicy burger!

The Taste Test

We asked City of Twin Falls Economic Development Director Nathan Murray and his colleagues to be our esteemed taste testers to pinpoint some of the best french fries in the area. Here are their tasting notes:

Best Parmesan Fries

Scooter’s Twin Falls

“They are almost curly and they have a cheesy glaze of melted parm on them. You’d be satisfied with a plate of those alone or pair them with a burger” Murray says.

Best Traditional Fries

Twin Falls Sandwich Company Twin Falls

“It’s a very hearty fresh fry made with locally sourced potatoes” Murray says. He recommends syncing that up with a pastrami on rye.

Best Fries with a Burger

Choate’s Jerome

“I like Choate’s because they do the ‘ground and round’ homestyle cut for fries. They’d get my vote for best fries with a burger” says Lisa Strickland city planner.

Most Indulgent Fries

Stevo’s Heyburn

“The fries are skinny like a shoestring and very tasty” Murray says. But it’s a choose-your-own-adventure here. You can get a heaping of toppings on your fries everything from chunks of steak and cheese to a ‘garden spud’ with veggies. All in all it’s a ‘mound of goodness'” Murray says.

Best Crinkle Cut Fries

Henry’s at Drift Inn Rupert

“Try the fish and chips with the perfect crinkle-cut fry” Murray says. “The service is always good here.”

Best Diner Fries

Ziggy’s Bliss

“They are always crispy on the outside and soft on the inside” says Jon Victor building inspector.

Still Hungry? Don’t Miss These Hidden Gems.

Some of the best restaurants are hidden — tucked away in strip malls with an unassuming storefront or perhaps a humble presence on the web. Here’s a treasure map to some of the best-hidden gem food destinations in the region.

Emma’s Cafe Restaurant & Market (Twin Falls)

This beloved Bosnian restaurant features an adjoining market with meats cheeses and sweets to take home. As for a meal it’s tough to choose between the two most ordered dishes: Sarma or Cevapi but baklava is the correct choice for dessert.

Buster’s Restaurant & Saloon (Hollister)

With a Wild West exterior this casual dining spot is loved for its wings daily specials (like prime rib Saturdays!) and fun atmosphere.

Wyant’s Manhattan Cafe (Shoshone)

Sidle up to the counter and enjoy breakfast any time of the day at this cafe or order a slab of pie topped with ice cream. The robust menu also serves burgers sandwiches steaks and more.

Get ready to dance along to some of music’s most talented artists.

On Sunday the first-ever “Juneteenth: A Global Celebration for Freedom” taking place at the Hollywood Bowl will air on CNN.

The event commemorates the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States and aims to inform viewers about the federal holiday signed into law by President Biden last year.

Who is performing:

Concert performers will include Chaka Khan Khalid Yolanda Adams Jill Scott Anthony Hamilton Billy Porter Debbie Allen Dance Academy Earth Wind & Fire Jhené Aiko Killer Mike Lucky Daye Mary Mary Ne-Yo Michelle Williams Mickey Guyton Robert Glasper The Roots and Bell Biv DeVoe. The Re-Collective Orchestra a 68-piece all-Black symphony orchestra will also perform.

Academy-award winning director Questlove and Adam Blackstone are serving as the musical directors of the event.

What to expect

The show is produced by creators Shawn Gee of Live Nation Urban and Jesse Collins Entertainment. Gee spoke to CNN in an interview on Thursday and explained how the show came about.

“CNN and Live Nation did a big event called the ‘NYC Homecoming Concert’ and the relationship between the companies were formed at that event and so CNN came back and said we want to do something around Juneteenth – big and bright and loud. Within Live Nation Live Nation Urban is really the one that focuses on Black culture so when the call came to the company they pointed the CNN team to me and they said if you want to do something big you need to do it with Shawn.”

As for the location? “Similarly I got a call from the Hollywood Bowl the year before and we weren’t able to do it because of the short time frame but I was able to marry the two ideas.”

Gee said the show will be multifaceted.

“We chose a group of artists who represent diverse genres” Gee explained. “It’s not just all music there are narrative parts too. We are introducing different individuals who were central in this becoming a federal holiday. The third thing is we are going to make sure people know the fight isn’t over.”

If you tune in you’ll also see former first lady Michelle Obama will deliver special remarks. Celebrity presenters include Debbie Allen Team USA gymnast Jordan Chiles actors Michael Ealy Gabourey Sidibe and Kendrick Sampson comedians Leslie Jones and Lil Rel Howery and stars from ABC’s “Black-ish” stars Deon Cole Marsai Martin and Miles Brown.

How to watch

The evening kicks off with a pre-show hosted by CNN’s Don Lemon at 7 p.m. ET followed by the concert at 8 p.m. ET. The event will air on CNN and will stream live for pay TV subscribers via CNN.com and CNNgo where available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL21hZGlzb24uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXVzaWMvdGhlLXN5bHZlZS1ib3VuY2VzLWJhY2stZnJvbS1wYW5kZW1pYy1yYW5rZWQtc2l4dGgtaW4tdGhlLXdvcmxkLWZvci1jbHVicy1pbi0yMDIxL2FydGljbGVfZjdiMDg4ZmUtNjVjZS01NDJkLTliN2MtYzMxMTBjZTRhNzc4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Sylvee bounces back from pandemic ranked sixth in the world for clubs in 2021,"A Madison music venue that opened to much fanfare in September 2018 has emerged strong after getting sidelined for 18 months at the start of the pandemic.

“Now that we’re at least over the restrictions of the pandemic things have been absolutely terrific at the Sylvee” said Fred Frank co-founder of the Madison-based national concert promotion company Frank Productions which owns the music hall.

“Business has been pretty close to sell-out on most all of our shows that we’ve put on sale so far” Frank said. “So that demand for live music was there and is happening right in front of our eyes.”

In 2021 Pollstar said the 2500-capacity venue sold 45613 tickets resulting in $1.9 million gross revenue. In troubled 2020 it ranked 32nd grossing $930667 from 25736 tickets.

Fred’s brother Larry Frank who was also a co-founder of Frank Productions but isn’t involved in day-to-day operations was pleased with the sixth-in-the-world rating.

“We’re very proud of the building and we figured when we built it people would come and enjoy it and that just proves it” he said.

Larry Frank and others involved with The Sylvee 25 S. Livingston St. off East Washington Avenue explain the ranking by calling Madison a great music town.

“Our demographics in Madison are extremely good for that age group and we built the building to attract people to the music” Larry Frank said noting that the venue is targeted at 20- to 35-year-olds. “It’s built for the music. When you build a proper music hall people enjoy it and they keep coming back.”

He called the pandemic hiatus difficult because unlike other businesses Frank Productions had almost zero revenue. “We couldn’t be like a restaurant where people eat outside or pick up food. There’s just nothing we could do. It was very hard and we were able to stick with it and when we reopened everyone came back and it’s working.”

Going out again

Joel Plant the CEO of Frank Productions called the pandemic shutdown a long haul. “We had an almost complete reduction in revenue a 98% reduction in revenue for the better part of two years.”

Plant said the company has not yet made up for the losses but he anticipates it being profitable again by the end of the year.

Scott Leslie is co-president of FPC Live (Frank Productions Concerts) a division of Frank Productions which runs The Sylvee the Majestic Theatre the Orpheum Theater and the High Noon Saloon and books shows at Breese Stevens Field and many Milwaukee venues and out-of-state theaters. He agrees that Madison is a strong market for concerts.

“Like a lot of other businesses that weren’t able to operate with their full capacity during the pandemic there was a lot of pent-up demand for people to go out and experience the things that they missed” Leslie said.

“We saw that across the country people being excited to go back out get back out into venues and sports stadiums and restaurants” he said. “The hope is that it keeps going.”

The Majestic Theatre came in at No. 72 on the Pollstar club list for 2021 with 11243 tickets sold with a gross revenue of $245552. The High Noon Saloon was at No. 136 with 4135 tickets sold and $73980.

As a promoter FPC Live ranked 33rd in the world for 2021 with 187548 tickets sold and a gross of almost $8.9 million.

In 2018 Live Nation the largest promoter in the world bought a controlling stake in Frank Productions which continues to operate as an independent company.

Quality bookings

The Sylvee averages two or three shows a week with indoor shows slowing down in the summer when a lot of artists choose to perform outdoors Fred Frank said. This year the theater is seeing more summer shows because more musicians are out on the road making up for lost time he said.

Leslie who has a two-person team that helps him with bookings said the venue and the city both tend to attract artists that are capable of playing larger venues.

“They want to play The Sylvee. They want to play Madison” he said. “And so that certainly helps with shows selling out. But we have a tremendous marketing staff. We have a tremendous buying staff.”

The Sylvee featured fewer shows than usual in 2021 but headliners included Modest Mouse Orville Peck Dermot Kennedy Louis the Child AJR Ashley McBride Black Pumas Bleachers two nights of Sylvan Esso Gogol Bordello Gojira and Beach Bunny.

Fred Frank said The Sylvee has surpassed his expectations. “It was so well received by not only the fans in Madison but also by artists that have played it. The word got out that it’s a great room because the fans are great. And the room itself is built for big shows in a small environment and artists really like that.”

He pointed out that part of being No. 6 in the world for ticket sales had to do with stricter restrictions abroad.

“Europe was shut down worse than we were” Fred Frank said. “It has to do with who opened up who was touring. A lot of artists weren’t playing Europe and some of these other markets because I think the COVID restrictions might have been tougher over there before they were here.”

Still growing

In early 2020 Frank Productions had about 100 employees and temporarily laid off 35% to 40% of them because of the pandemic Plant said.

The company was able to recall most of its employees but some had found other work he said. Frank Productions now has about 125 full-time employees and 600 part-timers including maintenance security and stage hands.

“We’re bigger now than we were pre-pandemic” Plant said. “And we were able to sustain employment for the majority of our team.”

Fred Frank said it would’ve been hard to replace all the talented people who work for Frank Productions.

“We needed to survive and we had no income coming in but we wanted to make sure that we took care of our employees to the best that we could” he said.

When the theater reopened last summer requiring proof of vaccination most of its key employees came back Fred Frank said. “We didn’t really miss much of a step on that. We were fortunate that we have such good employees that hung around and worked with us through these tough times.”

The Sylvee is owned by Sold Out LLC a small group of investors that includes the Frank family executives at Frank Productions and other private investors. When the theater opened it was under a ground lease with Gebhardt Development but Sold Out eventually bought the land Plant said.

Plant said FPC Live got some rent abatement from Sold Out during the COVID-19 shutdown but has caught up on that and other bills that went unpaid during the closure.

In December 2020 FPC Live as the owner of The Sylvee and the Majestic was one of seven Madison entertainment companies to benefit from $15 million in federal COVID relief under the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act targeted at venues. It got $395308.

Around the same time with its indoor Masterworks Series canceled because of the pandemic the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra recorded a four-concert Winter Chamber Series at The Sylvee that fans could watch online.

“It was wild. No one was using The Sylvee but us” said Joe Loehnis the orchestra’s CEO laughing. “It was really surreal because this was pre-vaccine right? We just sort of invented as we went along. They were wonderful partners.”

Milwaukee plans

FPC Live is planning a music venue in Milwaukee that Fred Frank said will have a capacity of roughly 4000. Attached to the venue will be an 800-seat room the company calls “club level” for musicians who he said will “hopefully graduate” to playing the bigger room.

Fred Frank said the venue should open in late 2023 but he will have a better idea of the timeline after meeting with Milwaukee officials in the coming weeks and going through the architectural review committees.

“We’re very excited about the Milwaukee opportunity. There’s really going to be nothing else like it in the marketplace. And Milwaukee also is another very good music market” he said.

He said they are still kicking around names. A Frank Productions employee came up with using the nickname of the Frank matriarch the name that was on her license plate. Now a large image of Sylvia Frank looks out from a big glass section of The Sylvee’s VIP room and onto Livingston Street.

Herb and Sylvia Frank moved to Madison from Chicago in 1964 and started Frank Productions the following year. The Franks promoted the majority of the shows at the Dane County Coliseum when it held frequent concerts hosting big-name acts like Elvis and The Who.

The company was also responsible for a series of stadium shows at Camp Randall in the 1990s including concerts by the Rolling Stones and U2.

Sylvia who died in 2006 handled much of the early bookkeeping and ticketing without ever seeking the limelight.

Calling the Milwaukee venue The Herbie after their father has been talked about but is not to be Fred Frank said. “I don’t think Milwaukee would get it.”

LIVE! at PNC Bank Arts Center

He concludes his performance with a bouncy rendition of Sam Cooke’s “Twisting the Night Away” which has audience members twisting along at their seats.

Medugno provides a tribute to Jay and the Americans’ lead singer Jay Black with a powerful interpretation of “Cara Mia” that has the crowd reacting with avid hoots and hollers.

“Are you ready to go back in time tonight?” inquires Medugno. He opens tonight’s show singing Freddy Cannon’s “Palisades Park” the sound of his rich tenor filling the amphitheater as he dances his way across the stage. Segueing into Dion’s “Runaround Sue” Medugno changes the song’s “She took my love then ran around/With every single guy in town” lyric for the NJ crowd to “With every guy from Middletown.” The audience chuckles while singing and clapping along to the music.

“Hello my friends!” exclaims Morrow. After informing the crowd “I am trying to bring everyone together during this difficult time. My radio show is four hours where people can get away from what’s going on in the world” Morrow introduces the audience to a surprise performer — fellow 77-WABC DJ and entertainer Vinnie Medugno.

Gravino welcomes tonight’s emcee Cousin Brucie who takes the stage as audience members stand cheer and dance to his radio show theme song.

Following the interview we make our way out to the open-air PNC Bank Arts amphitheater where Garden State Arts Center Foundation VP Ron Gravino takes to the podium to thank the sponsors of tonight’s program — PNC Bank Live Nation Entertainment and 77-WABC Music Radio. He also thanks the production staff at the PNC Bank Arts Center the volunteers of the Garden State Arts Foundation and GSAF executive director Cookie Santiago.

Lastly James tells us he has a message he’d like us to share with his many fans saying “I am very flattered and honored and so blessed to have such wonderful fans. They’ve let me go in so many directions over the years and they’ve stuck with me coming to my shows time after time” before concluding “I thank the Lord for them and I cherish them; they are so loyal and good!”

We also learn that James recently video-recorded an acoustic version of his song “Crystal Blue Persuasion” which has been sent to the Ukrainian Ambassador to share with the people of Ukraine. Because “music is the best communication” James believes the song will “give people hope” with lyrics like “So don’t you give up now/So easy to find/Just look to your soul/And open your mind/Crystal blue persuasion.”

James also talks about the progress on the movie version of his memoir Me the Mob and the Music — a book which explains his precarious association with Morris Levy the president of Roulette Records and a known mobster — acknowledging “Hollywood shut down during the pandemic for two years but casting for the film will be the next step. First we’ll be focusing on the Morris Levy character and then we’ll be casting the Tommy James character followed by other roles” before confessing “I have various ideas who should play these characters but I’m going to keep them to myself for now.”

James tells us about his Sirius XM radio program declaring “The radio show has been so great! It’s broadcast over all of North America and it’s been a great way to stay in touch with the fans.” He’s also excited to reveal that several of his songs are being considered for use in upcoming television and film projects disclosing “There’s a new NBC-TV series Candy that plans to use ‘Sweet Cherry Wine’ and there’s a new movie National Anthem that wants to use ‘Nothin' to Hide” prior to adding “This would be the first time that particular song has ever been licensed and it’s for a movie which is a Western.”

Before the event begins we slip backstage for a pre-show interview with Tommy James. When asked what it’s like to be doing performances again following the pandemic James replies “For a year and a half or more there were no concerts but now we’re back to a full schedule. It’s a lot like being an athlete who’s out of shape. At first I actually got very winded and my heart was pumping hard. It took a few gigs to get back into it but I’m feeling fine now” before exclaiming “It feels so good to get to mix it up with the fans again!”

Music lovers by the thousands are currently streaming into the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel NJ this June 9 2022 evening for a highly-anticipated free concert presented by the Garden State Arts Foundation. Featuring classic hits from Tommy James and the Shondells Little Anthony and The 1910 Fruitgum Company tonight’s show is hosted by 77-WABC radio DJ Bruce ‘Cousin Brucie’ Morrow.

Cousin Brucie retakes the stage to show the crowd his “happy socks” which are decorated with yellow guitars before introducing tonight’s next act The 1910 Fruitgum Co.

The members of the group — John Roginsky on guitar/keyboards Glen Lewis on bass Keith Crane on drums Mick Mansueto on vocals Frank Jeckell on guitar and Eric Lipper on keyboards — take the stage to open their set with a lively version of the 1968 bubblegum hit “Yummy Yummy Yummy” which has the audience snapping along to the happy beat.

Moving on to the group’s 1969 single “Indian Giver” Keith Crane’s driving drumbeat compels the audience to tap their toes as they sing along with the band.

Following cover versions of The Vogues’ “You’re the One” and Manfred Mann’s “Do Wah Diddy Diddy” the group moves on to another one of their hits 1968’s “1 2 3 Red Light.”

To conclude their set The 1910 Fruitgum Co. perform the 1967 smash which made them a household name — “Simon Says.” On this number Cousin Brucie joins the band on stage and has his hands in the air playing the game along with members of the crowd before they respond with animated cheers and applause.

Cousin Brucie introduces tonight’s next artist Little Anthony calling him “a great dramatist and great star” who “has the lock and key to our hearts and our souls.”

Following an overture of hits played by his talented backing orchestra Little Anthony opens his set with a poignant and soulful version of Eric Carmen’s “All By Myself.”

After he sings “All by myself/Don’t wanna be/All by myself/Anymore” four backup singers — Deanna Caroll Susan Marten Sarah Tracey and Johnny Britt — join Anthony onstage for the song’s dramatic conclusion.

The crowd cheers and Anthony and the singers give a potent performance of Marvin Gaye’s Motown classic “I Heard it Through the Grapevine” where they soulfully rock the estimated crowd of over 7000 music lovers.

Anthony greets the audience before taking them back in time with his 1959 hit“Tears on My Pillow.” He follows up with a performance of his dramatic 1964 ballad “I’m on the Outside (Looking In).” The arrangement — which features smooth backup vocals a dramatic orchestration and Anthony singing with style and flair — ends with great audience applause.

After talking about how he’s getting on in years — joking “My hair is white but I don’t sing with my hair!” — Anthony and company perform a spirited version of Little Richard’s “Lucille.”

Upbeat rocking and rollicking the number features several instrumental solos before the audience echo-sings along with the singers having fun on this classic ‘50s tune.

Anthony and the orchestra follow up with a song which he says “was our ticket into the 2009 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.” On his 1964 smash “Goin’ Out of My Head” Anthony sings with ease as the orchestra swells bringing enthusiastic cheers and a standing ovation from the crowd.

After the audience settles down Cousin Brucie asks Anthony to talk about his latest album Anthology telling him “We adore you we love you and we thank you for the decades of music.”

Following a short intermission Cousin Brucie invites his colleague fellow 77-WABC talk show host and Guardian Angels’ founder Curtis Sliwa on stage to chat. The men talk about their admiration and respect for one another with Brucie acknowledging “We both want the same things — peace harmony safety and goodness.”

Brucie introduces tonight’s headliner Tommy James who takes the stage along with his band The Shondells featuring Jonathn Ashe on bass John Golden on guitar Glenn Wyka on drums Mike DiMeo on synthesizer and John Korba on organ.

The crowd claps to the driving beat as James counts off the rockin’ intro to his 1971 solo hit “Draggin’ the Line.”

His voice sounding as fresh and clear as ever James sings “Makin’ a livin’ the old hard way/Takin’ and givin’ by day by day/I dig snow and rain and the bright sunshine/Draggin’ the line” as lights flash vocal harmonies ring out and the band’s wall of sound resonates throughout the amphitheater.

“Jersey! Everybody alright?” inquires James before exclaiming “Thanks for coming out! This is a great place to see a concert. Let’s put your energy together with ours and let’s make this happen!”

Blue lights flash to the beat as a tremelo electric guitar plays and James croons the lyrics to his 1968 hit “Crystal Blue Persuasion.”

Audience members happily sing along before clapping and cheering for this fan favorite.

Toes tap to the rhythm of the group’s next number “Say I Am” before James picks up an acoustic guitar and tells the audience that his memoir Me the Mob and the Music is slated to become a motion picture. He describes the final musical number in the film as a slowed-down version of his classic tune “I Think We’re Alone” which he and the band play in a mainly “unplugged” arrangement.

Following cheers Tommy and the band move on to a powerful and driving rendition of “Ball of Fire” — a song which features stunning live vocal harmonies — before continuing with the 1970 hit James co-wrote and produced for the group Alive N Kickin’. Filled with mighty harmonies and power chords lights flash as he and the band put a fresh spin on the million-seller “Tighter Tighter.”

The crowd roars as Tommy and the band ramp things up even further with a performance of James’ 1968 #1 smash the psychedelic “Crimson and Clover.” Tommy sings with feeling “Ah now I don’t hardly know her/But I think I could love her/Crimson and clover” on this classic rock ballad.

The crowd whistles and cheers and James and the Shondells respond with a song that really gets the audience moving — 1966’s “Hanky Panky” — the crowd clapping and cheering heartily at the end.

Tommy and the boys follow up with a second version of “I Think We’re Alone Now” — this time an up-tempo rendition à la the one heard on the original 1967 recording. The musicians rock the amphitheater as lights flash and audience members dance and cheer to the music.

Following 1968’s catchy “Do Something To Me” the James’ gang launches into an electric version of one of the greatest party songs in the history of pop music Tommy’s 1968 smash “Mony Mony.”

Music lovers dance on the sidelines while the band vamps and Tommy ventures offstage and out into the audience. After shaking hands with fans in the crowd he makes his way back onto the stage his talented musicians finishing the song with flair as the audience stands and cheers.

Cousin Brucie asks the fans “Do you need some more Tommy?” before acknowledging “I need some more Tommy!”

The crowd agrees and James and Co. perform an encore of Tommy’s 1969 hit “Sweet Cherry Wine.” They follow up with a rollicking rendition of 1967’s “Mirage” before concluding tonight’s festivities with a rockin’ reprise of “Mony Mony.” At the conclusion James exclaims “We love you! Thank you New Jersey!” to avid cheers and applause.

In addition the 200th F-35 fighter aircraft wing set produced by IAI was also delivered.

IAI is scheduled to produce a total of 811 pairs of F-35A wings with a potential value of over $2 billion by 2034 following a contract signed in 2011. IAI is operating a state-of-the-art F-35 wing production line inaugurated in 2014 while continuously investing in automated systems advanced infrastructures and technologies necessary to meet the aircraft’s innovative design. The wings’ upper and lower skins are made of composite materials unique to the F-35 also made by IAI as part of the production contracts.

IAI has been manufacturing aerostructures for Lockheed Martin since the 1980s. With the new demand for the F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft IAI recently reopened the assembly lines for the F-16 Wings Vertical Fins and Conformal Fuel Tanks. Prior to reopening the F-16 assembly lines IAI invested in modernizing infrastructure improving the work environment and introducing new tools to produce fully compliant F-16 aerostructures. IAI also successfully reestablished the supply chain of hardware suppliers to support the assembly lines checked and verified tooling carried out necessary first article inspections and conducted training programs for the F-16 team.

Joshua Shani Chief Executive Lockheed Martin Israel shared “Lockheed Martin’s growing sales of our most advanced platforms enable us to further expand local industrial partnerships. IAI is a valued partner for the F-35 and F-16 supply chains manufacturing various parts and technologies for Lockheed Martin for more than 40 years. Lockheed Martin greatly values our long-standing relationship with the state of Israeli and its defense industries and look forward to further expand our cooperations throughout all our key programs”.

Boaz Levy IAI President and CEO said “Delivering the F-16 aerostructures and the 200th F-35 wing to our partners at Lockheed Martin is a testament to the strong cooperation between our companies and to the trust Lockheed Martin have given us. IAI’s aerostructures production lines utilize innovative technologies that provide our customers with advanced capabilities. We look forward to many more projects with Lockheed Martin and will continue providing leading solutions to the industry.” IAI’s Aviation Group is a leader in developing and producing advanced technologies avionic structures and assemblies. It offers a dedicated line for making F-35 outer wing boxes and their skins. With these capabilities the Aviation Group serves the world’s largest aerospace companies.

He is survived by his wife of 67 years Jean Powell Batchelor. Doug was born July 31 1932 to Leonard and Pearl Lamb Batchelor in Wilmington NC. As a boy he loved to explore the nearby Atlantic beaches. His love of the coast would be lifelong. He graduated from New Hanover High School in Wilmington. In a few years he made his way to Baltimore and a job at the Glenn L. Martin Company. It was while employed there a young lady singing in a church choir caught his eye. He asked her out she said yes and they married two years later. Following a stint in the Navy the couple returned to Baltimore where they welcomed two daughters first Karen and then Cheryl. In 1962 the space program brought the young family to Orlando. Doug worked as an electrical engineer for what was now Martin Marietta helping to develop the systems that facilitated the moon landings. His idea of a good day at work was field testing space equipment atop a 100 ft. tower in remote Alaska during the wintertime. He also found the time to get his master’s degree in business administration from Rollins College. He was devoted to his family and saw to it that his daughters enjoyed a wealth of experiences growing up from canoeing the Everglades wilderness to exploring the Okefenokee swamp to spending lazy days at their cabin near Alexander Springs among others. Cheryl thanks her Dad for giving her the lifelong love of animals exploring nature and showing her how to build things with your own hands. He could fix or repair anything. Cheryl also thanks her Dad for teaching her to change the oil and spark plugs on a ’62 Rambler wagon. Karen learned from Doug to always leave a place better than you found it. At the age of 59 and after 36 years of working for what was now Lockheed Martin Doug and Jean retired to Flagler Beach. They bought an intracoastal building lot. Doug designed and built their dream home doing much of the construction himself. For the next three decades he basked in daily ocean sunrises the sights sounds and smells of the sand and sea filling his soul. His days were filled with bike rides developing his talent as an artist helping his neighbors learning more about our world and being that friendly familiar smiling face in his little beachside community. He never passed up an open U pick blueberry patch. With their daughters and extended family Doug and Jean traveled extensively in retirement from Machu Picchu to Iceland and innumerous locales in between. In recent years he saw the majesty of the Bison in Custer State Park South Dakota and enjoyed the warmth of a lakeside bonfire in Northern Michigan. As the infirmities of age required more attention Doug adapted with grace and always a warm smile. Two years ago Doug and Jean moved to Tallahassee to be closer to their daughters. To the end he regularly enjoyed the frequent family gatherings and celebrations. He is survived by his wife Jean his daughters Karen Moore (Richard) and Cheryl Elias (Robert) his grandsons Jarrod Moore and Joseph Elias his sister Dixie Jarrell nephews Howard and Phil Jarrell great nephew Sam Jarrell his sister-in-law Libby Foster nephew Larry Foster (Karen) niece Jo Padgett (Neil) and great niece Bari Padgett. A private family celebration of Doug’s life was held. At his request Doug’s ashes will be scattered in the Atlantic Ocean at his beloved Flagler Beach – but only when the surf temperature exceeds 80 degrees. He did not like cold water! The family wants to express their profound appreciation and thanks to Doug’s caregivers: Dee Gossard Shannon Mahoney and Anita Brooks for the love kindness and help they provided over the past few years. The staff at Big Bend Hospice helped make Doug’s transition more comfortable. Doug was a man of integrity self-reliance intellectual curiosity and kindness all offered with a warm smile and a servant’s heart. Those of us who love him will always aspire to the standards he set. Those who knew him will never forget him. Jared Padgett of Bevis Funeral Home is assisting the family with their arrangements. (850-385-2193 or www.bevisfh.com)

Posted online on June 18 2022 Published in Tallahasse Democrat",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN3dGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5L2xpZmVzdHlsZS8yMDIyLzA2LzE5L2Fya2Fuc2FzLWFpci1uYXRpb25hbC1ndWFyZC1iYXNlLWNob3Nlbi10cmFpbmluZy1sb2NhdGlvbi83NTU1MDc2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arkansas Air National Guard Base chosen as training location,"Lance Sumpter

Beginning next spring the sound of combat aircraft will fill our skies again pending an environmental study of Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Fort Smith that is due to be released in March 2023.

It will be the sound of maintaining the free world order freedom and democracy at home and abroad. Veterans may hear it with nostalgia and recall the good feeling of air superiority. The sounds will burst with our legacy of commitment to national security and a peaceful world order.

The U.S. Air Force announced in June 2021 that the Arkansas Air National Guard base was chosen as the preferred location for a pilot training center to support F-16 and F-35 fighter planes purchased by countries participating in the Foreign Military Sales program.

It is apt for us to host such a place given our history of contributing to the security requirements of the United States. Fort Smith has played a major role in national defense since its establishment in 1817 as a far western outpost. Later a larger more substantial fort was built and we became home to the U.S. Western District Court and Camp Chaffee. As the nation’s needs changed so did our role.

Those needs are changing again. A recently aggressive Russia in Europe and China in the Indo-Pacific poses a threat to global peace and stability. The pilot training center is our opportunity to play a part in the training and readiness of our allies who exist close to the antagonists.

In May Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a speech clarifying American policy on China calling the 2020s a ""decisive decade.""

In his speech Blinken stated “Since 1945 America and its allies have built a global order that has to a large degree kept the peace and promoted the well-being of people around the world … No country had benefited from this order more than China whose current power and prosperity were due to the opportunities the American-backed system offered for growth through trade. Rather than using its power to uphold and develop the world system however China has chosen to challenge it.”

The Wall Street Journal article ""Blinken's Indo-Pacific Blueprint"" (May 30 2022) reads “Mr. Blinken pledged to work with American allies to compete effectively with China economically diplomatically and militarily to ensure the survival and prosperity of the current world system.”

It is ironic that a Communist country became wealthy within the world order they now seek to undermine. This underscores the importance of global alliances and cooperation. We are truly at a crossroads with authoritarian leaders who seek to safeguard and expand their own power at the expense of their sovereign neighbors.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has made this clear in Europe. Ukraine chose closer ties to the West and were never a threat to Russia. It was President Vladimir Putin who felt threatened by the possibility of Ukrainian prosperity – if his neighbor prospered like Poland has with closer ties to the West Russian citizens may demand reforms that he is unwilling to make.

If the 2020s are to be a decisive decade the pilot training center is Fort Smith's opportunity to contribute again.

Should the environmental report be positive Fort Smith can expect the arrival of F-16s around June 2023 and the first F-35s in July 2024. The first training contingent will be the Singapore Air Force.

Singapore sits near the vital shipping lane of the Malacca Strait. It is the busiest strait in the world and the primary shipping route between the Indian and Pacific oceans.

Ebbing could eventually host personnel of other countries' air forces over the course of the program including Poland and Finland and the base could remain indefinitely. Poland and Finland share a border with Russia; Poland as a member of NATO and Finland recently applied for membership.

It is interesting to be part of the leading edge helping shape the logistics strategy and tactics of the free world.

Columnist Walter Russell Mead said “the secret weapon of American diplomacy is the deep community of interest between the U.S. and the peoples of the Indo-Pacific.”

For the people of Fort Smith the community of interest sits close to home.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTgvam9yZGFuLWJ1eXMtOC1mLTE2LWJsb2NrLTcwLWZpZ2h0ZXJzLWJ1dC10aGUtdXMtc3RvcHBlZC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTgvam9yZGFuLWJ1eXMtOC1mLTE2LWJsb2NrLTcwLWZpZ2h0ZXJzLWJ1dC10aGUtdXMtc3RvcHBlZC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jordan buys 8 F-16 Block 70 fighters but the US stopped production,"WASHINGTON — Another country has wanted to acquire the latest version of the 4 ++ generation F-16 Block 70 fighter and this is the Kingdom of Jordan. The Middle East country has ordered eight fighter jets but there is a problem: orders from Bahrain Slovakia Bulgaria Morocco and Taiwan are waiting in the production line.

Photo credit: Wikipedia

The F-16’s production line has been relocated in recent years to Lockheed Martin‘s newly built production facilities in South Carolina. However the United States has temporarily suspended production there and is not expected to resume until 2023. The first deliveries of new aircraft are not expected until 2024 at the earliest.

The South Carolina plant has not yet completed a full order. The last order and delivery were 36 F-16IQ fighters for the Iraqi Air Force but they were built in Fort Worth Texas. In the meantime 16 machines are to be built for Bahrain 14 for Slovakia 25 for Morocco 66 for Taiwan and eight for Bulgaria. Therefore the Jordanian order will not be able to be fulfilled in the coming years.

Currently Jordan’s combat aircraft consists of 59 F-16 – 44 A / AM versions and 15 B / BM versions. Jordanians may buy eight more than the eight currently ordered as the US State Department’s approval covers the sale of up to 16 units [12 single and four double]. The current order is half as small probably for financial reasons as it was recently for Bulgaria.

The Jordanian order shows that interest in the Fighting Falcon is not waning and as the manufacturer predicts there will probably be more people willing to buy hundreds of these aircraft. They are attractive in terms of value for money especially after the creation of the Block 70/72 variant and the F-16V package which are based on solutions developed for F-35 aircraft of the 5th generation and allow the detection of targets in more -longer distances and the use of more modern types of weapons precision air-ground class.

At the same time Poland is interested in the American F-16 Block 70/72 fighters as it is one of the countries producing elements for this fighter engaging the production capabilities of the PZL Mielec plant.

PZL Mielec provides the rear and middle of the fuselage the cockpit design the cockpit side panel and the front equipment for all F-16 fighters produced. Following their production Mielec components will be transferred to the Lockheed Martin finish line in Greenville South Carolina.

Lowe was born circa 1882 and first arrived in the Florida Keys following the conclusion of the Spanish-American War. During the war he served as a medic. He showed up in the Keys as a teenager and his time on the islands can be described as nothing short of colorful.

Though he studied law and medicine he never earned a formal degree in either discipline. It did not stop him from becoming “Doc” Lowe. In 1910 during the construction of Henry Flagler’s Over-Sea Railroad he was placed in charge of the Marathon hospital erected to tend to railroad workers. He also served as the local coroner. 1910 was a busy year for Lowe who on Sept. 3 was commissioned as a justice of the peace too.

Lowe did not always live in the Keys and after his work with the railroad he moved to the Miami area. In 1915 he ran for chief of police and lost. When he moved back to the Keys he settled in the Key Largo community of Tavernier where he became a man who wore many hats. As an officer of the court Lowe became acquainted with Robert Toombs Smith after meeting at a murder trial held in Jacksonville. The two became friends and over several summers during the mid-1920s Doc Lowe and his family began vacationing with the Smiths at their family homestead.

During Prohibition the Smith property served as a distribution portal for rum runners and bootleggers. A telegraph operator would alert Smith whenever a shipment of booze was coming in from Nassau. Shortly after that rum runners would come up Mullet Creek in the Indian River area where the 159-acre Smith homestead had been established and unload their contraband.

In a taped interview conducted by Ken Knudsen in 1990 Captain Bill Smith the son of Lowe’s friend said “Sometimes there would be as many as 50 cars parked on our property waiting to get loaded up.” Smith said he saw over $1 million in cash move across the family’s kitchen table. According to Captain Bill Doc Lowe enjoyed the Smith family’s corn whiskey.

Bill and his brother John became charter captains licensed by the Coast Guard in 1928. Later that year Doc Lowe contacted the Smith boys to say he needed a couple of charter boat captains to work at his new Tavernier club. Doc Lowe who operated a “professional and businessmen’s” club in Coral Gables opened a secondary location in the Keys where he could entertain his members. When the Tavernier club opened it was a two-story house on a piece of oceanfront property near the Leonard Lowe family – the two Lowes were unrelated.

Captain Bill went on to work for Doc Lowe until he left the Keys in 1930. Doc Lowe and his club continued to operate as was detailed in the December 1931 issue of Motor Boat Magazine:

“Capt. Doc Lowe will be found a regular fount head of information on boats tackle and places to go. All sorts of fishing tackle boats in season can be secured. Capt. Eugene Lowe is also a reliable guide. Captain Doc Lowe runs a fishing club famous for its fine eating and from Tarpon down the fishing is good in the proper season.”

In 1935 Doc Lowe was living in Tavernier when the Category 5 Labor Day Hurricane ripped the Florida Keys apart. One account of the storm published in The Miami News on September 4 1935 described the Lowe family experience. “In one corner huddled in stark fear were Mr. and Mrs. Doc Lowe their son and daughter-in-law and the latter’s nine-month-old baby. They were too frightened to talk at first. Doc was wounded in the head maybe seriously. But they finally told us of the four of them taking turns holding the baby and clinging to a tree for four hours before they were able to make their way to the Prevo bungalow.”

The Lowes remained in Tavernier after the storm and in 1937 Doc built a modern real-estate office at which point he was wearing the hats of a real estate agent justice of the peace and local historian. Lowe was elected president of the Florida Association of Justices and Constables in 1939. It would not be the last of his political aspirations and he ran for state senator in 1946.

In one of his political advertisements he said: “I have an unlimited and unsatisfied curiosity always wanted to know what made the wheels turn and what caused them to click. As a result I have attended each session of the Legislature for the past 14 years to study its mechanism or modus operandi as they would express it. I found that there were wheels and wheels within wheels and that they all turned mighty. But more often than not there was just a whir and not a click.”

Edward R. “Doc” Lowe suffered a stroke in 1951 and died at 70 years of age on June 10 1952. He left behind his wife Ellie and son Claude.

Sam Lowes (Kalex ELF Marc VDS Racing Team #22) qualified in pole position for the German Grand Prix his 18th in Moto2. It precedes Albert Arenas (GasGas GasGas Aspar Team #75) who achieved his best qualifying result since switching to Moto2 last year and remains in search of a first podium in the intermediate category. Finally Augusto Fernandez (Kalex Red Bull KTM Ajo #37) completes this first row on the Sachsenring in the hope of repeating his last victory at Le Mans.

The second line consists of Jake dixon (GasGas GasGas Aspar Team #96) passed through Q1 Marcel Schrötter (Kalex Liqui Moly Intact GP #23) and Aron Canet (Kalex Flexbox HP40 #40) and it is only with the latter that we find one of the three leading men in the championship this one being led by Celestino Vietti (Kalex Mooney VR46 Racing Team #13) 16 points ahead Ai Ogura (Kalex Idemitsu Honda Team Asia #79) and 24 ahead Arón Canet always looking for a victory.

Celestine Vietti will start from 8th position after passing through Q1 between Tony Arbolino (Kalex ELF Marc VDS Racing Team #14) and Joe Roberts (Kalex Italtrans Racing Team #16) while Cameron Beaubier (Kalex American Racing #6) will close the top 10.

The temperatures are 33° in the air and 47° on the asphalt of the Sachsenring.

When the red lights go out... Sam Lowes maintains the advantage of its pole position while Marcel Schrötter made an excellent start and positioned himself second at the first corner.

The two men even managed to create a small gap at the end of the first of 27 laps.

But little by little Augusto Fernandez came back and managed to overtake the German 24 laps from the finish while Jorge Navarro (Kalex Flexbox HP40 #9) falls at turn #13.

On the next pass the Ajo team driver took command and began to create a gap.

His teammate Peter Acosta is not to be outdone since he is then in 3rd position after starting 11th!

As the rounds go by Augusto Fernandez escapes irremediably in front of a peloton still led by Sam Lowes in front Pedro Acosta Marcel Schrötter Albert Arenas Arón Canet Fermín Aldeguer (Boscoscuro Speed ​​Up Racing #54) and Alonso lopez (Boscoscuro Speed ​​Up Racing #21) while the championship leader Celestino Vietti only appears in 14th position.

A little after Sam Lowes must bow to Peter Acosta but the leader is already more than four seconds behind while we are halfway through the race…

The gap is only growing and interest is shifting to the peloton where Aron Canet temporarily rises to seventh position Ai Ogura in 9th grade.

Dramatic turn of events seven laps from the finish when Celestine Vietti makes a mistake as if in slow motion at turn #1 which in the current situation would only leave him 8 points ahead of Ai Ogura and 12 on Augusto Fernandez !

Four laps from the finish a fight begins between Peter Acosta et Sam Lowes for second place on the podium and the two men provide us with a nice series of overtakes.

Two rounds later Marcel Schrötter comes to join in the debates but it is ultimately the Spaniard after several contacts who finishes ahead of the Briton and the German nevertheless acclaimed by his people.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels. Written and directed by Johnny Mack the comedy satire bills itself as “This is not a Tyler Perry Movie.” Expect single digits for the film.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hNjA3MjIyNDMvaG93LXdlZC1zcGVjLWl0LTIwMjQtYm13LW0tY2Fycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How We'd Spec It: 2024 BMW M2 M3 and Our Other Ideal M Cars,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a60722243/how-wed-spec-it-2024-bmw-m-cars/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hNjA3MjIyNDMvaG93LXdlZC1zcGVjLWl0LTIwMjQtYm13LW0tY2Fycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTgxMzQxL3dlc2xleWFuLXByZXNpZGVudC1ub3QtY2FsbGluZy1wb2xpY2Utc3R1ZGVudC1nYXphLWVuY2FtcG1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why I'm Not Calling the Police on My Students' Encampment,"The encampment now grown to roughly 50 tents may be fostering a sense of community among protesters but it hasn’t been kumbaya for everyone. Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvbWFuLXdoby1yZWNlaXZlZC0xMjVtLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtaHBkLWFycmVzdGVkLWd1bi1jcmltZXMv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGF3YWlpbmV3c25vdy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9tYW4td2hvLXJlY2VpdmVkLTEyNW0tc2V0dGxlbWVudC1ocGQtYXJyZXN0ZWQtZ3VuLWNyaW1lcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man who received $12.5M settlement from HPD arrested for gun crimes,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - A 38-year-old man getting paid $12.5 million to settle a lawsuit with HPD has been arrested for gun crimes according to Honolulu police.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan that was being chased by police officers in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving him in a coma for weeks and five others seriously injured.

Perkins-Sinapati filed one of three civil lawsuits blaming HPD for the wreck.

In February the city council approved the settlement.

At last check Perkins-Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses. Meanwhile his attorney cast suspicion on his arrest.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June. All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

Thompson Center is in full swing after the building’s developers on Monday officially kicked off the redevelopment project saying it will have an “unbelievable impact” on the Loop and strengthen Chicago’s reputation as a technology hub.

Once complete the building at 100 W. Randolph St. will become Google’s Chicago headquarters and house 2000 employees. The project is expected to be move-in ready by 2026.

The renovation of the center comes at a time of wider transformation for the Loop. Mayor Brandon Johnson announced in April that he was seeking $150 million in tax increment financing for four La Salle Street adaptive reuse projects. The conversions would create more than 1000 new apartments in the city’s Central Business District bringing new use to largely vacant office buildings.

Prime/Capri Interests a joint venture between developers Michael Reschke and Quintin Primo III is completing the $280 million build-to-suit redevelopment under an agreement with Google which intends to purchase the building once renovations are complete. PCI said the makeover is akin to a rebuild.

“When this project is complete this one single building will help lift up the surrounding area” Reschke said. “Not only will it lift up the buildings but it also will lift up ... all the people who work live and visit this area every single day.”

Reschke and Primo were joined by Gov. J.B. Pritzker Johnson and Google’s head of its Chicago operations Karen Sauder along with other Google executives and city and state officials.

Pritzker told Google’s leaders that it’s “an incredible investment both in your future and in ours.”

PCI will restore and modernize the Thompson Center with a new triple-pane glass wrap on the exterior a heightened colonnade three levels of covered terraces and access to green spaces.

The center’s CTA stop at Clark and Lake streets where six lines converge will remain open throughout construction. Google previously said passengers on those lines could expect a “new and improved CTA experience” though it hasn’t been made clear what that will look like.

Carbon-free energy

In 2022 Pritzker announced that the center traded hands inking a deal with Google in “a sale that has eluded State government for decades” according to a news release at the time. The state working out terms with developer Reschke sold it to Google for $105 million and then paid $75 million for 115 S. La Salle St. formerly the BMO Harris Bank building where the state moved its offices from the Thompson Center.

Construction at the 1.2 million-square-foot center started a month ago when Clark Construction placed equipment on the site and protective fencing was installed around the building’s perimeter and outdoor plaza. On Thursday construction crews could be seen tearing off the lower exterior of the building and a portion of the atrium.

The 38-year-old state government building has long garnered mixed reactions. Over the course of its existence three governors wanted the center demolished because of its age and high maintenance costs. State officials have said it costs $17 million a year to operate the building.

But pricey maintenance costs are expected to change through PCI’s redevelopment efforts. The developer is pursuing LEED Platinum status — the highest level of LEED certification — and transitioning the building to all electric. The Thompson Center’s internal systems will be replaced along with its heating and cooling systems to better handle Chicago’s climate. The glass facade which will bring a modern touch and higher visibility will also double as a way to improve the building’s thermal performance.

Efforts to make the center a green building are in line with Google’s goal to use 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

“With the Thompson Center we saw a chance to revitalize the Loop but also take this iconic building that some thought of tearing down and instead make the renovations necessary to respectfully steward it into the 21st century” Sauder said.

Designed by Chicago architect Helmut Jahn the building opened in 1985 as the State of Illinois Center. It’s become recognizable for its 17-story atrium and the 29-foot tall “Monument with Standing Beast” sculpture. The sculpture nicknamed “Snoopy in a Blender” was removed last week and will be kept at a state facility until it’s moved to the Art Institute of Chicago.

Jahn’s namesake architecture firm is leading the redesign.

Johnson said Google’s investment proves Chicago is globally connected and a world-class hub for innovation. From 2022 to 2023 Chicago saw 32 new office openings.

“Chicago is the place to be” Johnson said.

Broadly the offshore of Wales contains parts of six main Permo-Mesozoic basins which are the East Irish Sea Caernarvon Bay Cardigan Bay St George’s Channel Celtic Sea and Bristol Channel. The onshore consists of slivers of the Permo-Mesozoic Cheshire Basin and Worcester Graben in Mid and Central Wales and in the south it is dominated by the Devonian–Carboniferous South Wales Coalfield Basin and the Silurian Usk Basin.

Early Onshore Exploration

It is not commonly known but the oil and gas industry began in Wales in the 1860s in Flintshire in North Wales. There is a fascinating account of a seam of Carboniferous-aged cannel coal (or candle coal) a type of bituminous coal also classified as an oil-shale being worked in the Leeswood Green Colliery near Mold in North Wales. According to Giffard (1938) the cannel coal was used chiefly for the manufacture of ‘illuminating oil’ by distillation of the coal in cast-iron retorts at a low red heat. Lubricating oil and grease were also obtained. At the time the largest of the 20 or so coal-oil companies was the Flintshire Oil & Cannel Co. Ltd. However the ‘oil boom’ was short-lived with cheap exports of oil coming from Pennsylvania leading to the bankruptcy of most coal-oil businesses in North Wales by the 1870s. In the current era this would have been classified as unconventional oil exploration and production.

Figure 1: Basins oil and gas fields and wells drilled in Wales. Graphics by Ian Picton.



The first well drilled in Wales targeting conventional oil and gas was Pontypridd-1 drilled in Licence 114 in South Wales in 1941 by Anglo-American a company which later became part of Esso. The shallow exploration well located without seismic data and on surface geology targeted Carboniferous-aged Millstone Grit and Basal Grit as part of a wartime effort to find oil for Great Britain. Figure 1 shows a location of the wells drilled in Wales. It reached a total depth (TD) of 1973 ft but no hydrocarbons of significance were reported. Pontypridd-1 took some nine months to drill and was no doubt a stop-start process due to the situation at the time. The licence was relinquished in 1947. The drilling of Pontypridd-1 was probably in response to the D’Arcy Exploration Company (later renamed The British Petroleum Company) discoveries in the Carboniferous succession at Eakring (1939) and Kelham Hills (1941) in Nottinghamshire.

The second well drilled in Wales was Leeswood-1 drilled by D’Arcy in 1955 in Licence A100. D’Arcy had likely been encouraged by reports of the coal-oil in the Flintshire mines. The shallow well targeted the Carboniferous Limestone and Millstone Grit at a location near the River Alyn. The well reached a TD of 1093 ft in around six weeks with no hydrocarbon indications. Plans to drill a follow up well on the Billberry Wood Prospect to test the same objectives were then scrapped by the operator.

In the early 1960s a Conoco and Marathon-led group (Envoy and Safari were involved in some of the licences) was awarded acreage covering parts of Carmarthenshire Glamorgan Radnorshire Monmouthshire and Brecon and adjacent Welsh borderland counties. Trevor Thomas in a publication in 1964 speculated that the group was optimistic of a Silurian source rock. The major Silurian source rocks discovered in the Middle East North Africa and the USA may have driven these exploration efforts.

Between 1967 and 1969 an important geological discovery was made at the Mochras (or Llanbedr) borehole on the coast of Gwynedd West Wales. The stratigraphic well was drilled on the edge of Cardigan Bay by the Institute of Geological Sciences now the British Geological Survey (BGS) and encountered a thick succession of Jurassic rocks. The unexpected outcome of the borehole brought into play the Mesozoic hydrocarbon potential of the Cardigan Bay Basin and a major re-think of the geology of Wales.

In 1972 Cambrian Exploration Ltd spudded the Senghenydd-1 exploration well in PL155 in South Wales. The well reached a TD of 9331 ft in the Middle Silurian without encountering significant hydrocarbons in likely Carboniferous and Devonian sandstone objectives. Cambrian followed this up with Maesteg-1 in 1973 in adjacent PL154. The well seems to have targeted Devonian and Ordovician sandstones reaching a TD of 8690 ft in Ordovician sediments. There are again no reports of any significant hydrocarbons and the licences expired in 1978 without further drilling in Wales.

From the early 1970s attention moved to the North Sea but BP continued to explore onshore and drilled the Erbistock-1 wildcat in 1986 in PL228. The licence was located near Overton Bridge south of Wrexham near the England border. Erbistock-1 was deviated and designed to test Carboniferous-aged Westphalian and Namurian sandstones and the Dinantian dolomites on the western edge of the Cheshire Basin. BP had been encouraged by oil shows in the area; however only poor hydrocarbon shows were reported in the Dinantian which turned out to be sandstones rather than the anticipated shelf limestone and dolomite. It reached a TD of 6196 ft.

In late 1988 Sovereign Oil Ltd a successful offshore UK explorer at the time spudded the eagerly awaited Usk-1 wildcat in EXL080 in the Usk Basin in south-east Wales. Sovereign had some heavyweight partners that included Union Texas and Amerada Hess. The well located east of the north–south-orientated Usk Anticline was designed to target Silurian sandstones but encountered weak gas shows only (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Seismic line through Usk-1 showing the thick section of Silurian sediments. Graphic by Ian Picton.



Usk-1 reached a TD of 10040 ft in the Lower Silurian and remains the last conventional oil and gas exploration well drilled onshore Wales. While disappointing it did demonstrate the potential of a Silurian or older source rock with the gas shows encountered. A single Drill Stem Test (DST) conducted between 5644 and 5810 ft recovered mud filtrate and formation water only.

Gas from Coal

For several decades the National Coal Board (NCB) had been involved in the draining of methane for safety reasons from active mines but in addition it was a valuable clean fuel and used commercially. Mine gas only has medium heating value and was uneconomic to transport too far from the point of production. Morgan (1974) reported that initial trials were conducted in South Wales in 1950 and commissioning of a South Wales Methane Grid took place in 1957.

In 1956 the Wales Gas Board and the NCB agreed to a 20-year contract for the supply of methane from the Point of Ayr Colliery in North Wales for use in the national grid. It seems that a similar joint venture was in place to supply methane from local mines to the Aberavon gas works in South Wales. The NCB had a methane gas grid of around 80 km of pipeline in the South Wales Coalfield with the Afán colliery near Port Talbot used as underground storage.

In 1983 around 17 Bcf of pure methane is reported to have been drained from coal mining operations in the UK with some 1.5 Bcf coming from South Wales. At the time the NCB reported that the South Wales network of pipelines was used to integrate the supply of coke oven gas and mine gas. These customers included Treforest Industrial Estate Mid Glamorgan Hospital Flextank (later known as Thompson Technik) and Ness Active Carbon Plant (Figure 3).

From the mid-1990s following success in places like the USA Australia and China several Coal Bed Methane (CBM) and Mine Gas licences were applied for and awarded with some 17 shallow wells drilled. These are split into four CBM wells in South Wales and three in North Wales and eight Mine Gas wells in South Wales plus two in the North none of which have proved particularly successful according to public data. More recently old coal operations have made the news with an announcement that the UK is in an exploratory stage with its mine water heat schemes. The UK Geoenergy Observatory (UKGEOS) based in Glasgow and run by the BGS is one of the key research stations.

The Move Offshore

The first offshore well in Welsh waters was 103/21-1 drilled by Amoco in 1971. The wildcat was drilled to test potential Lower Cretaceous Jurassic Triassic and Permian sandstone reservoirs in a poorly understood area in the South Celtic Sea Basin. However the well failed to produce any encouragement.

By the mid-1970s exploration in the North Sea had really taken off with success after success. The enthusiasm also spread to other basins in UK waters and from 1973 to 1978 nine exploration wells were drilled in Welsh waters by major companies including operators Deminex Shell Arco Arpet Conoco Texaco and Hydrocarbons Great Britain (HGB).

While these wells in the Liverpool Bay area of the East Irish Sea Basin (HGB) were unsuccessful a subsidiary of British Gas discovered the world-class 5 Tcf South Morecambe gas field in 1974. The significant discovery was made shortly after the surrender of the block in rather unusual circumstances by Gulf Oil. Gas was discovered in the upper part of the Lower Triassic Sherwood Sandstone Group.

Finally Offshore Success

The offshore area saw another burst of activity starting in 1989 and in 1990 Colorado-based Hamilton Oil discovered the Douglas oil field with well 110/13-2. The field is located some 24 km off the coast of North Wales in 28m of water. The wildcat had been designed to test a gas play following the success at South Morecambe and the discovery nearby of the Hamilton and Hamilton North gas fields. Oil tested at the rate of 1800 bopd of 44-degree API oil from the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone with the Carboniferous Namurian Bowland Shale Formation believed to represent the source rock. The Douglas field came on stream in 1996 and was the first oil field developed in the East Irish Sea and Wales’s first and only oil production to date. At the time of discovery the field was estimated to contain over 200 million barrels of oil in place.

By 2020 the field had impressively produced over 100 million barrels. The Douglas oil field is now operated by Eni after its acquisition of BHP Petroleum’s East Irish Sea assets in 2014. The field was developed with 22 wells: 15 producers six water injectors and a single sour gas and condensate disposal well.

In 1994 Marathon Oil made the 103/01-1 gas discovery (later named Dragon) in 96m of water in the St George’s Channel Basin some 40 km off the south-east coast of Ireland and 35 km off the coast of Wales. Marathon was awarded Block 103/1 in the UK 14th Round of Licensing in May 1993. Well 103/01-1 was drilled to test a Triassic Sherwood Sandstone prospect as well as a secondary Jurassic Bajocian objective. Due to drilling problems the Sherwood Sandstone was not reached and the secondary target of the Bajocian Sandstone was absent due to faulting. However hydrocarbons were found in Jurassic sandstones of Callovian to Oxfordian age. The well tested at the rate of 21 MMscfg and 120 bopd of 42-degree API oil. The source of the hydrocarbons are Carboniferous shales and coals.

At the time it was estimated that the Dragon field had gas in place of around 120 Bcf. Marathon undertook a 3D seismic survey in 1995 and a fault block up-dip of 103/01-1 was identified as a potential large structural trap. A drilling moratorium prevented the appraisal of Dragon until 2005. The deviated well 103/01-2 was drilled in 2005 by Marathon but sadly the sands proved to lack hydrocarbons and reserves in the field were downgraded to around 50 Bcf.

In 2007 Ireland-based Providence Resources was awarded a Standard Exploration Licence covering Irish Block 51/01 and began discussions with Marathon regarding potential development of the fault block drilled by the 103/01-1 well. Marathon’s UK licence became listed as fallow and was subsequently relinquished in 2010 based on lack of commerciality. Providence submitted an out-of-round application for the block and were awarded the licence in January 2012 with its then partner Star Energy Oil & Gas Ltd. The structure of the Dragon gas field straddles the Ireland/UK median line which was attractive to the partnership. Providence subsequently relinquished the Dragon field in 2016 as it was deemed uncommercial. The field is now in open acreage and with the pending energy shortage it could be time for another company to revisit the field.

The last exploration well drilled offshore Wales was 110/13b-21. The well was drilled by BHP with Eni as a partner on the Bel Air Prospect close to the Douglas field in 2010. This well is reported to have encountered a thicker than expected Permian-aged Manchester Marl sequence comprising interbedded shale and dolomite. However hydrocarbons were absent in the well. The primary objective was Permian Collyhurst Sandstone in large fault block structure.

Today

Since 1 October 2018 Welsh Ministers are responsible for licensing the exploration and development of Wales’s onshore petroleum resources. They have a statutory duty to manage the existing petroleum licences that were issued by the UK Government before 1 October 2018. As the licensing authority Welsh Ministers are responsible for decisions on whether to issue new licences and the management of existing licences issued before 1 October 2018 in accordance with the licence model clauses.

The offshore is still the responsibility of the UK Government. Other than the area around the Douglas oil field in the Irish Sea there are no current offshore licences in Welsh waters. With proven hydrocarbons it is hoped that the open areas in the St George’s Channel Basin will attract industry interest in the future. It is hard to conclude that Dragon is the only hydrocarbon accumulation in Welsh waters in the basin.

Potential plays exist in the Cardigan Bay Basin where the Lias and Carboniferous offer possible source rocks but the challenge is getting the correct configuration of source rock trap and reservoir. One such feature that may bring all these together is the Morfa Structure a rollover anticline alongside the east north-east to west south-west Bala Fault. The location is shown on Figure 1.

The potential of these two basins was demonstrated by the award of 17 blocks to Eni in the 28th Offshore Licensing Round in 2015. Eni had planned a 955 sq km 3D survey to firm up several leads named after Roman emperors and mapped to prospect status. The leads are shown in Figure 1 which are taken from an Eni relinquishment report available via the OGA’s open data site. Eni’s largest lead is designated Hadrian and covers parts of Blocks 106/2425 and 29 alongside the north-east to south-west St George’s Fault. Hadrian has Jurassic and Triassic sandstone objectives and Eni estimated its recoverable reserves at around 40 million barrels of oil and 300 Bcf of gas. However due to environmental issues the 3D survey was cancelled and Eni subsequently relinquished the blocks in 2019.

There are currently five unconventional and only one remaining onshore conventional licence which is held by UK-based Sonorex Oil & Gas Ltd. The full list of all current licences is listed below.

Table-1: Current licence holders onshore Wales.



It is worth noting that although the work programmes associated with each licence are broadly categorised as conventional/unconventional the licensee is not contractually bound to deploy any specific techniques. In practice the developer can modify plans as their understanding of the geology improves.

PEDL157 is now held until 2035 by Sonorex and it is intended to drill the Uskmouth-1 well. Sonorex acquired 28 km of new 2D regional seismic data in 2006.

The Uskmouth Prospect has a Devonian Old Red Sandstone primary objective and Silurian Wenlock sandstones offering a secondary target with charge coming from Silurian or older shales. The overlying Carboniferous will provide the seal. The exploration well will be designed to simultaneously test for hydrocarbons geothermal and Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) capabilities with a planned TD of 4000 ft. The Silurian shales also offer an unconventional target. Sonorex estimate resource size to be in the range of 200 Bcf of gas. In 2000 there were reports of gas leaking into houses in the Ringland area of Newport which perhaps offers encouragement to Sonorex of an active petroleum system.

Grassroots community groups recently broke ground on the Eden Park project a six-acre ecological haven designed for an area of the city that has long dealt with industrial pollution.

During a groundbreaking ceremony recently Detroit dignitaries like Mayor Mike Duggan and U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib D-Detroit were on hand to mark the beginning of construction on the project. But Eden Park is the result of a decade-long effort by community members to turn the abandoned school site into a public space.

""You have your faith you have your vision and this is why we’re here today” said Tlaib acknowledging the local efforts during her speech at the Memorial Day weekend ceremony WDIV (Channel 4) reported.

The groundbreaking kicked off a weekend of festivities including a carnival that offered a glimpse at what the finished version will offer to the area which encompasses the Detroit neighborhood and the cities of Ecorse and River Rouge.

Construction for Eden Park is expected to be completed by 2024.

Eden Park is seen as one solution to combatting environmental problems the neighborhood has grappled with and is part of a community effort to take environmental concerns into its own hands following decades of battles over air quality in the area according to the project's website.

“Community residents for their own safety and safety of their neighbors they have immersed themselves in environmental justice” said the Eden Park steering committee co-chair Alicia Renee Farris.

“So it’s not what we thought it’s what the community recommended.”

When planning began in 2011 the idea was to develop a community center inside the shuttered Mark Twain Elementary School located on Detroit’s Gleason Street. Plans evolved and with a new focus aimed at designing a green space for the neighborhoods.

One of the catalysts for the green space idea was the environmental justice work at New Mt. Hermon Missionary Baptist Church which in recent years became an air monitoring site for a community-led operation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate the overall air quality of the neighborhood.

New Mt. Hermon Missionary Baptist Church owns the abandoned school property Eden Park will be built on and sits across the street.

The neighborhood surrounding the park is predominantly African American with a mix of elderly residents who have remained in the community for years and younger residents with children many of whom have long standing family connections to the area.

Large lush trees surround the perimeter of the property with a sign out front that reads Future Home of Eden Park. In the immediate vicinity orderly rows of one story family homes line the blocks.

On a recent morning residents were out mowing their lawns and taking care of their gardens. Churches throughout the neighborhood were filling up for Sunday service. A boy walked down the street eating a frozen ice pop and families sat out on their porches.

A few streets over from Eden Park Tracey Thomas was in her front yard watering the plants in the front of her house. The 52-year-old Ecorse resident has been in the neighborhood for decades and lives just a few houses down from where she raised her children.

That’s typical of the neighborhood Thomas said. The area is a peaceful place where “everybody knows everybody” and residents tend to stay for a long time she said. It’s a place where people can raise their children and later pass their house down to the next generation.

Thomas who is not involved in the project heard about the plans for Eden Park recently through word of mouth. Having a park that will jointly serve the southwest Detroit neighborhood as well as adjacent neighborhoods in Ecorse and River Rouge is something she hasn't seen before she said.

“Usually everything is separated but I think it will be a good thing it’s something good for the community” said Thomas. “It will be a beautiful thing.”

Thomas hopes the park will provide a safe place for young people in the neighborhood and she said she would like to see more projects for children.

The age makeup of the population factored significantly into the planning process according to Farris.

“It’s a mixed community but it’s also a very close-knit community” she said. “We knew we needed to consider the aging population and the younger population.”

The space will have a playground but it will also have a so-called “park within a park” which is described as a space that will provide scenic and tranquil surroundings for residents with Alzheimer's disease or neurological disorders.

The project also has been spearheaded by the Tri-City Community Development Corp. and partnered with some of the corporations that have historically contributed to the area’s air pollution like Marathon Oil.

Funding for projects in the neighborhood and surrounding 48217 ZIP code was recently included a settlement between the Sierra Club and DTE Energy Co. The nearby communities in Ecorse and River Rouge also are included in the settlement. Some of the money is earmarked for the construction of Eden Park.

Entities like the Wayne County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority and Ben & Jerry’s Foundation have also helped fund the project.

Rainy Hamilton a principal architect who runs the largest African American design firm in Michigan and his firm Hamilton Anderson Associates are handling the architectural and design aspects of the Eden Park project.

Hamilton also has a special connection to the project and the surrounding community.

He lived in the area as a child and saw his artwork displayed for the first time inside the halls of Mark Twain Elementary school which was then located at the grassy site across from the church.

""I do remember vividly holding my mother's hand standing in the hall of Mark Twain Elementary and looking at a watercolor painting I did displayed in a glass case right at the main entrance” Hamilton said.

Seeing the school abandoned in recent years was heartbreaking he said.

Now some 60 years later he’s designing a park that will give the community a six-acre slice of open space.

""It gives the neighborhood a place to come together to celebrate to play to relax"" he said.

Hamilton is hopeful the park will become a well-used amenity for the community. He is excited to see how the park brings native bird species and flowers to the area.

“It’s so hard these days the need is so great” said Hamilton. “So to see it getting to this point where it’s starting to turn a corner I think that encourages me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L2YxLWF1dG9zcG9ydC8xNjI3OTExL3RlZC1rcmF2aXR6LXNlYmFzdGlhbi12ZXR0ZWwtYXN0b24tbWFydGluLW9pbC1jb21wYW55LWFyYW1jby1jYW5hZGlhbi1ncmFuZC1wcml40gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvZjEtYXV0b3Nwb3J0LzE2Mjc5MTEvdGVkLWtyYXZpdHotc2ViYXN0aWFuLXZldHRlbC1hc3Rvbi1tYXJ0aW4tb2lsLWNvbXBhbnktYXJhbWNvLWNhbmFkaWFuLWdyYW5kLXByaXgvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ted Kravitz calls out Sebastian Vettel for promoting oil company after climate campaigning,"Question Time: F1 Driver Sebastian Vettel offers opinion on Brexit

Ted Kravitz is bemused by Sebastian Vettel’s climate campaigning while he is sponsored by one of the world's richest oil companies. He spoke out on the “incongruous” relationship on Ted’s Notebook after qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix.

Kravitz said: “Sebastian Vettel is wearing a sort of darker crash helmet calling out or drawing attention I should say with his environmental activism credentials Canada’s climate crime I think he calls it which is about the tar sands. It's slightly incongruous because on the top of his helmet there’s this big sort of oil pipeline and then of course they are sponsored by Aramco. The Saudi oil company. The most wealthiest company in the world. “So there’s this sort of Saudi oil company logo and then this big oil pipe over Seb’s helmet.” Kravitz then shrugged his shoulders in confusion adding: “I mean okay Seb listen of course I’m with you But you know what I mean.” Alongside his helmet design Vettel arrived at the Canadian Grand Prix wearing a T-shirt with the message: “Stop mining oil sands”.

Ted Kravitz has called out Sebastian Vettekl

The message prompted Alberta’s Minister of Energy Sonia Savage to hit back at Vettel ahead of the race. She explained: “I have seen a lot of hypocrisy over the years but this one takes the cake. A race car driver sponsored by Aston Martin with financing from Saudi Aramco complaining about the oilsands. “Saudi Aramco has the largest daily oil production of all companies in the world. It is reputed to be the single largest contributor to global carbon emissions of any company since 1965. Rather than demonising the oilsands which is on a path to net-zero people could look to lowering their own personal carbon footprint. Perhaps a pedal-car for Formula 1?” However Vettel backed up his message ahead of the weekend claiming he disagreed with the tar sand project. DON'T MISS

The Aston Martin driver has used his platform a global sports star to raise awareness on several climate change issues around the world.

He made a statement at the Miami Grand Prix by highlighting a 2019 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which warned the coastal city will be under water by 2060 due to rising sea levels. And this week has seen Vettel take aim at Canada's controversial use of oil sands and the operation in place in Alberta.

It appears as though some of those in attendance for Sunday's race didn't take too kindly to Vettel's strong words though and booed the driver as he made his way around the track in the hours before the Grand Prix. Vettel didn't mince his words in Friday's press conference when he called out ""Canada’s climate crime"".

“I find this – fascinating might be the wrong word – but there’s a lot going on. We live in a time and age where we are so much aware of a lot of things"" he said. “I think what happens in Alberta is a crime because you chop down a lot of trees and you basically destroy the place just to extract oil and the manner of doing it with the tar sands mining oil sands mining is horrible for nature.

Broadly the offshore of Wales contains parts of six main Permo-Mesozoic basins which are the East Irish Sea Caernarvon Bay Cardigan Bay St George’s Channel Celtic Sea and Bristol Channel. The onshore consists of slivers of the Permo-Mesozoic Cheshire Basin and Worcester Graben in Mid and Central Wales and in the south it is dominated by the Devonian–Carboniferous South Wales Coalfield Basin and the Silurian Usk Basin.

Early Onshore Exploration

It is not commonly known but the oil and gas industry began in Wales in the 1860s in Flintshire in North Wales. There is a fascinating account of a seam of Carboniferous-aged cannel coal (or candle coal) a type of bituminous coal also classified as an oil-shale being worked in the Leeswood Green Colliery near Mold in North Wales. According to Giffard (1938) the cannel coal was used chiefly for the manufacture of ‘illuminating oil’ by distillation of the coal in cast-iron retorts at a low red heat. Lubricating oil and grease were also obtained. At the time the largest of the 20 or so coal-oil companies was the Flintshire Oil & Cannel Co. Ltd. However the ‘oil boom’ was short-lived with cheap exports of oil coming from Pennsylvania leading to the bankruptcy of most coal-oil businesses in North Wales by the 1870s. In the current era this would have been classified as unconventional oil exploration and production.

Figure 1: Basins oil and gas fields and wells drilled in Wales. Graphics by Ian Picton.



The first well drilled in Wales targeting conventional oil and gas was Pontypridd-1 drilled in Licence 114 in South Wales in 1941 by Anglo-American a company which later became part of Esso. The shallow exploration well located without seismic data and on surface geology targeted Carboniferous-aged Millstone Grit and Basal Grit as part of a wartime effort to find oil for Great Britain. Figure 1 shows a location of the wells drilled in Wales. It reached a total depth (TD) of 1973 ft but no hydrocarbons of significance were reported. Pontypridd-1 took some nine months to drill and was no doubt a stop-start process due to the situation at the time. The licence was relinquished in 1947. The drilling of Pontypridd-1 was probably in response to the D’Arcy Exploration Company (later renamed The British Petroleum Company) discoveries in the Carboniferous succession at Eakring (1939) and Kelham Hills (1941) in Nottinghamshire.

The second well drilled in Wales was Leeswood-1 drilled by D’Arcy in 1955 in Licence A100. D’Arcy had likely been encouraged by reports of the coal-oil in the Flintshire mines. The shallow well targeted the Carboniferous Limestone and Millstone Grit at a location near the River Alyn. The well reached a TD of 1093 ft in around six weeks with no hydrocarbon indications. Plans to drill a follow up well on the Billberry Wood Prospect to test the same objectives were then scrapped by the operator.

In the early 1960s a Conoco and Marathon-led group (Envoy and Safari were involved in some of the licences) was awarded acreage covering parts of Carmarthenshire Glamorgan Radnorshire Monmouthshire and Brecon and adjacent Welsh borderland counties. Trevor Thomas in a publication in 1964 speculated that the group was optimistic of a Silurian source rock. The major Silurian source rocks discovered in the Middle East North Africa and the USA may have driven these exploration efforts.

Between 1967 and 1969 an important geological discovery was made at the Mochras (or Llanbedr) borehole on the coast of Gwynedd West Wales. The stratigraphic well was drilled on the edge of Cardigan Bay by the Institute of Geological Sciences now the British Geological Survey (BGS) and encountered a thick succession of Jurassic rocks. The unexpected outcome of the borehole brought into play the Mesozoic hydrocarbon potential of the Cardigan Bay Basin and a major re-think of the geology of Wales.

In 1972 Cambrian Exploration Ltd spudded the Senghenydd-1 exploration well in PL155 in South Wales. The well reached a TD of 9331 ft in the Middle Silurian without encountering significant hydrocarbons in likely Carboniferous and Devonian sandstone objectives. Cambrian followed this up with Maesteg-1 in 1973 in adjacent PL154. The well seems to have targeted Devonian and Ordovician sandstones reaching a TD of 8690 ft in Ordovician sediments. There are again no reports of any significant hydrocarbons and the licences expired in 1978 without further drilling in Wales.

From the early 1970s attention moved to the North Sea but BP continued to explore onshore and drilled the Erbistock-1 wildcat in 1986 in PL228. The licence was located near Overton Bridge south of Wrexham near the England border. Erbistock-1 was deviated and designed to test Carboniferous-aged Westphalian and Namurian sandstones and the Dinantian dolomites on the western edge of the Cheshire Basin. BP had been encouraged by oil shows in the area; however only poor hydrocarbon shows were reported in the Dinantian which turned out to be sandstones rather than the anticipated shelf limestone and dolomite. It reached a TD of 6196 ft.

In late 1988 Sovereign Oil Ltd a successful offshore UK explorer at the time spudded the eagerly awaited Usk-1 wildcat in EXL080 in the Usk Basin in south-east Wales. Sovereign had some heavyweight partners that included Union Texas and Amerada Hess. The well located east of the north–south-orientated Usk Anticline was designed to target Silurian sandstones but encountered weak gas shows only (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Seismic line through Usk-1 showing the thick section of Silurian sediments. Graphic by Ian Picton.



Usk-1 reached a TD of 10040 ft in the Lower Silurian and remains the last conventional oil and gas exploration well drilled onshore Wales. While disappointing it did demonstrate the potential of a Silurian or older source rock with the gas shows encountered. A single Drill Stem Test (DST) conducted between 5644 and 5810 ft recovered mud filtrate and formation water only.

Gas from Coal

For several decades the National Coal Board (NCB) had been involved in the draining of methane for safety reasons from active mines but in addition it was a valuable clean fuel and used commercially. Mine gas only has medium heating value and was uneconomic to transport too far from the point of production. Morgan (1974) reported that initial trials were conducted in South Wales in 1950 and commissioning of a South Wales Methane Grid took place in 1957.

In 1956 the Wales Gas Board and the NCB agreed to a 20-year contract for the supply of methane from the Point of Ayr Colliery in North Wales for use in the national grid. It seems that a similar joint venture was in place to supply methane from local mines to the Aberavon gas works in South Wales. The NCB had a methane gas grid of around 80 km of pipeline in the South Wales Coalfield with the Afán colliery near Port Talbot used as underground storage.

In 1983 around 17 Bcf of pure methane is reported to have been drained from coal mining operations in the UK with some 1.5 Bcf coming from South Wales. At the time the NCB reported that the South Wales network of pipelines was used to integrate the supply of coke oven gas and mine gas. These customers included Treforest Industrial Estate Mid Glamorgan Hospital Flextank (later known as Thompson Technik) and Ness Active Carbon Plant (Figure 3).

Figure 3: South Wales gas grid (modified from NCB). Graphic by Ian Picton.



From the mid-1990s following success in places like the USA Australia and China several Coal Bed Methane (CBM) and Mine Gas licences were applied for and awarded with some 17 shallow wells drilled. These are split into four CBM wells in South Wales and three in North Wales and eight Mine Gas wells in South Wales plus two in the North none of which have proved particularly successful according to public data. More recently old coal operations have made the news with an announcement that the UK is in an exploratory stage with its mine water heat schemes. The UK Geoenergy Observatory (UKGEOS) based in Glasgow and run by the BGS is one of the key research stations.

The Move Offshore

The first offshore well in Welsh waters was 103/21-1 drilled by Amoco in 1971. The wildcat was drilled to test potential Lower Cretaceous Jurassic Triassic and Permian sandstone reservoirs in a poorly understood area in the South Celtic Sea Basin. However the well failed to produce any encouragement.

By the mid-1970s exploration in the North Sea had really taken off with success after success. The enthusiasm also spread to other basins in UK waters and from 1973 to 1978 nine exploration wells were drilled in Welsh waters by major companies including operators Deminex Shell Arco Arpet Conoco Texaco and Hydrocarbons Great Britain (HGB).

While these wells in the Liverpool Bay area of the East Irish Sea Basin (HGB) were unsuccessful a subsidiary of British Gas discovered the world-class 5 Tcf South Morecambe gas field in 1974. The significant discovery was made shortly after the surrender of the block in rather unusual circumstances by Gulf Oil. Gas was discovered in the upper part of the Lower Triassic Sherwood Sandstone Group.

Finally Offshore Success

The offshore area saw another burst of activity starting in 1989 and in 1990 Colorado-based Hamilton Oil discovered the Douglas oil field with well 110/13-2. The field is located some 24 km off the coast of North Wales in 28m of water. The wildcat had been designed to test a gas play following the success at South Morecambe and the discovery nearby of the Hamilton and Hamilton North gas fields. Oil tested at the rate of 1800 bopd of 44-degree API oil from the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone with the Carboniferous Namurian Bowland Shale Formation believed to represent the source rock. The Douglas field came on stream in 1996 and was the first oil field developed in the East Irish Sea and Wales’s first and only oil production to date. At the time of discovery the field was estimated to contain over 200 million barrels of oil in place.

By 2020 the field had impressively produced over 100 million barrels. The Douglas oil field is now operated by Eni after its acquisition of BHP Petroleum’s East Irish Sea assets in 2014. The field was developed with 22 wells: 15 producers six water injectors and a single sour gas and condensate disposal well.

Figure 4: The Douglas oil field complex.



In 1994 Marathon Oil made the 103/01-1 gas discovery (later named Dragon) in 96m of water in the St George’s Channel Basin some 40 km off the south-east coast of Ireland and 35 km off the coast of Wales. Marathon was awarded Block 103/1 in the UK 14th Round of Licensing in May 1993. Well 103/01-1 was drilled to test a Triassic Sherwood Sandstone prospect as well as a secondary Jurassic Bajocian objective. Due to drilling problems the Sherwood Sandstone was not reached and the secondary target of the Bajocian Sandstone was absent due to faulting. However hydrocarbons were found in Jurassic sandstones of Callovian to Oxfordian age. The well tested at the rate of 21 MMscfg and 120 bopd of 42-degree API oil. The source of the hydrocarbons are Carboniferous shales and coals.

At the time it was estimated that the Dragon field had gas in place of around 120 Bcf. Marathon undertook a 3D seismic survey in 1995 and a fault block up-dip of 103/01-1 was identified as a potential large structural trap. A drilling moratorium prevented the appraisal of Dragon until 2005. The deviated well 103/01-2 was drilled in 2005 by Marathon but sadly the sands proved to lack hydrocarbons and reserves in the field were downgraded to around 50 Bcf.

In 2007 Ireland-based Providence Resources was awarded a Standard Exploration Licence covering Irish Block 51/01 and began discussions with Marathon regarding potential development of the fault block drilled by the 103/01-1 well. Marathon’s UK licence became listed as fallow and was subsequently relinquished in 2010 based on lack of commerciality. Providence submitted an out-of-round application for the block and were awarded the licence in January 2012 with its then partner Star Energy Oil & Gas Ltd. The structure of the Dragon gas field straddles the Ireland/UK median line which was attractive to the partnership. Providence subsequently relinquished the Dragon field in 2016 as it was deemed uncommercial. The field is now in open acreage and with the pending energy shortage it could be time for another company to revisit the field.

The last exploration well drilled offshore Wales was 110/13b-21. The well was drilled by BHP with Eni as a partner on the Bel Air Prospect close to the Douglas field in 2010. This well is reported to have encountered a thicker than expected Permian-aged Manchester Marl sequence comprising interbedded shale and dolomite. However hydrocarbons were absent in the well. The primary objective was Permian Collyhurst Sandstone in large fault block structure.

Today

Since 1 October 2018 Welsh Ministers are responsible for licensing the exploration and development of Wales’s onshore petroleum resources. They have a statutory duty to manage the existing petroleum licences that were issued by the UK Government before 1 October 2018. As the licensing authority Welsh Ministers are responsible for decisions on whether to issue new licences and the management of existing licences issued before 1 October 2018 in accordance with the licence model clauses.

The offshore is still the responsibility of the UK Government. Other than the area around the Douglas oil field in the Irish Sea there are no current offshore licences in Welsh waters. With proven hydrocarbons it is hoped that the open areas in the St George’s Channel Basin will attract industry interest in the future. It is hard to conclude that Dragon is the only hydrocarbon accumulation in Welsh waters in the basin.

Potential plays exist in the Cardigan Bay Basin where the Lias and Carboniferous offer possible source rocks but the challenge is getting the correct configuration of source rock trap and reservoir. One such feature that may bring all these together is the Morfa Structure a rollover anticline alongside the east north-east to west south-west Bala Fault. The location is shown on Figure 1.

The potential of these two basins was demonstrated by the award of 17 blocks to Eni in the 28th Offshore Licensing Round in 2015. Eni had planned a 955 sq km 3D survey to firm up several leads named after Roman emperors and mapped to prospect status. The leads are shown in Figure 1 which are taken from an Eni relinquishment report available via the OGA’s open data site. Eni’s largest lead is designated Hadrian and covers parts of Blocks 106/2425 and 29 alongside the north-east to south-west St George’s Fault. Hadrian has Jurassic and Triassic sandstone objectives and Eni estimated its recoverable reserves at around 40 million barrels of oil and 300 Bcf of gas. However due to environmental issues the 3D survey was cancelled and Eni subsequently relinquished the blocks in 2019.

There are currently five unconventional and only one remaining onshore conventional licence which is held by UK-based Sonorex Oil & Gas Ltd. The full list of all current licences is listed below.

Table-1: Current licence holders onshore Wales.



It is worth noting that although the work programmes associated with each licence are broadly categorised as conventional/unconventional the licensee is not contractually bound to deploy any specific techniques. In practice the developer can modify plans as their understanding of the geology improves.

PEDL157 is now held until 2035 by Sonorex and it is intended to drill the Uskmouth-1 well. Sonorex acquired 28 km of new 2D regional seismic data in 2006.

The Uskmouth Prospect has a Devonian Old Red Sandstone primary objective and Silurian Wenlock sandstones offering a secondary target with charge coming from Silurian or older shales. The overlying Carboniferous will provide the seal. The exploration well will be designed to simultaneously test for hydrocarbons geothermal and Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) capabilities with a planned TD of 4000 ft. The Silurian shales also offer an unconventional target. Sonorex estimate resource size to be in the range of 200 Bcf of gas. In 2000 there were reports of gas leaking into houses in the Ringland area of Newport which perhaps offers encouragement to Sonorex of an active petroleum system.

Selling diesel at ₹20-25 a litre below cost and petrol at ₹14-18 per litre below cost as a result of a price freeze despite soaring crude rates is unsustainable an industry body representing private fuel retailers like Jio-bp and Nayara Energy has told the Oil Ministry and has sought its intervention to create a viable investment environment.

On June 10 the Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry (FIPI) which besides private fuel retailers also counts state-owned firms such as IOC BPCL and HPCL as its members wrote to the Petroleum Ministry saying losses on petrol and diesel will limit further investments in retailing business.

International crude oil and product prices have risen sharply to a decade high but state-owned fuel retailers who control 90% of the market have frozen petrol and diesel prices at rates equivalent to two-third of the cost.

This has left private fuel retailers like Jio-bp Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy and Shell to either raise prices and lose customers or to curtail sales to cut losses.

Retail selling prices for petrol and diesel were held for a record 137 days between early November 2021 and March 21 2022 despite soaring prices.

""With effect from March 22 2022 the retail selling prices were revised on 14 occasions at an average of 80 paise per litre per day leading to an overall increase of ₹10 per litre on both petrol and diesel.

""However the under-recoveries (losses) continue to be very high in a range of ₹20-25 per litre for diesel and ₹14-18 per litre for petrol"" FIPI director general Gurmeet Singh wrote.

While retail rates have been on a freeze since April 6 the price of diesel sold to bulk users like state transport undertakings increased in line with the rise in international oil prices.

""This resulted in rapid diversion of bulk diesel (direct consumers) sales to retail outlets amounting to widening of losses incurred by private fuel retailing companies"" FIPI wrote.

""We urgently seek your support in matters related to retail selling pricing of petrol and diesel as all private oil marketing companies who are making investments in the retailing sector are experiencing a difficult investment environment"" it said.

Losses it said will limit their ability to ""make further investments as well as to operate and expand their networks. The stakeholders of private fuel retailing companies namely dealers (including prospective dealers) transporters direct and indirect employees and end-consumers also inadvertently bear the impact of under-recoveries"" Singh wrote.

FIPI sought the ministry's intervention to provide some relief to fuel retailers create a more viable investment environment for private fuel retailers and support development of the right environment and ecosystem to attract further investments and job creation in the sector.

""The continuing uncertainty around the oil and gas sector and delay in equitable policy implementation like following free market determined pricing principles providing access to infrastructure and bringing oil and gas under GST could potentially discourage foreign investors to make investments"" it said.

""With no triggers for reduction in prevailing crude and product cracks the under-recovery situation shall only aggravate for the fuel retailing companies."" Higher prices at private company outlets and some of them curtailing sales had led to heavy traffic at PSU petrol pumps in recent days leading to some of them running out of stock in states like Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Karnataka and Gujarat.

To ensure private companies don't curtail operations the government on June 17 expanded the scope of Universal Service Obligation (USO) mandating licensed entities to maintain petrol and diesel sales at all petrol pumps including in remote areas for specified working hours.

""The government has now expanded the horizon of USO by including all retail outlets (petrol pumps) including remote area ROs under their ambit"" the Oil Ministry had said in a statement on June 17.

After this entities that have been granted licences to retail petrol and diesel will be ""obligated to extend the USO to all the retail consumers at all the retail outlets."" Failure to meet norms can lead to the cancellation of licences.

The USOs include maintaining supplies of petrol and diesel throughout the specified working hours and of specified quality and quantity; making available minimum facilities as specified by the central government the statement had said.

Moreover maintaining minimum inventory levels of petrol and diesel as specified by the Centre from time to time; providing services to any person on demand within a reasonable period of time and on a non-discriminatory basis and ensuring availability of fuel to customers at reasonable prices are also part of USOs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9zZWxsaW5nLXBldHJvbC1hdC1ycy0xNC0xOC1wZXItbGl0cmUtYmVsb3ctY29zdC1wcml2YXRlLWZ1ZWwtcmV0YWlsZXJzLWNyeS1mb3VsLTExNjU1NjE4MjU1NzA3Lmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL25ld3MvaW5kaWEvc2VsbGluZy1wZXRyb2wtYXQtcnMtMTQtMTgtcGVyLWxpdHJlLWJlbG93LWNvc3QtcHJpdmF0ZS1mdWVsLXJldGFpbGVycy1jcnktZm91bC9hbXAtMTE2NTU2MTgyNTU3MDcuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Selling petrol at ₹14-18 per litre below cost: Private fuel retailers cry foul seek govt's intervention | Mint,"Private fuel retailers have sought government intervention to create a viable investment environment as they claim that they are selling petrol and diesel at losses.

The relaxed low-key setting featuring swaying palm trees and dreamy blue waters regularly filled my head throughout my childhood. Plus the island is one of the easiest in the Florida Keys to reach as its northern location in the chain means it boasts proximity to action-packed Miami.

You could easily fly into Miami International Airport (MIA) take a short 90-minute road trip south and enjoy a long weekend visit on Key Largo. The same can't be said for Key West which is roughly 100 miles farther from Miami making it a much longer haul unless you fly to Key West itself. Those routes often require a connection and cost considerably more though making Key Largo the better bet overall.

Like many tropical islands Key Largo offers its fair share of hotels and resorts. You'll have plenty of full- and limited-service options to choose from though two properties are especially popular with points-savvy beachgoers and relaxation-seekers: Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo Curio Collection by Hilton and Playa Largo Resort & Spa Autograph Collection. This duo of beachfront resorts from Hilton and Marriott offers an array of perks ideal for lounging by the water while taking advantage of elite status benefits.

So when I decided to finally book that bucket list trip to Key Largo I naturally considered Baker's Cay and Playa Largo when picking accommodations. However choosing between the two proved difficult. I couldn't bring myself to go with one over the other so I opted to split our stay and sample both properties. Although I enjoyed each resort there were noticeable differences between them making each quite distinct.

Here's a head-to-head look at Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo and Playa Largo Resort & Spa on sunny Key Largo.

First impressions and booking basics

Given their locations on idyllic Key Largo Baker's Cay and Playa Largo cater to travelers seeking an island escape. While Hilton-affiliated Baker's Cay has been around decades longer both properties offer a fresh modern take on a Florida beach resort.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Featuring 200 rooms and suites 13-acre Baker's Cay originally debuted as the Hilton Key Largo in 1985.

However it reinvented itself when it reopened in 2018 after a multiyear closure. Now part of Hilton's Curio Collection the property pays homage to its history as a pineapple plantation owned by captain Ben Baker through its name and use of pineapples throughout.

As you may expect the reimagined resort offers a mix of old and new. Numerous areas appear chic and contemporary while other spaces feature decor and architectural details common in the 1980s. You don't have to be a renovation expert to quickly gauge how much time effort and money went into the refurbishment.

During our Memorial Day weekend visit cash rates were around $1000 per night so we used 90000 Hilton Honors points per night to pay for our junior suite which cost the same as a standard room. It was a fantastic use of Hilton points as we netted more than 1 cent in value per point spent double what I bought them at. Another bonus: Because we paid with points the $45 nightly resort fee was waived.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

Following some development in the 1980s and early 1990s Key Largo fell into a bit of a new-construction drought until Playa Largo opened its doors in 2016.

Situated on 14 1/2 acres this sprawling Autograph Collection outpost is home to 177 rooms suites and bungalows plus a three-bedroom beach house with a private pool.

While the entire resort overlooks the beach its centerpiece is the large zero-entry pool which sits front and center and is a clear hub of activity.

Like Baker's Cay cash rates at Playa Largo were high for our travel dates because of the holiday weekend. In fact it's not uncommon to see them creep close to $1000 per night. So instead of paying around $600 for our one-night stay we used 60000 Marriott Bonvoy points to cover the cost of our two-queen balcony room. However we still had to pay the $55 nightly resort fee even though we redeemed points for our room an annoying downside to award stays at Marriott hotels.

The lobby

While it isn't the end-all-be-all of a vacation who doesn't love a nice space to start your stay or relax with a newspaper and a cup of coffee in the morning? A lobby does not make or break a hotel but it does set the tone for what you can expect during your visit. If done right it can really wow you with its design and atmosphere.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Odds are high that you will feel like you are in for quite a treat when you walk into the massive lobby at Baker's Cay. Offering floor-to-high-ceiling windows everywhere you turn the sleek space features a cool coastal vibe with modern light fixtures fresh furniture and even a fun library with a pool table. It's the perfect place to curl up in when you have some time to kill especially on days when rain showers make an appearance outside.

Playa Largo Resort's lobby had a number of highlights too. The swinging chairs were a hit with the kids and the pool and ocean views from the balcony couldn't be beaten. I also loved the complimentary welcome drink I received when we checked in.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 6 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4 5

Overall this wasn't a bad spot to start and end the trip. However there was a strong seemingly intentional scent that I wasn't fond of and the space felt surprisingly dated despite the hotel being less than 10 years old. In the end even with the included drink the lobby here couldn't live up to the modern welcoming space found down the road at Baker's Cay.

Rooms

A lobby is a passing fancy but rooms are key to a memorable stay. This is where new construction often sets itself apart from older properties.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

While being able to book a junior suite at the same award rate as a standard room was undoubtedly a major plus the property's accommodations felt older despite being renovated to look nice.

The room wasn't a bad space by any stretch but it was very narrow and a bit dark. Not to mention the pullout couch the kids used left something to be desired. The bathroom was cute but relatively cramped especially when compared to other options in the area. Perhaps the standard rooms feel a bit brighter and fresher but the junior suite certainly lacked the fresh feel I look for in a hotel room thanks in part to the layout.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

A much-appreciated contrast to the dated rooms at Baker's Cay the rooms at Playa Largo didn't just look fresh bright and airy — they felt that way when inside them.

There was plenty of counter space and outlets as well as a bathroom thoughtfully designed to be just as functional as it was beautiful. I loved the modern decor in white tan and blue hues which felt like an updated version of your stereotypical beach hotel. The comfortable beds were a welcome bonus too.

The beach

Now we're getting to the good stuff.

Although the Florida Keys are not known for their beaches as they're generally small and human-made they feature beautiful blue water that's ideal for snorkeling and diving.

While both of these resorts technically have beaches they're not quite the same as what you'll find in the 30A area near Destin and other parts of Florida.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Baker's Cay has a private beach that was very lively and popular from sunrise to sunset ... and beyond.

At first glance the beach looked fairly traditional with a gently sloping white-sand shore and mostly calm water. However there were some welcome surprises too including a few nooks with hammocks accessible via a trail that led guests away from the main beach area.

There were ample chaises though the lack of shade was a bit of a drawback. Unless you get there early and claim one of the few loungers under a tree you'll find yourself directly in the sun. Additionally there was an outdoor tiki bar serving a variety of cool drinks.

Away from the sand you can take advantage of the resort's nonmotorized water toys which the resort fee mostly covers. You can also cast a line off the property's dock with the loaner fishing equipment.

No matter what your ideal beach day looks like you'll want to make sure you come back at sunset as the view was truly breathtaking.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

A useable beach area is also available at Playa Largo but it may be a bit different than you are used to.

You can't walk from the sand directly out into the water as it is supported by a concrete wall. There are some handy stairs that you can use to easily get from dry land to water and back again but it's not a zero-entry beach where you and your toddler can sit with your legs at the edge of the water and build sandcastles.

Still the beach had a standout feature I wasn't expecting: a fire pit. I really enjoyed that area especially at sunset when it came alive as a hangout space.

Pools

In an oceanfront destination where beaches are not the main draw such as the Florida Keys you best believe there are noteworthy pools to offset that potential con.

Fortunately both Baker's Cay and Playa Largo offer pools. Unsurprisingly they're very different from each other.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

At Baker's Cay there are two waterfall grotto pools which sit back to back in a far corner of the resort. One is designed with families in mind while the other is an adults-only sanctuary.

We didn't spend any time in the pools but we did pop over to take a peek. There was some discoloring at the bottom of the main pool giving me the sense that this space was excluded from the more recent round of renovations. Considering rooms cost $1000 per night here the pools felt like a major letdown.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

Playa Largo by contrast only offered one pool but it was more in line with what I look for at a pricey beach resort.

While empty early in the morning it got quite crowded later in the day. There were lots of cabanas you could rent for a fee as well as a DJ and poolside food and beverage options. It may not be what you're looking for if you're seeking peace and quiet but its size location and beach views made it our clear favorite.

Restaurants and bars

On vacation eating out should be part of the fun. Both of these properties offered some standout moments when it came to food and beverages though one excelled over the other.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

You have your pick of a few different spots for snacks and meals at Baker's Cay.

There's Calusa the slightly more upscale option where modern American fare with a Creole-Caribbean twist is on the menu. Dishes here highlight locally sourced seafood and produce making the eatery feel right at home in the Keys.

We pretty much annihilated Calusa's Skiff seafood platter ($40) with shrimp oysters tuna tartare and smoked fish dip which felt like a decent deal overall. The Tuna Tower ($22) and complimentary bread were good enough too but we were more impressed with the Cucumber Cooler cocktail made with gin lemon juice and ginger ale ($14) and the Key lime pie ($10) which had a crumbly graham cracker crust white chocolate coconut meringue and guava glaze.

During our stay we also visited the more casual Dry Rocks establishment. The part-restaurant part-bar venue had live music and a laid-back vibe that fit perfectly with the open-air setting.

Standouts here were the breakfast pizza served on naan with fried eggs arugula and salsa ($14) the huevos rancheros ($16) and the fresco tacos ($18).

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

Dining options at Playa Largo are also plentiful. In addition to the casual outdoor bar there's Las Olas — a ceviche bar we didn't get a chance to try — plus Mediterranean-inspired La Marea and seafood-focused Sol by the Sea.

We tried La Marea for breakfast and found the standard morning fare to be solid. It was perfectly fine for a buffet breakfast though it didn't offer anything particularly noteworthy.

At night we dined at the open-air Sol by the Sea restaurant for dinner but our visit started off on the wrong foot. Despite making a reservation for a patio table for four we were seated on the sand at a table for two which was not going to work given how many of us were there and my extreme susceptibility to bugs. It took a fair amount of pushback on our part to get moved but we were ultimately accommodated.

Once we got past the seating debacle we ordered a few seafood dishes though they were OK at best. The average taste of the food wasn't worth the cost hassle or slow service.

Elite status perks

Given the properties' ties to major hotel chains they are both decent options for those with elite status. However despite the close race between the two when comparing the perks they give loyal guests one ultimately came out on top by offering a more favorable approach to hotel elite status benefits.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Hilton offers two tangible perks to those with mid-tier Hilton Gold status (which is blessedly very easy to earn).

The first isn't actually status-related but is connected to the loyalty program so I'll include it. By not charging resort fees on award stays members can save a considerable amount of money simply by using points. In the case of Baker's Cay that meant saving $45 per night which quickly added up for our multinight stay.

Additionally guests get a food and beverage credit of $36 per day (or $18 per person per day for up to two people) to apply toward any meals and drinks charged to their room. It's not the free breakfast Hilton Gold and Diamond members used to get in the U.S. so I ended up spending more on food than I used to since breakfast for four cost about $100 per day but it did help cover a couple of evening cocktails.

Playa Largo Resort & Spa

Like Baker's Cay Playa Largo offers a food and beverage benefit to guests with at least Marriott Platinum Elite status. At this property that meant complimentary breakfast and two evening cocktails during the resort's nightly sunset celebration.

Although the breakfast certificates we received technically said we could enjoy the Light Mercata breakfast for two people for free we were actually given the full breakfast for all four of us without any extra charges though we may have gotten lucky during our visit. That combined with our free pina coladas at night — which my 12-year-old and I loved (one was a mocktail of course) — probably saved us about $100 during our one-night stay.

Since the waived resort fees at Hilton properties is not a listed elite benefit I'll give the edge to Playa Largo.

Activities and amenities

If you get bored at either resort you're probably doing it wrong ... unless of course that's your goal. In that case relax away.

Should you crave a bit more action during your stay there's one resort that seemed to have more going on than the other.

Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Despite spending a lot of our time away from the property boating and snorkeling we still kept running into all kinds of fun things to do on site including nighttime outdoor movies (with free full-size candy!) morning fishing with bait late-night s'mores by the fire pit and daytime races with remote control cars.

It was really adorable seeing how many guests took part in the property's activities. The availability and participation in these events gave the resort a feeling of cohesiveness and togetherness that was not only charming but timeless.

Amenities were abundant at Playa Largo with everything from water activities to multiple indoor play spaces to a spa.

However even with our limited time at the property every member of my family that walked through the kids areas immediately wanted to walk out. During our visit they were unstaffed a bit dirty and felt a little abandoned and far from welcoming despite their bright colors.

There was a calendar of events available to guests but given the limited options we weren't that disappointed to be missing out on them during our one-night stay. Baker's Cay had many more things going on than Playa Largo.

Winner: Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo

Bottom line

There's no denying that my family and I had a great time at both resorts so don't let any nitpicking dissuade you from booking a stay at either property. If you are going for at least a long weekend you may even want to try both out like we did so you get two vacations in one.

Baker's Cay offers a fantastic selection of restaurants activities and common areas though its pools and rooms leave a lot to be desired. Conversely Playa Largo had a phenomenal pool modern accommodations and a terrific breakfast benefit but its dining options and beach were a bit underwhelming.

Regardless of which property you choose — if you limit yourself to one — be prepared for sticker shock especially if you're expecting a high-end feel when spending close to $1000 per night. To lessen the blow consider cashing in points to cover at least some of your stay. That way all that's left to worry about is which swimsuits and pairs of flip-flops to pack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGl2ZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wNi9wbGFubmluZy1hLXN1bW1lci10cmlwLWhlcmUtYXJlLXRoZS0yNS1tb3N0LXBvcHVsYXItaG90ZWwtY2hhaW5zLWluLXRoZS11cy5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGl2ZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wNi9wbGFubmluZy1hLXN1bW1lci10cmlwLWhlcmUtYXJlLXRoZS0yNS1tb3N0LXBvcHVsYXItaG90ZWwtY2hhaW5zLWluLXRoZS11cy5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Planning a summer trip? Here are the 25 most popular hotel chains in the U.S.,"STATEN ISLAND N.Y. – Two years after the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic basically shut down the business of travel the hotel and motel industry is finally starting to rebound. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint numbers are increasing daily and hospitality companies across the country are reporting near capacity bookings.

In light of those stats data journalism website Stacker analyzed figures from YouGov to rank the 25 most popular hotel chains in the U.S. The international research data and analytics group measured the fame and popularity of each chain offering a percentage-ranked list of those who have a positive opinion of the hotel brand.

Background

Young and dashing hospitality expert with years of experience garnered over the years in various roles Dami Adepoju Director of Lodging Development West Africa Marriott International holds a Bachelor of Science Accounting degree from Hunter College of the City University of New York and an MBA in International Hospitality Management from ESSEC Business School Paris France. She at a point had a stint with W Hospitality a renowned hospitality firm in the world operating from Lagos Nigeria. Adepoju has previously held senior consultant role in hospitality investment advisory supervised feasibility studies for new hotels residential commercial and mixed-use developments in over 25 African markets. She capped these various functions working also on the hotel ownership side most notably as an investment and portfolio analyst with RLJ Lodging Trust a US Hotel real estate investment trust while in 2019 she became the Director Lodging Development for West Africa Marriott International.

What was growing up like for you?

I grew up in a middle-class household in Lagos. I had a typical childhood in this regard with a close-knit family siblings active parents and plenty of relatives in our lives.

What are some of the factors that influenced your growth?

I was a voracious reader growing up and much of my personality and interests as an adult can be tied to how much I read as a child. Reading helped open my imagination extensively as a child and now it is evidenced in the way I try not to let my immediate environment or conditions limit my outlook on life.

What inspired your choice of a career in tourism sector?

My profession in hospitality is directly as a result of my first full-time job after university at Marriott International. After graduating with a Bachelor’s in Accounting I applied for an advertised ‘Staff Accountant’ role that I saw online. I was invited to Bethesda Maryland to interview for this role and subsequently accepted an offer for the role. Soon after I moved into another role in project accounting for the development team. During this time I noted great potential for more deals in Nigeria and across Africa. It was then I decided that I wanted to be in such a role that would help spearhead hotel development on the African continent. When I began to research ways to pivot into such a role I found the ideal Hospitality MBA programme at ESSEC Business School which suited my needs. This MBA was a pivotal point in my career and I have remained in the hospitality industry ever since.

Was there any special reason for settling for hospitality as your main focus?

I personally enjoy to travel and to discover new geographical locations and cultures and hospitality is a crucial aspect of the travel experience. Being in the hospitality industry allows me to combine my profession with a love of travelling and experiencing more of the world around me.

What has been your experience over the years and how would you describe your journey so far?

My experience working in the African region has been particularly fulfilling. I feel rewarded knowing that the work I am doing is helping to build and grow nascent hotel industries in many of the markets in this region.

What would you say attracted you to Marriott International?

Marriott International is a global company that is focused on growing its brand portfolio and most importantly its people. Marriott puts its people first and I wanted to be associated with a company that treats me well and also supports my career growth and ambitions.

You are presently the Director of Lodging Development in West Africa what does your role entails?

My role handles the company’s hotel development efforts in West Africa. Since our business model is asset light we partner with the investors who will build and own the hotels that we operate under our renowned brands. My job is to identify potential partnerships that will generate new management or franchise hotel agreements that add new hotels to our portfolio. I receive and source new leads negotiate agreement terms with potential partners and coordinate the in-house processes and teams involved in getting a hotel deal from initiation to signing.

How challenging is it?

It really depends on the particular deal and the macro environment that the project will eventually operate in. Various factors like the complexity of the ownership structures the negotiation of deal terms the project owner’s knowledge of the hotel industry as well as the economic political and social environment will determine how challenging it is to get a deal from origination to signing.

What are some of the things you are learning in terms of hospitality development that are of interest in the region?

Some of the considerations that go into developing a successful hotel in this region include access to patient capital choosing the right location ensuring the hotel and brand is a fit for the demand profile in the location as well as the overall economic and political stability of the market. It is perhaps relatively more challenging to align all of these factors and I find that the more successful owners are patient and thorough in understanding the business they are venturing into.

Which of the market in the region is top priority and why?

Looking specifically at the West Africa region from a growth perspective we are focusing on markets such as Nigeria Ghana Cote D’Ivoire and Senegal. These markets are home to the larger economies of the region and are seeing demand for hotel accommodation. We also continue to seek opportunities in other primary and secondary markets in the region.

How do you rate Nigerian market in the region?

Nigeria is is the largest economy in Africa and remains particularly important to Marriott International’s current operations and expansion strategy. We currently have a portfolio of eight properties and over 1500 rooms in this market. We expect to also open the Four Points by Sheraton Ikot Ekpene later this year. With major cities like Lagos and Abuja and the potential that many other secondary cities hold the opportunities are plenty and more robust than in many other markets in the region.

Lagos Marriott Hotel Ikeja was an instant success and appears to be the market leader presently what factors contributed to this?

The entrance of the new Lagos Marriott Hotel Ikeja has elevated the hotel offering in the Lagos market especially in the Ikeja area. The hotel reflects the newest global design vision for Marriott Hotels and features sophisticated and intuitively designed spaces for today’s modern traveller. It opened in May 2021 in the middle of a global pandemic and this is a great testament to the resilience of the Lagos and Nigerian hospitality market as well as the confidence of our investors. The hotel has performed above expectations so far and is expected to maintain a very positive outlook in the medium and long term. This new addition bodes well for hotel products that are developed to international standards and at the same time targeted at the right demand markets.

What is the future of Marriott business in Nigeria?

Nigeria is an important market for us because of the country’s economic growth expanding middle class and youth population. Marriott intends to keep growing our footprint in Nigeria especially given it is home to 36 state capitals. We see the opportunity for our premium brands in the major cities and also the opportunity for midscale and upscale hotel brands all over the country.

COVID-19 impacted negatively on hospitality business what is your assessment of the losses; how well is the market recovering and what are some of the things that need to be done to keep the growth traction?

COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the travel and hospitality sector around Sub – Saharan Africa and across the globe. As a business we started to see meaningful recovery in 2021. Now into 2022 we have seen global demand rebounded strongly and swiftly. COVID-19 is still impacting our business to varying degrees around the world but as global vaccination rates increase case counts decline and new COVID variants are tending to be less severe many countries have started to cautiously adopt a live with COVID policy leading to a rise in demand for all types of travel.

Looking at the Middle East and Africa region where borders have been opened since late last year first quarter performance in 2022 was stellar with RevPAR surpassing 2019 for the second quarter in a row. As a company we continue to focus on our guest experience and continue to innovate and meet their evolving needs.

What is the future of hospitality market in the continent; and what need to be done to accelerate a brighter prospect by both the public and the private operators?

The future of hospitality on the continent is linked to the economic future and to a larger extent the opportunities for growth on the continent. There is opportunity for governments in this region to create opportunities for private investors to partake in tourism development whether through public private partnerships the outright sale of assets designating tourism zones and of course putting security as a priority.

The private sector will naturally be attracted to opportunities when an enabling environment is created. Also a critical challenge that can be solved by government policy and private sector cooperation is the travel connectivity in the region and the African continent in general.

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) initiative is a great start and there needs to be more policy and action to support the movement of people and trade across the region. Once the infrastructure is available there will be increased movement of people across the region for business leisure meetings etc. which will mean increased demand for hospitality and other ancillary services.

There is also opportunity to increase capacity in training institutions for people who want to work in the hospitality industry. The supply of hotels restaurants and other hospitality establishments will continue to grow in Nigeria which will lead to opportunities for existing workforce in the industry as well as for those who have an interest in joining. So training will continue to be a key factor for the industry. It is also an effective way of carrying along significant portions of our population in education job training and employment opportunities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbi1waWN0dXJlcy1hLWxvb2stYXQtc2hlcmF0b24taG90ZWxzLWNvbXBsZXRlLWRlc2lnbi10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In pictures: A look at Sheraton Hotels' complete design transformation,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/news/in-pictures-a-look-at-sheraton-hotels-complete-design-transformation on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbi1waWN0dXJlcy1hLWxvb2stYXQtc2hlcmF0b24taG90ZWxzLWNvbXBsZXRlLWRlc2lnbi10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhybWFnYXppbmUuY28udWsvY29udGVudC9wZW9wbGUvaHJtaS0yMDIyLWpvbi1kYXdzb24tZ3JvdXAtZGlyZWN0b3Itb2YtcGVvcGxlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWxvcmUtZ3JvdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HRMI 2022: Jon Dawson group director of people development Lore Group,"Jon Dawson was appointed Lore Group’s director of people & development in September 2020 having joined the international hospitality company from Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London and One Hyde Park Residences where he was director of HR.

Cool and composed during a heroic comeback just two games from defeat Shaylee Moreno and Maya Klink delivered for Masconomet.

With a three-game comeback from a No. 1 doubles match third set filled with deuces as well as wins in the No. 2 and No. 3 singles matches the No. 4 Chieftains (20-0) overcame deficits time and again to beat No. 2 Westborough 3-2 for the program’s first state title at MIT’s duPont Tennis Courts.

“I thought I was going to die. Several times” said Masconomet head coach Kathy Farnham. “A nail-biter until the very end. They kept their composure. … They just went point by point just as I hoped.”

Tied 2-2 overall Masconomet looked like its first loss was on its way when Westborough’s Diya Bhattacharya and Anusha Vishal jumped out to a 4-1 lead in the decisive third set. But as nearly every point drew a reaction from the pair Morena and Klink quietly chipped away to tie it at 4-4.

Deuces filled each game from there but the Chieftains came through to take an exhilarating match (5-7 6-4 7-5).

“I was shaking at points” Klink said. “I was definitely getting nervous. Just hearing everyone cheering after every point helped a lot.”

Masconomet’s No. 3 singles Nina Klink beat Isabel Feldman (6-1 6-0) before Westborough’s Shruthi Nelluri defeated Kendall Skulley (7-5 6-3) in No. 1 singles and Ellie King paired with Elena Chen to win No. 2 doubles in straight sets.

All that remained for Masconomet was Teagan Skulley in No. 2 singles – who rallied to defeat Mina McLaren (3-6 6-2 6-3) – and the title-clinching No. 1 doubles team.",,,,,,

The five-year training partnership programme aims to equip young Nigerians with relevant skills across key sub-sectors in theatre and business. The initiative will form a significant part of the Terra Academy for The Arts (TAFTA) programme.

The partnership will create an e-learning platform which is expected to provide free education and access to employment opportunities to the most vulnerable youth with a major focus on women between 16 and 35 years in Lagos Ogun and Kano states.

The partnership will also provide participants with foundational training support internships and employment and financial services linkages.

Speaking on the partnership the Chief Executive Officer of Terra Kulture Bolanle Austen-Peters stated that the intervention would positively impact Nigerian youth and culture both now and in the nearest future.

She said “driving impact and creating massive visibility for the Nigerian culture and youth has always been at the core of our existence. We have leveraged our thorough understanding of arts culture and languages over the years to impact the next generation in the best way possible. We are extremely excited to partner with the Mastercard Foundation to further empower up to 65000 Nigerian youth spread across the country.”

We believe this will create employment opportunities for young creatives and make them self-reliant while facilitating national integration among students.”

The entry requirement for all students is a minimum of senior secondary school qualifications. All courses will include an introductory section and as such students do not need any prior knowledge to either register for the course or comprehend the course material.

The Play-ins of the first-ever League of Legends: Wild Rift Icons Global Championship has concluded in Singapore with all three Southeast Asian representatives qualifying for the next stage of the competition.

Thailand's Buriram United Esports (BRU) Taiwan's Flash Wolves and the Philippines' Rex Regum Qeon (RRQ) are all through to the Icons Group Stage after facing three other teams in their Play-in groups in best-of-three double-elimination matches.

BRU dominated Group D of the Play-ins winning all their games against Liberty Sentinels and Freecs to finish with a perfect 4-0 record.

The Thai squad began their Icons campaign by stomping Korean team Kwangdong Freecs in their opening match 2-0 before sweeping Brazilian team Liberty in the Winner’s Match to become Group D’s first seed. Meanwhile Liberty took Group D's second seed with a 4-3 standing.

Next to qualify was Flash Wolves from the Masters region who faced Nova Esports Game-Lord and Furious Gaming in Group A. The Taiwanese team started strong sweeping Belgian team Game-Lord 2-0 in the opening match.

However the Taiwanese team fell to Chinese team Nova Esports 0-2 in the winner’s match. Flash Wolves then denied Game-Lord of a revenge win sweeping the European team 2-0 in the Decider Match. This allowed Flash Wolves to take the second seed of Group A after Nova Esports.

Filipino team RRQ were next to qualify after they faced JD Gaming Unsold Stuff Gaming and STMN Esports in Group B. RRQ started off with a bang sweeping Japan's Unsold Stuff Gaming 2-0 in their opening match.

The Filipino team then struggled against China's JD Gaming in a nail-biter winners’ match that stretched into a three-game series.

RRQ threw a curveball Rakan mid for star mid laner Sean ""Helios"" Palisoc which allowed them to take a game off JDG.

However JDG still took the series 2-1 taking the first seed of Group B. RRQ then swept Unsold Stuff Gaming 2-0 once more in the decider match to secure their spot in the Group Stage.

Flash Wolves may have faced a sudden ADC roster change due to COVID-19 but that didn't stop them from qualifying for Groups. (Photo: Riot Games)

Last to qualify was Taiwan's Flash Wolves who faced Nova Esports Game-Lord and Furious Gaming in Group A. The Taiwanese team started strong sweeping Belgian team Game-Lord 2-0 in the opening match.

However Flash Wolves fell to Chinese team Nova Esports 0-2 in the winner’s match. The Taiwanese squad then denied Game-Lord a revenge win sweeping them 2-0 once again in the decider match.

As a result Flash Wolves took the second seed of Group A after Nova Esports and qualified for the Group Stage.

All three Southeast Asian teams along with Nova Esports JD Gaming J Team T1 and Liberty will face the top teams from all eight regions in the Icons Group Stage.

The draw results from the Group Stage are as follows:

Kieron Pollard chose the ground that brought back memories of one of the most distressing moments of his career to put his worst IPL season behind him and restate his credentials as one of the most destructive batters in the world.

It was a soupçon at best the merest hint that Pollard at 35 can still have many explosive moments in store but his 34 from 22 was essential to extend Surrey's record of eight consecutive wins and maintain their supremacy in the South Group. Hampshire buoyant after four successive victories made them work on an excellent pitch offering pace and bounce before conceding a four-wicket margin with five balls to spare.

It was at the Ageas Bowl in the T20 final 12 years ago that Pollard was struck in the eye by a short ball from Dominic Cork. His right eye was closed by the swelling and he feared serious injury even though scans in a Southampton hospital revealed nothing untoward and it was nearly a week later after his return to Trinidad when he was satisfied that his sight was unaffected.

Pollard had not played on this ground since and he seemed bent upon exacting satisfying revenge until Joe Weatherley ended his innings with a flying grab to his right at deep square leg after James Fuller had been deposited into the leg side. Pollard smoothed towards the pavilion with a philosophical nod of the head in recognition of the quality of the catch. he had left Surrey only 22 runs short with 26 balls and five wickets remaining and they reverted to an approach of minimal risk to chip them off.

Such has been Pollard's lean run that his 34 was his highest return since he made 41 against England in Barbados in January. He has been a key element in Mumbai Indians' five IPL crowns since 2010 but he finished the latest campaign with only 144 runs under his belt at an average of 14.40 and a strike rate of 107.46 - his lowest strike rate in any IPL season. With Surrey so dominant he had had little chance to change the narrative and had been limited to a few cameos keeping his game in trim with the hope of bigger things to come.

His IPL form led to Ian Bishop to suggest that Pollard had borne the weight of Mumbai Indians' failures too heavily and that he had to reinvent himself . There was not much sign of reinvention at the Ageas more a reaffirmation as he slammed the legspin of Mason Crane for successive sixes over extra cover and long-off the second of them brutally mistimed as his top hand came off the bat but he still landed the ball deep into the stands.

Fuller's fast-medium was then whipped through mid-off twice in a row with awesome power. Nathan Ellis was swatted through square leg as an irritant not worth his consideration. The familiar Pollard was by then in mode: the saunter down the pitch and the dismissive little touch of the top of his thigh pad to confirm that things were going well. Rory Burns at that point just played the supporting role of token glove puncher but he had the nous to stick around in understated fashion until the match was won. The decisive moment came with eight runs needed from seven balls at which point the Australian Ellis tried to bounce out Chris Jordan and the ball whistled for six.

Hampshire had been inserted on a pitch that initially was so quick the match might have been rescheduled for Perth. James Vince on the back of a sublime century on Friday night was dropped by Burns on 19 when he drilled Gus Atkinson to backward point but it was not overly costly: Jamie Overton's reputation is growing and the thought of a short ball on a fast pitch caused Vince to trust to the back foot and be lbw to a fullish one. The middle order faltered against Sunil Narine and Jordan the latter taking a stunning return catch to dismiss Ross Whiteley. It took Fuller's elan (39 not out from 22 balls) to post a meaningful score.

Vince unsurprisingly is leading Hampshire's recovery from a poor start to the season and lies second to Rilee Rossouw in the tournament's runs tally

Overton who hopes to make his Test debut at Headingley had a mixed afternoon. He added a second wicket when Weatherley pulled him to deep square leg but on a pitch that suited him down to the ground he did not quite assemble the hostility that might have been expected.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpdmVtZXNwb3J0LmNvbS84ODAyMzQ4Ny10ZWFtLXJvbmFsZGluaG8tdnMtdGVhbS1yb2JlcnRvLWNhcmxvcy13YXMtYW4tYWJzb2x1dGUtZ29hbC1mZXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Team Ronaldinho vs Team Roberto Carlos was an absolute goal-fest,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpdmVtZXNwb3J0LmNvbS84ODAyMzQ4Ny10ZWFtLXJvbmFsZGluaG8tdnMtdGVhbS1yb2JlcnRvLWNhcmxvcy13YXMtYW4tYWJzb2x1dGUtZ29hbC1mZXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmpwL2VuL2FydHMtY3VsdHVyZS9hcnRpY2xlXzc0Mzk5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japanese hip-hop group matches Jeddah's summer vibes,

He also campaigned on protecting the rights of parents in making decisions related to education and on making healthcare more affordable through increased transparency according to his campaign website.

Democratic candidate Dr. Jennifer McCormick the state’s former superintendent of public instruction ran uncontested in the primary and was projected as the winner shortly after polls closed in northwest Indiana according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

McCormick received her doctorate in education from Indiana State University. She is running on a platform that includes increased investment in public education protection of reproductive rights and finding unique solutions to eliminate wasteful spending while not eliminating key programs according to her campaign website.

McCormick was endorsed prior to the election by the American Federation for Teachers’ Indiana chapter the Indiana State Teachers Association and several other groups.

Braun and McCormick will face off in the general election this fall. Holcomb was unable to seek reelection due to term limits imposed in the state but won his 2020 reelection campaign decisively.

The state has not had a Democratic governor since Joe Kernan took over for Frank O’Bannon following his death in 2003.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L3N0ZWVsZXJzLXJvb2tpZS1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stc3RhcnRpbmctcmlnaHQtZ3VhcmQtMjAyNC1qYW1lcy1kYW5pZWxzLXRyYWRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

The annual letter-writing campaign is organized by the Northwestern chapters of the Society of Women Engineers the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers.

Current McCormick students write the letters in the spring and Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Ellen Worsdall the faculty advisor for SWE SHPE and NSBE mails out the letters to women Hispanic and Black engineering students over the summer.

Worsdall said 38% of McCormick class of 2026 were women and over a third were from underrepresented communities. The goal of the letters is to build community especially within underrepresented demographics in engineering Worsdall said.

McCormick freshman and SWE Mentorship Director Kayla Youhanaie said she loved receiving her letter.

“(The letter) showed me that (SWE) is very active and they care a lot about their club members” Youhanaie said. “I instantly got involved when I first got here.”

SWE hosted a letter-writing event in the Technological Institute on April 30 where colored paper and markers were provided.

“We write individual handwritten notes to every student” Youhanaie said. “We like making them feel like somebody’s thinking about them.”

On Friday SHPE also held a letter-writing event in the Ford Center where they encouraged letter-writers to include introductions to SHPE and its values as an organization give advice and make the recipient excited about coming to NU.

McCormick freshman and SHPE Mentorship Chair Gisela Martinez said she hopes to build relationships between mentors and mentees in SHPE during Fall Quarter. The letters are a first step she said.

SHPE letter-writers are encouraged to leave their contact info on the letters Martinez said in hopes that this will begin to build mentorship relationships.

“I wish to give back to my community and become a mentor even if it’s through a small thing such as a letter” Martinez said.

NSBE will be holding a letter-writing event on Friday in Ford.

Prior to receiving her letter McCormick freshmen Jocelyn Luevanos said she was nervous about going to an engineering school.

Luevanos later participated in both SWE and SHPE letter-writing events because she remembered how the letters impacted her.

“It came to my house and I was like ‘Oh my gosh I got a SWE letter’” Luevanos said. “Even though you’ve already been accepted you still don’t feel like you’re really part of the NU community. (The letter) gets you excited to go to college and helps ease some of that anxiety.”

CHICAGO (WLS) -- A third person is now facing charges after a deadly mass shooting outside a McDonald's on Chicago's Near North Side.

Chicago police said the 17-year-old turned himself in on Thursday. He is facing a felony gun charge.

Two Chicago men 21-year-old Jaylun Sanders and 20-year-old Kameron Abram were also charged after the mass shooting that left nine people shot killing two of them.

The shooting happened outside the McDonalds in the 800-block of North State Street in May according to Chicago police.

Family identified one of the victims killed as 30-year-old Antonio Wade. They said he apparently got into an argument with a woman there which quickly escalated.

2 CHARGED RELATED TO CHICAGO SHOOTING NEAR MAGNIFICENT MILE SHOPPING DISTRICT

At a press conference last month Chicago Police Supt. David Brown described how investigators were seeking a third suspect seen on surveillance footage handing a firearm to the alleged gunman.

A police street camera captured an altercation break out between two groups before the shooter opened fire into a crowd on Chicago's Near North Side. The Cook County medical examiner’s office identified the two people killed as 30-year-old Antonio Wade and 31-year-old Anthony Allen.

Among the seven others wounded were a 17-year-old boy taken to Stroger with multiple gunshot wounds a 19-year-old man taken to Northwestern in critical condition with a gunshot wound to his chest. and a 46-year-old woman shot in the leg and taken to Illinois Masonic Medical Center where she was stabilized. Four men later showed up at Northwestern Memorial Hospital with gunshot wounds.

Brown previously described how the gunman fled the area after unleashing a barrage of bullets onto the street as did individuals from the two conflicting groups. Officers gave chase following the individuals onto a CTA platform.

Brown said the shooter was apprehended and a firearm was recovered. Another person was arrested on the CTA platform after obstructing an officer making an arrest. A female member of the group was electrocuted on the rail line and was in critical condition Brown said.

One of the surviving gunshot victims identified by relatives as Parnelius Saunders was shot nine times his mother Kimberly Saunders told WLS. She said she was in the neighborhood when she heard gunshots and raced over to the McDonald’s to find her son lying there bleeding out on the sidewalk.

""And I walked up and my baby was there shot"" she told WLS. ""So I took my shirt off and I was naked and I was holding his wound and I was looking at the other two men.""

Fast food has become a staple of many people's everyday lives. It's cheap available and of course fast. But it's also got another hidden benefit: it's incredibly flexible. This doesn't just refer to how you can pick it up either. Many fast food restaurants like Burger King and Mcdonald's might let you modify your burger to your heart's content – as long as you're willing to possibly pay for any upgrades you fancy. The Golden Arches even got in on the fun giving customers a clear pathway to modding orders.

The McDonald's hacks menu didn't impress everyone because some assembly was required – customers had to order the individual components and craft the hacked sandwich themselves. The biggest mod on the menu might have been the one that tackled the Big Mac. Dubbed the Land Air and Sea it combined the iconic McDonald's burger with the McChicken and Filet-O-Fish sandwiches for what a The Washington Post contributor called a ""four-pattied beast"" and ""a muddled mess of flavors."" Of course not every change to the Big Mac has to be a monster-sized hack. One notable mod comes from comedian and actor Dax Shepard on his podcast ""Armchair Expert"" and it's unique in its own way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jdXN0b21lcnMtdmlzaXRzLXJlbWFpbi1yZWxhdGl2ZWx5LXN0ZWFkeS1hdC1tYy1kb25hbGRzLXdlbmR5cy1yZXBvcnQtZmluZHMtMjAyNjI0NTE0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Navigating inflation impact on fast food: McDonald's Wendy's Burger King,"Consumers are still heading to fast food chains — despite inflation taking a toll on their wallets.

In the month of May the cost of food away from home jumped 7.4% compared to a year ago but according to a new report from Placer.ai Americans are eating out at fast food restaurants the same amount as 2021 and at some fast food giants Americans are dining out even more.

In the report which was generated by anonymous location data from a panel of 30 million mobile devices which Placer.ai then leverages with AI and machine learning to make estimates about overall visit locations Shira Petrack Placer.ai marketing content manager found that the quick-service restaurant sector seems to be ""maintaining relatively steady visitation patterns.""

Compared to May 2021 foot traffic in May 2022 is higher at McDonald's up 21.7% and at other fast food locations including Wendy's up 5% and Burger King up 4.1%.

This spike in foot traffic comes as Americans slow down their spending. In the month of May U.S. retail sales fell 0.3% but on the fast food front deals and bargain offerings may be luring Americans in.

According to Lydia Boussour Oxford Economics Lead US Economist consumers might be trading in up-scale dining for less expensive options as they ""reshuffle"" their spending priorities to allocate ""more of their budget toward services and pricier necessities"" like gas food and shelter.

Boussour emphasized however there is ""pent-up demand for services like dining out.""

""Some consumers are more likely to trade down from pricier dining experiences to less expensive fast food options in this high inflation environment"" she told Yahoo Finance.

Despite the option grab cheaper meals on the go consumers cannot ignore the historic cost increase.

Peter Saleh of BTIG who has been covering the restaurant sector since 2008 says the sector is raising prices on menus ""substantially more than they have historically.""

On average price increases have been around 2% but in 2022 increases have been 6-8% with ""some instances even higher than that"" due to the commodities and labor inflation.

Nick Setyan of Wedbush says Chipotle (CMG) in particular is a ""unique animal"" as digital sales soar for the chain. When everyone is ""feeling the crunch"" consumers are eager to save $5 to $10 on delivery fees plus tip and so they're ordering on the app to pick up in store or at the Chipotlane.

At Chipotle (CMG) foot traffic jumped as high as 51.5 percent in the month of February compared to 2021. Placer.ai's Petrack found that orders made at the store and online ""do not need to come at the expense of each other.""

Then the truth slipped out,"Inflated idealism? SOPA Images / Getty

I want to believe.

I want to believe that technology is making the world better. Just.

I want to believe that we are all becoming more aware of the world's truths.

And I want to believe that when companies say things they really mean them.

That's why I was so so moved when McDonald's began experimenting with robot ordering at the drive-thru. Yes it looked like a perfectly awful experience but I wanted to believe that over time the robots would come to understand our accents and our quirky individualistic orders.

Not so long ago McDonald's announced it was selling its McD Tech Labs -- formerly known as Apprente -- to IBM. The company declared that IBM had more of the core abilities needed to expand robot drive-thrus to everyone and one imagined making everyone happier.

In making this sale McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski insisted that the tests the company had performed in Chicago had revealed ""substantial benefits"" to both customers and employees.

I emitted a brief hosanna. Could this really be a case of technology improving everyone's lot?

But then I drove through a recent interview at JPMorgan's 50th Annual Global Technology Media and Communications Conference.

Here was IBM's senior vice-president of global markets Rob Thomas giving his view on helping McDonald's become pre-eminent in robot ordering at the drive-thru.

He said that McDonald's had ""kind of struggled"" around ordering.

Also: Chick-fil-A is quietly making a huge customer service change (cyclists may hate it)

""We believed and we built a thesis around we could use our natural language processing technology which is very good to augment the McDonalds' technology and we're now starting to roll that out to many of their stores eventually all their stores"" said Thomas.

Ah so everyone really is going to get naturally linguistic robots? That should be interesting.

What was even more pulsating however was Thomas's next thought: ""And this is a great application of technology wage inflation and quick service restaurants.""

An application of wage inflation? Do you mean it's not so much about improving the customer experience but more about pure non-human money-making?

Ah so that's the real motivation? Fewer people want to work at McDonald's for relatively little money so voilá technology meets quick-service restaurants and squashes wage inflation.

Thomas was very much on a roll (or a bun perhaps) when he continued: ""We can do all the drive-thru ordering without requiring human intervention. Every once in a while something will kick to the human but it drives great economics to franchisees all through the power of software and through AI and creative construct.""

There's nothing like the human being kicked to as they stand perhaps all alone making burgers all night.

I wanted to believe in technology bringing substantial benefits to all. Yet the painful reality seems to be that the substantial benefits accrue to the franchisees far more than to say customers or employees.

So when you encounter one of these robots and they don't understand your more personal order just remember that they're just cheap labor. Nothing more."

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Vyjuvek is a topical gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa an inherited disorder causes painful blisters and persistent wounds.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

“Basically it’s a clothing store for your Meta avatar” Zuckerberg explained. “We already have a bunch of different free clothing … but we also wanted to create this marketplace.”

Meta which is focused on building out a centralized metaverse experience said that the creation of high-end clothing items for its avatars will allow users to better express themselves and connect with others.

“A huge part of how people express themselves is through what they wear and fashion” he said.

The first three designers to partner with Meta on the digital fashion experience include Balenciaga Thom Browne and Prada. To showcase the collections Zuckerberg’s avatar modeled different pieces.

“Balenciaga is hotter than hot” said host Eva Chen director of fashion partnerships at Instagram. “And then Prada you can do your ‘classic’ Prada or you can do the ‘Hypebeast’ Prada.”

Chen said that in addition to inviting luxury designers to create collections in the metaverse she was excited to see “a lot of brands that don’t exist physically exist in the metaverse.”

“To see the fashion work we’re doing in the metaverse with that kind of high-quality stuff is really cool” Zuckerberg said of the partnerships noting that he hopes a digital fashion marketplace will help inspire more designers to create garments they may not have been able to materialize in the physical world.

“A lof of the dream here is to make it accessible to anyone” he said.

The Meta Avatars Store will start rolling out next week in the U.S. Canada Thailand and Mexico. More brands are expected to be added to the store soon. Clothing purchased can be worn by avatars across Meta platforms including Facebook Instagram and Messenger.

A Meta spokesperson said they would be priced between $2.99 and $8.99 much less than the real outfits by those designers. Prada's Matinee ostrich leather bag for example sells for $10700.

Zuckerberg said he hoped to build the store out into an open marketplace where developers can create and sell a wide array of digital clothes.

Avatars have emerged as one way for Meta to link user identity across Facebook Instagram and its other services as it increasingly ties the platforms together and steers toward building an immersive ""metaverse"" of shared interconnected digital worlds where users can gather.

The Digital Governance and Sovereignty Chair will now publish on a regular basis the finest essays and papers written by Sciences Po students in the course of their studies.

This blogpost features the essay written by a second-year student at Sciences Po (Reims campus) as part of the course taught by Rachel Griffin and entitled ‘The Law & Politics of Social Media’.

The role of social media platforms in the current Russo-Ukrainian conflict (and its implications for our access to information)

On February 24th 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then there has been an escalation of violence and regional war. However with this war a new front appeared: social media and the Internet. In what scholars qualify as hybrid warfare information and its manipulation are a weapon and with social media increasingly used as a news source they are becoming a tool and weapon in this war.

Both parties Russia and Ukraine have used social media to advance their agenda. Russia has been mainly using social media to spread disinformation on the conflict while Ukraine has been seeking support from others mainly Western countries.

To analyse the issue of access to information it is more appropriate to focus on the most used social media platforms because the more widespread and used the platforms are the more relevant they are as information sources. This blog post will concentrate on Meta (Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp) YouTube Twitter and TikTok. Google will also be considered because even though it might not be a social media platform it is a tech company influencing our access to information and social media today and has taken certain measures that are relevant to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.

In this conflict social media have taken many measures to restrict Russian disinformation which strays from their traditional non-interference position on disinformation. By blocking access to Russian media sources social media platforms have shown their capacity to restrict information which can pose a threat if it is done for political agendas and if it hides necessary information and not just disinformation.

This situation puts forwards the question of whether the place of social media platforms in the current Russo-Ukrainian conflict highlights potential broader issues with these platforms as regards global access to information.

This subject requires analysing in more detail the measures social media platforms have taken against Russia and the threat these types of measures can pose. Potential solutions to fight these issues will also be put forward.

I. The measures social media platforms have taken against Russia



Global social media platforms such as Meta YouTube Google Twitter and TikTok have taken important measures to restrict Russian use of social media and disinformation. As they are the platforms with the largest reach their measures have impacted the highest number of people.

It is important to point out that Western social media platforms (Meta Twitter YouTube and Google) and TikTok have taken different stances on the matter. Measures common to the Western social media platforms have included downranking posts from Russian state-affiliated media. This meant removing them from recommendations on YouTube and Twitter putting them lower on the stories feed on Instagram etc. They have banned Russian state-controlled media like Russia Today and Sputnik from their platforms therefore removing access to their accounts and audiences.

Another significant measure they have taken is banning ads from and demonetising Russian state-affiliated accounts. The scope of this measure varies: Twitter has banned all ads in Russia and Ukraine YouTube and Meta have demonetised Russian state media outlets and Google has fully stopped selling ads in Russia and prohibited these media outlets from buying and selling ads via its platforms.

Focusing on more specific measures Meta has adapted its platforms’ content moderation policies to avoid “removing content from ordinary Ukrainians expressing their resistance and fury at the invading military forces which would rightly be viewed as unacceptable”. This has raised controversy as Russians have accused Meta of Russophobia claiming this allowed hate speech regarding Russians and Russian soldiers not to be censored.

Google has also banned Russia Today and Sputnik from its apps and search engine. Apple has done so as well concerning mobile apps. While they are not social media platforms they are also highly relevant to the concerns of this blog post as these measures considerably reduce access to information. Indeed these actions remove news sources from the public no matter the quality of these sources.

Twitter has also decided it will no longer recommend government accounts when the regime limits access to free information and is taking part in armed interstate conflict which seems like a measure whose scope will be broader than the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.

Finally TikTok has reacted differently. The Chinese platform has taken no official stance while the others have and has even been accused of spreading disinformation on the conflict. However it has blocked Russian state-controlled media for users in the EU and has said it will label content from state-affiliated media. However according to Vice News the Russian government has been paying TikTok influencers to post pro-Russian content. On the other hand the US government had also been meeting with TikTok influencers to brief them on spreading accurate information on the conflict.

Therefore despite the controversies around TikTok all mentioned platforms have taken measures to fight disinformation on the conflict most of them directed at Russian state-affiliated media by restricting their access or visibility on the platforms. While this is done for a widely-supported and legitimate cause today the measures put in place could be threatening if used for other purposes.

II. The potential threat of these types of measures on access to information



Indeed these measures can be threatening if misused which is something to bear in mind when looking at this conflict. Indeed before the conflict the legislation on misinformation and disinformation was much looser as was the position of platforms. This raises the question of why they suddenly reacted in this way and whether it could lay the ground for future issues.

It is important to understand the legal context on moderation and false information on social media platforms before the conflict. To do so we should distinguish misinformation and disinformation. The difference between the two is intent: disinformation is the intentional circulation of false information whereas misinformation is circulating information without knowing it is false. The current conflict mainly concerns disinformation since Russian media are knowingly circulating false information like claiming bombing victims were staged etc.

Regarding legislation there is very little regulating how social media platforms deal with both misinformation and disinformation. The 2018 EU Code of Practice on misinformation asks platforms to make voluntary efforts to regulate misinformation but is not legally binding and “voluntary efforts” is very vague. Certain states ban misinformation like France but it is very difficult to regulate as banning misinformation clashes with freedom of expression for example if someone expresses their mistaken opinion. Narrow approaches to misinformation are tricky making it difficult to adopt binding and constraining legislation on misinformation which explains the lack of laws on the topic.

The same can be said for social media platforms which historically have not made considerable efforts to moderate misinformation. In general platforms have opposed moderation meaning evaluating the posted content and removing it if it didn’t comply with laws or terms and conditions. Moderation is complicated given the amount of content on the platforms and the necessity of analysing content in context to evaluate its compliance with the rules.

This is even harder with misinformation and disinformation: it is difficult to understand whether the spread of false information is deliberate or not and false information which is initially spread deliberately can then be shared by people who mistakenly believe it is true etc. Fighting the vicious circle of false information is extremely complicated for social media platforms. In addition to the technical challenge it poses platforms tend to favour as little moderation as possible also to maintain as many users as possible.

Therefore the current measures ordered by governments and taken by social media platforms stand out from the traditional regulation on social media from both governments and platforms. Why they did so now and what it means are key factors in assessing the threat it may pose.The specificity of the conflict spurred these drastic measures. However if applied in other contexts they could be very threatening to our societies and access to information.

Indeed this shift in position from governments and platforms can most certainly be attributed to the violence of the war and therefore this position as a mobilisation against the “hybrid warfare” of Russia. Social media platforms might even see a business incentive in that they would lose users and support if they allowed such disinformation to circulate because they have not necessarily obeyed governmental regulations in such a way before.

But these actions done in another context or for political agendas can be extremely harmful. For example the US government meetings with TikTok influencers to “spread accurate information”. If this were to be done for the government’s political agenda it would be quite problematic given the audience these influencers have – usually young and easily-influenced people who would not necessarily identify the scripted dimension.

The same can be said for information in general. While platforms are blocking and downranking disinformation from Russian-affiliated media what if they started doing so for information or media outlets that simply contradict the government or other political figures? This restriction of information would not necessarily be noticed and would therefore (unconsciously) influence users’ minds making it very threatening for society. Similarly if Google starts removing sources for political reasons as it has done for Russia Today and Sputnik this can become quite problematic as it restricts our access to information with Google being the main search engine today.

Social media platforms have done so in the past in response to governmental requests and have faced backlash for it. Facebook was criticised for censoring posts critical of the Vietnamese government in 2020 and Facebook and Twitter took down posts criticising the Indian government’s coronavirus policies. While these censorship measures can be concerning if users are aware of them they can remain limited because if the platforms start censoring protests against human rights abuses they might face boycotts from users. But as the Guardian accurately puts forward complying with certain authoritarian countries’ requests is a way for platforms to avoid being banned in these countries and therefore avoid losing profits.

While platforms are blocking and downranking disinformation from Russian-affiliated media what if they started doing so for information or media outlets that simply contradict the government or other political figures? This restriction of information would not necessarily be noticed and would therefore (unconsciously) influence users’ minds making it very threatening for society. Similarly if Google starts removing sources for political reasons as it has done for Russia Today and Sputnik this can become quite problematic as it restricts our access to information with Google being the main search engine today.

Social media platforms have done so in the past in response to governmental requests and have faced backlash for it. Facebook was criticised for censoring posts critical of the Vietnamese government in 2020 and Facebook and Twitter took down posts criticising the Indian government’s coronavirus policies. While these censorship measures can be concerning if users are aware of them they can remain limited because if the platforms start censoring protests against human rights abuses they might face boycotts from users. But as the Guardian accurately puts forward complying with certain authoritarian countries’ requests is a way for platforms to avoid being banned in these countries and therefore avoid losing profits.

III. What can be done to protect access to information from abuses by social media platforms?



As shown by the examples above these censorship and access to information issues are not new but the threat is more visible with the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. But certain principles may help in moving forward and away from this threat.

An essential principle that needs to be developed more is transparency. This is important for two reasons: it enables users to exercise a certain check on tech companies and it can help users avoid being manipulated by algorithms. Indeed by being aware of the actions of tech companies and their platforms users can “control” tech companies by boycotting the platforms if they disagree with the methods. In addition by being aware of the platform’s practices such as its algorithms they can avoid being manipulated or influenced into thinking in a certain way and distance themselves from the content they see. For example there is more and more information surfacing about social media algorithms designed to be divisive and spread misinformation. The more users are aware of it the more distanced they can be from the content they see and they can even seek outside content to corroborate or add nuance to what they have read.

In addition to transparency reducing the platform monopoly is essential to reduce the threat of tech companies and their actions. Indeed the more people rely on platforms the more they are passive victims of their actions with little resources to counter them. Multiplicity of platforms can create more diverse content adapted to the different needs of users and it gives the opportunity for users to switch platforms if they are dissatisfied with one. By being less dependent on one platform they can seek diversity of content and sources elsewhere and are therefore less subject to the decisions of tech companies.

To conclude the measures taken by social media platforms in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict highlight problems concerning access to information and censorship if social media platforms start responding to governmental requests and concealing information without the user being made aware of it. Two essential points to fight this are transparency and reducing tech company monopolies to enable users to switch platforms if they are dissatisfied or seek more diversity of sources and content.

It is however important to highlight that the concerns put forward here come from a Western and liberal context. In authoritarian countries many social media platforms are banned content is censored and access to information is limited which contrasts with the focus here on countries where social media platforms respond relatively little to governmental influence and prioritise individual freedoms like freedom of expression. In addition with scandals such as Cambridge Analytica the concerns put forward are probably already existent but hopefully not as widespread.

Mexican band Grupo Firme answered that question Saturday night — and the 25000 fans in attendance at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford knew it from the first notes.

The catchy single “Ya Supérame” (“Get over me”) played a little after 8 p.m. as everyone’s wristbands (handed out at entrance gates) lit up on cue and the crowd held up their beers as the seven-lead members of the band ran up the catwalk.

Things got rowdier from there.

Members of the Tijuana band paused to take tequila shots. Folklórico dancers wearing colorful floral dresses pranced out. The cheering mass tossed everything from sombreros to T-shirts to bras onstage. The night was about a good kind of bedlam.

And history.

“Mexicans Latinos are for the first time performing at MetLife and that’s because of you” Jhonny Caz singer for Grupo Firme said in Spanish toward the end of night to the drunk and delirious crowd.

Performers sometimes get hyperbolic onstage. Caz wasn’t.

Three songs into the two-and-a-half-hour set Isael Gutiérrez CEO of Music VIP Entertainment who represents the group announced that Grupo Firme had indeed achieved the milestone — the first Mexican group to headline at MetLife Stadium.

“Everyone in Grupo Firme appreciates each and every one of you for coming out and making a long trip to enjoy tonight” Gutiérrez said Saturday as the crowd roared.

But he wasn’t done. New York City Mayor Eric Adams had officially designated June 18 “Grupo Firme Day” in New York Gutiérrez added.

“Viva Mexico! ... it’s time to unite us to show how powerful we are as Latinos” he said.

In addition to satisfying thousands of fans the Mexican band marked a nice change of pace for MetLife Stadium — one of many Garden State venues usually home to English-speaking pop rock and country headliners. The venue has taken steps toward better representing New Jersey’s exceedingly diverse population.

Anyone looking for evidence that Spanish-speaking artists merit the main stage look no further than the first Hispanic singer to headline MetLife Romeo Santos in 2019 — followed by his group Aventura which left its mark there last fall. And Grupo Firme firmly planted their flag on that same stage Saturday night.

“No other regional Mexican band has been able to sell to this capacity” Helen Strus director of marketing and communications for MetLife Stadium told NJ Advance Media after the show.

Strus noted that 25000 tickets were sold for Saturday on the 100 and 200 levels of the venue. The 300-level sections were not opened. Ticket sales hit 95% capacity she said.

While band members Jhonny Caz (singer) Abraham Hernandez (singer and songwriter) Christian Alejandro (electric bass) Jose Rodolfo (drums) Carlos Joaquín (bass) and Dylan Antonio (accordion) all left it out on the floor it was lead vocalist Eduin Caz who commanded the throng of fans throughout the night.

As “Juro por Dios” (“I swear to God”) began Eduin took the lead singing the opening lyrics: “No me vuelvo a enamorar de algien como tú” (“I’ll never again fall in love with someone like you).”

That made way to blaring trumpets and quick-paced drums. The sound quality was stellar each sultry lyric coming through clear and crisp.

The group dipped seamlessly in and out of Banda Norteño and mariachi tracks. It might hint to why the Latin-Grammy-award winning band currently has over 11 million monthly listeners on Spotify — they satisfy fans of Mexican music both young and old. Granted Saturday skewed slightly to the 30 and above crowd.

@GrupoFirme is the first Mexican group to perform @MetLifeStadium. Estamos de fiesta! Review in the am via @njdotcom pic.twitter.com/brYKpEBjp4 — Steven Rodas (@stevenrodasnj) June 19 2022

While most of the night’s lyrics were melancholy or romantic the mood was festive.

People danced in the aisles. Anyone with a sombrero either flung it onstage or held it up as they belted out the lyrics to the lovelorn “Pideme” the raunchy “En Tu Perra Vida” or the infectious “Yo Ya No Vuelvo Contigo.”

“Toxico” the group’s 2020 smash got such a great response the group sang it twice.

A “Shot Cam” encouraging attendees shown on camera to take a shot floundered somewhat — fans either didn’t have a shot handy to take were drinking something else or were caught empty-handed. Maybe hand out shots on future tours?

Not that the group itself didn’t have enough alcohol on hand. A band member tossed a fan a Michelob Ultra which he downed in seconds. Jhonny Caz paused several times to take tequila shots and at one point six of the seven performers faced off to see who could chug the quickest (Rodolfo the drummer took the crown).

The performance didn’t suffer because of it either. The seven members even began to show off — playing spin the bottle while performing one of two closing out tracks — which finished with an encore of ”El Tóxico.”

Eduin Caz took it easy with the liquor following a recent hospitalization but it was obvious the crowd had overpowered his best instincts too.

“Una mas?” (“One more?”) he said asking whether he should do another song. He motioned to Dylan Antonio who pointed off stage as if to say their time was up.

But nope Eduin tapped his mic as it approached 11 p.m. He smiled when he noticed it was still on and began to belt out “Yo Ya No Vuelvo Contigo.”

Fans embraced strangers as they re-sang the ballad while filing out onto the East Rutherford concourse and toward the parking lot.

One thing was clear: Grupo Firme didn’t have to justify Saturday why Latino groups deserve to appear on one of New Jersey’s biggest stages.

Their performance and the fans did it for them.

That’s right the “cute Beatle” turns 80 on Saturday. It’s one of those cultural milestones that bring a sharp intake of breath — has it been THAT long? — along with an appreciation of what he still has to offer.

For it has been more than a half-century now since the Beatles broke up a realization that hits you like that 1970s-era joke about young people saying “Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings?”

Like several other members of the “hope I die before I get old” generation including Bob Dylan the Rolling Stones and former Beatles mate Ringo Starr McCartney keeps working keeps sharing his music from the stage. Another 1960s icon Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys is scheduled to play at the Starlight Theatre in Kansas City on his 80th birthday Monday.

“He has a youthful exuberance that is ageless” said Bob Spitz a Beatles biographer. “There’s still some of that 21-year-old boy that shines through in all of his performances.”

It would be a cliché — and wrong — to suggest time hasn’t taken a toll. The fragility in his voice was evident while singing “Blackbird” on Thursday night at MetLife Stadium the final night of a brief US tour. He struggled for the high notes in “Here Today” his love letter to John Lennon who was robbed of a long life by an assassin’s bullet.

The skill of a sympathetic band along with the imagination and voices in the audience patches over the rough spots.

“Yeah yeah right I’ve got a birthday coming up” McCartney said scanning signs held by the audience that reminded him of the milestone. “I’m not trying to ignore it but…”

The crowd offered a spontaneous “Happy Birthday” serenade even before Jersey guy Jon Bon Jovi brought out a fistful of balloons during the encore to lead them in another verse.

That other Jersey guy Springsteen joined McCartney for the duet on “Glory Days” and a version of “I Wanna Be Your Man.” He later popped up to join the guitar duel from “Abbey Road.”

For most artists the appearance of such local royalty would be a hard-to-top moment. Most artists can’t immediately whip out “Let it Be” and “Hey Jude” to follow it.

To mark the birthday Stereogum magazine asked 80 artists to pick their favorite McCartney song and the choices were remarkable in their breadth — from the pre-Beatles 1958 cut “In Spite of All the Danger” (which McCartney performed at MetLife) to his 2016 collaboration with Rihanna and Kanye West “FourFiveSeconds” (which he didn’t).

David Crosby and Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys both chose “Eleanor Rigby.” Master showman Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips picked “Magical Mystery Tour.” Steve Earle selected “Every Night” while Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott went against type with the gentle “Little Lamb Dragonfly.” Mac DeMarco picked the “Ram” epic “The Back Seat of My Car.”

Many remarked upon the unfairness of having to pick just one.

Stereogum’s feature illustrated the varied entry points musicians of different generations have into a living breathing catalog. For example it revealed that a largely overlooked album like 1980’s “McCartney II” had a far greater impact on developing artists than its reception at the time would have foreshadowed.

On Friday McCartney’s team announced that it was packaging “McCartney II” with his other DIY albums “McCartney” of 1970 and 2020’s “McCartney III” into a boxed set that will go on sale in August.

How vast is the songbook? McCartney performed 38 songs at MetLife 20 of them Beatles songs and even managed to miss an entire decade. Remember the 1990s?

With the help of Peter Jackson who reimagined the “Get Back” sessions for last year’s television project McCartney was able to perform a virtual “duet” with Lennon singing his part of “I’ve Got a Feeling” from the Apple rooftop concert. McCartney also paid tribute to George Harrison who died in 2001 with a version of “Something” that began with Paul on a ukulele George gave him and built to a full band version.

Spitz recalled a Beatles-era film clip of Lennon telling an interviewer that he’d be flabbergasted if it lasted more than 10 years. McCartney stood next to him laughing. Lennon was right about the Beatles as a unit but not about the music.

Advanced birthday be damned the irrepressibly cheerful McCartney left with a promise when the last firework burst and he walked offstage.

The ex-Beatle turned 80 on Saturday days after finishing a brief US tour. The milestone comes the weekend before McCartney becomes Glastonbury’s oldest solo headliner when he takes to the Pyramid stage on Saturday.

On Thursday he was joined by Springsteen on stage in New Jersey and the pair celebrated with a duet of Glory Days and I Wanna Be Your Man. Springsteen popped up again later to play guitar on a medley of songs from the Abbey Road album.

Jon Bon Jovi also joined Sir Paul on stage at the same concert singing Happy Birthday to him with the help of 50000 fans.

Fellow ex-Beatle Sir Ringo Starr meanwhile sent “peace and love” to his friend and former bandmate on Twitter on Saturday posting a picture flashing a V sign for peace.

Referencing their 1968 song Birthday Starr who turned 80 in 2020 wrote: “They say it’s your birthday Saturday happy birthday Paul love you man have a great day peace and love Ringo and Barbara love love peace and love.”

Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and Beach Boys star Brian Wilson also posted photos with McCartney along with birthday wishes.

And American singer-songwriter Carole King shared a photo of the pair embracing with the caption: “Happy birthday paulmccartney. Welcome to the 80s.”

As well as fellow rock stars McCartney was congratulated by former prime minister Gordon Brown. Referencing Thursday’s gig Brown tweeted: “I think we would all like to sing Happy 80th Birthday to Paul McCartney today. My friend Jon Bon Jovi doing it in style here.”

Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) of which Sir Paul is a longstanding supporter also took the opportunity to thank him for his work saying: “We love seeing you advocate for animals and strive for ethical change! Thank you for raising awareness of the SaveCrueltyFreeCosmetics European Citizens’ Initiative.”

The list included the following sites:

Atlanta - Mercedes-Benz Stadium

Boston - Gillette Stadium (Foxboro Ma.)

Dallas - AT&T Stadium

Guadalajara - Estadio Akron

Houston - NRG Stadium

Kansas City - Arrowhead Stadium

Los Angeles - SoFi Stadium

Mexico City - Estadio Azteca

New York City - MetLife Stadium (East Rutherford N.J.)

Philadelphia - Lincoln Financial Field

San Francisco - Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara Ca.)

Seattle - Lumen Field

Toronto - BMO Field

Vancouver - BC Place

But the biggest snub was possibly D.C. which was named a site the last time the United States hosted the event back in 1994.

According to the Washington Post this is the fault of the Washington Commanders.

""There is one entity that is responsible: the Washington Commanders"" Washington Post soccer writer Steven Goff told 106.7 The Fan.

Back in 1994 the World Cup was played at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium but it is no longer used and is expected to be demolished soon.

That leaves the possibility of FedEx Field being used but with the stadium in poor condition and outside the D.C. area it was passed up for other options like Kansas City Seattle and Philadelphia all of whom were not host cities back in 1994.

The Commanders have made efforts to look for a new stadium in the DMV area but have been unsuccessful so far in their pursuit."

It wasn’t intended to inspire imitators and ultimately change the face of the Strip. It was built to obstruct the view of other casinos

The Mirage volcano wasn’t designed to be iconic.

It wasn’t intended to inspire imitators and ultimately change the face of the Strip.

It was built to obstruct the view of other casinos.

“Wherever there was a neon sign or something intrusive we blocked it” Steve Wynn told the Review-Journal in October 1989 less than a month before he opened the lush resort. “It would have been no good to design this environment then walk out and get hit in the face with the neon.”

The developer simply wasn’t a fan of the noble gas and the ubiquitous signage in which it was used. “I’m burned out on neon” Wynn said in the same interview. “I think it’s cheap.”

In a cruel twist of fate renderings of the guitar-shaped hotel that will replace the volcano at some point after Hard Rock International’s takeover of The Mirage is complete show it gleaming as though every last bit is dripping with the stuff.

When it debuted the volcano was the sort of attraction that stopped traffic. Literally. It was so unlike anything people had seen a sign warned drivers heading south on Las Vegas Boulevard: “Please drive carefully. And for your own safety try not to be distracted by the hotel on the right.”

Families. Hardened gamblers. Newlyweds. Grandparents. The volcano was for everyone and the public simply couldn’t get enough of it. With its mix of waterfalls fire and smoke the volcano was right there for anyone to see from the sidewalk for free.

“It definitely was something that changed the way people thought about what casinos were supposed to look like” says David G. Schwartz professor and gaming historian at UNLV.

Given the way crowds flocked to see it it’s little surprise that the Strip’s next three resorts — Excalibur Luxor and Treasure Island — each put their own spins on the volcano with free water-based spectacles front and center.

The early ’90s was a wild time to be a tourist in Las Vegas. If you were so inclined — and wearing comfortable shoes — you could start at Treasure Island where characters aboard a pirate vessel and a British warship waged explosive battles as many as seven times a day. After heading next door to see the volcano spit fire you could trek to Excalibur where a mechanical Merlin encountered an animatronic dragon in the hotel’s moat. If you still had the energy you could cap off your journey at Luxor with its 300000-gallon Karnak Lake and its more than 100 computer-controlled fountains.

All of that was available without venturing within a hundred feet of a casino door.

It was the era when Las Vegas began courting families with bigger and bolder ideas — and before the corporatization of the Strip which demanded ways to monetize every square inch of a property. Case in point: After an almost exactly 20-year run the last 10 of which were as the retooled “Sirens of TI” the pirate show was shuttered to make room for a CVS.

Schwartz describes the Strip before the arrival of The Mirage and its volcano as “workmanlike” and credits Wynn’s showmanship for the change.

“I think you have that idea that you can’t just give people slot machines and craps tables” he says of the years after The Mirage’s opening. “There needs to be something else. There has to be that romance that mystery that drama to lure them in.”

Wynn would expand on Luxor’s fountain show concept in 1998 with the opening of Bellagio bringing the shared influence full circle.

In a sign of just how much the Strip has changed nothing close to those attractions has opened in the quarter century since Bellagio.

The only thing that even resembles them is the Lake of Dreams with its massive animatronic singing frog and birds at Wynn Las Vegas. The hotel’s namesake made sure though that the show was tucked away inside the resort past high-end retailers including Dior Chanel and Van Cleef & Arpels.

It’s still free but viewing spots are largely limited to the upscale Overlook Lounge and Bar Parasol. You can also see it with a reservation from the patio at Lakeside with its “resort elegant attire” dress code and SW Steakhouse where Wagyu steaks sell for $75 an ounce.

Here’s a closer look at those attractions that soon will be joined by the volcano in the annals of Lost Vegas: Treasure Island

It made zero fiscal sense.

Two dozen cast members performed as many as seven times a day aboard two $12 million 90-foot ships in the $33 million village known as Buccaneer Bay.

The battle between the crews of the pirate ship Hispaniola and the British ship Britannia which sailed into view around the corner from Spring Mountain Road involved trading insults and cannon fire the latter of which was accentuated by 45-foot fireballs that generated several thousand degrees of heat.

The show was directed by David Sosna who’d been the first assistant director on movies including “The Blues Brothers” and “Coming to America” as well as the iconic video for Michael Jackson’s “Thriller.” The stunt work was overseen by Charlie Croughwell Michael J. Fox’s longtime stunt double who’d coordinated the stunt work on “Batman Returns.”

“In a movie you do stunts one at a time” Croughwell said back then. “But this is 23 separate people doing stunts all at the same time from different angles.”

Since this was a pirate-themed hotel the British lost every battle as their sailors fell or jumped overboard. They left the captain whose voice on the recorded soundtrack was provided by Treasure Island developer Steve Wynn to go down with the ship as it sank.

Despite hotel estimates that it was attracting 4.5 million visitors a year the show was retired on July 6 2003 three days before pirate fever began sweeping the world with the opening of “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.”

Whoops.

By then Treasure Island executives had seen enough families and wanted to chase the younger crowd that was flocking to the Palms and the Hard Rock Hotel. So they came up with a new show using the occasion of the hotel’s 10th anniversary on Oct. 26 2003 to debut “The Sirens of TI.” Gone was the British navy having been replaced by sexy sirens ladies whose singing voices famously lured sailors to their doom.

With artistic direction by Michael Cotten who designed Michael Jackson’s “History” and ill-fated “This Is It” tours and original songs produced by Emilio Estefan the show was directed by Kenny Ortega of “High School Musical” fame.

“It’s old Hollywood movies meet rock ’n’ roll videos” Ortega said at the time calling it “a contemporary rock pirate musical.”

The show’s overall aesthetic was a bit like the cast of Thunder From Down Under had sailed into the Spearmint Rhino.

A cabin boy named Eros was lured to The Song the rechristened pirate ship where he was held prisoner eventually leading the pirate crew of The Bull aka the former Britannia to attempt a rescue.

What followed was a gorgeous train wreck involving dance numbers explosions some light bondage and artery-clogging levels of cheese that put a whole new spin on the words “pirate booty.”

The show ended with the male and female leads going upstairs to a secluded part of the ship with “a little business to take care of.”

If that weren’t enough of a clue that the hotel had changed there was this lyric: “Are you looking for the arcade? Well it doesn’t exist anymore. You wanna know why? Because this is an adult candy store.”

Public reaction to the new show could charitably be described as “mixed.” Still it gyrated on four shows a night weather permitting until Oct. 21 2003. It never returned from a brief hiatus once it became clear that current Treasure Island owner Phil Ruffin was drastically shortening the renamed Sirens’ Cove to make room for a retail development.

The ships are still there a monument to bygone days.

The Bull though has been positioned in a way that makes it look as though it ran aground at Señor Frog’s and its crew just decided to stay.

Excalibur

It was billed as one of the largest animatronic dragons in the world. A 70-foot long three-story smoke-snorting fire-breathing monster that roamed the Excalibur moat every hour on the hour from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m.

“It took nine months to construct this beast” animation supervisor Scott Kessel said at the time. “We really wanted to make this dragon look lifelike.”

Excalibur opened June 19 1990 but the dragon — which we once described as having “hand-painted murky-green scales glowing yellow eyeballs and a blood-red smile” — didn’t arrive until 1993. It was created by AVG Technologies the company behind the “Wizard of Oz” display that opened the same year at the MGM Grand.

As for the show the dragon emerged from behind a gate and lumbered about in a manner best described as “deliberate” — somewhere between the characters at Chuck E. Cheese and those mechanical horses that used to reside in front of supermarkets. It breathed some fire and roared a bit before it began mildly bothering a robotic Merlin. Then the wizard shooed it away with some low-wattage fireworks.

Review-Journal readers voted the show “worst attraction” in the annual Best of Las Vegas polls for 2002 and 2003 then it quietly vanished leaving behind only memories — as well as Merlin’s cottage and the tracks on which the dragon maneuvered both of which are still visible in the moat.

Luxor

Resort officials clearly had some pretty lofty goals for Luxor’s fountain show.

Among the attractions that opened with the hotel and casino on Oct. 15 1993 was the River Nile boat ride that brought hotel guests to their elevators and took others on an 18-minute tour of the hotel floating by manufactured artifacts and passing through tunnels representing the Tomb of Queen Nefertari and the Temple of Isis.

Then there were the three movielike attractions collectively known as “Secrets of the Luxor Pyramid” that were overseen by Douglas Trumbull the special effects whiz who shared Oscar nominations for best visual effects for “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” “Blade Runner” and “Star Trek: The Motion Picture.”

The highest praise though was reserved for the fountains.

During the day they’d spout water out of the resort’s Karnak Lake as part of a seemingly endless array of patterns. At night lasers would shoot from the sphinx’s eyes setting in motion a process in which more lasers and Egyptian-themed imagery would be projected onto a 60-foot screen of water.

“Luxor officials ‘to a degree’ hope the light-and-water spectacle will displace The Mirage’s erupting volcano as the highest-profile attraction on the Strip” we wrote on the day of the opening attributing those hopes to Cliff Hay then Luxor’s director of rides and attractions.

The sheer variety of water shows that were possible gave the Luxor attraction an edge Hay said at the time. “(I)f you’ve seen the volcano once or twice you’ve seen it.”

Today anyone at the station to catch the tram that links Mandalay Bay and Excalibur can see the remains of Karnak Lake the fountains and any dreams of unseating the volcano.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuY2lnYXJhZmljaW9uYWRvLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FtZXJpY2Etcy1jaWdhci1mcmllbmRseS1jYXNpbm9z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's Cigar-Friendly Casinos,"Arizona

But a new report examining how the coronavirus pandemic has changed gamblers' habits says that may no longer be the case.

The report issued Friday by Las Vegas-based C3 Gaming come as several states including New Jersey Rhode Island and Pennsylvania are considering banning smoking in casinos. The research firm says its report was done independently and was not financed by any outside party.

It notes that the pandemic changed several key aspects of the casino experience including the elimination of daily housekeeping in many places closing of buffets and an end to room service -- all of which customers have gotten used to. It suggests smoking will be the next such change to be accepted.

""The pandemic altered consumer expectations and consumer behavior in virtually every industry including retail entertainment lodging dining and casino gaming. One of those changes [is] in attitudes towards smoking in casinos"" the report's three authors wrote.

""Data from multiple jurisdictions clearly indicates that banning smoking no longer causes a dramatic drop in gaming revenue"" it read. ""In fact non-smoking properties appear to be performing better than their counterparts that continue to allow smoking.""

In Arkansas the state Legislature provided an exemption from the Arkansas Clean Indoor Air Act of 2006 allowing smoking in designated sections of a casino floor.

Oaklawn in Hot Springs is smoke-free in its hotel resort casino and racetrack according to a spokesman but there is a glass-enclosed smoking area in one corner of the casino with a specialized filtration system. At Southland Casino in West Memphis no smoking is permitted within the facility with the exception of the Sports Bar & Grillwhich also houses the Betly sportsbook according to an email from a casino spokesman. The exception is pending approvals from state and local health departments according to the emailed statement.

""Saracen hosts 150000+ patrons a month with both smoking and non-smoking gaming available onsite. To compete in the hospitality space we must keep our ear to the ground to provide the experience our customers want"" Carlton Saffa the chief marketing officer at Saracen Casino Resort in Pine Bluff said in an emailed statement.

""Similarly today's economy has a renewed emphasis on employee recruiting and retention and with that in mind we are also extremely attentive to providing the workplace our staff seeks. Saracen was the biggest construction project in Arkansas in 2020 and included a multi-million dollar investment in state-of-the-art air handling systems which provide for a complete change of the air in the building every 8 minutes.""

The C3 Gaming report looks at casinos' performance in numerous states since the coronavirus pandemic hit in early 2020 and finds that ""those casinos that implemented smoking prohibitions did not experience any drop in revenues or lost market share to nearby casinos that continued to offer smoking environments.""

The authors also interviewed tribal casino executives who said profitability was starting to increase due to lower maintenance costs adding that 157 tribes were able to end smoking in their casinos ""without economic cost.""

The authors also predicted that smokers will not abandon Atlantic City casinos in droves if New Jersey bans smoking there noting that due to smoking bans in Connecticut and New York and a smoke-free policy at Rivers Casino Philadelphia gamblers from New York New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania would have only four options that offered smoking.

The report is the latest in a back-and-forth over whether there is evidence that smoking can be eliminated without harming casinos' bottom line. It also takes aim at a report commissioned in February by New Jersey's casinos predicting significant revenue and job losses if a smoking ban were implemented.

The stakes are high particularly in New Jersey where the main casino workers' union is threatening a strike in July if new contracts providing big raises are not reached before then.

Gamblers in the northeastern U.S. interviewed by The Associated Press expressed strong support for smoke-free casinos.

""Smokers will say that they aren't going to go gamble any more if they ban smoking"" said Linda Quinn of Montvale N.J. ""They said this when they made restaurants and bars non-smoking and it didn't affect them at all. I honestly believe it will not have an effect and smokers say that because they don't want the law changed.""

Erik Lovequist of Billerica Mass. quit smoking 14 years ago and has not visited Rhode Island's Twin River casino ""in a very long time due to the entire casino including much of the non-smoking area smelling like an ashtray. I'm enjoying having the entirely smoke-free Encore casino a half-hour away.""

John Bucek of Chester N.Y visits Atlantic City six times a year and quickly grew to like the absence of smoking in casinos there during the first year and a half of the pandemic.

""Now that it is back it is terrible"" he said. ""I never realized how bad it was. A lot of times it drives us out of there.""

Some gamblers who smoke however said they would seek out casinos that continued to allow them to do so.

The report notes revenue declines that followed the end of smoking in Delaware Colorado Illinois Deadwood SD. and New Orleans. But it also noted there were other economic factors that may have influenced revenue including the opening of new competition nearby. And it said those revenue declines ""tended to recover in subsequent years.""

The report found that gamblers in several markets did not flock to smoking casinos when others in the region prohibited smoking citing examples from Pennsylvania Indiana and elsewhere.

The authors conceded that ""It is an irrefutable fact that a slot machine located in a smoking area of a casino makes more money than a slot machine in a non-smoking area.""

But they also found that casinos that offer smoking do not perform better than those that allow it. It showed that the Parx Casino in Philadelphia; Empire City in Yonkers N.Y.; Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut; and Resorts World in the Queens section of New York have a slot machine win-per-day performance that is greater than those in Atlantic City over the past 12 months.

Las Vegas the nation's largest gambling market remains a bastion of casino smoking; only one resort Park MGM bans smoking completely. New Jersey allows smoking on up to 25% of the casino floor.

The Rivers Casino in Philadelphia has been smoke-free since August 2021 when general manager Justin Moore decided it was easier operationally to remain that way rather than changing policy to comply with frequently changing pandemic mandates from the city.

In April the casino adopted a policy allowing its smoking customers to use a restaurant patio to smoke avoiding the need to go through metal detectors two additional times in leaving and re-entering the casino.

The financial results have been mixed with some good months and some where revenue fell short of projections Moore said adding that inflation labor shortages and new competition nearby make it difficult to attribute revenue performance to any one factor.

The casino decided to remain smoke-free even after it could have resumed smoking in part out of the experience of operating during the pandemic.

""It was hard to tell people 'We're keeping you safe' and then allow people to blow particles into the air"" he said.

They can offer you the high-end features you want.

As new cars have gotten more advanced so has the technology offered. With more advanced and modern technology cars have gotten more expensive especially with the microchip shortage of the last year. When drivers are looking for a new car they often want those modern features but don’t want to pay higher prices. Luckily quite a few different cars are available that are friendly to your wallet while still having the advanced technology they want.

What technology do drivers want?

Drivers shopping for a new car often want advanced driver assistance technology to offer more confidence on the road. This technology is ready to provide drivers and passengers more safety to tackle more roads. These features are prepared to offer drivers more confidence and safety and make busy commutes more relaxing.

According to Cars drivers most often want technology like Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop & Go and Lane Centering Assistance. Those features were usually reserved for higher-priced cars but nowadays many lower-priced models can include these driver assistance technologies.

Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop & Go: While a relatively common feature Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop & Go helps make long highway drives more enjoyable. This feature allows the maintain a pre-desired speed and the following distance and adjust the pace with the traffic flow. It will even bring you to a stop and keep you stopped if necessary.

Lane Centering Assistance: Using cameras the car will read the road markings and the vehicle in front of you and keep your car centered in your lane. Depending on the system it can work at highway speeds and can even bring you to a stop if necessary. Make sure to keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes ahead.

What budget-friendly cars offer these features?

A few great cars will offer the two features above and many other technologies. They are also much lighter on your wallet. These specific cars all start at or below $25000 and can get a bit pricier.

MU,Micron Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvbWljcm9wbGFzdGljcy13YXRlci1maWx0ZXItcG9sbHV0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Water filters can protect us from ingesting microplastics,"Out of all the plastic that has even been produced globally less than 10 percent has been recycled. One of the biggest environmental dilemmas with this is that plastic does not decompose it only breaks down into smaller pieces that can contaminate soil and water. Small plastic particles between one micrometer and five millimeters in length are called microplastics; those smaller than one micrometer are called nanoplastics.

So far microplastics have been found in water sources like lake water groundwater and tap water and they likely contain the even tinier nanoplastics too. In fact studies have identified nanoplastics in tap water in China lake water in Switzerland and even ice samples in the Northern and Southern polar regions. However the full extent of tiny plastic contamination of drinking water sources has yet to be known because it is challenging to detect them which can make it more difficult to address the problem.

The potential health impact of small plastic particles

Microplastics were recently found in human blood and living lung tissues for the first time but their effects on human health are not yet fully understood. Ingested microplastic particles may cause an imbalance in the human gut microbiome which can play a role in the development of gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. However a direct link has yet to be established.

Regardless of any risk considerations releasing enormous amounts of non-biodegradable synthetic material into the environment—which results in micro- and nano-plastic particles—is not wise says Ralf Kägi head of the Particle Laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology.

“Nano-plastic particles may have unwanted effects on ecosystems and human health” he adds. “The smaller the particles the higher the likelihood that they can be taken up by any organism and distributed for example in the gastrointestinal tract.”

The number of nanoplastics in water sources is expected to increase in the future as plastics continue to degrade therefore drinking water treatment processes must be equipped to remove them.

Various filtration processes may help provide drinkable water without plastics

Some studies show that drinking water treatment plants can filter nanoplastics well enough. According to a study published in Science of The Total Environment a conventional drinking water treatment plant that uses sand and granular activated carbon (GAC) filters—the kind of filter that many water pitcher filters use—can remove nanoplastics by about 88.1 percent. The removal efficiency can increase to 99.4 percent if a coagulation process is also used.

Meanwhile a different study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials found that a treatment process called slow sand filtration is just as effective at retaining nanoplastic particles from water sources if not more. In this method water is treated using a thick biologically active layer called schmutzdecke that lies on top of quartz sand. The untreated water passes through the biological layer first and then the layers of sand below it.

The biologically active layer—which consists of organisms like algae bacteria and protozoans—is especially effective at retaining the vast majority of particulate materials including micro- and nano-plastic particles says Kägi who is one of the authors of the study.

Pilot-scale filtration experiments were conducted at the Zurich Water Works to compare different water treatment processes and simulate the removal of nanoplastics in a full-scale drinking water treatment plant.

In the pilot-scale slow sand filtration unit about 70 percent of the nanoplastics were retained in the first 0.1 meters of the sand bed and the retention reached 99.5 percent at 0.9 meters. Other processes were not as effective. For instance ozonation or the infusion of ozone into water does not affect the retention of nanoplastics during water treatment. Meanwhile activated carbon filtration retained only 10 percent in the first 0.9 meters of the filter.

As exciting as this news is slow sand filtration is actually a pretty old technology. It was used in the United States for the first time back in 1875. Although it gradually fell out of favor in the late 1800s due to its slow flow rate and inadequacy to treat turbid source waters it was still a promising filtration method for rural communities.

Slow sand filters are also being phased out in newly constructed water plants due to their extensive space requirements. These are then replaced by ultrafiltration a kind of membrane filtration system which uses synthetic polymer membranes to physically separate or strain substances from water like sand or algae. They are generally more expensive but the efficiency is comparable to slow sand filters and they don’t take up as much space says Kägi.

There is very limited research on the matter but the removal of micro- and nano-plastic particles using membrane-based filtration technologies appears to be more effective compared to other techniques. A 2021 study published in Water Science & Technology found that the membrane filtration method displayed a 100 percent efficiency in removing microplastics from wastewaters as demonstrated in both laboratory- and real-scale filtration results.

“Membrane filtration systems are expected to even outperform slow sand filtration systems regarding the retention of micro- and nano-plastic particles” says Kägi. Although it’s very promising that some water treatment processes can be effective at removing plastic particles from contaminated water sources the root of the problem must still be addressed. Minimizing plastic use as much as possible remains paramount in providing plastic-free potable water.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But Microsoft’s oft-forgotten Surface Duo 2 which launched back in October 2021 with a steep price tag and a laundry list of bugs and issues that made it very frustrating to use has bucked that trend. In fact the Duo 2 has improved so much that it’s now one of my favorite mobile devices even if it’s still weird and unique enough that I can’t exactly recommend it to most people.

In case you’ve forgotten the Surface Duo 2 is a folding phone with two big screens joined by a hinge. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 which takes a single tablet-sized display and folds it in half to fit in your pocket the Duo 2’s two screens make it feel more like two large phones attached together and running the same software. You can easily run two apps side by side as if you were holding two phones at the same time or you can span a single app across both screens to mimic a small tablet. Both halves of the phone are thin enough that it can fold together like a book and fit into a pocket with relative ease. Pair it with Microsoft’s Surface Slim Pen 2 and you have a portable digital notebook that can work just as well for note-taking reading an ebook or drafting an email.

When I reviewed the Surface Duo 2 last year none of its clever design or book-like features mattered. The device was effectively broken held back by software bugs that made it infuriating to type on frustrating to use and ultimately disappointing. It was a $1500 novelty that could only appeal to the most die-hard Microsoft brand stooges willing to put up with its many faults so they could have the never-launched Courier device they dreamed about over a decade ago.

The Surface Duo 2 doesn’t really work well as a phone but can be a very useful pocket computer.

But remarkably Microsoft has not given up on the Duo 2. In fact the company has consistently issued software updates on a monthly basis to address the many problems the Duo 2 had at launch. Some of these updates consisted of simple security patches and small bug fixes while others like the recent June update included more significant corrections and added new features. Crucially Microsoft has addressed the touch latency problems that were prevalent at launch and made it very difficult to type on the Duo 2’s virtual keyboard — or even navigate the interface.

Knowing that Microsoft has been attending to many of my original complaints with the Duo 2 I took advantage of a recent price cut (the phone can now be had for $1000 which is still expensive but significantly less than its launch price) and a generous trade-in offer and bought one of my own. The goal was to see if I could get a better idea of what Microsoft is trying to accomplish with this device when show-stopping bugs aren’t standing in its way.

And reader I can finally say I get it. The Duo 2 is the most unique mobile device I’ve used allowing me to do things I just can’t do with a traditional smartphone. It also does certain things such as multitasking and reading ebooks better than the Z Fold 3’s single large screen.

Reading Kindle books remains one of the best experiences on the Duo 2. Rotating the Duo 2 to portrait while both screens are open provides a large iPad Mini-size display for reading vertically scrolling articles or taking hand-written notes.

In the past month-plus I’ve used the Duo 2 for reading lots of books in the Kindle app which takes advantage of the dual screens to provide a more book-like experience than any other device. I’ve managed my inbox and calendar at the same time; I’ve edited Google Docs while keeping up with a Slack conversation. I’ve used the Slim Pen 2 to take hand-written notes in OneNote. I’ve read countless articles in my Pocket queue with the app stretched across both screens and the Duo 2 turned into a portrait orientation. I’ve watched so much video spanned across both screens that I don’t even notice the slight gap anymore. There’s something undeniably satisfying about completing a task on the Duo 2 and then folding it closed like a book and slipping it into my pocket.

It’s not even accurate to call this device a “phone” based on how I use it

The Duo 2 has not replaced my primary smartphone because I use them for different tasks: messaging calls photos smart home control music and mobile payments on my iPhone; reading multitasking note-taking and YouTube on the Duo 2. I’ve yet to actually take a call on the Duo 2 because unless you use wireless earbuds it’s horribly awkward to do so. Mostly I’ve used the Duo 2 exactly how I might use an iPad Mini except it folds in half and fits in my pocket. It’s not even accurate to call this device a “phone” based on how I use it. (Microsoft attempted to position the original Surface Duo as something other than a phone at its launch but moved away from that marketing with the Duo 2.)

Microsoft has made the Duo 2’s camera app faster and more responsive but I’ve never used it for taking photos. It’s just too awkward for taking photos and I have my iPhone for that anyway. In fact I’d prefer it if the ungainly rear hump and its camera were gone entirely and the Duo 2 maintained the sleeker lines and ability to fold flat against itself that the first Duo had.

Aside from being an awkward camera there are other things about the Duo 2’s design that make it challenging to use as a primary phone. There’s no quick way to check notifications or do something one-handed — you have to open up the device to use it. (The recent addition of third-party chat app notifications to the “hinge display” in the June update does not change this fact.) It’s a much more intentional device than slab phones that can be easily unlocked and used one-handed when you want to kill some time in line at the grocery store. Samsung’s Z Fold 3 is a much better single device to replace both a phone and a tablet simply because you can still use it when it’s folded closed.

The Duo 2’s form factor makes it difficult to protect from damage. I’ve resorted to using the Surface Pen cover bumper case and a vinyl skin but I still handle it with kid gloves (not pictured).

The Duo 2 is also far from a durable device. Though I haven’t had anything break in the month-plus I’ve been using it again it lacks both water and dust resistance so you don’t want to get it wet. Its design makes it extremely hard to put a case on and maintain the flexibility of the hinge. (I’ve resorted to Microsoft’s Surface Pen charging cover and bumper along with a Dbrand skin.) Even though it’s folded closed when I’m not using it it’s not something I’d just toss in a pocket with keys and loose change for fear something will get jammed in the hinge.

The software also has plenty of room for improvement. Aside from the Kindle app and Google Play Books the only apps that can really work well spanned across both screens are made by Microsoft even despite the fact that the Duo 2 has been on the market for eight months now. There are still times when an app or link opens on the opposite screen from what I’m expecting or a gesture to full-screen an app fails. Pen input in anything other than Microsoft’s own apps is still lousy. I don’t think I’ve ever actually used the drag-and-drop feature because it’s supported in so few apps that it’s not worth remembering it exists.

Even with the updates and bug fixes the Duo 2 is still not going to be a device for everyone

It’s possible that things will get better with the forthcoming Android 12L update which is designed to improve the experiences on folding devices like the Duo 2 and Fold 3. But I suspect that even after that update I will still use most apps on a single screen.

All of that is to say that despite the updates and bug fixes the Duo 2 is still not going to be a phone for everyone or even most people. It’s best suited as a secondary device for specific tasks much like how an iPad or tablet is secondary to your smartphone. Even with the recent price cut it’s still more expensive than an iPad or other small tablet. It’s only ideal for those who will appreciate the ability to take it on the go more places even if they are already carrying another phone in their other pocket.

Now that many of the bugs and issues with the software have been resolved the Duo 2 comes closer to fulfilling the dream of the Microsoft Courier concept from 2009.

Rumors have it that Microsoft won’t be launching a Duo 3 this year instead holding it for 2023. That would give it more time to iron out issues and avoid the bug-filled launches that plagued both the original Duo and the Duo 2. Microsoft could also address the aspects of the Duo design that make it difficult to use as a primary phone (a touchscreen on the outside would go a long way here). Perhaps it can figure out a way to attach and charge the pen without resorting to a goofy and expensive add-on case. A recent patent filing from the company imagines a Duo-like device that utilizes a single panel that can fold 360 degrees instead of two discrete screens attached by a hinge. I’m not sure what problem that would solve other than eliminating the gap between the screens when you’re watching video but it definitely would look cool.

Either way if Microsoft remains committed to the Duo form factor and continues to iterate on it I’ll be watching. The Duo 2 has gone from one of the most problematic devices I’ve reviewed to one of my favorites and I’m curious to see where Microsoft takes it next. In the meantime I’ve got another book to finish reading.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9tZ3VidW50dS5jby51ay8yMDIyLzA2L21pY3Jvc29mdC1mb3NzLWZ1bmQtZ25vbWUtcHJvamVjdNIBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9tZ3VidW50dS5jby51ay8yMDIyLzA2L21pY3Jvc29mdC1mb3NzLWZ1bmQtZ25vbWUtcHJvamVjdC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Gives $10k to GNOME for… Being Awesome Basically,"The GNOME project is set to receive a $10000 boost from Microsoft.

But let me stress (before anyone gets their underwear twisted) there aren’t any strings attached to this. Nothing’s being acquired or embraced.

Instead Microsoft employees chose GNOME to be the latest recipient of the Microsoft FOSS Fund an initiative the software giant has run for a couple of years. It set up the fund to “provide $10000 sponsorships to open source projects” as part of an effort to ‘give back’ to the communities and projects its employees rely on in their work.

That the one-time “enemy” of open source is keen to position itself as BFF with community-based software efforts Linux in particular isn’t new of course. But neither is it entirely fake.

These days Microsoft is a key member of many leading open-source organisations directly contributes to the Linux kernel and even maintains its own Linux distribution.

What is the Microsoft FOSS Fund?

Each month Microsoft lets its employees nominate open source projects used by the company but not owned by (anyone at) it. To be eligible projects need to have an OSI-approved license and a way to process the funds.

“The nomination process is open to all Microsoft employees and interns and a curation group – the “Open Source Champs” helps to get each fund’s nominees together. Some funding rounds may have a particular theme and every funding round will have from 5-20 nominated projects or so” the fund’s GitHub (what else) page explains.

At the end of the selection process there’s a vote and the winning projects gets a $10k boost typically offered as $1000 a month for 10 months.

As Senior Program Manager at Microsoft Emma Irwin revealed on Twitter the GNOME project is the latest recipient. Previous winners of the Microsoft FOSS Fund include systemd curl QEMU and OpenStreetMap.

GNOME benefitting from the Microsoft FOSS Fund is a pretty big endorsement. Not only is the project an important part of the open source landscape as we all know it but it turns out it’s an important one in the open source landscape at Microsoft too.

And even if you don’t want to give Microsoft as a hulking great corporate mass any credit on a human level it’s nice that Microsoft employees feel GNOME is deserving.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTgvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWZpbmRzLWdlbi16LWlzLXJlZGVmaW5pbmctdGhlLWlkZWEtb2Ytd29yay1odXN0bGUuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L21pY3Jvc29mdC1maW5kcy1nZW4tei1pcy1yZWRlZmluaW5nLXRoZS1pZGVhLW9mLXdvcmstaHVzdGxlLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft finds Gen Z is redefining the idea of work hustle in and outside the office,"For decades Microsoft has been associated with a traditional definition of office work long hours in front of a computer but now the corporate enterprise giant finds Gen Z entrepreneurs disrupting ideas about workplace hustle and the traditional 9-5 day. Many recent Gen Z college graduates are flipping the career paradigm and pursuing entrepreneurship rather than entering the corporate world.

""We've seen a lot of reimagination during the pandemic and a lot of digital transformation which I think really has propelled what we see as a bit of a boom in entrepreneurship"" says Travis Walter vice president of retail at Microsoft Store. Almost two-thirds (62%) of Gen Z has indicated they have started or intend to start their own business according to data from WP Engine and the Center for Generational Kinetics. Meanwhile in 2021 alone 5.4 million Americans submitted applications to start their own business according to government data.

The traditional idea of ""hustle culture"" has evolved over the years and while the grind Gen Z puts in looks slightly different than millennials it doesn't mean they're doing any less work. Instead these entrepreneurs wear multiple hats with flexible work schedules working vacations and more consideration for personal time. Nearly half of Gen Z about 48% have numerous side hustles compared to 34% of small business owners according to Microsoft's survey conducted by Wakefield Research across 1000 small business owners with less than 25 employees. Many of these businesses overlap with the rise in social media marketing. Entrepreneurs who use TikTok for their business (48%) are almost twice as likely to have multiple side hustles as those who do not (27%) according to the Microsoft data.

""I think it's important to let people work the way they need to work because then they can actually do their best work as we're seeing with entrepreneurs and Gen Z"" Walter said.

Microsoft's data shows 91% of Gen Z entrepreneurs work unconventional hours; 81% say they work on vacation compared to 62% of business owners overall.

""What do I truly want to do?"" is a question being asked more frequently according to Philip Gaskin vice president of entrepreneurship at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. ""That's some of that Gen Z energy"" he said.

Gen Z graduates are coming into the workforce during the pandemic period of ""rediscovery"" Gaskin said a reevaluation of personal and professional goals by many Americans across generations. Some people who may have been bored of their corporate jobs or felt stale at a point in life were given the time to pause and reevaluate. Many people who saw an opportunity went for it during the pandemic often with new technology ideas. The boom in new business formation isn't uniformly a rosy scenario. In some cases it is a function of necessity according to Kauffman's analysis with people who lost their jobs needing new forms of income.

This shift is correlated with a rate of new entrepreneurs that has been growing for several years with 2020 showing the highest spike of all according to Kauffman Foundation data. And it has big implications for the labor market. ""Most jobs created over the last five years were provided by firms less than five years old"" Gaskin said.

Gen-Z is also leaning more towards the entrepreneurship path rather than getting involved in corporate America right out of college because many see it as a way to fast-track their retirement. About 61% of Gen Z small business owners believe they will be able to retire faster than if they had gotten a corporate job compared to 40% of all small business owners who hold this view according to the Microsoft survey. Among the broader small business community amassing retirement savings through investment vehicles has historically been a challenge and much of their income directly reinvested in the business which has provided reason for concern about financial security among entrepreneurs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvcGF5LWZvci1taWNyb3NvZnQtZGVmZW5kZXItYW50aXZpcnVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do you have to pay for Microsoft's Defender Antivirus?,"A confusing announcement has lead some to wonder: Do I have to pay for this now?

If you've ever rocked with a Microsoft operating system at any point in your life you're probably familiar with Microsoft Defender Antivirus. It's been with the OS since the early 90's when it was called Microsoft Anti-Virus for MS-DOS and it's always been free.

However with the recent announcement of Microsoft Defender for Individuals many are wondering: Do I have to pay for this now?

As Neil Rubenking at PCMag.com reports the short answer is no not really. Microsoft Defender for Individuals is only available as part of a paid subscription to the Microsoft 365 cloud-based office service and strictly protects non-Windows devices. For Mac and Android (but not iOS) you can pay a small subscription fee to use Microsoft's antivirus software.

Workers sometimes have to service a data center’s electrical equipment while it’s being energized. And they can become exposed to chemicals like chlorine which is used as a sterilizing agent for the water circulated through liquid cooling systems for computers and servers. In June 2015 five people had to be taken to a hospital after a chlorine gas leak at an Apple data center in Maiden North Carolina.

Data centers are safer than they used to be. But in search of forward-looking solutions some tech giants say that they’re exploring how AI can be applied to prevent safety issues. For example Microsoft is developing an AI system that analyzes data from a range of sources and generates alerts for data center construction and operations teams to “prevent or mitigate the impact of safety incidents.” A complementary but related system also under development attempts to detect and predict impacts to data center construction schedules.

“These initiatives are both in early testing phases and are expected to begin expanding into our production environments later this year” a Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch via email.

Meta also claims to be investigating ways AI can anticipate how its data centers will operate under “extreme environmental conditions” that might lead to unsafe work environments. The company says that it has been developing physical models to simulate extreme conditions and introducing this data to the AI models responsible for optimizing power consumption cooling and airflow across its servers.

“We have significant operational data from our data centers in some areas at high frequency with built-in sensors in servers racks and in our data halls” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Each server and network device taking on different workloads will consume different amounts of power generate different amounts of heat and make different amounts of airflow in the data centers. Our [infrastructure] team collects all the data from each server and then develops AI models which can allocate our servers and racks in the data centers and send workloads into these servers to optimize [for] performance and efficiency.”

Of course companies have motivations aside from safety to ensure data centers remain in peak condition. Outages are expensive — and are becoming more frequent. According to a 2020 survey by the IT Uptime Institute an IT consulting firm a third of data center owners and operators admitted to experiencing a major outage over the past 12 months. One in six claimed that their outage cost them more than $1 million — up from one in ten in 2019.

Meta has more than 20 data centers in operation around the world including new projects in Texas and Missouri estimated to cost $1.6 billion combined. Microsoft meanwhile manages more than 200 data centers and says it’s on pace to build between 50 to 100 new data centers each year for the foreseeable future.

AI also promises to find opportunities for energy — and therefore cost — savings in the data centers that normally fly under the radar another appealing aspect for corporations. In 2018 Google claimed that AI systems developed by its DeepMind affiliate were able to deliver energy savings of 30% on average compared to its data centers’ historical energy usage.

When reached for comment DeepMind said that it had no updates to share beyond the initial announcement. IBM and Amazon didn’t respond to inquiries. But both Meta and Microsoft say they’re now using AI for similar energy-tuning purposes.

Microsoft launched AI “anomaly detection methods” in late 2021 to gauge and mitigate unusual power and water usage events within the data center using telemetry data from electrical and mechanical devices. The company is also using AI-based approaches to identify and fix issues with power meters in the data center and to identify ideal spots to place servers in order to minimize wasted power network and cooling capacity.

Meta for its part says that it has been leveraging reinforcement learning to reduce the amount of air it pumps into data centers for cooling purposes. (At a high level reinforcement learning is a type of AI system that learns to solve a problem by trial and error.) Most of the company’s data centers use outdoor air and evaporative cooling systems making optimizing airflow a high priority.

The reduced environmental footprint is an added benefit of energy-regulating AI systems. Data centers consumed about 1% of the global electricity demand and contributed to 0.3% of all carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 according to a report from the Environmental Investigation Agency. And the typical data center uses 3 million to 5 million gallons of water per day the same amount of water as a city of 30000 to 50000 people.

Microsoft has previously said that it plans to have all of its data centers running on 100% renewable energy by 2025. Meta claimed to have achieved the feat in 2020."

COVID-19 vaccines for kids as young as 6 month old could be available next week.

First the CDC has to give a final signoff.

Many experts are already expressing a preference for one brand but both are good options.

Little kids toddlers and babies as young as 6 months old will likely be lining up for COVID-19 vaccines in pharmacies doctor's offices and vaccine clinics across the US in just a few more days.

The Food and Drug Administration gave its vote of confidence for shots from Moderna and Pfizer to start going into little arms on Friday. The move still requires a final signoff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this weekend but the White House is already planning for vaccinations to start ""as early as the week of June 20.""

Because there are two different brands being offered with different formulations dose schedules and side effects parents are already weighing which shot is best for them and their children.

""Both are great options"" ER doctor Jeremy Faust wrote in his Inside Medicine newsletter expressing confidence in both Pfizer and Moderna.

However Faust along with public health expert Katelyn Jetelina and prominent parenting author Emily Oster have all decided that Moderna is the top pick for their own young kids.

Their reasoning boils down to the fact that according to early data Moderna's shot appears to pack a bigger immune punch and it does the job faster. While short-term side effects are slightly worse with Moderna than with Pfizer Moderna kids appear to gain protection against COVID in a matter of weeks not months.

Faster protection with Moderna

Moderna's vaccine for babies and toddlers includes a bigger dose of mRNA than Pfizer's which may be part of the reason why FDA data suggests Moderna's shot prompts faster protection with fewer shots.

""The three-dose Pfizer series takes nearly 90 days to go into effect"" Faust said. ""Moderna's two-dose series is considered effective by day 42. That means Moderna recipients get protection much sooner.""

Faust even created his own model chart forecasting COVID-19 illnesses in little kids based on insights gleaned from the clinical trials. His model shows Moderna kids achieving some protection against COVID-19 illnesses about a month and a half before Pfizer kids do. But keep in mind that these are estimates based on the available data we have so far:

Inside Medicine

According to FDA data sets little kids who received Moderna in the company's clinical trials begin receiving some protection against COVID illnesses shortly after their second dose (administered at 30 days).

Kids under 5 who got Pfizer's vaccine didn't see much of a benefit kick in until they received their third dose which means it took almost three months for them to achieve meaningful protection against symptomatic COVID.

Based on the FDA breakdowns it looks like toddlers over 2 years old gain some immune protection a little faster than babies do both with Pfizer and with Moderna. But generally speaking it's about a month to a month and a half for Moderna versus three months for Pfizer.







""Parents should feel comfortable getting either one of these vaccines"" Dr. Peter Marks who runs the FDA's vaccine division said on Friday during a call with reporters.

""It may be that the Moderna vaccine brings an immune response slightly more rapidly"" he said. ""On the other hand the three dose Pfizer regimen may also bring a greater immune response after the third dose.""

Pfizer's 80% efficacy appears better than Moderna's — but Faust is skeptical about it

Pfizer said its three-shot vaccine was around 80% effective during trials. But this is a preliminary number based on only 10 COVID cases observed over the course of 40 days.

Moderna's roughly 40% to 50% vaccine efficacy estimate for kids 6 months to 6 years old includes more kids and a longer follow-up period of around 70 days.

Faust speculated that Pfizer's high effectiveness numbers might've been indicative of a ""honeymoon phase"" for the vaccine where the three jabs initially provide outstanding protection against infection. While public health experts agree that 80% figure may fade Faust is confident that protection against ""serious outcomes"" like hospitalization and death will ""hold up over time.""

""Infections were starting to occur in a few Pfizer recipients just at the end of the assessment period"" he said. ""It's likely that with a few more weeks of data Pfizer's efficacy might have dropped some leading to numbers closer to Moderna's.""

Some parents might prefer Pfizer's milder side effects

Because Pfizer's vaccine is a much smaller less potent mRNA dose than Moderna's it appears to come with easier side effects in the days after vaccination. The main ones for babies are irritability and drowsiness.

For toddlers and pre-schoolers arm pain was far more common for Moderna-takers than for those who got Pfizer.

""Pfizer also might be especially attractive to parents of children who have already had COVID"" Faust said since those kids may already have some immune protection.

Bottom line: there isn't a 'wrong' choice

Parents should be comforted to know that whatever vaccine they choose for their children is a good one.

""The correct answer here is: whatever vaccine your healthcare provider pediatrician has that's what I would give my child"" Marks said.

Vaccines help prevent long COVID and while they aren't flawless at stamping out infections they still slow the spread of disease through communities by reducing the amount of time people are infectious and by preventing some disease especially (and importantly) the severe kind.

""It's nice for parents of young children to have two options in the fight against COVID-19 instead of none"" Faust said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxncmVlbnNib290c2FsbGlhbmNlLmNvbS9uZXdzLW1lZGlhL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzLzIwMjIvd2FsZ3JlZW5zLW5vdy1wcm92aWRpbmctcGZpemVyLWFuZC1tb2Rlcm5hLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmVzLXRvLWNoaWxkcmVuLWFnZXMtMy1hbmQtb2xkZXItYXQtc2VsZWN0LWxvY2F0aW9ucy1uYXRpb253aWRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walgreens Now Providing Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 Vaccines to Children Ages 3 and Older at Select Locations ...,"DEERFIELD Ill.

Walgreens Expertise in Pediatric Immunizations

In 2020 the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) expanded the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act authorizing licensed pharmacists to administer recommended vaccinations to children aged 3 and older. In that time Walgreens has significant experience in administering recommended vaccinations to millions of children and adolescents for COVID and flu vaccines as well as other immunizations.

Walgreens pharmacy team members are among the most trusted health resources readily available to administer vaccines and provide education to this newly eligible population and their parents or guardians. Pharmacists receive extensive training and assessments to ensure they can properly educate individuals about COVID-19 vaccines and administer them and are frequently updated on the latest CDC guidelines which Walgreens continues to follow closely throughout the pandemic.

Children ages 6 months to 5 years are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. With this authorization parents of young children may have questions about the vaccine and what to expect after.

Here Dr. Vivi Tran a CHOC pediatrician answers parents’ common questions about the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 5 years.

Can kids younger than 5 years receive the COVID-19 vaccine?

Yes. Children ages 6 months to 4 years are now authorized to receive the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer). Pfizer’s vaccine has already been approved for kids in the age groups ages 5 to 11 years and 12 to 18 years.

Children ages 6 months to 5 years are also authorized to receive the COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna. Moderna’s vaccine is now authorized for children ages 6 to 11 years teens ages 12 to 17 years and adults 18 years and older.

Upon reviewing the data from Pfizer and Moderna’s clinical trial the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given emergency use authorization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the vaccine be administered to children under 5 years.

Why did the vaccine approval for kids under 5 years take so long?

COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers needed time to conduct clinical trials to determine the safety efficacy and dosage size of the vaccine for young children. The good news is that the extended timeline gave Pfizer and Moderna the chance to ensure that their vaccine would be both effective and extraordinarily safe for children under 5 years.

Can children under 5 years get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine? Is it safe?

Yes. The Pfizer vaccine has proven to be safe for children ages 6 months to 4 years.

Pfizer’s clinical trials showed that after the two-dose vaccine the immune response for some children wasn’t as strong as desired. The third shot is crucial for Pfizer’s vaccine because two doses offered little protection.

The FDA had originally sought to fast track the first two doses in February but Pfizer postponed its submission because the data wasn’t good enough. Now the three-dose vaccine has been proven to be 80% effective at preventing illness from the omicron variant.

The Pfizer vaccine as well as the Moderna vaccine is an mRNA vaccine. When the vaccine is injected mRNA – a strip of genetic material – enters a body’s cell and prompts the cell to build copies of spike proteins. These spike proteins are the bumps that protrude from the surface of coronavirus particles. The body’s immune system then learns to spot these spike proteins and produces antibodies that block the virus from entering healthy cells in the future.

We have no reason to expect that children would tolerate the vaccine less favorably than adults would.

Can children under 5 years get the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? Is it safe?

Yes. The Moderna vaccine has proven to be safe for children ages 6 months to 5 years.

Moderna’s vaccine is administered in two doses for kids ages 6 months to 5 years. The shots are dosed at 25 micrograms which is one-fourth of what adults receive.

According to Moderna’s clinical trials the vaccine was about 51% effective at preventing illness from omicron for kids six months to 2 years and about 37% effective for kids ages 2 to 5 years.

Moderna plans to conduct further clinical trials on a third dose targeting the omicron variant in this age group over the summer and ask the FDA to review the data as soon as possible.

How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine will kids ages 0-5 years receive?

The FDA has granted emergency use authorization to administer three doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to children ages 6 months to 4 years and two doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine to children ages 6 months to 5 years.

Learn more from a CHOC expert about how to protect your family against the omicron variant.

Are the vaccine vials for children under 5 the same as for older children and adults?

No. The vials of the Pfizer vaccine for children under 5 years will contain 3 microgram doses. The vials for children ages 5 to 11 years contain 10 microgram doses and the vials for older children teens and adults contain 30 microgram doses. This means that pharmacies and doctors’ offices will have separate stocks for these populations. They won’t for example be able to draw a smaller dosage amount from an adult vial to give to a young child. They will also need to use smaller needles to administer the vaccine to younger children.

Vials of the Moderna vaccine for children 5 years and under will contain 25 microgram doses. This is one-fourth of the dose that adults receive. The vials for children 6 to 11 years contain 50 microgram doses one-half of the vials for adults. Teens ages 12 to 17 years will receive 100 microgram doses which is the same as adults.

Is the J&J Janssen COVID-19 vaccine available for children under 12?

No. The one-dose J&J Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for adults ages 18 years and older. J&J Janssen is conducting research on the vaccine’s response in younger age groups.

Is the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine available for children under 12?

No. The Moderna vaccine is only authorized and recommended for kids 6 months to 5 years. Moderna will be seeking authorization from the FDA for the vaccines for kids 6 to 11 years and 12 to 17 years.

Even with the vaccine it seems like a lot of kids are getting sick from COVID-19 variants. How can I prevent my kids from getting sick?

The best thing to do is get your young children vaccinated and surround them with people who have been fully vaccinated as well as boosted if eligible against COVID-19.

In addition keep doing what you’ve been doing all along to keep your children safe:

teach your children over age 2 how to appropriately wear a mask and wear high-quality and well-fitted masks in public spaces and when around people from outside your household;

wash hands frequently and thoroughly;

limit your activities to open spaces without crowds;

stay home when sick; and

ensure you and your children are current on all vaccines they are eligible for especially this year’s influenza vaccine.

What are the COVID-19 vaccine side effects for kids under 5?

Pfizer and Moderna state that their COVID-19 vaccine was well-tolerated by its clinical trial participants. The side effects are generally comparable to those observed in older children and adults. The most commonly reported side effects include:

Pain where the shot was given

Fatigue

Headache

Chills

Muscle pain

Fever

Joint pain

Any side effects should be relatively short-lived and ease within 24 hours. Because children have more robust immune systems it’s possible that they may feel these side effects more strongly than adults would. This is a sign that their immune system is mounting a response against the virus.

Although it is not recommended to administer an over-the-counter pain reliever to your child as a preventative measure for side effects before to their vaccine it is OK to administer an over-the-counter pain reliever following their vaccine to ease any side effects.

Why should my child under 5 receive the COVID-19 vaccine?

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reported data that since the beginning of the pandemic about 13.5 million children have been infected with COVID-19 — which is about 18% of all U.S. cases. Among states reporting children ranged from 1.3 to 4.6% of their total cumulated hospitalizations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) puts the pediatric death toll at 1257 children under 18 years in the United States representing 0.1 percent of total COVID deaths and 0.01 percent of pediatric COVID-19 cases.

Even one child death is too many. This is why we urge vigilance against COVID-19 and full vaccination once eligible. Most children who contract COVID-19 will become infected from other adult family members. So protecting yourself and providing a cocoon around our kids is one of the most successful strategies for protecting our youngest children who are unable to be vaccinated. Additionally schools and childcare centers are doing a tremendous job of ensuring these environments are safe.

Can my child receive the COVID-19 vaccine at CHOC?

Pediatricians in CHOC’s primary care network are offering the vaccine to kids under 5 years. Please call your pediatrician for an appointment.

Other community clinics may also be offering the vaccine to kids under 5 years. Visit myturn.gov to find options and make an appointment in your zipcode.

Even with vaccines all of the uncertainty from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been difficult for my family. How can we feel better?

We understand completely. More than two years into the pandemic parents around the world are burnt out after shouldering so much uncertainty decision making and sacrifices. Please keep going. You’re a superhero and you’re doing a great job.

Remember that no one can pour from an empty cup. Take time for yourself and try these practices suggested by CHOC pediatric psychologists to help prevent burnout:

Build self-care into your routine. This can be simple like making and enjoying your morning coffee; taking the dog on a walk; or paying attention to what you notice when looking out the window. Exercise consistently. Try taking a walk around the neighborhood; going on a family hike; riding bikes; taking stretch breaks; or taking the stairs. With any choice the length of time is less important than consistency. Prioritize sleep. Irritability anxiety and decreased focus are all side effects of sleep deprivation. Aim for seven to eight hours a night of sleep and be consistent with sleep and wake times. Cut yourself some slack. Reframe your goals to reduce pressure. We all need a little more grace these days. Rely on your support system. Reach out to family friends and neighbors for help when you need it. Reduce media consumption. Increased media consumption has led to increased anxiety and depression. Schedule time away from devices and news. Reflect on yourself. Get into the habit of rating how you are feeling mentally on a one-to-10 scale. Track this and make changes if you need to.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday backed Pfizer 's and Moderna 's Covid-19 shots for children as young as 6 months with vaccinations expected to begin in earnest after the holiday weekend.

The CDC's committee of independent vaccine experts voted unanimously to recommend the shots for infants through preschoolers after two days of public meetings. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky accepted the committee's recommendation and gave the final go-ahead on Saturday.

The White House has said vaccinations for children under age 5 would begin in earnest on Tuesday after the Juneteenth federal holiday. Appointment availability might be limited initially but every parent who wants to get their child vaccinated should be able to do so in the next few weeks according to Dr. Ashish Jha who oversees the Biden administration's Covid response.

The federal government has initially made 10 million vaccine doses available to its local partners. There are nearly 20 million children 6 months through 5-years-old in the U.S.

The CDC is encouraging parents to reach out to their family doctor local pharmacy health department or visit vaccines.gov to find out where the shots are available for their kids.

Nearly everyone in the U.S. is now eligible for Covid vaccination less than two years after the first shots were authorized for the elderly in December 2020.

""I am fully confident that vaccines should be recommended"" said Dr. Grace Lee chairperson of the CDC's vaccine committee. ""We can clearly prevent hospitalizations and deaths. And I believe we have the potential to prevent long-term complications of infections that we don't yet understand.""

The American Academy of Pediatrics in a statement Saturday strongly recommended that parents get their kids vaccinated and bring any questions or concerns they may have to their family doctor."

It’s one of the oldest and most popular recreational drugs and it gives people the effects of being drunk (“drunkenness”). Among other things Alcohol makes people happy and euphoric makes them less anxious more outgoing and sleepy hurts their ability to think remember move and feel and slows down their central nervous system.

Ethanol is just one type of Alcohol but it’s the only one found in alcoholic drinks and is often used for fun. Other kinds of Alcohol like methanol and isopropyl alcohol are much more dangerous. Isopropanol isn’t much more hazardous than ethanol so a mild short exposure isn’t likely to do much damage. Methanol is much more dangerous than ethanol and can kill you with as little as 10–15 millilitres (2–3 tsp).

There are both short-term and long-term problems with drinking too much alcohol. Short-term side effects include impaired neurocognitive function dizziness nausea vomiting and symptoms similar to a hangover. People who drink too much Alcohol can develop an alcohol use disorder become dependent on it and have trouble getting off it. It can hurt your health in the long run like damaging your liver and brain. It is the fifth most common cancer cause and people drink it.

The worst things that Alcohol does to your health are most noticeable when you drink too much or too often. But some of them like an increased chance of getting certain cancers can happen even with light or moderate drinking. When you drink too much you might lose consciousness or die in the worst cases.

Alcohol works in the brain primarily by making a chemical called -aminobutyric acid or GABA work better.

This is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and Alcohol slows down the activity of the central nervous system by making it work better. The substance also directly affects several other neurotransmitter systems such as glutamate glycine acetylcholine and serotonin. When you drink Alcohol dopamine and endogenous opioids in the brain reward pathways get more active. This makes you feel good. Alcohol also has harmful and unpleasant effects on the body many of which are caused by acetaldehyde which is made when Alcohol is broken down.

People have been making and drinking Alcohol for almost 10000 years because it makes them feel good.

Drinking Alcohol is socially acceptable and legal in most countries which is not the case for many other drugs used for fun. But there are often rules about the sale and use of Alcohol like a minimum age for drinking and laws against drinking in public and driving after drinking.

Alcohol is a big part of society and culture and plays critical social roles in many places worldwide. Most drinking places like bars and nightclubs are primarily about selling and drinking alcoholic drinks and people often drink alcohol at parties festivals and other social events.

Alcohol is the only drug that hurts other people more than it hurts the person who takes it. It is linked to many societal problems like drunk driving accidents sexual assaults domestic violence and violent crime. In many countries especially in the Middle East it is still against the law to sell or drink alcohol. Some religions like Islam don’t let people drink Alcohol but others like Christianity and Shinto use Alcohol in ceremonies and rituals.

Alcoholic drinks like beer wine and spirits which contain ethanol are usually drunk for recreation. It is often used in social settings because it makes people more friendly.

Blood alcohol content (BAC) the weight of ethanol per unit volume of blood is often used to measure how much ethanol is in the body. In general small amounts of ethanol act like stimulants and cause euphoria and relaxation. People who experience these effects tend to become talkative and less shy and may make bad decisions.

However at higher doses (BAC > one g/L) ethanol acts as a central nervous system depressant causing impaired sensory and motor function slowed thinking stupor unconsciousness and even death at higher doses. Because it makes people feel good ethanol is often used as a recreational drug especially when people are out with friends.

Standard drink

There is no one standard but a standard drink of 10g of Alcohol which is used as an example on the WHO AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) questionnaire form has been adopted by more countries than any other amount. Ten grams is equivalent to 12.7 millilitres.

Toxicity

There are both short-term and long-term problems with drinking too much Alcohol. It also has terrible effects that come from reinforcement such as addiction dependence and withdrawal.

Many bad things happen because of Alcohol.

It is often linked to drinking in public having trouble keeping social distance passive drinking drunk dialling drunk driving sexual risk-taking or drug-facilitated sexual assault (especially with caffeinated alcoholic drinks) and both violent and nonviolent crime.

About one-third of arrests in the US are because of drinking too much. A lot of trips to the emergency room also involve drinking. Up to 15% of employees act in evil ways because of Alcohol at work like drinking before going to work or even drinking on the job. Heavy drinking is linked to being more likely to get hurt have problems with your partner and get violent at home. Alcohol use is directly linked to many sicknesses and death like overdoses and health problems caused by drinking.

Bad effects

1. Central nervous system impairment

Alcohol depresses the central nervous system as a whole. It is a positive allosteric GABAA modulator linked to cognitive motor sensory and memory problems. It slows down and hurts thinking reaction time and cognitive skills.

It also hurts judgment interferes with motor function causes motor incoordination loss of balance confusion sedation numbness and slurred speech. It also hurts the formation of memories and impairs the senses. A lot of ethanol in the blood can cause forgetfulness pain relief spins stupor and even unconsciousness.

At very high concentrations Alcohol can cause anterograde amnesia a prolonged heart rate pulmonary aspiration positional alcohol nystagmus (PAN) slowed breathing shock coma and even death. This is because an overdose of Alcohol can severely slow down the central nervous system leading to dysautonomia and death.

2. Effects on the intestines

If you drink enough alcohol it can make you feel sick and make you throw up (varies by person).

Even when there is no food in the stomach Alcohol makes the stomach make more gastric juice. The stomach makes more acidic secretions usually used to break down protein molecules. As a result the extra acidity could hurt the stomach’s lining. A layer of mucus usually protects the lining of the stomach. This layer keeps the stomach from in a sense digesting itself. But this mucosal layer breaks down in people with peptic ulcer disease (PUD). People often link PUD to the bacteria H. pylori.

H. pylori make a toxin that weakens the mucosal wall making it easier for acid and protein enzymes to get through. Since Alcohol causes the stomach to make more acid a person with PUD shouldn’t drink on an empty stomach.

When you drink Alcohol more acid is made which hurts the already weak stomach wall even more. If this disease worsens it could cause burning pain in the abdomen bloating and in worst cases dark black stools which are a sign of internal bleeding. People who drink Alcohol often are strongly encouraged to drink less to prevent PUD from worsening.

Alcohol can cause systemic pro-inflammatory changes through two intestinal pathways:

Changing the composition of the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) which causes more lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to be released and

Breaking down the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier makes it easier for LPS to get into the bloodstream. The portal vein supplies the liver with most of the blood it needs. So the liver is always getting nutrients from the intestine but it is also exposed to any bacteria or bacterial products that get past the mucosal barrier of the intestine.

So when you drink Alcohol LPS levels go up in the portal vein liver and systemic circulation. In addition immune cells in the liver make reactive oxygen species (ROS) leukotrienes chemokines and cytokines in response to LPS. These things cause tissue inflammation and lead to organ disease.

Drinks with ethanol in them can cause alcohol flush reactions worsening of rhinitis and more seriously and more often bronchoconstriction in people with a history of asthma. They can also cause urticarial skin eruptions and systemic dermatitis in some cases. These reactions can happen 1–60 minutes after drinking ethanol and they can be caused by:

Genetic flaws in how ethanol is broken down can cause the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde to build up in tissues and cause histamine to be released or allergic reactions to allergens that are naturally present in or contaminate alcoholic drinks (especially wine and beer) or some other unknown cause.

The long-term results

1. Brain damage

Wernicke’s encephalopathy and Alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome (AKS) which often happen together can damage the brain. This is called Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (WKS).

Lesions or abnormalities in the brain are usually found in the diencephalon and cause both forward and backward amnesia or memory loss.

Liver damage

NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is changed into reduced NAD when Alcohol is broken down by its dehydrogenases. Typically the liver uses NAD to break down fats so Alcohol has to compete with fats to use NAD. When someone drinks Alcohol for a long time fats build up in the liver giving rise to the term “fatty liver.” When people keep drinking their hepatocytes die because the fat stores in the cell make it so it can’t do its job. This can happen when someone has an alcohol use disorder. These cells are then replaced by scar tissue which is what causes the disease called cirrhosis.

Let’s talk about the Top 10 Alcohol Producing Countries

Chinese archaeologists think that the first beer was made in China between 7000 and 9000 years ago and that rice was used as a grain. However using barley and hops to make beer in a modern way didn’t start until the early 1900s. As a result China makes more beer than any other country in the world.

Every year the beer made in China goes up by about 3–5%. Seven big brewery groups now control most of the Chinese beer market. Most of these groups have teamed up with big foreign brewers to better access new techniques and markets. In 2020 China made 341.1 million beer hectoliters about 286 million barrels.

2. The United States of America

It’s no secret that people in the United States love beer. Americans who were old enough to drink legally drank 26 gallons of beer per person in 2020. A.B. InBev and Molson Coors make most of the beer in the United States. A.B. InBev makes Budweiser and Corona and Molson Coors makes Blue Moon Coors Light and Miller Lite.

Craft beer is also very popular in the United States and over the last ten years the number of craft breweries has grown by a factor of ten. In 2020 Americans made more than 177 million barrels of beer or 211166000 hectoliters.

3. Brazil

The beer industry is becoming more and more important to the Brazilian economy. In 2019 the Brazilian Ministry for Livestock Farming and Supply made the Sectorial Chamber for Beer to help the industry. Because our world is becoming more globalized Brazilians have been able to try new brands and tastes of beer from around the world.

This has helped the country’s beer production industry skyrocket. In 1999 there were only 33 microbreweries in Brazil. By 2019 there were 1209 of them. Brazil made 151.9 million hectoliters of beer in 2020 which is more than 127 million barrels.

4. Mexico

People say that in 1544 the first beer was made in Mexico. Today the beer industry in Mexico is one of the most important economic factors. It makes up just under 30 per cent of the total gross production in the beverage sector.

Also Mexico is the largest exporter of beer in the world and almost half of all the beer made there is sent to other countries. In 2020 the country made more than 106 million barrels of beer or 126.9 million hectoliters.

5. Germany

Germany is the leader in beer production in the European Union and has been for many years. It has one of the oldest brewing cultures in the world that has never stopped. So it’s no surprise that German beers are so well-known since events like Oktoberfest and Springfest bring millions of beer lovers worldwide to Germany every year.

Today Germany makes more than 20% of all the beer in the E.U. Pilsner and wheat beers are Germany’s most popular types of beer. In 2020 Germany made 87027000 hectoliters of beer which is just a little less than 73 million barrels.

6. Russia

After vodka beer is the second most popular drink in Russia. Many Russians drink beer during the summer sporting events and barbeques. In Russia beer is grouped differently than in the U.S. Instead of putting beers into groups based on their types like pilsner wheat beer or lager Russians put beers into groups based on their colour: light red semi-dark or dark. The country made more than 66 million barrels of beer or 79.5 million hectoliters of beer.

7. Japan

Beer didn’t become popular in Japan until the late 1800s when an American opened The Japan Brewery in Yokohama to sell mostly to business travellers from other countries. During the rest of the 1800s more Japanese-owned breweries opened and by the turn of the century Japan was making a lot of its beer. Today craft beers and happo-shu a low-malt beer popular in Japan are both parts of the country’s beer culture.

Happo-shu is only made in Japan because it has a low amount of malt (usually 25 per cent or less) which is a big part of how much it costs. Taxes on beer in Japan are about $2.50 per litre making a regular six-pack cost more than $15. But happo-shu can have up to 65% malt before it is reclassified as beer. As a result it is much cheaper with a six-pack costing about $8. Japan made more than 46 million hectoliters of beer in 2020 the same as making more than 39 million barrels.

8. Vietnam

Beer is the second most popular alcoholic drink in Vietnam according to a survey by the Institute of Population and Social Affairs. From 2005 to 2019 the average amount of beer made in Vietnam has increased almost three times. Sabeco and Habeco are two of the biggest beer makers in Vietnam.

Together they make up more than half of the beer industry’s market share and are the leaders in both the cheap and mid-range segments. In 2020 the country made 40 million hectoliters or more than 33 million barrels of beer.

9. Poland

Poland is the second-largest producer of beer in the European Union. It makes up 12% of all the beer made in the E.U. “Poland has gone through a beer revolution” says Bartomiej Moryzycki director of the Union of Brewing Industry Employers Browary Polskie. “It went from being a vodka country to a beer country.”

There are now more than 310 breweries in the United States and the industry supports more than 9000 jobs across the country. In 2020 Poles made more than 38 million hectoliters more than 32 million barrels of beer.

10. Spain

Archaeologists from the University of Barcelona found traces of malt and beer still stuck to grinding stones in a cave in Begues Barcelona. This shows that beer was made in Spain a long time ago. A rise in interest in craft beer is a major factor in Spain’s beer industry. Spain is the fourth-largest craft beer producer in the European Union after Germany the United Kingdom and Poland.

Also Spain’s success in the beer industry may be because more than 90% of all beers drunk in Spain are made there. This makes it harder and harder for foreign companies to break into the Spanish market. In 2020 the country made more than 34.7 million hectoliters or about 29 million barrels of beer.",,,,,,,,,,,,
MDLZ,Mondelez International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL3Nocmlua2ZsYXRpb24taXMtcmVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Shrinkflation’ is real,"AP – It’s the inflation you’re not supposed to see.

From toilet paper to yogurt and coffee to corn chips manufacturers are quietly shrinking package sizes without lowering prices.

It’s dubbed “shrinkflation” and it’s accelerating worldwide.

In the United States (US) a small box of Kleenex now has 60 tissues; a few months ago it had 65. Chobani Flips yogurts have shrunk from 5.3 ounces to 4.5 ounces. In the United Kingdom (UK) Nestle slimmed down its Nescafe Azera Americano coffee tins from 100 grammes to 90 grammes. In India a bar of Vim dish soap has shrunk from 155 grammes to 135 grammes.

Shrinkflation isn’t new experts say. But it proliferates in times of high inflation as companies grapple with rising costs for ingredients packaging labour and transportation. Global consumer price inflation was up an estimated seven per cent in May a pace that will likely continue through September according to S&P Global.

“It comes in waves. We happen to be in a tidal wave at the moment because of inflation” said consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts Edgar Dworsky who has documented shrinkflation on his Consumer World website for decades.

Dworsky began noticing smaller boxes in the cereal aisle last fall and shrinkflation has ballooned from there. He can cite dozens of examples from Cottonelle Ultra Clean Care toilet paper which has shrunk from 340 sheets per roll to 312 to Folgers coffee which downsized its 51-ounce container to 43.5 ounces but still says it will make up to 400 cups.

Dworsky said shrinkflation appeals to manufacturers because they know customers will notice price increases but won’t keep track of net weights or small details like the number of sheets on a roll of toilet paper. Companies can also employ tricks to draw attention away from downsizing like marking smaller packages with bright new labels that draw shoppers’ eyes.

That’s what Fritos did. Bags of Fritos Scoops marked “Party Size” used to be 18 ounces; some are still on sale at a grocery chain in Texas. But almost every other big chain is now advertising “Party Size” Fritos Scoops that are 15.5 ounces – and more expensive.

PepsiCo didn’t respond when asked about Fritos. But it did acknowledge the shrinking of Gatorade bottles. The company recently began phasing out 32-ounce bottles in favour of 28-ounce ones which are tapered in the middle to make it easier to hold them. The changeover has been in the works for years and isn’t related to the current economic climate PepsiCo said. But it didn’t respond when asked why the 28-ounce version is more expensive.

Likewise Kimberly-Clark – which makes both Cottonelle and Kleenex – didn’t respond to requests for comment on the reduced package sizes. Proctor & Gamble Co didn’t respond when asked about Pantene Pro-V Curl Perfection conditioner which downsized from 12 fluid ounces to 10.4 fluid ounces but still costs USD3.99.

Earth’s Best Organic Sunny Day Snack Bars went from eight bars per box to seven but the price listed at multiple stores remains USD3.69. Hain Celestial Group the brand’s owner didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

Some companies are straightforward about the changes. In Japan snack maker Calbee Inc announced 10 per cent weight reductions – and 10 per cent price increases – for many of its products in May including veggie chips and crispy edamame. The company blamed a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials.

Domino’s Pizza announced in January it was shrinking the size of its 10-piece chicken wings to eight pieces for the same USD7.99 carryout price. Domino’s cited the rising cost of chicken.

In India “down-switching” – another term for shrinkflation – is mostly done in rural areas where people are poorer and more price sensitive said head of corporate communications for Dabur India Byas Anand a consumer care and food business. In cities companies simply jack up prices.

“My company has been doing it openly for ages” Anand said.

Some customers who have noticed the downsizing are sharing examples on social media. Others said shrinkflation is causing them to change their shopping habits.

Alex Aspacher does a lot of the grocery shopping and meal planning for his family of four in Haskins Ohio. He noticed when the one-pound package of sliced Swiss cheese he used to buy shrank to 12 ounces but kept its USD9.99 price tag. Now he hunts for deals or buys a block of cheese and slices it himself.

Aspacher said he knew prices would rise when he started reading about higher wages for grocery workers. But the speed of the change – and the shrinking packages – have surprised him.

“I was prepared for it to a degree but there hasn’t been a limit to it so far” Aspacher said. “I hope we find that ceiling pretty soon.”

Sometimes the trend can reverse. As inflation eases competition might force manufacturers to lower their prices or reintroduce larger packages. But Dworsky said once a product has gotten smaller it often stays that way. “Upsizing is kind of rare” he said.

Professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University’s WP Carey School of Business Hitendra Chaturvedi said he has no doubt many companies are struggling with labour shortages and higher raw material costs.

But in some cases companies’ profits – or sales minus the cost of doing business – are also increasing exponentially and Chaturvedi finds that troubling.

He points to Mondelez International which took some heat this spring for shrinking the size of its Cadbury Dairy Milk bar in the UK without lowering the price.

The company’s operating income climbed 21 per cent in 2021 but fell 15 per cent in the first quarter as cost pressures grew.

By comparison PepsiCo’s operating profit climbed 11 per cent in 2021 and 128 per cent in the first quarter.

“I’m not saying they’re profiteering but it smells like it” Chaturvedi said. “Are we using supply constraints as a weapon to make more money?”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's no secret that Warren Buffett is one of the best investors alive delivering investors returns of 20% compounded annually since becoming chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965.

Numerous factors can explain Buffett's success and an important one is his love of dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are a great source of returns in the market and according to Fidelity have accounted for 40% of the S&P 500's total returns since 1930. When inflation is high as it was in the 1940s and 1970s dividend stocks accounted for as much as 71% of the market's returns.

Dividend-paying companies tend to have strong businesses that generate consistent cash flows making them stellar long-term investments. Here are three Buffett stocks that net the Oracle of Omaha high dividend yields relative to what Berkshire Hathaway paid for the stock.

1. Moody's: 27.9% yield relative to cost basis

Moody's (MCO 1.62%) provides credit ratings to companies across the globe and is an essential player in the fixed-income market. The credit ratings business has huge barriers to entry making it difficult for new companies to enter the space. As a result a few companies dominate the industry with Moody's and S&P Global as the leaders with a 40% market share each.

Last year Moody's benefited as $2.3 trillion in corporate debt was issued a record amount. Moody's gains from low interest rates which encourage businesses to issue more debt as they expand.

Rising interest rates will put a damper on this business which saw revenue decline 20% in the first quarter compared with the previous year. Management at Moody's expects its ratings business revenue growth to decline to the low-double digit percentages but sees revenue from its analytics business increasing in the high teens. In the first quarter analytics business revenue increased 23% marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth from the segment.

Moody's is a longtime holding of Berkshire's which has an ultra-low average cost of about $10 per share giving it an impressive 27.9% dividend yield relative to its cost basis.

2. Bank of America: 5.9% yield relative to cost basis

Bank of America (BAC 0.40%) provides banking services across the globe and is the second-largest bank in the U.S. with $2 trillion in deposits behind only JPMorgan Chase. It's also Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest holding.

The Federal Reserve is aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation which can benefit bank stocks. Banks traditionally make money from net interest income the difference between interest paid on deposits and interest collected from loans.

The Federal Reserve recently raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.75% as it tries to reel in inflation. The benchmark interest rate now sits between 1.5% and 1.75% and will continue to rise through the year as Fed officials forecast the rate to be around 3.4% by year-end.

One factor investors must consider is that if interest rates rise too quickly they could stifle consumer demand which could lead to reduced economic growth and slower loan growth for banks.

While there are fears of a recession on the horizon Bank of America is well positioned to benefit from rising interest rates in the long run which is why Buffett likes the stock so much. In its March 31 filing Bank of America noted that a 1% increase in interest rates would cause net interest income to grow by $5.4 billion or a 12% increase from 2021.

Berkshire Hathaway has an average cost of $14.17 on its Bank of America stock giving it a 5.9% dividend yield relative to its cost basis.

3. U.S. Bancorp: 4.9% yield relative to cost basis

U.S. Bancorp (USB -0.57%) provides banking services through its 2200 branches across the Midwest and West regions of the U.S. and is one of Berkshire Hathaway's top 10 largest holdings.

The bank also benefits from rising interest rates more than other banks because it doesn't have an investment banking division to boost earnings. Instead it focuses on traditional banking activities of lending money and growing deposits.

U.S. Bancorp is laser-focused on increasing loans and is selective about the loans it is willing to make concentrating only on high-quality credits. As a result the bank has a return on equity (ROE) that has outpaced its banking peers for years.

Last year the bank sacrificed short-term profits so that it could have the financial flexibility to take advantage of higher interest rates this year and beyond. The bank's net interest income grew by 3.6% in the first quarter. In its March 31 filing it projected a 2% increase in interest rates would increase its net interest income by another 3.3%.

Berkshire Hathaway has an average cost of $37.51 in U.S. Bancorp stock giving it a 4.9% dividend yield relative to its cost basis.",,,,,,,,,,,,
MS,Morgan Stanley,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzA3NWMwMWQzLWUzZTAtNGYyNC1hMTg5LTRhZGUxMzFhZmYxNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Technology providers push direct indexing into the mainstream,"Print this page

Investment firms are racing to provide access to direct indexing (DI) — a way of creating bespoke indices for individual clients — as demand rises for portfolios that are more personalised and tax efficient.

DI was previously restricted to affluent clients and their wealth managers due to the higher costs involved. But recently developments in technology have brought customisable indices to a broader customer base. Firms are rushing in acquiring new fintech partners and building out their DI offerings.

“There is a bit of a race on at the moment” says Daniel Needham president of wealth management at Morningstar. The index group purchased direct-indexing specialist Moorgate Benchmarks in September following in the footsteps of other industry titans such as Vanguard BlackRock and Morgan Stanley.

DI allows investors to tailor portfolios around their specific investment interests choosing to include or exclude specific stocks as well as weighting holdings according to their preferences. For example they could specify environmental social and governance (ESG) credentials — or value or momentum investing strategies.

But demand for DI is also being driven by its use as a tax tool. In the US DI can deliver tax benefits as it allows investors to reduce their tax liabilities through tax-loss harvesting: selling stocks that are losing value and matching the loss against gains to reduce capital gains tax due on other investments.

“There is going to be an increase in demand for these services . . . Being able to personalise a portfolio at scale for an individual is pretty compelling — especially as people begin to express their personal values in their portfolios” Needham says.

Around 20 per cent of retail investor accounts are held in DI products according to research by Cerulli Associates. And the market share taken by customisable products is predicted to grow with estimates suggesting they will account for more than 8 per cent of all assets under management by 2030.

As a result there has been a land grab among large traditional managers to find partners who can help provide direct indexing solutions to clients.

BlackRock acquired Aperio in November 2020 while JP Asset management picked up OpenInvest in June 2021 in order to provide more customisable ESG offerings. Vanguard made its first acquisition in its history when it bought Just Invest in July 2021 a wealth management boutique that offers DI customisation.

DI’s assets under management have been growing rapidly in recent years according to research by Morgan Stanley. In 2020 around $3.5bn was managed through DI. That figure is expected to grow an average of 34 per cent per year for the next five years to $1.5tn from wealth manager demand alone.

A 2022 survey by the CFA Institute found DI was the most popular customisation tool among investors who had financial advisers with 56 per cent saying they were interested in utilising them.

And customisation is in high demand. Eighty-two per cent of those surveyed said they were interested in increasing the personalisation of their investment products.

DI is particularly valuable in high-value portfolios invested across alternative solutions such as hedge funds private equity and less liquid alternatives.

“In any of those instances if the primary goal is to deliver alpha or outperformance at the end of the day tax isn’t the primary consideration” says Stephanie Pierce chief executive of investment provider Dreyfus Mellon as well as exchange traded funds at BNY Mellon Investment Management. Investment losses can also be carried over from one year to the next to offset gains.

“If you know you're going to have potential capital gains it’s nice to have something working for you all year that is designed to give you same return as market but also gives you tax offsets at the overall portfolio level” she adds.

But DIY shops are pushing in as well as retail brokers have raced to offer solutions to investors. In April America’s largest retail brokerage Charles Schwab launched a DI product for customers as part of a tax management offering. The broker built its own DI solution rather than partner with a provider. Another US brokerage Fidelity this year added 12000 new jobs it said as part of a push to expand into new areas such as DI.

Interest in DI has been catalysed by recent market performance. “We have gone through a decade long bull market in equities so you have a large number of individuals who have made investments over time and may hold funds that have made substantial gains” notes David Botset head of equity product management at Charles Schwab. “They can see the potential impact that taxes will have and that has them increasingly looking for tax advantage opportunities in their accounts.”

In a choppy or falling market investment losses create more opportunities for offsetting these large gains.

Dropping trading commissions also helped to make DI possible for more investors than just ultra-high net worth individuals Botset adds.

“An industry that has historically been focused on pre-tax returns has started focusing on: what do these taxes mean and the implications” says Liz Michaels co-head of longtime player Aperio which was acquired by BlackRock in February.

But despite the hype around the offering advisers say that DI is not for everyone.

“It’s the new thing but it doesn’t mean that the old thing — exchange traded funds — aren’t the right answer for many many people” Michaels says. “Tax loss harvesting only makes sense if you have capital gains elsewhere in your portfolio. It is a tremendously powerful tool for the people who need it but it’s more complex than people realise.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9iYW5raW5nLzIwMjIvaHNiYy1lZ3lwdC1vZmZlcnMtZmluYW5jaW5nLW9wdGlvbnMtZm9yLWdyZWVuLXB1cmNoYXNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HSBC Egypt: Financing Options for Green Purchases,"HSBC Egypt has debuted a green personal finance program for Egyptian customers a press release says helping the bank support clients working towards a goal of a zero carbon future.

The company offers an interest rate discount on standard personal finance products and flexible repayment periods.

HSBC Green Personal Finance will help with buying electric vehicles or solar panels for homes or other such things.

The release says HSBC wants to lead a transition to a “global net-zero economy” and will provide around $750 billion to $1 trillion toward sustainable financing and investments by 2030.

“We all have a role to play in climate action and HSBC is mobilizing finance to support our customers’ transitions to net zero providing competitively priced green finance to support the sustainability choices of our customers” said Nesreen Hafez Head of Wealth and Personal Banking at HSBC Egypt.

Hafez added that there was an ambitious plan to “unlock finance solutions that can support our customers in their energy transition” adding that the finance products were intended to support a sustainable lifestyle including the Egyptian government’s goal towards renewables making up 42% of the country’s energy mix by 2035.

HSBC also recently said it planned to go more into web3 through building a virtual stadium called The Sandbox a blockchain-based metaverse to “engage and connect with sports eSports and gaming enthusiasts.”

Avalanche goalie handling Tampa Bay Lightning and critics like a Stanley Cup champ.,"First the eye then the naughty bits. At one point Corey Perry tried to dislodge his stick from Darcy Kuemper’s groin area the way you’d use a crowbar to remove rotting wood from a porch.

“He just likes to get to the net” Kuemper the Avalanche goaltender said of Perry the Lightning pest who later nose-dived into Kuemper’s midsection during Colorado’s 7-0 curb-stomping in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Final on Saturday night. “That’s how he plays.”

Did you think it was some sort of gamesmanship on Perry’s part?

“I don’t know” Kuemper replied. “Just try to get out there as best as I can.”

So… how do you keep your composure … or …

“They’ve got guys and that’s how they play. It is what it is.”

With that Kuemper sort of shrugged. The way he’s shrugged off everything thrown at him — sticks pucks stats historical precedent pithy one-liners — during his historic playoff run.

Mea culpa Darcy. Apparently you can win a Stanley Cup with Kuemper between the pipes for the same reason you could win a Super Bowl with Trent Dilfer or Brad Johnson as your quarterback.

If the unit on the other side of the field — or ice in this case — is that stinking good that completely utterly dominant just don’t screw it up. The rest will take care of itself.

The Avs’ offense was their best defense Saturday night proving once again that it’s awfully hard for Kuemper to get you beat if three-quarters of the action is unfolding some 150-200 feet in front of his crease.

Nathan MacKinnon Gabe Landeskog Mikko Rantanen Cale Makar Valeri Nichushkin Andre Burakovsky and Darren Helm are scoring for fun right now line after line wave after wave. Colorado is the first NHL team in 37 years to record at least four outings of seven goals or more in a single postseason making it the greatest offensive tsunami to crash the Cup since Wayne Gretzky Jari Kurri and Mark Messier carried the flag for the 1985 Edmonton Oilers.

“They’re playing at an elite level right now” shell-shocked Lightning coach Jon Cooper said after his side lugged an 0-2 series deficit with them back to Florida for Game 3 Monday night. “Give (the Avs) credit.”

Let’s give Kuemper some credit too while we’re at it. Yes Saskatoon’s finest had enough time during Game 2 to catch up on episodes of “Stranger Things” on his side of the rink while his teammates were badgering Tampa netminder Andrei Vasilevskiy on the other.

But a goose egg is a goose egg and Mount Darcy stopped all 16 of the Lightning’s shots however infrequent that came his way. It was the first shutout in a Stanley Cup Final by a Colorado goaltender since Patrick Roy did it during Game 6 of that 2001 title scrap with the New Jersey Devils.

In franchise history Kuemper now joins Roy as the only Avs netminders to ever hang a clean sheet in a Cup Final — although Roy had to do a lot more heavy lifting granted turning away 24 shots (Game 6 ’01) 25 shots (Game 1 ’01) and a whopping 63 shots (Game 4 ’96) respectively.

“I thought he was poised” Avs vet Andrew Cogliano said of Kuemper. “It was just one of those nights where you knew that when a shot was going he was square and he was making the save.

“They had a couple pushes in the second (period) and some chances on the power play but he seemed very tall and very positional.”

Yet Kuemper was never bigger than the times when Perry was either in his face or at his hip gooning it up baiting prodding punching pushing or yanking. Looking to start something.

“I think this time of year you’re just trying to do different things to throw guys off their game” Helm explained. “And that might have been one of their ways.

“We’ve just got to (forget) all that … we know that’s going to come a little bit. But Kuemps is a smart guy. And he knows (how) to stay out of it.”

It is what it is. Let Perry yap.

After two tilts one goaltender in this series has his head on a permanent swivel while giving up almost six goals per game. The other goaltender is Darcy Kuemper silent but deadly halfway home to immortality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbnJpL21pZ3JhdGUvaW5kaWFzLXJpY2hpZS1yaWNoLWFyZS1idXlpbmctb25lLXdheS10aWNrZXRzLW91dC1vZi10aGUtY291bnRyeS1oZXJlcy13aHkvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTIzMTc3MDcuY21z0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9ucmkvbWlncmF0ZS9pbmRpYXMtcmljaGllLXJpY2gtYXJlLWJ1eWluZy1vbmUtd2F5LXRpY2tldHMtb3V0LW9mLXRoZS1jb3VudHJ5LWhlcmVzLXdoeS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTIzMTc3MDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's richie rich are buying one-way tickets out of the country.

The rich are fleeing India repeated surveys show. Around 8000 High Net Worth Individuals or HNIs will leave India this year says a 2018 report by London-headquartered global citizenship and residence advisory Henley & Partners (H&P).These claims are borne out by figures from the wall-street investment bank Morgan Stanley. A 2018 bank report found that 23000 Indian millionaires had left the country since 2014. More recently a Global Wealth Migration Review report revealed that nearly 5000 millionaires or 2% of the total number of high net-worth individuals in India left the country in 2020 alone.Covid-19 has been a big driver of what was an ongoing trend of wealthy Indians seeking to ""globalise their lives and assets"" according to H&P. So much so that the firm set up its office in India in the middle of the lockdown last year to cater to growing demand.""I think they [clients] are realising they don't want to wait for the second or third wave of the pandemic. They want to have their papers now that they are sitting at home. We refer to this as the insurance policy or Plan B"" Dominic Volek Group Head of Private at Henley & Partners told the BBC from Dubai.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)Bob Dhillon Canadian-Indian real estate magnate and chief executive officer of Mainstreet Equity Corp sees this as the third wave of migration from India — after poor and marginal farmers from Punjab moved to western countries over a century ago and later professionals left India in search of better working and living conditions.“The constant flow of rich Indians moving to another country or taking up residency in another country can be a concern for India as it plans to reach the $5 trillion economy” Sudhir Kapadia national leader-tax at EY India told ET.This exodus of big money is not necessarily permanent in nature - people merely invest money in another country as a fall-back option rather than take out all their money from their home country and cut business ties. But it doesn't bode well for a developing nation like India experts told the BBC.Andrew Amoils Head of Research at New World Wealth a Johannesburg-based wealth intelligence group told the Business Standard newspaper: ""It can be a sign of bad things to come as high-net-worth individuals are often the first people to leave - they have the means to leave unlike middle-class citizens.""India also loses on the tax collection front when the rich leave.For some of the businessmen—mainly who handle investment companies or are into international trade—not staying in India is part of their tax planning. They avoid staying in India merely to avoid coming under the tax net.“The main issue why many Indians are taking up residency in countries such as the UAE and Singapore is the high individual tax rates in India” Saraswathi Kasturirangan partner at Deloitte India told ET. “With a 37% surcharge over a 30% tax rate in India the maximum marginal rate is as high as 42.74%. While reducing tax rates for individuals should be a priority the number of days’ stay in the country for taxing global income in India is also crucial.”The US UK and Canada are favourite destinations. EU countries as well as traditional favorites Dubai and Singapore are gaining popularity among Indians. While Singapore is a popular choice for digital entrepreneurs and family offices due to its robust legal system and access to world-class financial advisors the Dubai Golden Visa has emerged as a winner in some circles due to its ease of acquisition and the numerous options it provides.According to the Henley Private Wealth Migration Dashboard the UAE is predicted to draw the greatest net inflow of HNWIs globally in 2022 (at least 4000). Singapore is ranked third behind Australia (3500) with net inflows of 2800 predicted this year.Israel is ranked fourth on the list with a score of 2500 followed by Switzerland with a score of 2200 and the United States with a score of 1500.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA2LTE4L25lYXJseS1hbGwtb2Ytd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtYW5kLXRoZS1mZWQtYm90Y2hlZC1jYWxscy1mb3ItMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly All of Wall Street – and the Fed – Botched Calls for 2022,"Why did this happen?

Crossing the county line northbound on Highway 1 just south of Watsonville you can see it. At that point it’s nearly two miles away but with an assist from the late afternoon sun — and if you’re blessed with good eyesight — you can make out the top of it.

That thing you’re straining to see is a parking structure in the middle of downtown Watsonville the kind of massive blocky mountain of white concrete that urban planners and architects consider a necessary evil and a generic marker of Anytown USA.

But this particular parking garage is a different kind of animal. In the summer of 2022 the giant multi-story parking structure that shares a block with the Watsonville Public Library and the Santa Cruz County Superior Courthouse is halfway to a stunning transformation. Some time at the tail end of 2024 it will no longer be an anonymous parking garage. It will be a gigantic quilt-like representation of Watsonville’s human story a portrait of the city’s soul created with small pieces of ceramic tile.

This is Watsonville Brillante.

In early June what might be the most ambitious public art project in Santa Cruz County’s history reached its halfway point.

The first half which is complete consists of four large vertical mosaic murals conceived and designed by San Francisco artist Juan R. Fuentes who grew up in the agricultural labor camps outside Watsonville.

The second part of the project is only just beginning. That includes the decoration of the much smaller but more numerous horizontal spaces between the levels of the parking garage.

The last of four murals from artist Juan Fuentes — “The Flower Grower” — was unveiled June 7 on the Second Street side of Watsonville’s downtown parking structure as part of the Watsonville Brillante public art project. Credit: Kevin Painchaud

The vertical pieces the largest of which covers about 2400 square feet are all done. What you’ll see with that eagle eye from Highway 1 is the hairline of a girl named “Hermanita” (little sister) the only mural on the structure’s southwest face on Rodriguez Street. Around the corner on the southeast-facing wall stands the first two completed images both 60 feet tall depicting the area’s primary economic activity. They are respectively “The Strawberry Picker” and “The Apple Picker.” And on the opposite side of the structure overlooking Second Street is the fourth and newest member of the Fuentes family of murals “The Flower Grower.”

The second part of the project involves the 8-to-10-foot-long horizontal faces between the huge vertical murals 185 of them all together. On June 7 the first 15 of those were unveiled. The vision is to illustrate the ethnic heritages of Watsonville’s people — Indigenous Latino Asian European African Polynesian and more — with symbols and depictions both beautiful and meaningful.

Kathleen Crocetti’s vision

Crocetti’s vision of a five-year vision to cover a downtown parking structure in mosaic tiles to reflect Watsonville’s cultural heritage has reached its halfway point. Credit: Kevin Painchaud

Crocetti envisioned Brillante and launched the five-year project in 2019 in the process elevating the Chicano-style printmaking artwork of Fuentes Watsonville’s crazy-quilt of ethnicities and the art of mosaic tile all at once. It meant mobilizing an army of volunteers to put the tiled panels together in her workshop the Muzzio Mosaics Art Center a few blocks away during a shutdown international pandemic. Depicting the ethnic identities of the community also required an enormous outreach effort to get local residents to come forward with artistic designs of their particular cultural or ethnic background. Where the vertical panels represented the work of one accomplished artist the horizontal panels will come from the artistic vision of hundreds of Watsonville’s people.

“The common thread is to connect all the residents of Watsonville” said Crocetti whose own artistic contribution will be limited to her ethnic background constituting Italian Croatian and Irish. “That is the big idea.”

Even at halfway finished the Brillante murals are already a colossal achievement in public art in Watsonville. The artist Fuentes said Crocetti “is a role model for the artists of Watsonville. He’s in virtually every Mexican-American museum in the country.”

Fuentes 71 was born in New Mexico but grew up in the farm worker communities as one of 11 children mostly in Monterey County just across the county line from Watsonville. He graduated Watsonville High School in 1969 and though he lives in San Francisco he still has many members of his family in the Watsonville area.

“Everybody’s kind of blown away” said Fuentes of the local reaction to his enormous mosaic murals. “My nephew told me ‘You know we’re out there looking at your murals and people we know walked by and we were like my uncle did that. And they were all Nooo I don’t believe you.’”

Fuentes works in the high-contrast linocut/woodcut style. For years he has centered his work mostly on portraits most often of people representing different backgrounds — Latino Mestizo Indigenous — and in the context of anti-war or anti-colonialist themes. The Brillante mural “Hermanita” is typical of much of his work: an effort to portray the dignity spirit and humanity of his subjects. Fuentes emerged at the same time that the Chicano poster movement of the 1960s and ’70s was flowering giving a new generation of Latinos a vibrant political voice.

Galvanizing his artistic and political sensibilities was his presence in the aftermath of the landmark 1968-69 strikes at San Francisco State College (not SF State University) when a coalition of students of color initiated a strike over the lack of diversity both on campus and in the school’s curriculum. “One of the reasons I ended up at San Francisco State” said Fuentes “was because of the struggle for ethnic studies.” By the end of 2024 all the horizontal spaces between the large vertical murals will be covered in mosaic tiles as part of the Watsonville Brillante project.

When Crocetti first approached Fuentes with the Brillante idea he was uncertain. “At first I wasn’t quite sure what it represented or what it meant. And I didn’t know much about mosaics. I wasn’t sure how it would translate with my work. I was like ‘Well there are a lot of lines in my work.’ I just couldn’t imagine it being done with these little pieces of tile. So I’ve learned a lot and like anyone else I was just blown away [by the end result]. They’re so beautiful and the fact that the community has been involved in them from the beginning they kinda don’t even belong to me anymore. And that’s really the fabulous part.”

The first two Brillante murals reflected what Fuentes saw as the humanity and the often unacknowledged backstory of the thousands who work in the agricultural fields of California. “The Strawberry Picker” for example a barbed wire separates the stooping worker and ancient Latin American mythological imagery including a sun in the style of the flag of the artist’s native state of New Mexico. The barbed wire said Fuentes represents the U.S./Mexico border and the inherent separation between the worker and his ethnic birthright that the border symbolizes.

“Hermanita” the largest of the four Fuentes murals was not said Fuentes inspired by a specific young woman. She is instead symbolic of women’s struggles to make a better lives for themselves and their families. Fuentes has four older sisters. They more than anyone else served as the inspiration for the image. “My sisters were so influential in my development as an artist and our family” he said. “They all worked in the fields. One of my sisters used to work in the pajama factory that used to be there in Watsonville that’s gone now. And my other sisters worked in the canneries there for years.”

The new image “The Flower Grower” is different in that it portrays an Asian-American representing a female Japanese worker in the nursery industry. “When I was growing up in Watsonville I had classmates who were Japanese and lived close to where I lived. I asked one of my classmates if she had any old photographs of her family working in the fields and she sent me this cool old photo of her grandparents and her uncle working in the fields.” A volunteer applies tiles to an art piece that will eventually be mounted on a downtown parking garage as part of the Watsonville Brillante project.

At this point the Brillante project shifts to the design and creation of the horizontal panels. The few panels unveiled this month said Crocetti “gives people an idea of what’s to come.”

Watsonville’s incredible diversity – 120 identities

Crocetti’s outreach work and her research into Watsonville’s demographics have yielded so far 120 different ethnic/cultural identities each of which she plans to represent on the parking structure. “I just left it open for people” she said. “Whatever you want to call yourself however you identify.”

The panels wrapping around the building from Second Street will unfold a chronological story. The ones now on display already represent a wide variety of cultures from the native Amah Mutsun Ohlone peoples to Yaqui to Oklahoma Seminole to the empire of Spain.

“We’re now starting to work on the next section” she said “which is a lot of Asian groups so we have Chinese Japanese and Filipino coming next.”

Another of the project’s goals is proportionality — Watsonville’s large Latino population will be represented by for example at least one symbol or icon from each of the 32 states in Mexico.

What was originally a five-year project is on pace to wrap up by the beginning of 2025. But even then Watsonville will continue to change and evolve demographically. Crocetti said that Brillante will work to depict the city’s present as well as its past believing that people of various mixed backgrounds will find their identity right alongside everyone else. In the end Brillante is aiming for nothing less than to be an artistic demographic illustration of Watsonville’s people. After two and a half years of long hours in her workshop Crocetti and her many volunteers are finding a second wind as the project shifts its focus.

“Our most recent arrivals” said Crocetti” are people from the Middle East. So believe it or not we have people from Iraq Qatar Lebanon Afghanistan Iraq Kuwait Yemen Palestine Saudi Arabia Armenia Pakistan Turkey Syria and Israel — in Watsonville. I mean that’s so exciting.”

Payne has been putting fellow Detroiters in a position to be successful since his days as the floor leader of the Kettering High School basketball team in the early 1980s. Ryan Garza Detroit Free Press

Terry Payne defines a father as “the leader of the family.” And as Payne tells it he received some of his earliest training for being a dad on the basketball court when he was a standout starting point guard for Kettering High School in the early 1980s.

“It was a great experience just being on the team playing high school basketball in the PSL and the point guard is the leader — the brains” the now 58-year-old Payne explained. “Sports can make a man out of you because you have to go to practice every day you have to train you have to do the discipline stuff and it keeps you out of trouble. Playing sports is a beautiful thing for life.”

Many of the games Payne played in a Kettering uniform were a beautiful thing to watch for Detroit Public School League basketball fans of that era. Among those games was a memorable matchup around the holidays during the 1982-83 campaign when the Pioneers from the east side — known that season in basketball circles as “The Supreme Court” — took on the Southwestern Prospectors at Detroit's “Big House” Calihan Hall on the then-University of Detroit campus.

“The Christmas tournament set everything up for the big city championship game (a rematch with Southwestern) later that season when they were outside scalping tickets; it was so crazy that year” Payne recalled. “ ‘83 was all about the PSL and it wasn’t just about Southwestern and Kettering High School. It was also about Cass Tech and Southeastern and Cody — the PSL was loaded — every team had somebody. That was a championship year for all PSL schools.”

For the record Kettering split with Southwestern (the eventual Class A state championship runner-up) during the highly competitive season Payne described with Kettering winning the first game 57-55 when a driving twisting Derrick Kearney sank a bucket as time expired which triggered a spontaneous celebration on the Calihan Hall floor. The Feb. 26 1983 edition of the Free Press documented the success of the Kettering team that season. In a story written by the legendary Hal Schram Kearney and Robert Godbolt represented Kettering as first- and second-team selections on the Free Press’ All-PSL Team. And Kettering’s coach the late Arnold Nevels was recognized as Coach of the Year. Around that time Payne an adept facilitator for Kearney Godbolt and other potent scorers on the Kettering squad was feeling good too. And for a while he had grand hoop dreams.

“When I was coming up I thought I would play for the University of Michigan or the Detroit Titans on my way to the NBA but I took a different path” Payne said Wednesday from the offices of Payne Landscaping Inc. which he founded in 1989.

Ryan Garza Detroit Free Press

After Payne’s Kettering days some of his fellow high-profile PSL contemporaries with names like the late Roy Tarpley (Cooley High School/University of Michigan) Demetrius Gore (Chadsey/Pittsburgh) Vernon Carr (Cody/Michigan State) and Antoine “The Judge” Joubert (Southwestern/Michigan) would go on to play big-time college basketball games viewed by millions on TV. But Payne tells a story about becoming a father for the first time.

“I had to leave school because I had a child. And at that time we didn’t have much money so I had to come back home and try to support the baby” said Payne who described playing at Garden City (Kansas) Community College with Keith Smart who became famous for sinking the game-winning shot that lifted Indiana University to a national championship in 1987.

When Payne returned home to Detroit from Kansas he found employment as a custodian at the Belle Maison East apartments on East Jefferson. He was a long way from the excitement and accolades of his PSL days. And Payne also appeared to be the longest of long shots to ever own a business which provides 100 jobs as he does today at Payne Landscaping located on the corner of East Davison and Van Dyke. However as Payne revealed Wednesday a caring boss at the Belle Maison East saw championship potential in Payne — not as a ballplayer but as a man and a father who had much more to contribute to his family and community.

“I was 22 23 years old at the time and I think she (Deborah Jude Alexander) knew my background and what I had been at Kettering” Payne said of his former boss. “She saw more in me and didn’t want me to be in that field. And one day she gave me an ultimatum: She piled a whole lot of work on me that I could not do in one day and said “you gotta get all of this done today or don’t come back.' ”

The boss’ shrewd ploy gave Payne a reason to take an early lunch break.

“I went over to McDonalds that was right on Jefferson and Crane and had a Happy Meal” Payne said with a deadpan delivery. “And I was just playing with the little toy (from the Happy Meal) on the table and I decided that I couldn’t do all of that work so I walked away from the job and went home and cut my lawn.

“And when I started cutting my lawn the neighbors (7 Mile and Hoover area near Osborn High School) started asking me if I could cut their grass because I did it so great. This was like ‘88 ‘89 and at the apartment complex I was only making like $5.49 (an hour) so when somebody is giving you $10 or $12 or $15 to cut their grass at that time it was easy to make that transition — as a point guard. In life you have to make those decisions. Are you going to stay over here and play with the winners or play with the losers? So that’s how I got started in the business.”

Payne’s days of cutting the neighbor’s lawns are long gone as his company specializes in “landscaping services grounds maintenance snow removal and tree service for commercial industrial and municipal” clients. But he says there is definitely a community and neighborhood connection to everything he does as a businessman.

“Without Detroit Public Schools the city of Detroit the state of Michigan and the private institutions we have served there would be no us and we wouldn’t be able to provide jobs and feed families in Detroit neighborhoods” said Payne who also coached the Kettering junior varsity and varsity basketball teams for a combined 17 years during the period he was expanding his business. “And through those jobs we provide at Payne Landscaping we try to teach each employee how to become better adults and better fathers because that’s going to help our neighborhoods be better.”

Payne’s use of the pronoun “we” is highly intentional. When it is suggested to him that growing from one lawn mower to a business fleet of 45 vehicles that services city county and state contracts; along with being the proprietor of two They Say restaurants (Detroit and Harper Woods); while also refurbishing the nonprofit Brighter Detroit Community Center (in the Gratiot Woods neighborhood) are special community contributions to say the least Payne gets quiet for a spell before speaking from the heart.

“This is not about me — God did this” Payne the husband of Sharlyn Payne and father to Tierra Tikirra Terry Jr. and Terrell professed. “I’m amazed myself sometimes to be able to get up and look after people and help people. I thank God because God has put me in all of the positions that I’ve been in; I’m just a team leader. I had a great coaching staff when I played and I had a great basketball team when I played. And my team now is awesome!”

And Thursday from the comfortable air-conditioned offices of Payne Landscaping a couple of Payne’s key team members conveyed their admiration for their “leader” in a way that no Father’s Day greeting card could ever match.

“Mr. Payne’s slogan is ‘We are one.’ And as employees everyone is treated with love and respect” said Porchia Mulligan a native east-side Detroiter (Denby High School Class of 2007) who was groomed to be the director of operations at Payne Landscaping after working as a waitress bartender and manager at the They Say restaurant in Detroit. “For the community Payne Landscaping is about second chances. And I think that is so important now more than ever because so many people are discouraged.

""But with that second chance you can change your life around. I’ve known some people who have gone from being felons to having healthy long-standing relationships and lives. I’ve seen that happen with this company because Mr. Payne is adamant about opening his doors to whomever wants a job.”

Denise Bennett Payne Landscaping’s chief financial officer was a surprise arrival in the office on Thursday afternoon due to a wrist injury she recently suffered that required surgery. Out of the earshot of colleagues Bennett confided that she was in some pain but having a chance to talk about someone who she says shares her passion for Detroit brought a smile to her face.

“This is the best job I’ve ever had because I have had a chance to use my expertise and grow and be mentored and it’s all connected to this city and this is my home” said Bennett a 1974 graduate of Central High School where she was class president and valedictorian. “Terry is definitely a native Detroiter who believes in giving back to the community. A couple of weeks ago he hosted a Detroit Public Schools alumni reunion event at his restaurant. And there have been times when we have cut and cleaned fields that were not even a part of our contracts to make an impact. And making an impact is what it’s all about when you’re a part of Terry’s team.”

Since hitting its peak in fact the Nasdaq has sold off hard falling 34% through Thursday's close. And since it only takes a 20% decline from peak to trough to meet the definition of a bear market well we're definitely in a bear market now. There's no question about that.

Instead the questions a lot of investors are asking are how close we are to the end of the bear market and is it safe to start buying stocks now?

^IXIC data by YCharts.

What history says

Those are excellent questions. (But they're not necessarily the right questions to ask -- more on that in a moment).

According to research by The Washington Post the U.S. economy has survived seven separate bear markets in the past 40 years. Stock market investors suffered losses of anywhere from 27% to 52% from peak to trough during these downturns and the average loss was 35%. Given that the Nasdaq is down 34% already today therefore this suggests we may very well be near the bottom of the current bear market.

Or we may not be. History may rhyme but there's no guarantee it will repeat itself.

It's also worth pointing out that according to the Post's research the average bear market since World War II has lasted 23 months from peak to trough and back to peak -- but by that yardstick our current bear is a mere cub just seven months young.

Again whether or not now is the time to buy depends largely on how you look at the numbers. According to research examining recessions dating all the way back to the Great Depression it seems it only takes about 10 months on average for a stock market to fall from peak to trough during a recession. (The other 14 months are spent regaining the initial peak).

No matter how long it takes to regain the initial peak though once you've hit the trough and started climbing back higher that's exactly the right time to buy! And given that we're seven months into the current bear market we may be approaching this point.

A better question

So should you buy stocks right now? Judging from history the answer certainly seems to be leaning toward ""yes."" And yet I do wonder whether this is perhaps the wrong question to ask.

A better question might be: Even if we don't know exactly how long the bear market will last we certainly know that the stock market has already fallen a lot and a lot of stocks have gotten cheaper. So are there any specific stocks that are already cheap enough to buy no matter how long the bear market lasts?

And the answer to that one is a much clearer ""yes.""

Judging just from my own personal stock shopping list alone I've already spotted a good dozen or more stocks that are cheap enough to make me sit up and take notice -- and begin cautiously buying as the market continues to fall. These include:

Growth stocks trading at deep discounts to intrinsic value such as beaten-up social media pick Pinterest (NYSE: PINS)

Dominant plays on a revival in travel as Summer 2022 arrives. Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG) S&P Global Market Intelligence data but a valuation just as cheap as Pinterest's at 17b times FCF.

S&P Global Market Intelligence data but a valuation just as cheap as Pinterest's at 17b times FCF. Even more gigantic companies that aren't quite as cheap as I'd like but are getting there. Mastercard (NYSE: MA)

And for investors that's really the good news. You don't have to wait for the bear market to end. Whether or not the Nasdaq sell-off has run its course these three stocks -- probably many more besides -- are already cheap enough to buy right now.

Cheese-lovers can now wear their favorite dairy product on their fingertips thanks to Velveeta and British nail polish brand Nails Inc.

A limited-edition set of two cheese-scented polishes will cost cheese fanatics $15 on the Nails Inc. website. It includes two shades: “Finger Food” a bright red and “La Dolce Velveeta” a creamy yellow color.

The polishes’ signature cheesy scent only appears when they are dry says Nails Inc.

“These highly pigmented shades provide full-cover payoff and are designed to be worn together for those confident enough to show the world they are living a big bold and unrestrained life” says Nails Inc. The collaboration is a part of Velveeta’s “La Dolce Velveeta” campaign “which is all about stepping out in a confident unapologetic way to show the world that you’re living a life filled with outrageous pleasure” according to a press release from the Kraft Heinz Company which owns Velveeta.

Although Velveeta’s products are not vegan the formulation of both colors is vegan and cruelty-free according to Nails Inc.

The collaboration also includes a set of Velveeta-themed nail stickers featuring gooey cheese graphics and the phrases “creamy” and “drip.”

“Veleeta is known for its rich creamy texture and cheesy melty goodness so what better way to bring this to life for our fans than with something equally as rich and creamy — nail polish” said Kelsey Rice senior brand communications manager at the Kraft Heinz Company in the press release.

And unfortunately for Kymera Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:KYMR) shareholders the stock is a lot lower today than it was a year ago. The share price has slid 67% in that time. Kymera Therapeutics hasn't been listed for long so although we're wary of recent listings that perform poorly it may still prove itself with time. The falls have accelerated recently with the share price down 64% in the last three months.

Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.

See our latest analysis for Kymera Therapeutics

Because Kymera Therapeutics made a loss in the last twelve months we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth at least for now. Generally speaking companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year and at a good clip. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits often of considerable size.

In the last year Kymera Therapeutics saw its revenue grow by 29%. We think that is pretty nice growth. Meanwhile the share price tanked 67% suggesting the market had much higher expectations. It is of course possible that the business will still deliver strong growth it will just take longer than expected to do it. To our minds it isn't enough to just look at revenue anyway. Always consider when profits will flow.

The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

Kymera Therapeutics is a well known stock with plenty of analyst coverage suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts

A Different Perspective

We doubt Kymera Therapeutics shareholders are happy with the loss of 67% over twelve months. That falls short of the market which lost 20%. That's disappointing but it's worth keeping in mind that the market-wide selling wouldn't have helped. With the stock down 64% over the last three months the market doesn't seem to believe that the company has solved all its problems. Basically most investors should be wary of buying into a poor-performing stock unless the business itself has clearly improved. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Kymera Therapeutics has 4 warning signs (and 1 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about.

After a more than 10% drop in 6 trading sessions S&P 500 is right at a vulnerable spot where a stock market crash could easily be triggered. Over the weekend Bitcoin broke below the support at 20000 suggested a continuation of the risk-off mode into the coming week.

However there is still a silver lining for the looming stock market crash when adopting the Wyckoff trading method to spot the tell-tale signs for a potential short-term rally. Refer to the chart below.

Since the breakdown of the short-term support at 4080 on 9 Jun 2022 shortening of the thrust to the downside was observed (as annotated in blue) along with decreasing of the volume suggested exhaustion of the down momentum.

S&P 500 is currently testing the oversold line of the down channel which could prone to a relief rally out from the oversold condition. The rebound off the channel oversold line happened in the past on 24 January 2022 24 February 2022 and 20 May 2022.

The two price targets based on the Point and Figure chart are 3900 followed by 3650. In May 2022 after the first price target of 3900 was hit S&P 500 stopped the down move and consolidated for one month. The fulfilment of the second price target at 3650 provides a condition for S&P 500 to attempt to rally when interpreting with the technical details as explained above.

Even if S&P 500 starts to rally up as illustrated in the green path it is crucial to monitor how the price reacts at the key levels such as 3800 followed by the gap resistance zone near 3900 (annotated in red line). Any failure along the way could signal the end of the rebound and the beginning of an impulsive down move.

Should the short-term rebound fail to materialize a break below the recent low at 3640 and a commitment below the oversold line of the down channel could trigger a capitulation which could lead to a stock market crash similar to 2008’s situation as detailed in the video at the bottom of this post.

Bullish Divergence Between S&P 500 and The Market Breadth

A bullish divergence between S&P 500 and the market breadth (percent of stocks above 50-day average) was observed as shown in the chart below.

Story continues

A bullish divergence was observed near end of January 2022 till mid of March 2022 (annotated in orange) where the market breadth formed a higher low while S&P 500 formed a lower low. Subsequently a strong rally kicked start after the bullish divergence.

Similarly between 12-20 May 2022 a bullish divergence was formed followed by a relief rally tested the resistance zone near 4200.

Now a potential bullish divergence is unfolding from May till now. A meaningful rally in S&P 500 would mark the third successful bullish divergence.

Stock Market Crash Comparison 2022 vs 2008

When the silver lining fails along the way or even at the beginning S&P 500 is likely to enter into market crash mode similar to the global financial crisis in 2008.

Watch the video below to find out the similarities of the stock market crash in 2008 from the price structure to the market rotation sequence.

The sign of weakness in the energy sector (XLE) started last week further strengthened this market crash analogue. Visit TradePrecise.com to get more stock market insights in email for free.

Of course music fans regularly turn to Netflix for concert documentaries like Taylor Swift's Miss Americana and series with killer soundtracks like Bridgerton. But if you spend some time browsing the musical genre category on Netflix you'll find the streaming service also has a treasure trove of Broadway-caliber musicals (""musical"" defined in this case as any story in which the music directly influences the plot and/or a major character consistently performs music as part of their arc) waiting for you.

If that sounds good start up the orchestra and draw back the curtain. Here are 15 of the catchiest most dazzling all-around best musicals Netflix streaming right now.

15. The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience

At a short 30 minutes The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is a snack-sized Netflix musical. It is also by far the strangest. Described in our review as a ""Lemonade-style visual album complete with spoken word poetry and rap tracks about Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco's baseball careers in the late '80s"" almost nothing about The Lonely Island's surprise-dropped pet project makes sense in the best way possible. There are cardboard cutouts of Kathy Ireland cameos galore tons of bizarre costumes and a soundtrack that frankly slaps. It only takes one listen of ""IHOP Parking Lot"" to get the insanely catchy ""shake that nasty butt"" line stuck in one’s head forever and the rest of the songs are infinitely memorable. — Alexis Nedd Senior Entertainment Reporter

Best song: ""IHOP Parking Lot"" How to watch: The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is now streaming on Netflix.

14. Shrek the Musical

""Shrek the musical"" may not be synonymous with big-time Broadway success but the 2008 production from Jeanine Tesori and David Lindsay-Abaire is a perfectly reasonable good time. Brian D'Arcy James' take on Shrek and Daniel Breaker's on the Donkey are loads of fun but the best number in the show belongs to Sutton Foster's Fiona and two younger versions of the character.

As a child Fiona is imprisoned in the highest room of the tallest tower guarded by a vicious dragon. She passes time by singing and reading stories of other fabled princesses...only to realize that what they all have in common is the endless waiting. Years go by as Fiona grows into a teenager and finally an adult trying to stay optimistic while waiting for her prince to arrive any day. Foster's version finally snaps destroying her story books and belting out a plea to God. Fiona always did know how to strip the glamor away from princess life. — Proma Khosla Entertainment Reporter

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s feature directorial debut packs a potent musical theater punch from every angle. He brings to life the selective reality and theatrical phantasmagoria of Rent writer Jonathan Larson’s life and career based on an autobiographical show from 1992.

Miranda whose In the Heights was spectacularly adapted for film by Jon M. Chu proves as adept at moving from stage to screen as he does sucking the marrow of his medium. Andrew Garfield fully inhabits Larson from voice to body to towering buzzing hair and a frenetic urgency to create — to write to sing to matter as Larson so clearly did to legions of dreamers who followed. — P.K.*

12. Les Misérables

Whatever influence the mesmeric dumpster fire that is Cats had on your opinion of director Tom Hooper his 2012 film adaptation of Les Misérables set a new standard for stage productions cranking up to their utmost epic-ness for the big screen. Anne Hathaway who received the Best Supporting Actress Oscar she deserved for her take on Fantine absolutely brings the house down with her rendition of ""I Dreamed A Dream"" — and just shy of a decade later that makes it worth watching the entire two hour and 38 minute film over again. Even the rambling bits with Hugh Jackman which we promise do in fact come to an end. Eventually. — Alison Foreman Entertainment Reporter

Young Fei Fei is enchanted by the story of the moon goddess Chang'e and the legend of her lover.

10. The Prom

Get ready to dance through The Prom a bubbly celebration of inclusion and being yourself. The Prom features an all-star cast including Meryl Streep Nicole Kidman James Corden and Andrew Rannells who play washed-up Broadway actors in need of an image boost. When Emma a lesbian student in Indiana wants to bring her girlfriend to prom the bigoted PTA threatens to cancel the event all together. The Broadway performers see this as a chance to nab some positive publicity and go to Indiana to help Emma out. The Prom has trouble keeping its balance at times often focusing too much on the Broadway stars and not enough on Emma's journey. However its musical numbers ranging from emotional ballads like ""Unruly Heart"" to high energy set pieces like ""Love Thy Neighbor"" are fun and full of heart. — Belen Edwards Entertainment Reporter

Bee So Long blends deeply effective yet understated performances and an over-the-top escapist atmosphere to instantly transport viewers outside their living rooms.

Audrey Hepburn played no shortage of iconic roles but one of her best known is as cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady. When arrogant linguist Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) laments the ""degradation"" of the English language with accents like Eliza's he makes a bet that he can teach her to speak like a proper English lady and pass her off as such as an upcoming ball.

Baz Lurhmann's luxurious mind gave the world Romeo + Juliet Moulin Rouge that weird Great Gatsby adaptation and Netflix’s The Get Down. Taking place in the south Bronx in the late '70s right at the cusp of disco and the rise of hip hop The Get Down follows a group of young men who discover the incomparable sound of a mysterious DJ and become The Get Down Brothers a fictional rap group that nonetheless interacts with real-life legends like Grandmaster Flash. Its fast-paced editing and artistic imaginings of the Bronx are reminiscent of Lurhmann's other work but remain unique and its music is some of the best in any Netflix original offering. — A.N.

Shut up and embrace the magic of Christmas with Jingle Jangle  a delightful original musical about family toys and inheritable mechanical ingenuity.

Forrest Whittaker stars as Jeronicus Jangle a formerly genius toymaker who thinks he’s lost everything. But his daughter Jessica (literal Disney princess Anika Noni Rose) and granddaughter Journey (newcomer Madalen Mills) come back into his life to reignite the spark that makes their family special. Ricky Martin Phylicia Rashad  and Keegan Michael Key also star in unforgettable roles that play together to make Jingle Jangle an instant holiday classic. — A.N. *

4. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham

Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is a classic and beloved Bollywood movie soundtrack but ""Yeh Ladka Hai Allah"" rarely gets its due. This is the rare Bollywood number that has it all and puts it on full display while Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan) attends Anjali’s (Kajol) best friend’s wedding. Like ""Bole Chudiyan"" in the same movie it's a boisterous group number rooted in cultural celebration and like ""Suraj Hua Maddham"" a mere 10 minutes earlier it basks in the legendary chemistry of Khan and Kajol who move seamlessly from sweet flirtation to playful rivalry to full on eye-fucking (Kuch Kuch Hota Hai gazebo scene here is your obligatory shout out).

The song is diegetic as part of the wedding festivities but with just enough of a fantasy element for our characters to explore unspoken emotions and break into choreographed dances they definitely never rehearsed. — P.K.

Best song: ""Yeh Ladki Hai Allah""

3. Vivo

Vivo makes such sweet beautiful music on Netflix.

The animated feature from writers Quiara Alegría Hudes and Kirk DeMicco who also directs tells the story of the eponymous kinkajou. The furry little singing-and-dancing cutie pie named Vivo sets out on a journey from Havana to Miami hoping to fulfill the dying wish of his best friend and musical partner Andrés. Along the way he finds help from an unlikely source: Gabi the music-loving (but rhythmically dense) niece to Andrés who also happens to be a sweet-natured agent of chaos.

Their emotional journey is propelled most of all by song. That's where Vivo's true superpower lies. Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote them all and he infuses each with crackling energy as the voice of Vivo. Alongside Gabi actor Ynairaly Simo the two embark on a deeply moving adventure that's all but guaranteed to leave you in joyous heartfelt tears. — Adam Rosenberg Senior Entertainment Reporter

Best Song: ""My Own Drum.""

2. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom

If Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom can’t quite escape the rhythms of the stage (it’s based on a play by August Wilson) it's more than dynamic enough to hold its own as a movie. Set during an eventful recording session in 1927 Chicago the film is at once a full-throated tribute to the ""Mother of the Blues"" a lively celebration of Black culture and its place in history and a sharp exploration of racial dynamics then and now — not to mention a stunning showcase for its cast including Viola Davis as the towering legend of the title and Chadwick Boseman in his thrilling heartbreaking final performance. — Angie Han Deputy Entertainment Editor *

Best song: ""Deep Moaning Blues"" How to watch: Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is now streaming on Netflix.

1. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend

All four seasons of Rachel Bloom's magical emotional musical extravaganza are on Netflix so if you didn't originally catch the CW charmer during its 2015-2019 run you're in for a real treat. The show follows a woman after she moves across the country to get her high school boyfriend back — but of course it's actually a lot more nuanced than that. Smartly tackling mental illness love the patriarchy and the lies we tell ourselves the dark comedy will consistently make you laugh (sometimes joyfully sometimes more so out of recognizable secondhand cringe). Fair warning: The original songs (over 150!) about modern dating horrors will get stuck in your head and you will sing along. — Erin Strecker Entertainment Editor

Best song: ""You Stupid Bitch"" (But there are oh-so-many contenders!) How to watch: Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is now streaming on Netflix.

The accident was not on the set of the show but happened in transit from Santa Rosalía to the local airport on June 16 Netflix said in a statement to USA TODAY.

Local media reported the crash happened Thursday and said the van flipped after running off the road in a desert area. The crew had apparently been working in the nearby Santa Rosalía area at the time.

The two actors who died in the crash were identified Friday as Raymundo Garduño Cruz and Juan Francisco González Aguilar according to the Baja California Department of Culture.

Netflix describes the plot of ""The Chosen One"" as a series about a 12-year-old boy who learns he's the return of Jesus Christ and ""destined to save humankind."" It's based on a comic-book series by Mark Millar and Peter Gross. It's unrelated to another show featured on streaming service with the same name. That show features three doctors aiming to bring a Zika vaccine to the remote Pantanal region in South America.

Millar who previously worked at Marvel Comics created properties such as Kingsman and Kick-Ass – as well as the ""American Jesus"" comics that ""The Chosen One"" is based on – and founded Millarworld. Netflix acquired the company run by Millar and his wife Lucy in 2017. The following year the streaming company announced plans to produce a TV series based on ""American Jesus"" along with other projects.

The production of the show has been temporarily paused by Redrum the production company.

Friends of the victims voiced concerns to the Daily Beast about ""The Chosen One"" actors' complaints regarding poor transportation and logistics.

“It fills me with rage that there are reports of abuse and exploitation being shared by people involved with the production” Liliana Conlisk Gallegos who said she was a friend of González Aguilar known professionally as “Paco Mufote"" said to the Daily Beast. “I would like to demand that this is further investigated. If nothing wrong was going on then there shouldn’t be an issue with providing the information.”

Netflix did not comment on the allegations noting that an investigation into the accident is ongoing.

On Twitter actor and director Fernando Bonilla said that Garduño Cruz was ""a festive and generous friend.""

""It is imperative that the production report how many hours of rest the driver who lost control of the truck had"" he wrote about the accident.

Here’s what’s planned to come to Netflix between June 20th through June 26th 2022.

We’re also expecting a full look at what’s set to come to Netflix in July 2022 this week so keep an eye out for that. If you missed any of the new releases from last week check out the full list of 47 new movies and shows added here.

Most Anticipated New Releases on Netflix This Week

The Man from Toronto

Coming to Netflix: Friday

Kevin Hart has found his home at Netflix with his last few projects all coming to the service and plenty more in the works too. To cement Netflix as his home Netflix bought up the rights to The Man From Toronto earlier in the year which comes to Netflix globally exclusively on Friday.

Co-starring Woody Harrelson the new action-comedy movie is about the world’s deadliest assassin forced to team up with someone who let’s just say isn’t so deadly.

Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area (Season 1)

Coming to Netflix: Friday

When it comes to Netflix’s biggest shows Money Heist is easily up there among the top 5 and as a result of this success we’re not going to be seeing spin-offs (so far in the form of a Berlin spin-off) and international spin-offs with a Korean adaptation of the story coming up first at the end of this week.

We’ll see all the characters you loved from the Spanish show return with fresh new takes.

The Umbrella Academy (Season 3)

Coming to Netflix: Wednesday

Given we’ve seen Stranger Things dominate the Netflix top 10s and expected to again the week after next there’s perhaps no better show to be sandwiched in between the two volumes than The Umbrella Academy. The show which is releasing on the slightly unusual day of Wednesday perhaps tells you how confident they are in the title’s ability to perform season after season.

This season promises to be the biggest yet for our heroes as they face off against their multi-verse (so-to-speak) rivals in the form of the Sparrows.

According to the NGO which promotes community development environmental sustainability and human rights within the Mine’s enclave Newmont had already acquired the Ahafo North Mine’s concessional area covering Afrisipakrom Techire Susuanso Adrobaa and Yamfo in the Tano North Municipality from the government.

The NGO observed it would be in the interest of the Mine’s affected communities to negotiate with Newmont on compensation and other entitlement issues.

It said though Focus was always mindful of the negative impact of mining with strong partnership and collaboration affected communities could better manage negative impacts and maximise the positives.

Addressing a news conference at Susuanso one of the communities within the Mine’s enclave Victor Gyabaah the Secretary said Focus had the interest of the mining communities and would continue to push community development and asked the people “to come with open heart and mind to dialogue with Newmont and journey together on emerging issues to positively impact the communities.

“This is why we call on individuals who are seeking a court injunction to restrain the mine from operating in the area to as a matter of urgency withdraw the issue from the court as the court injunction has halted Newmont Mine’s project development in the Ahafo North Mine” he said.

Mr Gyabaah regretted operations of the Newmont Ahafo Development Foundation (NADeF) a foundation set by the mine to push community development in 10-mine take communities had also halted operations because of the impasse between the company and the communities slowing down development processes in the area.

“Now many of our qualified students cannot access the scholarship package of the foundation to continue with their education while infrastructural projects had also been stalled in the local communities” he indicated.

Mr Gyabaah noted that the Newmont Ahafo Mine’s project served as an economic driver for the local economy thereby attracting investors into the local economy saying with Newmont’s investment of US$850 million into the Ahafo North Mine’s project the five local communities would be opened up for economic prosperity.

Meanwhile some of the resident farmers directly or indirectly affected by the Mine’s operations had condemned the practice of some of the people who had put up speculative structures in the Mine’s concessional enclave just to obtain undue compensation.

They told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) that the practice had halted the payment of compensation to deserving farmers and asked those engaged in such speculative activities to be faithful to themselves and do the right thing to pave way for the company to pay them the compensation.

The residents expressed worry that since the company acquired the concession they were unable to engage in any commercial farming and asked the company to facilitate payments of compensation to enable them to engage in other alternative livelihood activities to better their lives.

Mr Joseph Baffour Darkwah a farmer and Adrobaa local President of Focus told the GNA Newmont had so far paid US$22 million as crop compensation in the 10 mine-take communities since it started the Ahafo Mine operations.

“The company has also allocated more than US$20 million to be disbursed to the communities. But the current impasse between the people and the company has slowed down the disbursement process”.

“In fact we have learnt a lot of lessons from other mining communities and I believe the disbursement of these monies to the communities distinctively would better the livelihoods of our farmers and their dependents” Mr Darkwah stated.

He therefore called on the people and communities’ leaders to remain truthful with Newmont on matters relating to compensation so that affected farmers could obtain their share to ensure their socio-economic survival.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC93LXItcG93ZXItdGhlZnQtY29uc3VtZXJzLWdpdmVuLWEtbW9udGgtdWx0aW1hdHVtL9IBS2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC93LXItcG93ZXItdGhlZnQtY29uc3VtZXJzLWdpdmVuLWEtbW9udGgtdWx0aW1hdHVtLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,W/R: Power Theft Consumers Given A Month Ultimatum,"The Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) has given a one-month ultimatum to all its customers to rectify all anomalies with their meters ahead of an impending audit of all meters leading to the prosecution of culprits.

According to ECG the move would help to reduce commercial losses once and for all clean the system of any electrical illegalities as well as help improve upon the revenue of the company.

The ECG therefore called on customers who have not been receiving bills prepaid customers who do not purchase electricity credit customers with faulty meters those who have tempered their meters and all those engaged in any form of illegality to willingly own up within the one-month moratorium instituted by the company.

According to the power distribution company any customer caught engaged in illegality after the one-month moratorium would be dealt with in accordance with the law.

Addressing the media in Takoradi Mr Daniel Anokye Abebrese the Director of Customer Service of the company indicated that over the years the biggest bane of the company has been its losses which militate against the viability of the company.

He contended that generally losses were inherent in every electricity business all over the world.

“It’s however the quantum of our losses which is unacceptable. Hence our efforts to reduce the quantum of commercial losses once and for all by getting rid of all electrical illegalities to improve upon the revenue mobilization” he added.

He explained that losses in the electricity business were in two components which included technical and commercial losses.

He pointed out that it was the commercial losses that the company had control over and mentioned some of the commercial losses as uncaptured metres.

“This is where customers use metres which are not captured in our system and for that matter they don’t pay for the electricity they use” he explained.

He indicated that faulty metres and customers who tampered with metres so that they do not record the true power consumption or pay for the full usage of electricity also accounted for commercial losses.

Mr Abebrese therefore indicated that the ECG was encouraging customers with such anomalies on their meters to come out willingly to sort out the issues with their metres from June 7 to July 6 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9jb21tdW5pdGllcy1pbi1jZW50cmFsLXJlZ2lvbi1zdWJtZXJnZWQtYWZ0ZXItaGVhdnktZG93bnBvdXIv0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzZ2hhbmEuY29tLmdoL2NvbW11bml0aWVzLWluLWNlbnRyYWwtcmVnaW9uLXN1Ym1lcmdlZC1hZnRlci1oZWF2eS1kb3ducG91ci8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Communities in Central Region submerged after heavy downpour,"Several communities along the Ankaful Prisons – Elmina Junction Road have been completely submerged following three days of torrential rainfall.

Some residents in the affected communities including Ankaful Fie Ntranoa Amissano Nkontrodu Peace and Bethel Avenues have been rendered homeless with others who have no alternative places stuck in their rooms.

Other terribly hit areas include Abee Simiw and Abrem where the Agona Health Centre has been affected.

Many structures and homes including those belonging to the Ankaful Prisons farms parks among other facilities have all been submerged.

The streets are completely out of site with no vehicles commuting.

As at the time of filing the story a Fire Service rescue team had arrived at Kakum Cottage near the SSNIT Flats with a boat to evacuate distressed people whose property have been swallowed by the high tide moving flood waters to safety.

Roads have been rendered unmotorable while the Nkontrodu Bridge had been completely swallowed by the floods.

A prison officer (name withheld) according to internal sources is feared dead after he fell in the water during an operation on Saturday.

At Mepeasem cars were seen completely sunk in the floods so were many buildings some with their walls collapsed.

A canyon at the Jukwa portion of the Cape Coast – Twifo-Praso road has rendered the road inaccessible and left hundreds of commuters and residents stranded at both sides.

The portion of the road at the tip of the bridge just before the Jukwa barrier was deeply eroded by the high current from a nearby river which overflowed its banks due to the rains.

The situation has left the bridge in a deplorable state and therefore needs urgent fixing.

The affected portion of the road has since been cordoned off by security personnel to keep residents and commuters at bay.

The residence of the Chief Executive Officer of the EXIM Bank Mr Lawrence Kwabena Agyinsem very close to the scene was also terribly hit as he lost at least two cars to the floods after his wall was pulled down by the fast-moving water.

Owing to the situation commuters from Cape Coast to Praso have to pass through Assin Fosu pushing the transportation fare from GH¢22 to GH¢50 consequently.

Some affected persons who thronged the scene called on authorities to attend to the road with urgency because the situation was having a devastating effect on them.

“We were going for a funeral but were greeted by this situation here. We have been directed to use another town but I understand it is also flooded. It doesn’t not look like the situation can be salvaged immediately and so we are returning to Accra” a commuter Mr Isaac Amponsah said.

“I am a bolt driver and I have to deliver some goods at Domeabra but I cannot go which means I cannot make sales today. It is very troubling.

“We need the authorities to do something about this bridge immediately” another road user Mr Daniel Nwonsah said.",,,,,,

We have compiled a list of 60 of Queensland’s superwomen of real estate including 16 from the Gold Coast. >> SEE THE FULL LIST <<

They include industry pioneer Lucy Cole a single mum and cancer survivor when she launched her own agency 22 years ago and Karen Pirie who says there is no secret to her success but hard work.

Ms Pirie 49 has carved an enviable career over close to two decades in the cut-throat industry while raising her two kids solo with no family support network.

“Do I have something special? No — I just work hard. I love what I do. I’m extremely honest and ethical and I think people see that and like it” she says.

Ms Pirie switched agencies to the Gold Coast’s award-winning Harcourts Coastal franchise just weeks ago.

In 2003 she moved to QLD from Christchurch New Zealand and made her first foray into the real estate industry.

With her family still overseas she relied on babysitters and nannies to care for her children

Sienna 13 and Cole 11 while she put in the extra hours to give them the best life she could.

“I want my kids to be successful in life as well. I’m trying to give them opportunities that I never had” Ms Pirie said.

Back in New Zealand Ms Pirie was an avid mountain bike racer but gave that up when she “fell in love with real estate”.

She still prioritises staying active and wakes at 5am every day to head to the gym before getting the kids off to school and honing in on a productive work day.

“I’ve had one weekend off in about six months.”

For young women looking to enter the real estate industry Ms Pirie says it’s important to choose who you work for wisely.

“It’s really important to work with a dominant agency wher you’re starting out because it makes a big difference when you’re doing calls if people recognise the agency as being one of the best out. That’s half your work done for you” she says.

“Just work hard — the more calls you can do the more successful you will be. And don’t be shy.”

Handling the rejection that is part of the job comes with time she says but having someone to confide in helps.

“Real estate is a rollercoaster of emotions and it’s really important to not let those affect you.

“Sometimes it does and it’s really good to have someone to talk to when that happens because looking from the outside it’s never exactly what it seems to be when you’re in the middle of it” she says.

Ms Pirie says her move to Harcourts Coastal was due in part to managing director Dane Atherton’s commitment to the growth of agents within his teams.

Industry pioneer Lucy Cole was one of the first women in Queensland to open an independent agency Lucy Cole Prestige Properties.

She has grown the company from a one-woman operation to a highly respected brand with a team of 20 employees working across two offices.

Ms Cole counts winning the Real Estate Institute of Queensland Salesperson of the Year award three times among her proudest achievements.

“It was a moving experience to receive the accolade because I had been recovering from cancer” Ms Cole says.

“I could not attend the gala ceremony but was encouraged to do so. I could not even walk up the stairs to the ballroom and hold the large trophy.”

She recalls starting her agency as an “exciting but daunting dream” and says she is lucky that property is her passion not just her work.

“For me it is not uncommon to start work before the sun comes up and still be working well into the night.”

“However the joy of real estate is that it is not a 9-to-5 job and it means that you can take time out to enjoy other interests such as serving on committees charity work auctioneering or spending time with the grandkids” she says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L25ldGJhbGwvc3VwZXItbmV0YmFsbC1saXZlLWZldmVyLXN0YXItaG9sZHMtdGhlLWtleS1hcy11bmRlcmRvZ3MtbG9vay10by1iYW5pc2gtZ2hvc3RzLW9mLTIwMjAvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9kMjc2N2MwZTRlY2QyODQ4ZTI2MjI3ZDA4NTkwMmQ2YdIBpwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L25ldGJhbGwvc3VwZXItbmV0YmFsbC1saXZlLWZldmVyLXN0YXItaG9sZHMtdGhlLWtleS1hcy11bmRlcmRvZ3MtbG9vay10by1iYW5pc2gtZ2hvc3RzLW9mLTIwMjAvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9kMjc2N2MwZTRlY2QyODQ4ZTI2MjI3ZDA4NTkwMmQ2YQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Superstar’s all-time effort seals Super Netball semi in wild twist to sell-off drama,"A playoff record shooting performance from Jhaniele Fowler has helped West Coast Fever book a home grand final and move a step closer to a maiden Super Netball premiership with a 71-62 demolition of the Melbourne Vixens.

The victory also makes Netball Australia’s controversial decision to sell the grand final to Western Australia look a masterstroke given the Fever would have earnt the right for free under the old system.

Fowler finished with 67 goals to beat Romelda Aiken’s 63 in the 2016 grand final and just behind her own Super Netball general record of 70 goals

Massive underdogs after being beaten twice by the Vixens during the regular season and playing in front of a near full house at Melbourne’s John Cain Arena the Fever defied the odds to totally dominate the minor premiers who turned in an uncharacteristically error-riddled showing.

After breaking away with a nine-goal unanswered run late in the first quarter the Fever were never headed with the Vixens unable to find answers.

The Vixens were beaten across the court unable to make an impact in attack or defence as the Fever brought and aggression and energy that the home side was unable to match.

The Vixens had won both games against the Fever in the regular season and lost just twice all year heading into the clash.

But they made too many basic errors with co-captain Liz Watson admitting their performance was undeserving of delivering them to a grand final.

“To put out a performance like that you don’t deserve to go through to a grand final to be honest” Watson said.

“But we’ve got another week which is the positive and we just need to bring it from the start because we were just missing right from the first whistle today.”

The Vixens fought back through young gun Rhani Samason who sank a record-equalling 10 super shots to claw the margin back to nine goals after they led by as many as 21 late in the third term.

While Fowler was on song the Fever’s performance was stunning across the court.

Defenders Courtney Bruce and Sunday Aryang were outstanding Sasha Glasgow and Alice Teague-Neeld fed the circle brilliantly and the Fever did a Vixens on the Vixens with their full-court defensive pressure suffocating the minor premiers.

Captain Bruce said the Fever were “absolutely stoked” to make the decider.

“We wanted to earn the right to host that grand final and we’ve done that so I’m absolutely stoked” Bruce said.

“We really did our homework on the Vixens and I just think the switches between Sunday and I (in the defensive circle) were phenomenal.

“She was out there taking intercepts all day.”

Money for nothing

Netball Australia’s decision to sell the grand final to Western Australia is now looking like a genius move given the Fever would have earnt hosting rights anyway under the old system.

Until this year the winner of the major semi-final gained the right to hos the grand final as the first team into the season decider.

But in a move announced just two weeks before the finals Netball Australian announced it had struck a commercial deal with the West Australian government that would deliver around $650000 in cash and in-kind deals.

That’s now bonus money that will be invaluable to the financially flailing organisation’s bottom line.

Homework pays off

Fever captain Courtney Bruce said her team did their homework on the Vixens and while it showed all over the court it was no more evident than in the performance of Melbourne and Aussie captain Liz Watson.

Widely regarded as the best wing attack in the world Watson was kept incredibly quiet by her standards with many of her 33 feeds and 21 goal assists coming late in the match.

The Fever’s pressure forced Vixens coach Simone McKinnis to make an early shuffle in the midcourt with Watson moved to centre and co-captain Kate Moloney to wing defence.

But she shuffled them again with the Fever pressure continuing to pay off.

Fantastic Fowler

Jhaniele Fowler is such a dominant player her performances rarely get the credit they deserve given her ability to make the extraordinary seem so simple.

But there was no glossing over her semi-final showing or its importance to the Fever.

At 198cm the strong holding shooter is a massive target for the Fever but she is more than just her height and strength.

Accurate and athletic Fowler is an incredible target for the Fever and the growth of fellow goaler Sasha Glasgow this season has made it more difficult for defences to throw all their resources at the Jamaican without fear of being scored on.

We have compiled a list of 60 of Queensland’s superwomen of real estate including 16 from the Gold Coast. >> SEE THE FULL LIST <<

They include industry pioneer Lucy Cole a single mum and cancer survivor when she launched her own agency 22 years ago and Karen Pirie who says there is no secret to her success but hard work.

Ms Pirie 49 has carved an enviable career over close to two decades in the cut-throat industry while raising her two kids solo with no family support network.

“Do I have something special? No — I just work hard. I love what I do. I’m extremely honest and ethical and I think people see that and like it” she says.

Ms Pirie switched agencies to the Gold Coast’s award-winning Harcourts Coastal franchise just weeks ago.

In 2003 she moved to QLD from Christchurch New Zealand and made her first foray into the real estate industry.

With her family still overseas she relied on babysitters and nannies to care for her children

Sienna 13 and Cole 11 while she put in the extra hours to give them the best life she could.

“I want my kids to be successful in life as well. I’m trying to give them opportunities that I never had” Ms Pirie said.

Back in New Zealand Ms Pirie was an avid mountain bike racer but gave that up when she “fell in love with real estate”.

No penalties for short-term rentals

She still prioritises staying active and wakes at 5am every day to head to the gym before getting the kids off to school and honing in on a productive work day.

“I’ve had one weekend off in about six months.”

For young women looking to enter the real estate industry Ms Pirie says it’s important to choose who you work for wisely.

“It’s really important to work with a dominant agency wher you’re starting out because it makes a big difference when you’re doing calls if people recognise the agency as being one of the best out. That’s half your work done for you” she says.

“Just work hard — the more calls you can do the more successful you will be. And don’t be shy.”

Handling the rejection that is part of the job comes with time she says but having someone to confide in helps.

“Real estate is a rollercoaster of emotions and it’s really important to not let those affect you.

“Sometimes it does and it’s really good to have someone to talk to when that happens because looking from the outside it’s never exactly what it seems to be when you’re in the middle of it” she says.

Ms Pirie says her move to Harcourts Coastal was due in part to managing director Dane Atherton’s commitment to the growth of agents within his teams.

Industry pioneer Lucy Cole was one of the first women in Queensland to open an independent agency Lucy Cole Prestige Properties.

She has grown the company from a one-woman operation to a highly respected brand with a team of 20 employees working across two offices.

Ms Cole counts winning the Real Estate Institute of Queensland Salesperson of the Year award three times among her proudest achievements.

“It was a moving experience to receive the accolade because I had been recovering from cancer” Ms Cole says.

“I could not attend the gala ceremony but was encouraged to do so. I could not even walk up the stairs to the ballroom and hold the large trophy.”

She recalls starting her agency as an “exciting but daunting dream” and says she is lucky that property is her passion not just her work.

“For me it is not uncommon to start work before the sun comes up and still be working well into the night.”

“However the joy of real estate is that it is not a 9-to-5 job and it means that you can take time out to enjoy other interests such as serving on committees charity work auctioneering or spending time with the grandkids” she says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L25ldGJhbGwvc3VwZXItbmV0YmFsbC1saXZlLWZldmVyLXN0YXItaG9sZHMtdGhlLWtleS1hcy11bmRlcmRvZ3MtbG9vay10by1iYW5pc2gtZ2hvc3RzLW9mLTIwMjAvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9kMjc2N2MwZTRlY2QyODQ4ZTI2MjI3ZDA4NTkwMmQ2YdIBpwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L25ldGJhbGwvc3VwZXItbmV0YmFsbC1saXZlLWZldmVyLXN0YXItaG9sZHMtdGhlLWtleS1hcy11bmRlcmRvZ3MtbG9vay10by1iYW5pc2gtZ2hvc3RzLW9mLTIwMjAvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9kMjc2N2MwZTRlY2QyODQ4ZTI2MjI3ZDA4NTkwMmQ2YQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Superstar’s all-time effort seals Super Netball semi in wild twist to sell-off drama,"A playoff record shooting performance from Jhaniele Fowler has helped West Coast Fever book a home grand final and move a step closer to a maiden Super Netball premiership with a 71-62 demolition of the Melbourne Vixens.

The victory also makes Netball Australia’s controversial decision to sell the grand final to Western Australia look a masterstroke given the Fever would have earnt the right for free under the old system.

Fowler finished with 67 goals to beat Romelda Aiken’s 63 in the 2016 grand final and just behind her own Super Netball general record of 70 goals

Massive underdogs after being beaten twice by the Vixens during the regular season and playing in front of a near full house at Melbourne’s John Cain Arena the Fever defied the odds to totally dominate the minor premiers who turned in an uncharacteristically error-riddled showing.

After breaking away with a nine-goal unanswered run late in the first quarter the Fever were never headed with the Vixens unable to find answers.

The Vixens were beaten across the court unable to make an impact in attack or defence as the Fever brought and aggression and energy that the home side was unable to match.

The Vixens had won both games against the Fever in the regular season and lost just twice all year heading into the clash.

But they made too many basic errors with co-captain Liz Watson admitting their performance was undeserving of delivering them to a grand final.

“To put out a performance like that you don’t deserve to go through to a grand final to be honest” Watson said.

“But we’ve got another week which is the positive and we just need to bring it from the start because we were just missing right from the first whistle today.”

The Vixens fought back through young gun Rhani Samason who sank a record-equalling 10 super shots to claw the margin back to nine goals after they led by as many as 21 late in the third term.

While Fowler was on song the Fever’s performance was stunning across the court.

Defenders Courtney Bruce and Sunday Aryang were outstanding Sasha Glasgow and Alice Teague-Neeld fed the circle brilliantly and the Fever did a Vixens on the Vixens with their full-court defensive pressure suffocating the minor premiers.

Captain Bruce said the Fever were “absolutely stoked” to make the decider.

“We wanted to earn the right to host that grand final and we’ve done that so I’m absolutely stoked” Bruce said.

“We really did our homework on the Vixens and I just think the switches between Sunday and I (in the defensive circle) were phenomenal.

“She was out there taking intercepts all day.”

Money for nothing

Netball Australia’s decision to sell the grand final to Western Australia is now looking like a genius move given the Fever would have earnt hosting rights anyway under the old system.

Until this year the winner of the major semi-final gained the right to hos the grand final as the first team into the season decider.

But in a move announced just two weeks before the finals Netball Australian announced it had struck a commercial deal with the West Australian government that would deliver around $650000 in cash and in-kind deals.

That’s now bonus money that will be invaluable to the financially flailing organisation’s bottom line.

Homework pays off

Fever captain Courtney Bruce said her team did their homework on the Vixens and while it showed all over the court it was no more evident than in the performance of Melbourne and Aussie captain Liz Watson.

Widely regarded as the best wing attack in the world Watson was kept incredibly quiet by her standards with many of her 33 feeds and 21 goal assists coming late in the match.

The Fever’s pressure forced Vixens coach Simone McKinnis to make an early shuffle in the midcourt with Watson moved to centre and co-captain Kate Moloney to wing defence.

But she shuffled them again with the Fever pressure continuing to pay off.

Fantastic Fowler

Jhaniele Fowler is such a dominant player her performances rarely get the credit they deserve given her ability to make the extraordinary seem so simple.

But there was no glossing over her semi-final showing or its importance to the Fever.

At 198cm the strong holding shooter is a massive target for the Fever but she is more than just her height and strength.

Accurate and athletic Fowler is an incredible target for the Fever and the growth of fellow goaler Sasha Glasgow this season has made it more difficult for defences to throw all their resources at the Jamaican without fear of being scored on.

So it's no surprise that a ranking of the most valuable sneaker investments from discount code website DealA found some pairs of iconic Nike kicks on reselling site StockX fetching as much as a nearly 150000% premium over their original retail prices.

At the top of the list – organized by how much more expensive the shoes are now than their original retail price – is the Nike Dunk SB Low Paris a limited-edition version of a Nike basketball sneaker first unveiled in 2003. Roughly 200 pairs were ever produced and each pair features cutouts from art by late French expressionist painter Bernard Buffet.

No two pairs of the sneakers are the same and they sold out immediately upon their release nearly two decades ago. Last year a pair sold for more than $130000 in the U.K. according to HypeBeast.

The sneakers originally retailed for $60. The lowest asking price DealA found offered by resellers on StockX was $89691. That's a return on investment of 149385% for anyone lucky enough to snag one at retail price.

Here are the five sneakers with the highest return on investment on StockX according to DealA:

Nike Dunk SB Low Paris: 149385% premium over original retail price 1985 Jordan 1 OG Bred: 145554% premium Nike SB Dunk Low London: 41400% premium Nike SB Dunk Low Tokyo: 38925% premium 1985 Jordan 1 OG Chicago: 22224% premium

Coming in second is the 1985 Jordan 1 OG Bred sneakers which the website describes as ""possibly the holy-grail to sneakerheads."" The black-and-red shoes were part of the first product line from Michael Jordan's multi-decade partnership with Nike.

On StockX DealA found that the lowest asking price for the classic sneakers – which originally retailed for $65 – was $94675 representing a premium of 145554% over the original price. Some pairs of the original Jordans are even more valuable: In 2020 a game-worn pair of the sneakers autographed by Jordan himself sold for $560000 at auction.

The rankings are dominated by Nike sneakers which reflects the Beaverton Oregon-based company's close connection to basketball. Nike and its Air Jordan label helped fuel the rise of sneakerhead culture to such a degree that DealA's rankings don't feature another brand until the 34th spot on the list.

That spot belongs to the ASICS Gel-Lyte III Ronnie Fieg Salmon Toe sneakers. Launched in 2011 the ASICS sneakers were the first shoes released in partnership with popular streetwear brand KITH.

As with any highly coveted and appreciable asset the trick is to get in on the ground floor. If you landed a pair of original Nike Jordans for $65 in 1985 and kept them in excellent condition for a few decades you're in great shape today.

That takes a level of luck and foresight that not every devout collector can possess.

Certain pairs of particularly rare sneakers have also been known to fetch truly eye-popping amounts of money. For instance in 2021 Sotheby's sold a pair of Nike Air Ships the first pair of sneakers Michael Jordan wore in the NBA during his 1985 rookie season for $1.47 million. That same year Sotheby's sold a prototype pair of Nike Air Yeezys – worn by rapper Kanye West to the 2008 Grammy Awards – for $1.8 million.

Model: Un-Cortez

Release Date: June 21

Buy: Union's physical and online store

Editor’s Notes: It feels like it's been months now since we've seen teasers of the Union LA x Nike Cortez shoes steadily floating about the sneaker 'net. Well now the wait is finally over as the collaborative sneakers arrive just in time for Summer '22.

Though sacai also has an impressive Cortez sneaker in the works Union's Cortez hits differently as it manifests as a love letter from one LA legend to another.

Since the Nike Cortez sneaker celebrates its 50th anniversary this year Union honors the LA icon — the Cortez that is — by reworking the model with modern updates while capturing the diverse spirit of the City of Angels.

Out the gate these obviously aren't the classic leather Cortez's you grew up wearing. No they've received dose of the Union treatment.

Like Union's past sneaker collabs the Un-Cortez utilizes the brand's signature color and texture juxtaposition materializing as a clever nod to LA's abundant cultural essence.

Up top a material clash ensues as paneled suede overlays rest over a striped knit foundation.

Meanwhile Nike's sustainable efforts come into play down below on the sneaker's midsole and outsole comprised of Nike's Crater Foam and Grind materials respectively.

Interestingly the tentative ""Grain"" colorway follows in the footsteps of Union's Jordan 2 ""Rattan"" and Jordan 4 ""Guava Ice"" incorporating the brand's signature color palette of tan icy blue and tropical red.

As a Cortez fan who still has the COMME DES GARÇONS platform sneakers on her wishlist I'm more than content with Union's spin on Nike's west coast staple.

While I'm already a fan of Union's sneakers I can appreciate the Un-Cortez. It's fresh but still has the feels of the timeless Cortez model that I've grown to love.

Undoubtedly like Union LA's previous Nike and Jordan sneakers I suspect the Un-Cortez will be a tough W even for Cortez lovers like myself.

The Englewood Flyover the lengthy bridge which raised Metra’s Rock Island District above the Norfolk Southern main line on the city’s South Side is the classic example.

For others the impact is far more operational than visual. The Argo Connections project B9 in the CREATE labeling system is a prime example. Most people may never see the infrastructure work being celebrated on Friday June 17 but its impact will be widespread.

CREATE (that’s Chicago Region Environmental And Transportation Efficiency) celebrated the completion of the Argo project with a ribbon cutting that brought out both the state’s U.S. senators U.S. Rep. Marie Newman and a host of other government and railroad officials. It’s the 32nd project to be completed of the 70 on CREATE’s agenda since the program began in 2003.

“The big problem we are addressing with each of these projects is how to move trains through the Chicagoland area more quickly” said U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin. “Why is that important? Well there are two reasons that come to mind immediately. One is called supply chain. Have you heard the term? We know the inflation we are facing reflects the fact that the supply chain is not as efficient as it should be.

“The other problem we are facing is how to move trains some with passengers some with freight through the same areas in an efficient way … That is one of the bottom-line accomplishments on this particular B9 project.”

Added U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth “Our rail system carries nearly half of all intermodal rail containers and nearly 30% of all the railcars right here. It’s really crucial that we move goods quickly and efficiently so we can keep the costs down.”

The project involved building a new double-track connection and new crossovers at the connection between the Belt Railway of Chicago and an Indiana Harbor Belt/CSX Transportation line at Argo adjacent to Archer and 63rd streets in Summit with additional crossovers at a control point at 71st Street raising speeds from 10 to 25 mph.

That connection doesn’t directly involve Metra commuter trains — although its Heritage Corridor trains cross a nearby diamond and stop in Summit — but Metra’s CEO Jim Derwinski was as passionate as anyone in extolling its benefits during the series of speakers marking the project’s completion. He noted the huge collection of partners in the effort to make the 1500 trains that move in Chicago each weekday — roughly 700 freights 700 from Metra and 100 from Amtrak — do so more smoothly

“Six Class I railroads Metra Amtrak the federal government the state of Illinois the county of Cook all of our municipal partners along with IDOT” — the Illinois Department of Transportation — “it’s an amazing project” Derwinski said. “And every time we get together for a ribbon cutting or even a groundbreaking it reminds us where we have come to.

“We didn’t do that in the past. That’s why this network got congested. And even though we’re here on CSX property this project benefits Metra. It benefits Metra’s riders. Because it decongests another portion of the network today.”

A few minutes later in a conversation with Trains News Wire Derwinski elaborated on the Argo project’s impact.

“It relieves pressure at the areas where we cross the freight traffic” he said. “… On the Heritage Corridor alone we cross six different rail crossings and on an average day there’s 150 movements over those crossings. So to keep those commuter trains on time it’s really about clearing the freight train from its slot at that crossing. And projects like this speeding up the throughput and opening up a little more capacity are going to get the freight trains through those crossings faster.”

The freight railroads certainly welcome that additional capacity as well.

“For the IHB it means more fluidity in and out of Argo but we also see it as an opportunity to increase business up the road” said Indiana Harbor Belt General Manager John Wright. “We have terminals up in Norpaul” — about 10 miles away in Franklin Park Ill. — “that we want to develop for future business so it gives us more velocity through this area adds another track for trains coming out of the BRC railroad and obviously helps our partners with Metra and Amtrak in getting across the diamond. … When you can go high speed at what is basically a crossroad it makes a big difference in the fluidity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvYW5jaG9ybWFuLWFjdG9yLWRhdmlkLWtvZWNobmVyLWFycmVzdGVkLWluLW9oaW8tb24tb3ZpLWNoYXJnZS9hcnRpY2xlXzRhNzEyNjNkLWNjMjMtNWU1YS1hOGRkLTgyZWZkZjkzNGEwMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Anchorman' actor David Koechner arrested in Ohio on OVI charge,"Memphis TN (38111)

“It is a huge mistake. The unions have been gunning for this strike throughout. This strike is completely unnecessary” he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme.

“It is going to inconvenience millions of people – students doing their GCSEs and A-levels people trying to get to hospitals to get operations that have been postponed perhaps during coronavirus.

“It is disastrous. It is no way to behave on the railway. There is no advantage to this. I know Mick Lynch says he is ‘nostalgic for union power’ but this is no way to behave.”

But the Transport Secretary played down fears that the strikes could lead to UK food shortages and prevent fuel from reaching power stations petrol pumps and airlines.

Asked if it’s a possibility that the strikes could cause the lights to go out Mr Shapps said: “No I don’t think we will see that.

“Even while the strikes are ungoing we will see freight moving around at perhaps 50 per cent of the normal levels.”

A Network Rail spokesman said that on strike days vital freight trains will run during the day and take priority over passenger services.

Jake Kelly Network Operations Director at Network Rail said: “We are working nonstop to keep nationally important freight flows – including supermarket supplies and fuel – moving during strike action.”

But a 50 per cent disruption is still significant with freight trains carrying important goods such as supermarket deliveries.

Rail is increasingly being used by supermarkets to transport goods.

Tesco last year introduced a refrigerated rail service to help it deliver goods and reduce carbon emissions by taking 17000 trucks off the road. In October it said it would increase its use of trains to distribute products by almost 40 per cent crediting rail for helping keep shelves stocked during HGV driver shortages.

i reported earlier this month that there is a genuine risk the strikes could lead to empty supermarket shelves this week.

The strikes will also affect key freight deliveries such as fuel for commercial airlines and biomass – used to generate energy – to power stations.

A Government source said Drax power station had 10 days of stockpiles which means the strikes are unlikely to adversely affect the power station while fuel supplier Puma has enough storage to survive a 24-hour walkout and officials expect hauliers and other operators to make up the shortfall deliveries to mitigate the impact at the petrol pumps.

But fears remain that supply chains could still be severely disrupted as a result of freight lines being hit by the strikes.

Rail Freight Group Director General Maggie Simpson OBE said: “The pattern of proposed strike action is about as bad as it gets for rail freight with disruption likely across the entire week and into the weekend.

“Even with the plans that are in place supply chains will be impacted and it is really damaging to customer confidence in rail and to future growth.”

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to comment on this in a speech to the Labour Local Government Association conference in Warwick on Sunday.

“Businesses will struggle with freight. School exams will be hard to get to. Hospital appointments missed” Starmer will say. “That’s why I have said the strikes should not go ahead.”

It comes as Britain faces its biggest rail strike in almost a century which will bring the country to a standstill as thousands of workers protest over pay jobs and pensions.

Strikes will take place across 13 trail operators on June 21 23 and 25. National Rail have warned the walk out will cause six days of disruption because services will be affected on the days in between.

Fewer than one in five trains are likely to run and only between 7am and 6.30pm.

A tube strike has also been announced for 21 June which will grind the Transport for London network to a halt and disrupt travel for millions of London commuters.

The strikes threaten widespread travel disruption during a number of major events including concerts Test match cricket and the Glastonbury festival.

Glastonbury starts on June 22 while that week will also see England play New Zealand in a Test match in Leeds the British Athletics Championships in Manchester and gigs in London’s Hyde Park by Sir Elton John (June 24) and The Rolling Stones (June 25).

There will also be a Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London on June 24 and 25 and it is Armed Forces Day on June 25.

Mr Lynch said thousands of jobs were being cut across the rail networks and workers were facing below-inflation pay rises.

“We don’t want to be the cause of disruption in people’s lives we want to settle this dispute – but we’re facing a crisis” he told Sky News.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The government committed £16 billion – or £600 per household – to keep our railways running throughout the pandemic while ensuring not a single worker lost their job.

“The railway is still on life support with passenger numbers 25 per cent down and anything that drives away even more of them risks killing services and jobs.

“Train travel for millions more people is now a choice not a necessity. Strikes stop our customers choosing rail and they might never return.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVhdGxhbnRhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dlb3JnaWEtc3BlbmRzLTE4LTZtLW9uLW5ldy1wbGFudC1zaXRlLWFmdGVyLTItYmlnLXNjb3Jlc9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVhdGxhbnRhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dlb3JnaWEtc3BlbmRzLTE4LTZtLW9uLW5ldy1wbGFudC1zaXRlLWFmdGVyLTItYmlnLXNjb3Jlcy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Georgia spends $18.6M on new plant site after 2 big scores,"The state of Georgia and the Peach County Development Authority have bought 1100 acres (450 hectares) in the middle Georgia county for $18.6 million hoping to attract a large industry like the Rivian Automotive and Hyundai Motor Group plants that have recently been announced east of Atlanta and near Savannah.

The state has already been marketing the land which is 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of Interstate 75 near Fort Valley but officials say owning it makes it more attractive to a user.

""It boils down to speed to market being a driving factor in a company’s decision making process"" said Jessica Atwell a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Economic Development. ""The more we can do to speed up that timeline the more likely a company is to choose a site.""

The development authority and state completed the purchase of four separate parcels of land on Wednesday.

The site also has access to the Norfolk Southern Railway and plans ready for development. A conceptual site plan posted online by Peach County officials shows it’s large enough to host an auto assembly plant.

""It can provide for easy access to a site with utilities"" for larger original equipment manufacturers B.J. Walker the development authority’s executive director told WMAZ-TV

Atwell said the state will ""evaluate all opportunities"" but that ""we would prefer to locate a single end-user"" who can make the best use of the site’s advantages."" The state must approve the lease or sale of the property Atwell said. The state is seeing increased demand for large sites she said.

Hyundai said in May that it would invest $5.5 billion on an electric vehicle and battery plant in the Bryan County hamlet of Ellabell that’s projected to employ 8100 workers. The state and local officials spent $61 million to buy 2200 acres (900 hectares) in the county last year. They later agreed to add 2900 more acres (1173 hectares) for Hyundai at an as of yet undisclosed additional cost.

Rivian said in December that it would invest in a $5 billion electric truck plant east of Atlanta that’s expected to employ about 7500 workers. That plant is located on 2000 acres (800-hectares).

""Even after announcing the two largest projects in the State’s history back-to-back we remain focused on attracting key industries and investment by providing the project sites companies need"" Gov. Brian Kemp said in a statement.

Rivian’s location near Social Circle aroused opposition from neighbors who said it would spoil the rural area. At least some Peach County neighbors also say they they’re not excited for a big factory on a two-lane highway now dominated by peach and pecan groves.

""The potential environmental impact I think that risk is greater than what we should take"" neighbor Harry Houpt said.

Although he is not a member of the PGA Tour yet he is considered one of the best in the world now.

The current world no. 14 has been in the top order for all the majors he has played except for two. He missed the cut at the 2021 U. S. Open whereas the young golfer had to withdraw from the Open Championship.

The 1-time Korn Ferry Tour champion has never won a PGA Tour title. As a young golfer of 25 he has seen his best and worst since he turned professional in 2018. Failure or victory his caddie Ryan Goble has been a part of the Zalatoris’ golfing journey.

Notably Zalatoris considers his caddie the main reason why he got to win the TPC Colorado Championship on the Korn Ferry Tour. According to him Goble’s intervention at the right time made him slow down his game thus winning it by a one-shot lead.

As one of the primary support systems of the 25-year-old let’s find out everything about his long-time caddie Ryan Goble!

Who is Ryan Goble?

Unlike other caddies Ryan Goble’s first choice of sport has never been golf. In fact he grew up playing basketball and has even served as the captain of his high school and college teams.

Later Goble coached the Exeter High School boys basketball team to the Division III Championship. Following that he became a men’s golf team’s assistant coach.

Before becoming the caddie for Zalatoris Goble carried the bag for the PGA Tour professional player John Merrick. Notably he was the caddie of Merrick when he won his only victory at Riviera in 2013. Goble also made his debut at the Augusta National with the first golfer he caddied.

Following Merrick the former basketball coach caddied for Spencer Levin Michael Thompson and K.H. Lee. However his only victory on the PGA Tour is still one the 2013 Northern Trust Open with John Merrick.

When did Ryan Goble start caddying for Will Zalatoris?

After leaving K. H. Lee Goble worked in a local golf club in North Carolina. According to him John Merrick’s manager who also managed Will Zalatoris contacted asking whether he could caddie for the Korn Ferry pro.

Since he was not on PGA Tour and thus the payment would be less Goble didn’t like the idea at first. However after missing a couple of chances to caddie for him due to personal reasons Goble started caddying for the golfer Lecom Health Challenge in 2019.

“The first practice round with that kid” Goble said about his first impression of the golfer. “And I thought ‘Oh wow’ because he’s that talented.”

The duo hasn’t won many championship titles in golf. Yet their bond is still going strong and believe their hard work will pay off one day. Do you think the golfer and caddie can win a major title in 2022?

Ann Marie’s business has been built around regular participation at food markets especially the successful Causeway Speciality Market in Coleraine on a monthly basis. She also showed her preserves at the recent Balmoral Show in the Food NI Food Pavilion.

“I am really thrilled to have received the order from the National Trust” says Ann Marie. “The negotiations began many months ago and followed a lead last year from Taste Causeway promotional operation and Naturally North Coast and Glens for producers of preserves to supply the Trust. I decided to pitch some samples for tasting and was delighted recently to secure what will be very important business for my small company.

“Taste Causeway and Naturally North Coast Glens have been immensely supportive over the years.”

Around 90% of her sales largely revolved around trading at markets. She admits to being “devastated“ when the coronavirus pandemic led to the closure of the markets. She didn’t then sell to stores. The setback however led Ann Marie to step up contacts with local food stores in particular.

Ann Marie set up Annie’s Delights a small bakery and producer of jams relishes and chutneys in 2016 following suggestions from family and friends who had long enjoyed her home produce. The success of the part-time business subsequently encouraged Ann Marie to quit her day job and to focus on the small artisan enterprise.

She chose the name Annie’s Delights because her family and friends have long called her Annie “all through my childhood and still do”.

Many of her original products are influenced by her upbringing in rural county Antrim.

“My boiled cake for instance is from mum’s recipe” she continues. “And I remember baking this with her as a child. I also started making jams and wheaten bread as my family love nothing better than bread butter and jam. People around the town and wider community then started asking me for these and other handcrafted products. I also started doing local food markets including the popular Causeway Speciality Market in Coleraine every month….until the lockdown inevitably led to their closure. It was great therefore to see it resume earlier in the year.

do it as I bake everything fresh daily for markets. Customers therefore can count on the wholesomeness and quality of everything I make. All the products and ingredients have total traceability. I make them at home in my kitchen in small batches to ensure quality.”

Her original products have won acclaim over the past two years from the influential UK Great Taste and the Blas na hEireann Irish Food Awards. Ann Marie won two silvers at Blas na hEireann for her pear apple and apricot chutney and her lemon curd. The latter also gained a UK Great Taste Award.

“I was thrilled to receive the awards because they are a marvellous endorsement of the quality and taste of my handcrafted products” Ann Marie adds. She also gained an Innovate NI award for innovation during the lockdown for ‘thinking outside the box’ to keep the business trading during the pandemic.

The Innovation award recognised her response to the serious setback to her business by the closure of local farmers’ and food markets due to the pandemic.

“I quickly developed a home delivery service to existing and potential customers from markets. I then decided to invest in my website for online sales quite a step for me.

The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) Prof. Peter Umeadi has urged Igbo traditional rulers in the 19 northern states to work hard and in conjunction with is running mate Alhaji Abdullahi Koli Mohammed to win elections in the north for him.

Umeadi who eulogised his VP said APGA is a great project because the quality of the personalities flying the party’s ticket.

The presidential candidate who was the Chief judge of Anambra State spoke in Abuja when Association of Ndieze Igbo in the 19 Northern States endorsed his candidature.

He said: “You now have a capable man who will assist you every inch of the way in the north in a bid to delivering APGA in the north. The party now has a national outlook and a credible and formidable team which we will take to the 2023 elections where we hope to emerge victorious.”

Mohammed on his part said the endorsement of their was a historic moment and a blessing adding that that was all they needed to clinch the presidency.

He said it was his pleasure to meet and work with an accomplished professor of law like Umeadi.

Mohammed further said the cock which is the mascot of APGA signifies doggedness and love and care saying the party is poised to imbibe those qualities and use them to advance socio-economic fortunes of Nigeria.

He therefore charged the chiefs to pool their resources together and support the cause of APGA and drive the presidential ambition of Prof. Umeadi.

Earlier chairman of the association HRH Igwe Ikechukwu Akpudo the Ndieze Igbo Kano who spoke on behave of the chiefs said they endorsed the Umeadi/Mohammed ticket because of their sterling leadership qualities.

Liftoff occurred at 12:27 AM EDT (04:27 UTC) from Space Launch Complex 40 of the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station with the rocket’s official mission being the deployment of a single replacement satellite for communications operator Globalstar.

The Globalstar-2 FM15 spacecraft was manufactured by Thales Alenia Space as part of Globalstar’s second-generation constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) communications satellites. While 24 of its sister craft were deployed between 2010 and 2013 it has remained on Earth until now as a ground spare. Now it is launching to be on hand to reinforce the network as the existing satellites begin to show their age.

Globalstar uses its fleet of satellites to provide voice and data communications worldwide. The company’s first-generation constellation was deployed between 1998 and 2000 and consisted of 48 operational satellites plus on-orbit spares. The second-generation system was originally designed with 32 satellites but downsized to the 24 that are currently in orbit.

These second-generation satellites including FM15 are based on Thales’ Extended Lifetime Bus 1000 (ELiTeBus-1000) platform and have an operational life expectancy of 15 years. The 24 satellites already in orbit were launched in groups of six atop Soyuz-2-1a/Fregat rockets which flew from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Globalstar plans to replace these satellites with a third-generation spacecraft which will be phased in from 2025. Earlier this year the company awarded a contract to Canada’s MDA Corporation to build the first 17 replacement satellites.

FM15 was part of an initial batch of 25 satellites procured for Globalstar’s second-generation constellation. The company had intended to order additional satellites as spares; however in 2011 Thales rejected an order for an additional six spacecraft after a contractual dispute between the two companies. This has left FM15 as Globalstar’s only available spare satellite and it has been held in reserve until now. Launching FM15 will help to keep the constellation operational until the MDA-built satellites begin to come online.

With a mass of 700 kilograms the Globalstar-2 satellite is well below the carrying capacity of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that has been selected to deliver it to orbit. In addition the Falcon 9’s first stage booster landed aboard the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS) Just Read the Instructions downrange of Cape Canaveral.

The ASDS is typically used when the rocket is carrying heavier payloads or targeting higher orbits where performance constraints prevent it flying a Return To Launch Site (RTLS) profile instead.

These factors lend weight to rumors that a clandestine US Government payload was also aboard the rocket for Sunday’s launch joining Globalstar-2 FM15 for the ride into orbit.

If so this is an unusually high level of secrecy: for most classified launches the agency responsible is at least identified and the launch is announced – often with an unclassified mission name such as the NRO Launch (NROL) designations used by missions for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).

Images of the second stage during the coast phase did show a rather unique setup on the adaptor.



One notable past exception to this practice was a previous Falcon 9 launch carried out in January 2018. That launch carried a satellite called Zuma built by Northrop Grumman for a still-undisclosed US Government customer. Flying an RTLS mission Falcon successfully delivered Zuma into a planned low Earth orbit with an inclination of around 51°.

As part of the payload however Northrop Grumman had provided their own separation mechanism to attach Zuma to the rocket and this reportedly failed to operate. This meant that the satellite was still attached to Falcon’s upper stage when it performed a deorbit burn to dispose of itself safely and was destroyed when the stage burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere on re-entry.

With Globalstar’s constellation operating in a 52° orbit if FM15 has a co-passenger that is a successor to or replacement for Zuma the rocket will not have to make a particularly significant adjustment to its orbit in order to deploy the two satellites on their planned courses. On the other hand the Zuma launch did not require the ASDS for recovery – although this could be explained by the additional presence of the Globalstar satellite and the need to deploy the satellites into different orbits.

Two NRO launches have also flown to similarly-inclined orbits in recent years both aboard Falcon 9 rockets. NROL-76 was launched in May 2017 and NROL-108 which consisted of two satellites followed in December 2020. It is currently unclear whether these missions are related to each other with observers speculating that they might be technology demonstrators.

It is also possible that the second payload could be another lightweight satellite – or indeed several smaller satellites – leaving Falcon 9 with more performance to spare for orbit-changing maneuvers. This might allow it to unload its secret cargo into a completely different orbit after first dropping the Globalstar spacecraft off on its planned trajectory.

Either way barring any official acknowledgment of the clandestine aspect of Sunday’s launch the first indications of what Falcon 9 has deployed into orbit are likely to come from amateur satellite watchers who post their observations to mailing lists like SeeSat-L.

Before the payloads can be observed in orbit however they first had to get there. SpaceX used a Falcon 9 rocket to carry out Sunday’s mission with liftoff occurring from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket consisting of a reusable first stage booster and an expendable second stage. A payload fairing – which can also be recovered and re-used – encloses the satellites at the nose of the rocket. SpaceX launched its first Falcon 9 in June 2010 and the vehicle has since completed over 150 successful missions with only one in-flight failure.

Nine Merlin-1D engines developed in-house by SpaceX powered the rocket’s first stage during the early phase of its flight. After lifting off from SLC-40 the rocket rolled and pitched over onto a north-easterly heading to align with its target orbit. About 70 seconds into the flight it passed through Max-Q the area of maximum dynamic pressure going supersonic around the same time.

The first stage that powered Sunday’s mission was booster B1061-9. A veteran of eight previous launches it first flew in November 2020 and has flown one of the most eclectic collections of missions for any Falcon 9 booster. Its first two missions were dedicated to NASA’s Commercial Crew program assisting the program’s first operational crew rotation flights to the International Space Station by boosting Crew Dragons Resilience and Endeavour into orbit on their respective Crew-1 and Crew-2 missions.

The booster’s first uncrewed launch came in June 2021 when it helped deploy the SXM-8 communications satellite for SiriusXM before flying a Cargo Dragon mission CRS-23 in August. B1061’s fifth launch deployed NASA’s Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) last December. Since then the booster has carried out a Starlink launch – Group 4-7 in February – and has flown the two most recent multi-payload Transporter missions in April and May.

B1061-9 powered Sunday’s mission for about the first two minutes and 31 seconds of flight before its engines shut down: an event designated Main Engine Cutoff or MECO. Stage separation occurred about four seconds later with Falcon’s second stage continuing towards orbit with the payloads while B1061-9 began its return to Earth. The second stage lit its single Merlin Vacuum (MVac) engine a vacuum-optimized version of the Merlin-1D about eight seconds after staging.

The two halves of the fairing fell away from the rocket at T+ two minutes and 54 seconds having completed their job of protecting the payload during the climb through the atmosphere. After re-entry each half of the fairing will deploy a parachute as it descends into the Atlantic Ocean where SpaceX’s recovery boats will pick them up and return them to shore for future re-use.

The second stage completed a series of three burns prior to deploying the Globalstar payload at T+ one hour 53 minutes and 21 seconds. If any unannounced rideshare payloads are to be deployed on Sunday’s mission it is not clear whether they would separate before or after Globalstar.

While the second stage continued towards orbit to fulfill the primary objectives of Sunday’s mission B1061-9 made its return to Earth. After stage separation it reoriented itself and deployed the grid fins that will help to provide guidance as it falls back through the atmosphere. With the drone ship Just Read The Instructions positioned downrange to receive it no boostback burn was required during this mission so it only needed to make entry and landing burns during this flight.

(Photo caption: B1061 returns to Port Canaveral aboard Just Read The Instructions after the Transporter-4 mission)

The entry burn helps to reduce heating on the stage as it re-enters the atmosphere using three of the Merlin-1D engines. Shortly before touchdown the center engine lit up again for the landing burn slowing B1069-9 to a soft touchdown on the deck of Just Read The Instructions.

Sunday’s launch was the third Falcon 9 mission in the space of 36 hours which have used all three of SpaceX’s launch pads. The trio of launches began with a Starlink mission from Falcon’s other East Coast launch pad: Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 12:09 PM EDT (16:09 UTC) on Friday. This was followed by Saturday’s launch of the German SARah-1 radar imaging satellite out of Vandenberg Space Force Base on the West Coast. The SARah-1 launch lifted off at 7:19 AM PDT (14:19 UTC) less than 15 hours before the Globalstar mission.

According to the defense ministry this aircraft has transported more than 300 injured and wounded Ukrainian nationals from Poland to Germany for treatment on ten flights since mid-April 2022.

An extension of the service life of four of these A310-304s all of which were built in the 1980s and 1990s and some of which still came from “Interflug” stocks beyond 2021 was not pursued further with a gradual parallel transfer of tasks to the new A330 in the multinational MRTT unit in Eindhoven.

Shortly before the outbreak of war in Ukraine it was decided to extend the use of the last A310 until June this year. The defense ministry decided to cut further extensions as the aircraft is due for a maintenance check lasting several months. The deadline for this “D-Check” was already extended as part of the decision from earlier this year. The extension was made possible by an exemption that can only be granted once. However for reasons of aeronautical safety continued operation without this “D-Check” is not possible and also not legally permissible the defense ministry explained.

In recent years the last five A310s have been slowly transferring their tasks to the growing A330 fleet of the Multinational Multi Role Tanker Transport Unit or MMU for short in Eindhoven.

Pending certification by the Dutch authorities the A400M will initially take over the medical evacuation (MedEvac) mission that was performed by the A310.

Additionally Germany is preparing to receive the first of two A321-200NX passenger aircraft that will be modified for these missions. The two aircraft will be operated by the Executive Transport Wing of the German defense ministry which operates as part of the air force.

The Air Force most recently had five Airbus 310-304 aircraft at its disposal four of which were also deployable in the MedEvac role as “multi tole transport tankers (MRTT)” for the core capability “strategic air patient transport.”

Until the multinational A330 MRTT in the MedEvac role is certified by the Dutch certification authorities – which is expected in the coming months – Air Transport Wing 62 in Wunstorf Lower Saxony will take over the core mission of tactical and strategic air patient transport with the A400M.",,,,,,

Proceed at your own risk!

Kimiko and Frenchie weren’t the only pair moving into new territory on The Boys this week.

More from TVLine

In the latest episode Butcher told Maeve that the trip to Russia in search of a weapon capable of killing Homelander came up empty. Feeling defeated the two got drunk — so much for their sobriety — and commiserated about the sad state of affairs. Then Maeve leaned into Butcher and… the two kissed! When Butcher stood up with a sternly shocked expression Maeve followed and challengingly replied “Still think you’re too good for me?” Let’s just say he definitely wasn’t too good to not have sex with her.

“The writers talked about that moment as like desperate and a little grimy” showrunner Eric Kripke tells TVLine. “We talked about Monster’s Ball when Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry hook up and it’s just so grimy because they’re both mourning deaths. So we talked a lot about [how] they’re both so cornered right then and there and they both have so much in common surprisingly [in] how much they hate Homelander how much they hate superheroes in general how f—ked they both feel. And then it just kind of explodes in this hookup.”

The Boys Butcher/Maeve

If Butcher and Maeve’s unexpected moment of passion seemed familiar in its staging and tone that might be because star Karl Urban took inspiration from a famous erotic thriller. “He got really interested in the first big sex scene between Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange in The Postman Always Rings Twice because it’s so desperate and grimy and fast and he was really inspired by that” Kripke shares. “If you actually put the two sex scenes up next to each other they’re pretty similar. It was just about kind of capturing that energy of desperation.”

Unfortunately for Maeve Homelander could smell Butcher on her after the hookup leading him and Black Noir to kidnapped her. Starlight feared that Maeve was dead which Ashley would neither confirm nor deny instead spinning a story about how Maeve had entered a wellness center for treatment.

“You should be very concerned about [Maeve’s] wellbeing but tune in to see. She’s in a tight spot” Kripke teases.

As for whether Homelander’s decision to take Maeve captive was an act of jealousy or about him feeling betrayed Kripke believes his response was the culmination of many perceived threats over the years. “I don’t think it was an impulsive moment” Kripke says. “For Homelander it was a long time coming. It’s the airplane video that Maeve has been blackmailing him with it’s years of small slights that he like banks away. For the writers it was a sign of oh wow this guy really is in control at Vought because he’s starting to settle his debts and that’s what makes him so scary.”

The Boys fans what did you think of Butcher and Maeve’s hookup? And do you think Maeve is alive or dead?

Sign up for our newsletters to stay up to date on the stories that matter.

Rising Lake Michigan levels strong wind gusts and waves of nearly 10 feet high all from extreme weather brought on by climate change pose toxic threats to the entire lakefront — stretching from Zion to the Southeast Side and even to Northwest Indiana a new analysis finds.

Waukegan says goodbye to a coal plant but must contend with its industrial waste read more

A just-released report examines possible climate-related disasters caused by high lake levels powerful storms and erosion along Lake Michigan.

The report by Chicago’s Environmental Law and Policy Center largely focuses on toxic hazards in four states bordering the lake but also notes that densely populated neighborhoods — including Rogers Park Edgewater and Uptown on the North Side and South Shore on the South Side — face potentially devastating flooding if weather patterns continue as they have. Large parts of those areas may face more severe flooding as much as a half-mile inland.

“Lake Michigan is where we live work and play” said ELPC Executive Director Howard Learner in an interview. “Climate change is forcing us to see another side of Lake Michigan.”

Using government data study authors simulated different flood levels and mapped the potential impacts.

In a seven-year period that began with a historic low in 2013 the average level of Lake Michigan rose 6 feet. If those swings along with high wind and waves continue toxic-waste Superfund sites a recently closed coal plant in Waukegan north of Chicago and a dismantled nuclear plant in Zion all represent an opportunity for water to “breach facility barriers and carry industrial pollutants to surrounding areas and into Lake Michigan” the report said.

“A major storm surge combined with high lake levels could simultaneously flood streets homes and businesses from Zion to the Southeast Side of Chicago” according to the report which also looked at hazards in Wisconsin Indiana and Michigan. “A major flood could also threaten public health by carrying contaminants such as PCBs and heavy metals into populous neighborhoods.”

PCBs are shorthand for polychlorinated biphenyls a once widely used cancer-causing industrial chemical that is now banned.

The PCB chemicals are present at the former location of Outboard Marine one of four Superfund toxic-waste sites in Waukegan. Those sites neighbor the recently closed NRG Energy coal plant and nearby coal-ash ponds. The other Superfund locations are Johns-Manville and two formerly operated by North Shore Gas. The combination of toxic sources — all built decades ago — in the city of almost 90000 people makes it stand out in Illinois as they all “create significant risk and potential problems” Learner said.

In addition to cleaning up the toxic sites and reassessing them as a potential threat government officials need to consider natural remedies such as wetlands restoration and green infrastructure such as vegetated landscaping Learner said.

Zoning and planning also needs to be re-evaluated he added.

“Policymakers need to rethink the Lake Michigan shore’s built environment” Learner said and “make decisions based on today’s realities.”

Just north of Waukegan spent nuclear fuel is encased along the lake in Zion. The nuclear plant there was shut down in 1998 and its dismantling now completed began more than a decade ago. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said government officials continue to inspect the site to ensure that it’s safe and not a health or environmental hazard. But there’s no place for the fuel to be transferred and therefore there is not a timeline for removing it.

The ELPC report urges regulators to update their reviews for protection against potential flooding something the nuclear commission spokeswoman said is ongoing.

On the Southeast Side several locations including a closed scrap-metal operation by Sims Metal a dump for Calumet River dredged material and a shipping terminal managed by the Illinois International Port District all contain toxic materials that can spread to neighborhoods and into the lake if flooded the report said.

Just to the east in Northwest Indiana a number of current and former industrial sites raise pollution concerns including the U.S. Steel Gary Works and the now-demolished State Line coal plant the report noted.

Other threats remain including a lakeside wastewater treatment plant in South Haven Michigan as well as two wastewater facilities in Manitowoc and Two Rivers in Wisconsin. Areas of the Alliant Edgewater coal plant and its ash ponds in Sheboygan Wisconsin may also be vulnerable to flood waters the report said.

NUE,Nucor,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvanVuLzE5L2hlYXZ5LW1ldGFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OPINION | REX NELSON: How steel came to overpower cotton as the strongest product of northeast Arkansas ...,"I've finished my speech at a luncheon meeting of the Mississippi County Regional Chamber of Commerce at the Holiday Inn in Blytheville. Cliff Chitwood walks over and hands me a cap. I get plenty of free caps--more than I'll ever wear--in my travels across Arkansas but I particularly like this one. It says ""Cotton to Steel.""

I've long been fascinated by the rich history of this sprawling northeast Arkansas county which at one time claimed to grow more cotton than any other county in America. The transformation of Mississippi County from top cotton-producing county to top steel-producing county is an amazing story.

The Great River Economic Development Foundation which Chitwood heads is the organization behind the ""Cotton to Steel"" campaign. GREDF was formed in 2002 to recruit businesses to the county which has been losing population for decades. It's funded by a county-wide half-cent sales tax for economic development.

Prior to becoming GREDF president Chitwood was marketing director for the Blytheville-Gosnell Regional Airport Authority which is tasked with finding uses for the former Eaker Air Force Base. In 2010 the association that represents Arkansas economic developers recognized Chitwood as its developer of the year. A graduate of the University of Arkansas with a degree in finance and economics he once worked as a UA development officer.

The transformation here began in 1987 when Nucor-Yamato Steel constructed a mill in the Blytheville area. Nearby Nucor Steel Arkansas locally known as Nucor Hickman began production in 1992 and expanded in 1998. Nucor-Yamato was formed as a joint venture between Nucor and Yamato Kogyo. The plant now has the ability to produce more than 2.5 million tons per year.

The two steel plants were surrounded by steel-related industries such as Milwaukee Electric Tool Corp. (which closed in 2008) and Maverick Tube Corp. (now Tenaris).

The Blytheville-area steel mills have produced what are known as hot band cold roll galvanized galvanneal and painted sheet types of steel used in the automotive energy appliance construction and agricultural equipment industries. Since 2018 Nucor has invested almost $750 million in facility upgrades.

In 2017 Big River Steel began operations at its $1.3 billion scrap metal recycling and flat-rolled steel production facility near Osceola. It wasn't long until Big River was providing steel to more than 200 customers. An expansion was planned almost immediately and completed in November 2020.

Lenore Trammell Big River's chief administrative officer said at the time of the expansion: ""Our location in Osceola is steel mill heaven because of our proximity to a main-line railroad major highways and the Mississippi River. That allows us to easily receive raw materials including recycled scrap and then ship steel via a variety of transportation methods.""

In July 2019 Zekelman Industries announced it would build another tube mill adjacent to its existing Atlas Tube mill in Blytheville. The expansion produced 75 additional jobs and cost $150 million. Production at the facility began earlier this year.

In October 2019 Nucor opened a $230 million specialty cold mill complex on its Hickman land. The complex expanded Nucor's capability to produce automotive-grade steel. Almost 100 additional workers were added at an average salary of $80000 annually.

""With today's automakers counting on steel as their material of choice to reduce vehicle weight while at the same time improving safety and performance our new cold mill will be at the forefront of making these advanced high-strength steel products"" Nucor Steel Arkansas general manager Jay Henderson said at the time.

The expansion pushed Nucor's total employment in Arkansas above 1800.

Last August Majestic Steel USA announced that it was adding a service center and processing facility on Nucor's Hickman campus. The 515000-square-foot complex will have advanced processing and warehousing equipment and create 225 jobs. The facility is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year.

Majestic founded in 1979 and headquartered in Cleveland will process and stock steel products for businesses across the region.

The biggest of all announcements came in January when U.S. Steel Corp. (which earlier purchased Big River) said it will locate a $3 billion mill near Osceola creating 900 jobs with an average pay of more than $100000 annually. It will be the largest private capital investment in Arkansas history.

The mill will have two electric arc furnaces with three million tons per year of advanced steelmaking capacity. The plant also will feature advanced finishing capabilities. U.S. Steel president and CEO David Burritt said in January that the new plant will ""reshape the future of steelmaking. We had numerous competitive site options but Osceola offers our customers incomparable advantages.""

Alabama and Mississippi were also in the running for the mill. The Arkansas Legislature held a special session last year to put together an incentive package. Industry experts say it will be the most advanced steel mill ever constructed.

""Our nation and our customers need a robust and resilient supply chain to meet consumers' needs and that starts with U.S. Steel's advanced sustainable steels"" Burritt said in January. ""Steel is critical to so much of what the world builds so how we make our products contributes directly to a better more sustainable world for all. This new facility will build that future.""

The facility will be adjacent to the Big River mill. Together the two mills will be known as Big River Steel Works. U.S. Steel is moving quickly with project completion expected by 2024.

Arkansas Commerce Secretary Mike Preston says the selection of Mississippi County ""speaks volumes about the business climate and workforce in the area. By being the home of the first mill in the country to use endless casting and rolling technology the steel industry will continue to recognize Arkansas for excellence in steel production.""

In an April speech to the Arkansas Economic Development Foundation Burritt said his employees have been offered everything from free bottled water to help moving into their homes.

""This is a great place to do business and it's because of the people you have here"" Burritt said. ""We love the culture in Osceola. They make our people feel extraordinarily welcome. I'm bullish about our business and about Arkansas--bullish with a capital B.""

Other announcements followed.

Electric vehicle manufacturer Envirotech Vehicles Inc. is trying to raise the capital necessary to make an $80.7 million investment in Osceola. The company announced in February that it wants to refurbish the former Fruit of the Loom plant that covers 580000 square feet. If funds can be raised the plant will produce up to 2000 vehicles a year after investing another $200 million above the initial $80.7 million. Employment is expected to reach 800.

The company also announced that it will relocate its headquarters from Corona Calif. to Osceola.

""This is what we've envisioned for northeast Arkansas"" Preston says. ""When you bring in big anchor companies like Big River Steel and U.S. Steel folks in the supply chain are naturally going to gravitate to the area. We feel manufacturing in northeast Arkansas is going to be strong for years to come.""

Last month Sierra Group Roofing & Solar announced that it will invest $16 million for an 11000-square-foot headquarters at Blytheville and create 40 jobs. The company makes gutters and metal roofing accessories.

""Sierra Group is a great example of a company that's poised to make strides in the steel industry"" Preston says.

Here's the problem for Chitwood and other economic developers in Mississippi County: Many of those who work in the mills don't live in the county. Mississippi County's population peaked at 82375 in 1950 when thousands of sharecroppers and tenant farmers were needed to chop the massive fields of cotton in the summer and pick the crops by hand in the fall. The rapid mechanization of agriculture after World War II sent those workers to other states.

Mississippi County saw its population tumble to 70174 in 1960; 62060 in 1970; 59517 in 1980; 57525 in 1990; 51979 in 2000; 46480 in 2010; and 40685 in 2020.

Many in the steel industry work a schedule of four days on and four days off. They share house trailers or recreational vehicles with co-workers then return home to Missouri Tennessee western Kentucky and southern Illinois during their off days. How do Mississippi County officials convince them to move their families to northeast Arkansas?

The answer is what's known as the ""Work Here Live Here"" initiative. The program pays 10 percent of any new home bought in the county by a worker in the manufacturing sector as long as the home is in the $2000000 to $500000 range. A worker must obtain a construction loan from a local bank to qualify. When the house is completed a second mortgage with the 10 percent is implemented. If the worker remains employed in the county for at least four years the second mortgage is paid off by the program.

Companies with operations in the area are partnering with the county.

""Living half your time in an RV is just not sustainable for those who want a family life"" Chitwood says. ""The executives of our companies understand that. It's like life in an oil and gas field for these workers. I think company executives are beginning to understand the benefit of having their workers live close to the mills.

""Take what Nucor has done in the way of expansions what Big River Steel has spent and what Atlas Tube has spent. That's more than $2 billion in recent capital investments even before the $3 billion U.S. Steel announcement. The capital is here. These mills are going to be here for decades to come. I have to believe that more of the people who work in the mills will decide it makes sense to have homes here.""

Chitwood doesn't think the ""Work Here Live Here"" initiative will be around for decades.

""We're not going to have to do this forever"" he says. ""What we're trying to do is provide an incentive to increase our housing stock and change the conversation inside the county.""

Liz Smith who heads the Mississippi County Regional Chamber of Commerce says the feeling of momentum is palpable.

""I've never felt this much energy here"" she says. ""Our chamber membership has doubled. The huge industrial announcements get all the attention but there are lots of small businesses opening to support those workers. We're even seeing investors buy some of the old buildings in downtown Blytheville and Osceola. Meanwhile a new foundation was formed to support the Ritz Theater in downtown Blytheville.

""The most exciting thing of all is that the main people involved in things like downtown restoration are young. That's what we need in Mississippi County--a younger generation fully committed to making this a nice place to live.""

In the south part of the county investor Gaylon Lawrence Jr. continues to pour millions of dollars into the old company town of Wilson. Its boutique Hotel Louis is already advertising in upscale lifestyle magazines such as Garden & Gun with plans to open this fall. Steel company executives are expected to build homes in the Wilson area and enroll their children in its prep school the Delta School.

Thousands of acres of cotton--not to mention soybeans rice and corn--are still grown here. Modern agriculture requires few workers though. Steel is now king in Mississippi County and the key to its future.

Two days after the city cleared the mostly-RVs encampment site along SW Andover/28th SW eco-blocks were installed this morning. The neighboring West Seattle Health Club had announced pre-sweep that to “avoid the return of the encampment the West Seattle Health Club is partnering with our neighboring businesses to place cement eco-blocks along the surrounding area.” After a tip early this morning we went over around 7:30 am and found two workers in gear from neighboring Nucor finishing the placement which they said they’d started about two hours earlier.

Blocks are also in place along the west side of 28th.

As the camping was illegal – though not enforced for six-plus years – this is too. We asked SDOT about it on Thursday and spokesperson Ethan Bergerson replied:

Seattle Municipal Code 15.04 states that it is unlawful to place objects or structures in a public place without first securing a written permit. SDOT does not issue permits to obstruct public streets sidewalks or parking spaces with concrete blocks because this can cause problems such as parking spillover onto adjacent streets blocking utility access conflicts with other transportation needs or accessibility barriers which violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Additionally the desire to prevent others from using a public space is not a valid reason for seeking a permit in and of itself.

Blocks like these have been installed however in other areas of the city either post-sweeps or preventively. Some are also in place along part of a formerly much-camped area of 1st Avenue South in southeast West Seattle.",,,,,,,,,

The power limits include both desktop & mobile parts.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Desktop & Mobile GPU Power Limits Detailed: Ada Lovelace Powered AD102 Flagship Desktop Maxes Out at 800W Flagship Mobile AD103 Maxes Out at 175W

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series lineup based on the Ada Lovelace graphics architecture will come in both desktop and mobile flavors. We have heard various reports of how the flagship is going to feature a TGP of up to 900W but as we know the power limits are the max the GPU can reach and are not reflective of the actual TGP/TBP figures. These limits may only be reachable by heavily overclocked and custom-cooled variants.

A truth. The power limits:

AD102 800W;

AD103 (DT) 450W AD103 (Mobile) 175W;

AD104 (DT) 400W AD104 (Mobile) 175W;

AD106 (DT) 260W AD106 (Mobile) 140W.

But I don't think we need to use the full power cap. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 18 2022

So coming to the power limits we have four NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU SKUs the AD102 AD103 AD104 and AD106. All GPUs except the AD102 will receive a mobile variation and the reason is simply that the flagship chip has much higher power requirements that the laptop platform can't support. The same was the case with the GA102 GPU so the GA103 became the fastest mobile offering.

Starting with the desktop lineup the NVIDIA AD102 GPU will feature an 800W power limit the AD103 GPU will feature a 450W power limit the AD104 GPU will feature a 400W power limit & AD106 will feature a 260W power limit. As for mobile parts the AD103 mobile GPU will feature a 175W power limit AD104 mobile GPU will feature a 175W power limit and the AD106 mobile will rock a 140W power limit. Rounding up the figures we have:

NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Desktop GPUs:

AD102 - 800W Max Power Limit

AD103 - 450W Max Power Limit

AD104 - 400W Max Power Limit

AD106 - 260W Max Power Limit

NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Mobile GPUs:

AD103 - 175W Max Power Limit

AD104 - 175W Max Power Limit

AD106 - 140W Max Power Limit

This is a drastic increase in the power limits for the desktop and mobile parts. The AD102's 800W power limit is already bonkers but the actual graphics card that utilizes it will end up with a 600W TGP. The AD103 and AD104 GPUs are very similar to each other so the TGP figures are almost the same on mobile and a 50W difference on the desktop segment. The AD106 is in the mainstream 260W segment while the actual graphics cards using it will end up close to 200W TGPs. The mobile parts max out at 175W power limits because that's the best the platform could do in the given area. Anything more would require a major redesign of existing laptops and coolers for them and it looks like most manufacturers don't want to make that extra investment right now.

Based on the power limit differences between the desktop and mobile parts there's once again going to be a huge performance difference between the two NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU segments. But that's only due to the limitations on the mobile platform still we expect to see a major boost when it comes to performance on the mobile side while desktops take things to the next level.

The flagship AD102 is rated at 800 W and it will be a desktop-only GPU. GPUs from AD103 to AD106 will be available for desktops and laptops. Though the power limits seem high the actual TGP figures are likely to be much lesser.

We have been speculating that Nvidia's upcoming Lovelace generation of GPUs would have higher power consumption than Ampere. Rumors so far suggested that the upcoming flagship RTX 4090 based on the AD102 GPU may have power consumption pushing past 700 W or even 850 W.

Nvidia will offer both desktop and mobile variants of Lovelace and now we are getting to know what could be their likely power targets.

This information comes via @kopite7kimi on Twitter who has been quite accurate for the most part when it comes to GPU leaks. The Lovelace lineup will have GPU offerings starting from AD102 which is the flagship chip all the way down to AD106.

AD102 is expected to have a mind-boggling 800 W power limit which obviously means it will not make it to laptop form factors. This is not unlike what we've seen with Ampere wherein the top-end RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU was based on GA103 and not GA102.

GPUs from AD103 onwards will come in both desktop and mobile variants. While the desktop AD103 will have a maximum power limit of 450 W the mobile version will be capped at 175 W similar to the RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU.

AD104 is touted to have a power limit of 400 W on the desktop but will be restricted to 175 W on mobile. This is a good uplift from what we've seen with the RTX 3070 Ti Laptop GPU which has a TGP of 150 W (125 W TDP and 25 W Dynamic Boost).

Finally AD106 will have a power limit of 260 W on the desktop but will work at 140 W in laptops. The RTX 3060 Laptop GPU offers a range of TDPs from 60 W to 115 W but it is interesting to know that its successor can be pushed all the way to 140 W. We do not have power limits for AD107 yet.

A point worth noting here is that these figures are maximum power limits for a particular GPU and not actual TDP or TGP figures. These numbers serve to indicate as to how much a GPU can be pushed under the right cooling and overclocking conditions. They also give us an indication of what could be the extent of a momentary spike in power consumption under load.

The RTX 4090 cards are thought to hover around 600 W TGP. However a more recent spec leak puts the RTX 4090's TGP at around 450 W which is still a good 100 W higher than the RTX 3090's 350 W rating.

The mobile Lovelace cards look to be using similar power limits as the current Ampere generation. The wide power limit gap between corresponding desktop and laptop Lovelace SKUs indicates that the performance delta between them could be huge.

Having said that pushing Lovelace any higher than 175 W would probably require large investments into chassis and cooling redesign R&D which is unlikely a near-term goal for most OEMs. Some Alder Lake HX laptops are pushing a combined 250 W from both the CPU and the GPU already. That being said the increased CUDA core counts and other specifications should still lend a good performance uplift with Lovelace mobile but it is too early to speculate.

GeForce RTX 4000 series cards codenamed Ada Lovelace could consume 50 to 100 W more than their predecessors across the board with flagship models breaking new ground.

Veteran leaker kopite7kimi who nailed the specifications of Ampere weeks before anyone else has updated his forecasts of Ada Lovelace's power limits. It's important to note that power limits are not the same as TDPs or TBPs; they're an upper bound that only comes into play when overclocking is involved. However they're still a good guideline for power consumption just an overestimate.

Coming to torture our power supplies is the flagship AD102 with a limit of 800W. Going down a level the desktop AD103 has a limit of 450W the AD104 of 400W and the AD106 of 260W. In the past the xx106 has been used by entry-level GPUs and the xx104 by mid-range GPUs but Nvidia could change that up.

As you'd hope the leaked laptop power budgets are tamer. Kopite reports that the mobile versions of the AD103 and AD104 have limits of 175W and the AD106 has a limit of 140W. However because they're laptop parts manufacturers will have a lot of leeway to tweak them anyway.

Back to the numbers you're probably still reeling over: 800W. It's achievable with a pair of the new PCIe 5.0 power connectors which can handle 600W each (if the card used 8-pin power connectors it would need six!). But there aren't very many power supplies with two of those ports and that much power on the market.

Cooling will also be an interesting challenge. But setting those practical concerns aside for a moment is an 800W ceiling that unreasonable for a GPU with 18432 CUDA cores (according to the information from February's hack)?

In its fully unlocked state the AD102 will consume 0.0434W per CUDA core which is only marginally more than the 0.0419W per core consumed by the RTX 3090 Ti. As Steve pointed out in our RTX 3090 Ti review that GPU is a power-hungry monster but theoretically the AD102 is only equally as awful.

And remember 800W is the (probable) hard limit not the TDP. A past report said that Nvidia was testing a 600W TDP for the 4090 that would improve the GPU's efficiency and leave 200W as overclocking headroom.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3JvYm90aWNzYW5kYXV0b21hdGlvbm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTkvY2hhbG1lcnMtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1zZWxlY3RzLWxlbm92by1hbmQtbnZpZGlhLXRvLWJ1aWxkLXN3ZWRpc2gtbmF0aW9uYWwtc3VwZXJjb21wdXRlci81MTU3OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chalmers University selects Lenovo and Nvidia to build Swedish national supercomputer,"Chalmers University of Technology is using Lenovo and Nvidia’s technology infrastructure to power its large-scale computer resource or supercomputer Alvis.

The project has seen the delivery and implementation of a clustered computing system for artificial intelligence and machine learning research in what is Lenovo’s largest high-performance computing cluster for AI and ML in the Europe Middle East and Africa region.

Alvis – old Norse meaning “all-wise” or “all-knowing” – is a national supercomputer resource within the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC).

It began initially in 2020 and has since developed to hold a capacity that solves larger research tasks on a broader scale. Financed by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation the computer system is supplied by Lenovo and located at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg home to the EU’s largest research initiative Graphene Flagship.

The collaborative project allows any Swedish researcher who needs to improve their mathematical calculations and models to take advantage of Alvis’ services through SNIC’s application system regardless of the research field.

This supports researchers who are already utilising machine learning to analyse complex problems and those who are investigating the use of machine learning to solve issues within their respective field with the potential to lead to ground-breaking academic research in fields such as quantum computing and data-driven research for healthcare and science.

Noam Rosen EMEA director HPC and AI at Lenovo Infrastructure Solutions Group says: “The Alvis project is a prime example of the role of supercomputing in helping to solve humanity’s greatest challenges and Lenovo is both proud and excited to be selected as part of it.

“Supported by Lenovo’s performance leading technology Alvis will power research and use machine learning across many diverse areas with a major impact on societal development including environmental research and the development of pharmaceuticals.

“This computing resource is truly unique built on the premise of architectures for different AI and machine learning workloads with sustainability in mind helping to save energy and reduce carbon emissions by using our pioneering warm water-cooling technology.”

Sverker Holmgren director of Chalmers e-Infrastructure Commons hosting the Alvis system says: “The first pilot resource for Alvis has already been used by more than 150 research projects across key Swedish universities.

“By making it much larger and fully opening the Alvis Systems to all Swedish researchers Chalmers and Lenovo are playing an important role in providing a national HPC ecosystem for future research.”

Chalmers has chosen to implement a scalable cluster with a variety of Lenovo ThinkSystem servers to deliver the right mix of NVIDIA GPUs to its users in a way that prioritises energy savings and workload balance.

This includes the Lenovo ThinkSystem SD650-N V2 to deliver the power of Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPUs and the Nvidia-Certified ThinkSystem SR670 V2 for Nvidia A40 and T4 GPUs.

Rod Evans EMEA director of high-performance computing at Nvidia says: “The work we’re doing with Chalmers University and its Alvis national supercomputer will give researchers the power they need to simulate and predict our world.

“Together we’re giving the scientific community tools to solve the world’s greatest supercomputing challenges – from forecasting weather to drug discovery.”

The storage architecture delivers a new Ceph solution with 7.8 petabytes to be integrated into the existing storage environment at Chalmers.

Nvidia Quantum 200 Gb/s InfiniBand provides the system with low- latency high data throughput networking and smart in-computing acceleration engines.

With these high-speed infrastructure capabilities users have almost 1000 GPUs mainly Nvidia A100 Tensor Core including over 260000 processing cores and over 800 TFLOPS of compute power to drive a faster time to answer in their research.

In addition Alvis leverages Lenovo’s Neptune liquid-cooling technologies to deliver unparalleled compute efficiency. Initially full air cooling was proposed for the project but Chalmers instead decided to deploy Lenovo Neptune warm water-cooling capabilities to reduce long-term operational costs and result in a “greener” AI infrastructure system.

As a result the university anticipates that there will be significant energy savings thanks to efficiencies through water cooling.

The HPC solution has been in production since February 2022 and will be fully operational by Summer 2022."

In other action as the Bolivar Herald-Free Press and KIX 105.7-Townsuare Media presented the Mid-Season Championships at the Lucas Oil Speedway Kris Jackson captured the Ozark Golf Cars USRA B-Mod feature and mid-season title and Dillon McCowan had a similar sweep in the Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modifieds.

White wins race Beck takes USRA Stock Car points: Bryan White of Lebanon led all but one of the 20 laps to capture the O'Reilly Auto Parts Stock Cars feature win. Mason Beck of Urbana meanwhile took the Midseason Championship with a fourth-place finish.

""It was fun"" White said. ""I saw (runner-up) David Hendrix running the top there so I started going to the top on the straightaway. I'd like to thank all my sponsors on this car plus my dad and my brother. Just everybody that helps me on this car.""

Bryan White set the early pace with Hendrix moving into second by lap three as three early cautions plagued the rhythm of the feature.

Hendrix worked the high groove out of turn four to pass White at the flagstand to complete lap 11 but it was White regaining the top position the next time around with Hendrix second Keller third and Beck in fourth.

White continued to lead it as the white flag appeared but a caution for Mark Simon’s spin on the backstretch set up a green-white-checkered shootout. As White looked to finish off the win Beck needed to protect his position to nail down the midseason points title.

Both were able to do that with White taking the victory but winding up just three points behind Beck in the points battle. Beck posted his third top-five finish of the season.

""I cut it was too close there"" Beck said. ""I dug myself a hole in the heat race and I paid for it in the feature. But I guess we've been consistent all year and I found myself up in the front. I don't know how but I done it.""

It's all Jackson in USRA B-Mods: With six Lucas Oil Speedway track championships already to his credit in the Ozark Golf Cars USRA B-Mod division Lebanon’s Kris Jackson is halfway to earning No. 7.

Jackson started up front and led all 20 laps to picked up his third feature win of the season and nail down the B-Mod Midseason Championship. He outdistanced runner-up Ryan Gillmore by 3.5 seconds.

""It's been a pretty good year and it's flown by"" Jackson said after notching win No. 13 overall in 2022. ""I just want to say happy Father's Day to all the guys out there and and thank all my sponsors.""

Jackson beat fellow front-row starter J.C. Morton to the lead as the green fell. He went on to build a two-second lead over a tightly bunched trio of Morton Gillmore and Andy Bryant by lap eight when the first’s first caution stacked the field for a restart.

Gillmore who began the night 13 points behind Jackson got around Morton as action resumed and gave chase. But Jackson cruised away from there getting through lapped traffic over the final four laps without incident.

Gillmore was second with Bryant edging past Morton on the final lap to earn third. Jon Sheets rounded out the top five.

McCowan makes it six USRA Modified wins: Dillon McCowan of Urbana finished off a near-flawless first half of the Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modified season driving to his sixth feature victory in eight attempts.

McCowan beat Dustin Hodges by one-second for the victory with Cody Brill finishing third and Jason Pursley fourth.

“The car's been really good and the track has been phenomenal here this year"" McCowan said. ""I think this is the fastest track we've had since we started racing over here.

""I'd like to thank all my sponsors and everybody that helps me in the shop. It's been a long road to get where we're at today but I wouldn't change it for the world.""

McCowan took over the lead from Brill on lap 2 and never relinquished it. He sprinted to a 1.6-second lead by lap six over Dustin Hodges when the race’s first caution bunched the field.

It didn’t take McCowan long to open a comfortable margin as green-flag action resumed needing only six laps to push the gap to 1.7 seconds. McCowan caught lapped traffic by lap 16 but got through it to prevail though Hodges was gaining at the end.

McCowan wound up an unofficial 114 points in front of Hodges for the mid-season title.

And that spot on the map below that demarcation as Morgantown’s former mayor Charlene Marshall found out has implications that are just as sociopolitical as they are geographic.

Marshall was mayor of the University City from 1991-98.

She was the first Black woman to hold that position here.

In fact she was the first Black woman at the time to be elected mayor of any municipality in West Virginia.

As Morgantown mayor and later as a member of the state House of Delegates she often traveled the country attending conferences workshops and the like.

The once-and-former civic leader recounted some of those interactions in a 2001 profile in The Dominion Post.

People were interested in the Black woman mayor from a state that didn’t always know if it was North or South or Mid-Atlantic.

Be it pigment gender or politics she made an impression. A lot of those people she talked to had West Virginia pegged on the map in their mind.

That’s in the South some people would marvel. How did you get by?

“I always answer the same way” Marshall said then.

“I always talk about the good people in Morgantown and Monongalia County. I’ve stood on a lot of shoulders to get where I am.”

Calendars and character

Today — Sunday June 19 two decades later — it’s officially Juneteenth in America.

Actually it was officially Juneteenth two days ago in West Virginia.

That’s the date of proclamation signed by Gov. Jim Justice making it a holiday on the books of the only state born of the Civil War.

Juneteenth.

A shorthand-melding of month and date for the observance long-deemed as American’s “second Independence Day.”

A day that jumped into the nation’s consciousness on June 19 1865 when 250000 Black people — maybe more — were finally told they were free of their enslavement.

This two years after Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.

Marshall grew up in the Osage coal camp near Morgantown.

At Osage it was a coal mining Melting Pot where Blacks up from Alabama were neighbors with Italians over from Calabria.

Everyone in Osage was looking to carve a purchase of the American dream in the dangerous depths of a West Virginia coal mine.

Osage was where her dad died in a mining accident and her stepdad too.

Osage was where she was old enough to have awareness of just what it really meant — when those photographs of 14-year-old Emmett Till’s battered corpse began appearing in the nation’s Black press.

And Osage was where she learned that institutional racism just was even if she was blessed with good friends and good neighbors in the camp.

Good families too: who watched out for her like she was their kid.

Circle the date

Juneteenth as an official holiday is still slow-going in some parts of the country.

Lawmakers in Alabama Mississippi and South Carolina have yet to advance it as a federal holiday for example and the day Marshall said is hardly a fix-all to begin with.

Not in a post-George Floyd world she said.

Not after the most recent targeted slayings in Buffalo she said.

However a real holiday she said is a start.

The federal odyssey of Juneteenth she said means awareness.

Awareness begets understanding — and understanding begets empathy she said.

Realization that this date is a shared cause she said. Just like the Osage of her girlhood.

Juneteenth for her means history that is sometimes worth repeating.

“Young people need to be aware to really be aware of just where we’ve been” she said.

And not just in the shadows of racism and other bad behaviors as she asserts.

‘It gave me chills to stand there’

Society works she said when people — without lobbying without pressure — are allowed to intuitively follow their better angels.

Marshall as said likes to acknowledge her debt by saying she’s “stood on the shoulders” of supportive people who helped her and never judged her.

In 1994 she stood on the stage of Morgantown’s landmark Metropolitan Theatre as city mayor.

The Met then wasn’t the ornate showplace it is today. That’s why she was there.

She was accepting a $1 million federal Housing and Urban Development check for its purchase and refurbishing by the city.

“I didn’t really say anything at the time but it gave me chills to stand there. Here I am as mayor in this theater accepting this money” she remembered.

“And when I went there as a little girl I had to sit in the balcony. African-Americans weren’t allowed down front.”

When Basketball Hall of Famer and Power Coach Nancy Lieberman was a high schooler growing up in Queens she would take the subway to Harlem and go to the legendary Rucker Park. She managed to get herself in the game and once she got in there was no getting her out. She quickly became Rucker Park royalty. When she made a particularly impressive play someone in the crowd would inevitably yell “FIRE!” – a nickname she earned from the way she played the game and her unmistakable red hair. (She would later earn the sobriquet “Lady Magic” because of her court vision size and ability to control the game from any position.)

Via SLiC Sports

After a journey that has included dominating women’s college basketball playing women’s professional basketball playing men’s pro ball coaching in the WNBA G-League and NBA Nancy ‘Fire’ Lieberman became the first female head coach to win a championship in FIREBALL3. Like I said sometimes things just feel like fate. Power hasn’t won a championship since 2018 but they’re looking to return to the promised land with #1 overall pick Glen Rice Jr. seven-foot shooter Nikoloz Tskitishvili and hyper-skilled big man TJ Cline the latter of whom just happens to be Coach Lieberman’s son. With talent and family on her side I wouldn’t bet against her.

Coach Lieberman was recently kind enough to grant BIG3 an interview covering her experiences in almost every format of basketball and hearing her reflections on the past and vision for the future was a pleasure. (Note: The following interview has been edited for the purposes of brevity and clarity.)

Krolik: You have an almost impossibly diverse background. You were a legend in college at Old Dominion you went into the women’s pro league you’ve coached in the WNBA the NBA the G-League you’ve coached FIREBALL3 as a head coach you’ve played men’s semi-pro and you played for the Washington Generals.

Lieberman: I also played for the Lakers in 1980. My first professional coach was Pat Riley. He was using Summer League to learn how to coach.

Via Sportswrap

Pat tells the story about how there were times in his career where he was overwhelmed and maybe they were bigger faster or stronger than me but you couldn’t measure my heart and I wasn’t afraid. And he would be in situations where he was uncomfortable and he would think of me. And he would say “she always acted like she was the best player on the court.” I didn’t know that I had affected Pat in that way until later until 2015 at the NBA coach’s symposium. And 30 years later he’s telling me I had an effect on him. That’s what I want to do with my players my teammates my son anyone who’s around me I want to be able to have an effect on them in some way shape or form.

That’s just how I live my life. When I was hired by the Mavericks to coach their G-League team and was invited to the White House by President Obama – I almost hung up on them because I thought I was getting punked – and [President Obama] came up to me I was with my son and he looked at my son TJ who was in high school at the time and said “can you beat your mom at basketball?” and he said “Nope.” Then he said “well can I beat your mom at basketball?” and he said “Nope.” Then he pulled me to the side and said “Nancy I’m a black man I just happen to be President. I’ve been black all my life. It’s normal to me. You’ve been a white woman your whole life. You’ve been coaching predominantly young black men and playing against them your whole life. It’s normal to you. It’s our responsibility to make it normal for everybody else.” And he was so right. So when I look at what he said and look at people who have came after him or people who came after me like [BIG3 Coach Lisa Leslie] maybe that opportunity is not on the table for her if somebody doesn’t see that.

Krolik: I don’t think there’s a doubt.

Lieberman: So when someone like [Former Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon] got that job with Coach Popovich and I called her to congratulate her she was almost apologizing to me. And I just go “Becky shut up. Stop. It’s not a contest. He gave you an opportunity and now your job is to open it up for other women.” And then I was that next person. So it’s so important for us to know that if just one woman gets hired we’ve failed. When Jackie Robinson was the first African-American baseball player if he was the only one it would have been a tragedy. If Becky was the only female hired it would have been a tragedy. You have to have the Larry Dobys and the Roy Campanellas and the other people that come behind which is vital.

Krolik: Again you’ve played in all these different leagues and formats of basketball. And one thing I noticed about you at the combine is that you’re still so curious about the game where a lot of people who have spent so much time in it especially ones who have had a lot of success tend to be more set in their ways. I was impressed by how curious you were about the game and how it’s changing.

Lieberman: Well you have to be. Life is changing the game is changing. I’m not saying I’m ever going to lose my core values.

You have to be open to change. And change can make the game better. Look at the three-point line. Without that nobody would know who Steph Curry is. There are a lot of players who play the game and very few players who change the game. I feel very grateful and humbled to have changed the game. It’s very powerful. Do I wish I’d had the WNBA in my prime? Heck yeah. I would’ve loved that. But it wasn’t my time. My time was to open doors for the Taurasis and the Lisa Leslies and those people. They expected to have a WNBA I hoped to have a WNBA. It was just a different time. I’m grateful for today’s players. I’m grateful for their success. I’m thrilled for what they can do. I’m not jealous of them. I am envious that I didn’t get to play in my prime for 15 16 or 17 years. That’s the competitor in me. That’s not “oh my gosh I can’t believe Rebecca Lobo or Britney Griner…” No. I love what they’ve done for the game.

Krolik: Let’s get into BIG3. Power won the Championship in 2018 what is the plan to get back to that championship form?

Lieberman: We had extraordinary players. I give our commissioner Clyde Drexler…you know I get a lot of credit for the championship and I appreciate that but the team was incredible. And then for the next few years we kept getting hit by injuries.

You can’t play in this league without continuity. The guys are too good. They’re just too good. I don’t care who or what coach – because they wouldn’t be telling you the truth if they said they were responsible for the team winning if a coach in this league or any other league says that. Players play coaches coach. Players determine probability and outcome. And it’s one of the single most incredible things you can do in life is to be a player. How you play will determine whether we can win or not.

I can call timeouts I can call plays I can script some plays. But you know Joe Johnson is Joe Johnson. I mean why even screw around and draw up a play? His nickname [“Iso-Joe”] is telling you I don’t need a play. So like I’ve said forever KYP. Know your personnel. I’ve been saying that since I coached in the WNBA. That’s one of the beauties of being a coach. Know your personnel. Know what they can do.

Krolik: The league is getting younger we’re excited about that but what’s always been a hallmark of the BIG3 is giving players a chance to retire on their own terms. You came back to the WNBA at 50 years old and got to retire on your own terms. How important is that to an athlete like you?

Lieberman: I want to say you very rarely see athletes these days retire. We don’t want to retire. There are a lot of different reasons. It could be the extraordinary money the locker room the fandom and the competition. The BIG3 – I’ve said this since the first year I was coaching and this is my fourth – what Ice Cube and Jeff Kwatinetz and Amy Trask and Commissioner Clyde Drexler did – this became a stepping-stone for so many guys.

Think about mental health depression and anxiety. Think about this with me John. You’ve been a guy who’s dedicated 131415 years to playing. To giving your family generational wealth. That means you had to sacrifice. Missing recitals missing games missing plays missing things that your family was doing. Mama Bear is holding down the fort. You retire and you’re the odd man out. Everyone else has a routine except you. They’ve been doing this without you for years and it doesn’t mean they don’t love you but life goes on whether you’re in the house or not in the house.

The BIG3 is one of the greatest things for athletes so that they can step out of retirement. So that the kids can be in the locker room. So Mom Grandma Wife Aunties your Girlfriend can be in the locker room. We want you to show your family who you are. When you were starring in the NBA your kids were either not born or they were 234 years old they didn’t know what the heck you were doing. I want my players’ kids to see their daddies shine. I want them to see them in their glory and then go home and share it. To be able to see players send me pictures of the wife and kids watching the game on TV and the kids are talking about their daddy…man that gives me chills. That’s what Cube has done for not only people like Julius me and Rick Barry Rick Mahorn and…all of us. It’s given us a very very broad opportunity on this platform to continue to be who we are. And we love being around each other.

Krolik: You had the first overall pick in the draft you took Glen Rice Jr. What do see his role for the team being?

Lieberman: Well Glen is an extraordinary player. He’s only 31 years old. He’s a bucket. He’s pretty much been unstoppable at every level that he’s played at. I’ve known him for a long time I coached him at NBA Coach’s Camp. It’s actually been a pleasure to reunite with him. I saw him play in Israel he was TJ [Cline’s] teammate with [Hapoel] Holon four years ago. And the guy was absolutely unstoppable. And I’m thinking “man he’s unreal.”

Krolik: So it’s safe to say he was very much on your radar before the Combine.

Lieberman: Yes. Because I have known him for so long and I just have a lot of respect for him. He’s young he’s talented he can get up and down the court. I hope he continues to play inspired and to show his talent I want the world to see his talent.

Krolik: What is the plan for Power schematically? You seem to have a lot of playmakers with size.

Lieberman: You remember Hoop It Up right? The outdoor 3-on-3 basketball that was all over the country?

Happy Birthday to the legend @NancyLieberman aka Lady Magic.



At age 18 she was the youngest basketball player to win an Olympic medal.



At age 39 she was the oldest player in @WNBA history.



At age 50 she returned to the WNBA and made SportsCenter's Top 10 with this pass pic.twitter.com/X35ZmrzghJ — Ballislife.com (@Ballislife) July 1 2020 Via Ballislife

Krolik: I don’t remember Hoop It Up.

Lieberman: It was the largest 3-on-3 tournament in the world. And my ex-husband TJ’s daddy Tim was the Senior Vice President. It started in the late ‘80s. And I played Hoop It Up. And when you play 3-on-3 you have to understand basketball concepts but you also need to have people who can pass the ball. Nikoloz is a great passer. Cuttino is a heck of a passer savvy with the basketball. Glen is a passer. TJ is a great passer. He’s one of the few players in the history of the NCAA to have averaged…I don’t even know what it was 18 points 7-8 rebounds and 6 assists. These guys can drop dimes.

And Royce White is one of the most gifted passers we have in the league. We’re big we’re strong – Cuttino’s the smallest player we have at 6’4. We have a nice blend but so do the other teams. We were just doing what we thought was right for our makeup and our chemistry. We’re anxious to see what that looks like when we get on the court.

Krolik: You mentioned how the BIG3 gives chances for families to come together. On that note TJ’s playing for your team next season.

Lieberman: Who is that?

Krolik (Slow on the uptake): TJ Cline?

Lieberman (laughing): Sounds familiar. I think he’s got most of my money. If you see him tell him I want my money back.

Krolik: Having been to so many training camps where you stood out did that give you more confidence to fit in with the team where people might think he’s only there because he’s the coach’s son?

Lieberman: If anybody says that they have no idea who I am. I am 100% about trying to win and if you are not good enough to play you will not play on my team. It’s a player’s game and you have to be able to be at this level. If you would have asked me two years ago about TJ I would have said “ummm…he’s in Europe.” But he’s 27 he played in Turkey Israel Spain Euroleague Eurocup he’s won three championships and he spent most of last year with the Wizards’ G-League team. He has so much experience – not NBA experience he’s going to have to learn – these are grown men who have been so successful and amazing at what they’ve done. But TJ will be up for the challenge. It’ll be tough but he’ll have to figure it out.

It’s like when Doc Rivers coached his son Austin. He traded his son. He coached Seth Curry [his son-in-law] who I coached in Sacramento. He traded Seth Curry! First of all I have players captains. And I talked to my captains. In fact two years ago Corey Maggette said “I want TJ to run our practice.” And for an hour he ran that practice. And I didn’t ask Corey to do that. That’s what he thought of him.

Krolik: Nikoloz looked impressive at the combine his size really seems to fit his frame.

Lieberman: He looks good. I was very impressed with him at the combine he was passing he was stretching the floor. But we’ll see what happens. Look here’s what we’ll do: We will get out there. We will work hard. We will try and put the right people in the right place. And then we’ll go play ball. And we’ll have no regrets.

And at the end of the day every time I see Cube I say “Thank you” and there’s gratitude. Every time I see Clyde or Amy or Jeff it’s “Thank You.” And there’s true gratitude for what they’ve done for all of us. It’s been remarkable. And I go out to restaurants and it’s “Coach coach how are you doing?” People love the BIG3. It’s just a concept…Cube’s legacy…oh my gosh what is his legacy?

[Krolik and Lieberman chuckle as they reflect on the vast amount of things league Co-Founder Ice Cube has accomplished in his career]

Lieberman: And I’ve never seen him turn down an interview. I’ve never seen him turn down a fan. He gets it. He’s a great husband. He’s a great father. And it’s just an honor and a privilege to work for him and with him and the fact he calls me his “spirit animal” that’s just over the top. I think we’ve got a lot in common just pursuing things people tell us we can’t do.

Krolik: Well it’s an honor and a privilege to talk to you Coach Lieberman. You really have changed the game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovLzI0N3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vbG9uZ2Zvcm1hcnRpY2xlL3N0YW5kb3V0cy1leWUtY2F0Y2hlcnMtZnJvbS1mYXVzLW1lZ2EtY2FtcC13aXRoLXJ1dGdlcnMtaW5kaWFuYS1pb3dhLWFuZC1nZW9yZ2lhLXRlY2gtcmVjcnVpdGluZy0xODg5MzIyMTIv0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9sb25nZm9ybWFydGljbGUvc3RhbmRvdXRzLWV5ZS1jYXRjaGVycy1mcm9tLWZhdXMtbWVnYS1jYW1wLXdpdGgtcnV0Z2Vycy1pbmRpYW5hLWlvd2EtYW5kLWdlb3JnaWEtdGVjaC1yZWNydWl0aW5nLTE4ODkzMjIxMi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eye-catchers from FAU’s mega camp with Rutgers Indiana Iowa and Georgia Tech,It’s always fun to see who fights for reps in these types of settings and Tra’quan Johnson was that guy Saturday.

Jurassic World Dominion director Colin Trevorrow went to bat Saturday for his Tyrannosaurus rex after a Twitter user argued the dino was no longer getting the respect it deserved in the franchise.

In Dominion which opened last weekend a Therizinosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus rex team up to kill the ultimate bad dino a Giganotosaurus. In the epic battle scene toward the end of the film it seemed all might be lost after the T. rex appeared to be killed. But in true Jurassic Park fashion her eye popped open and it was on. The T. rex and Therizinosaurus proceed to kill the Giga.

This was an awesome moment for most fans — but clearly not for all.

Actor Angel Rosario Jr. tweeted at Trevorrow that he felt the T. rex had become second banana in the Jurassic Park storytelling which in Rosario’s opinion was wrong.

“Hey @colintrevorrow… ya made the Rex look weak. Again. Come on now! It’s the face of the franchise. Terrible. The Giga might have been strong but science proves the Rex was a better predator and stronger. Very disappointed in your utilization of Rexy. #JurassicWorldDominion” read Rosario’s post.

The director then responded. And it was perfect.

“I understand the feeling. Worth noting the T. Rex had an average lifespan of 28 years so our Rexy would be near the end of her life in Dominion. Even at that age she found the strength to rise up and avenge her own death 65 million years later. Sometimes revenge takes time” Trevorrow said via Twitter.

Rosario appeared thrilled with the back-and-forth.

“Got a response from the great @colintrevorrow about Dominion. Though conflicting arguments about the Rex…as an actor I’d love to work on a project with you sir. Respect and admiration for your work sir. Hope we can talk about it face to face someday! #JurassicWorldDominion” he wrote.

Jurassic World: Dominion is in theaters now."

But only if the supply chain cooperates.

In the past few months casino operators and gaming equipment providers have gone from quietly discussing ways to manage product delays to openly addressing an issue that could alter multi-million-dollar casino openings.

Gaming equipment providers use high-tech components supplied by multiple vendors to assemble slot machines. Gaming analysts said much of the recent attention has focused on bill validators a device attached to games that accept either currency or a ticket voucher which are then converted into gambling credits.

Manufacturers of the bill validators use microchips also referred to as semiconductors to manage the automated transaction technology. The industry is centered in Asia and supply chain issues – including transporting the devices across the Pacific Ocean and into the hands of slot machine manufacturers – have been a challenge.

“Everyone is trying to figure out a workaround” said Eilers & Krejcik Gaming Partner Todd Eilers.

Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas told investors in mid-May that JCM Global a Japan-based provider of more than half of the bill validators used by the slot machine industry “has seen sizeable chip shortages impact its business which we think could have wider implications for the manufacturer’s pipeline this year.”

JCM Senior Vice President David Kubajak said the company which has its U.S. headquarters in Las Vegas “is being affected by supply chain challenges.” He said JCM which is publicly listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is facing the same headwinds as similar businesses dependent on the global semiconductor industry.

“JCM has established a global strategic sourcing team specifically focused on identifying and sourcing materials and components from suppliers around the world” Kubajak said in an emailed statement. “Even during these challenging times JCM continues to ship out product daily and remains focused on meeting their gaming and casino customers’ record demand for their products.”

Daron Dorsey executive director of the Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers (AGEM) said gaming has become a technology-driven sector with significant research and development planning cycles. The need to procure materials and components happens long before the individual elements need to be used within the products.

He said gaming equipment suppliers have multiple sub-suppliers and have developed different sourcing for components. Some of those strategic plans have changed.

“All of the different companies are trying to figure out alternate solutions to find the different pieces and that's what made it difficult” Dorsey said. “Someone might have had a historical provider of some type of component in their supply chain. If that provider is no longer available or delayed the companies are having to go to three four or five (component providers) instead of just one or two.”

Industry admits a problem

Jonas said the supply chain is just one of the overriding concerns for the casino industry in its recovery from the pandemic. Gaming company leaders – both operators and suppliers – believe the issue is manageable for the time being.

“They have been using the term ‘whack-a-mole’ to describe operating in today’s environment” Jonas said. “Today the risk is bill validators. But what’s the problem tomorrow? That is the real concern when you combine that with inflation and higher gas prices and rising costs.”

Supply chain concerns began to surface in early May during first-quarter earnings conference calls by slot machine companies.

International Game Technology’s chief financial officer Max Chiara said on May 10 that supply chain delays coupled with the effect the Omicron variant outbreak had on business in January cost the company some $30 million in profits in the first quarter.

“This is the biggest challenge we have right now” Chiara said referring to the issue as the “funnel” that brings components into IGT.

“We think in our outlook we can absorb some of that funnel slipping into the subsequent quarter as a result of the difficulties that exist in certain areas” Chiara said. “It could be in the pocket of deliveries. It could be in the availability of components. So our teams are really focused on trying to get the funnel over the fence and deliver to the best of our abilities.”

That same day Jonas asked executives from Light & Wonder (formerly Scientific Games) on the company’s conference call if supply chain issues were hurting sales.

“Similar to other industries and companies we are having some impacts on the supply chain” CFO Connie James said at the time. “But for us they've really been timing in nature. I think the good news is we were really proactive and instituted a global supply chain about 18 months ago. We've been able to drive some cost efficiencies.”

Slot machine orders arriving

Gaming equipment manufacturers are reliant on the airline industry for shipping semiconductor components to the U.S.

But that path has been challenging too.

Shelia Kahyaoglu an aerospace industry analyst for Jefferies wrote in a June 9 research note that Singapore Philippines and Malaysia flight activity to various destinations including the U.S. is down between 42 percent to 56 percent from pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Also she noted airline flight activity from South Korea and Taiwan has yet to see a meaningful recovery.

The manufacturers Jonas said are “getting creative” about how to manage the situation such as recycling old components. He suggested that some gaming equipment manufacturers will prioritize their available games where top-tier operators are first in line.

“This is a concern but it feels manageable for now at least in terms of replacements and some of the major casino openings have been well planned out for this year” Jonas said. “I do think you're seeing prioritization of some sort for any remaining inventory.”

The largest opening on the planning books is the $500 million Sky River Casino near Sacramento that Boyd Gaming will operate for the Wilton Rancheria Tribe. The property which will have 2000 slot machines is expected to open in the fall.

Boyd spokesman Dave Strow said the company ordered its slot machines “well in advance.”

“We have all the slot products we need to open” Strow said adding that supply chain issues have delayed certain light fixtures for the property coming out of China.

On a smaller scale when Las Vegas-based Olympia Gaming opens Legends Bay Casino in Sparks this summer roughly 20 of the casino’s 660 slot machines will still be on backorder because of supply chain issues.

Olympia Chief Operating Officer DeCourcy Graham said the gaming equipment provider will add a similar existing product to the casino floor until the new games are ready.

Slot machine route operator Century Gaming is also feeling the pinch. General Manager Tim Cogswell said the delay for certain components has increased from 30 to 60 days to 90 to 120 days.

“It’s hitting us both in our Century routes and Grand Vision” Cogswell said of the company’s slot machine development division.

For now the supply chain issues have not slowed the demand for new games. Jefferies gaming analyst David Katz said the top manufacturers are benefitting from both product improvements within the traditional slot machine market improved digital and technology enhancements and strong interest from consumers.

A single provider

Full House Resorts CEO Dan Lee said the Las Vegas-based company has been able to secure the 1000 slot machines it plans to use later this year when its temporary casino in Waukegan Illinois opens. The location is next to where the company is building the $500 million American Place Casino which is set to open in 2024.

“We have different slot machine orders some of which are already in” Lee said. “The other ones are about to be in. And if we had a problem with one manufacturer we would shift to another.”

Lee said bill validators are not an issue for Full House.

“There are two major suppliers of bill validators and one of them has got a problem” Lee said. “The other one so far has been OK. Fortunately we were going with the one that's been OK even before we knew the other guy had a problem.”

Pennsylvania-based Crane Payment Innovations is another supplier of bill validators to the gaming industry. A spokesman for the company could not be reached for comment.

Eilers whose Southern California-based gaming advisory firm tracks the major data points in the gaming equipment sector said most casino operators don’t like to use multiple systems for their bill validators. He added that operators often request a certain brand of bill validator to be used.

“It’s a big challenge to operate two systems” Eilers said.

Everi Holdings spokesman William Pfund said some casino operators might keep spare bill validators on hand for various reasons. The company has often shipped new slot machines to casinos that are missing the bill validator.

“They take the old bill validator out of the game that was on the floor and put it in the new one” Pfund said. “Casinos prefer to have a single bill validator.”

The Japanese government will pay up to 476 billion yen (about US$3.5 billion) towards an $8.6-billion wafer fab being built by TSMC Sony and Denso according to local reports.

The reports reference Japan’s Economic Minister Koichi Hagiuda speaking at a press conference Friday.

The level of support is 40 percent off the estimated cost. This is the same level of subsidy provided by the German government to attract Intel to build two wafer fabs in Masdeburg (see Intel to get 40% subsidy for German wafer fabs).

In the Japanese case the government has backed a joint venture called Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Inc. a joint venture of TSMC Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corp and Denso Corp to set up the factory in Kumamoto Prefecture (see Denso joins TSMC’s Japanese wafer fab club).

Construction of the wafer fab with an anticipated manufacturing capacity of 55000 wafer starts per month began in April. The plant in Kikuyo is expected to begin operations in December 2024.

Oracle set out to win the TikTok data storage contract leveraging US-China antagonism and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison’s personal relationship with Trump to inject new life into its flagging data storage business.

Now thanks to a new TikTok data privacy scandal Oracle has finally won TikTok’s business.

TikTok announced June 17 that it had “changed the default storage location of US user data” and “100% of US user traffic is being routed to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.” The announcement coincided with a BuzzFeed investigation that revealed TikTok employees in China controlled and routinely accessed private data from US TikTok users between September 2021 and January 2022.

Storing data from over 100 million US TikTok users will be a boon for Oracle which was once one of the world’s biggest data hosts but has struggled to catch up after rivals Amazon and Microsoft made early breakthroughs in cloud computing and took control of more than half the market between them.

Trump’s TikTok deal comes full circle

In August 2020 Trump made a (legally and practically dubious) threat to ban TikTok in the US citing worries that the Chinese government would use the data TikTok gathered to spy on US citizens. By September the Trump administration had engineered a deal in which TikTok parent company ByteDance agreed to sell a minority stake in the social media app to two “very American” companies Oracle and Walmart with Oracle taking over TikTok’s US data storage.

After Trump lost the 2020 election in November the TikTok deal entered a period of limbo and eventually fell apart when US president Joe Biden took office. Biden revoked a Trump executive order banning TikTok in June 2021 but then launched his own investigation into the app’s data practices.

By March 2022 ByteDance and Oracle had renewed negotiations for Oracle to take over TikTok’s US data storage this time to allay the Biden administration’s privacy concerns. After BuzzFeed detailed how the company’s China-based employees controlled access to US TikTok users’ data in June TikTok quickly announced all US private data—including users’ phone numbers birthdays and draft videos—are being stored in Oracle’s servers. The company also said it hired Oracle to “develop data management protocols that Oracle will audit and manage to give users even more peace of mind.”

BuzzFeed however reports that ByteDance employees in Beijing will still have access to public data about US users’ videos comments and bios allowing them to draw inferences about Americans’ interests and politics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmludGVjaHRpbWVzLmNvbS9maXZlLW1vcmUtbWVtYmVycy1qb2luLWZpbnRlY2gtYXVzdHJhbGlhcy1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtcHJvZ3JhbW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five More Members Join FinTech Australia's Corporate Partnership Programme,"Five new corporate partners have joined FinTech Australia‘s ever-expanding corporate partnership programme.

The new Gold tier partners to the country’s national fintech association’s ecosystem partnership programme include the innovation and venture capital partner of ANZ Bank 1835i and OneSpan the digital agreements company.

Ecosystem partners include the technology consulting firm Endava cybersecurity companies Palo Alto Networks and banking services and digital identity and cybersecurity company Thales.

The addition of these five companies follows the association’s April 2022 announcement that insurance specialists ii-A enterprise technology company Oracle Australia and the business process management solutions provider WNS had also joined as gold tier partners.

April’s ecosystem partners also included the business certification and efficiency specialist BSI Group corporate advisors Latimer Partners customer experience organisation Probe CX and AI-powered eKYC and AML compliance platform Jumio Corporation.

A lot of names with a lot happening in the last five months for FinTech Australia but what does its programme actually set out to achieve?

The association describes itself as a ‘member-driven organisation’ setting out to ‘build a strong community and foster connections while supporting innovation and regulation’.

Partners including the five that have been announced this week can expect to leverage the association in a collaborative way to expand their customer base their insight into one of the fastest-growing sectors in the world and their professional network with other likeminded organisations operating in Australia.

Speaking on the addition of its latest members FinTech Australia’s head of strategic partnerships Rehan D’Almeida describes the global interest in Australia’s fintech industry as “red hot” and how the association is in “an ideal position to help convert this into deeper connections and potential partnership opportunities.”

Stating that the company is “pleased” to join the programme 1835i’s managing director Ron Spector adds that “we believe there are many opportunities for partnership and we look forward to taking a more active role in this growing ecosystem.”

Noting how it’s already helped a number of Australian banks and financial institutions to mitigate fraud risk digitise internal and consumer-facing agreement processes and comply with industry regulations OneSpan’s country manager Nigel Stewart added that “we look forward to partnering with FinTech Australia to enable organisations to deliver secure and trusted digital experiences through collaborations with Australian fintechs.”

Likewise Endava shares in the excitement of joining the programme with the company’s principal industry consultant David Marsh adding: “We’re excited to have partnered with FinTech Australia and look forward to helping Australia’s fintech and financial institutions leverage the latest technologies to compete on the global stage.”

Identifying how collaboration and sandboxing between established banking and fintechs is driving innovation and competitive advantage Steve Manley regional vice president ANZ at Palo Alto Networks added: “Through this partnership we hope to encourage the Australian fintech community to adopt and leverage cybersecurity measures to mitigate current risks while preparing for new security risks associated with innovations.”

With its foot in FinTech Australia’s door Thales’ SVP of banking and payment services in Asia Michael Au says that the company is “uniquely positioned” to meet the needs of fintechs down under adding that “we are already bringing innovative solutions sustainable product options and rapid deployment programs to many fintech organisations and welcome the opportunity to work with more customers in Australia.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiImh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJzc25ld3MubmV0L25ld3MvNjcxNDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikTok says Oracle to keep US user data safe | News,"SAN FRANCISCO June 18 2022 (BSS/AFP) - TikTok on Friday said Oracle will store all the data from its US users in a bid to allay fears about its safety in the hands of a platform owned by ByteDance in China.

The announcement came as the popular video snippet sharing service fended off concerns about the ability of engineers in China to access information about US users that isn't public.

ByteDance employees have repeatedly accessed information about US TikTok users according to a Buzzfeed news report citing leaked audio from TikTok in-house meetings.

It is common for some engineers at internet firms to be granted access to data and TikTok told AFP it is trying to minimize that kind of system privilege.

""Similar to industry peers we will continue to drive our goal of limiting the number of employees who have access to user data and the scenarios where data access is enabled"" TikTok chief information security officer Roland Cloutier said in a blog post highlighted by the company.

""Our goal is to minimize data access across regions so that for example employees in the (Asia Pacific) region including China would have very minimal access to user data from the EU and US.""

TikTok has been adamant that it has never given US user data to Chinese officials and that it would refuse if asked to do so.

Last month TikTok created a new US data security devoted to strengthening protection policies and protocols to safeguard user information a TikTok spokesperson told AFP.

""We've brought in world class internal and external security experts to help us strengthen our data security efforts' the spokesperson said.

TikTok will continue to use its own datacenters in Virginia and Singapore to backup information as it works to ""fully pivot"" to relying on Oracle in the United States it said in a post.

""We know we are among the most scrutinized platforms from a security standpoint and we aim to remove any doubt about the security of US user data"" said Albert Calamug who handles US security public policy at TikTok.

President Joe Biden last year revoked executive orders from his predecessor Donald Trump seeking to ban Chinese-owned apps TikTok and WeChat from US markets on national security concerns.

Trump had given his blessing to a plan that would have given TikTok to US tech giant Oracle with investments from retail powerhouse Walmart but that deal failed to win approval in Beijing.

Biden's new executive order nixed the unimplemented ban and called for ""an evidence-based analysis to address the risks"" from internet applications controlled by foreign entities.

WeChat part of Chinese tech giant Tencent is a ""super app"" which includes social networking messaging e-commerce and more.

TikTok revealed late last year that it had a billion users worldwide.

""Today 100 percent of US user traffic is being routed to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure"" Calamug said.

""In addition we're working closely with Oracle to develop data management protocols that Oracle will audit and manage to give users even more peace of mind.""",,,,,,

CRN compiles a sampling of recently announced layoffs.

By many measures the cybersecurity sector in general is doing fine despite economic storm clouds on the horizon. Due to recent high-profile ransomware and other cyber-attacks private-sector and public-sector demand for cybersecurity products has never been greater. Spending remains high on security products and services – and many officials believe the security sector should fare better than other tech segments in the event of an economic downturn. But that doesn’t mean everything is hunky-dory within the security sector. Like other publicly traded tech companies security firms have lately seen their stocks pounded on Wall Street. And the Wall Street drubbing has largely dried up the IPO market – a fact that has disrupted the plans of security startups and their investors in general. In the short-term many later-stage security startups are being told to pull back on their spending as a way to preserve their cash until markets recover and IPOs become an option again. The net result: Some cybersecurity startups have recently begun laying off workers. The following are five later-stage startups that have recently reduced their payrolls amid uncertain economic times: * Lacework * Cybereason * Deep Instinct * OneTrust * Automox

Lacework Last month’s news that Lacework was laying off an estimated 20 percent of its workforce hit the cybersecurity investment world like a thunderclap. After all the San Jose Calif.-based Lacework a cloud security firm founded in 2015 had raised $1.3 billion in new funding only six months prior becoming one of the hottest cybersecurity companies in the world. The blockbuster Series D funding round was led by Sutter Hill Ventures Altimeter Capital D1 Capital Partners and Tiger Global Management. So what happened? Lacework co-CEOs David Hatfield and Jay Parikh said in a company blog post that the “very difficult decision” to reduce the company’s headcount was the result of a “seismic shift” in both the public and private markets. “While we do not have control of the environment around us we do have a responsibility to control how we operate our business and make changes as needed to best position the company for continued and long-term success” the Lacework leaders wrote. “We have adjusted our plan to increase our cash runway through to profitability and significantly strengthened our balance sheet so we can be more opportunistic around investment opportunities and weather uncertainty in the macro environment.” The number of employees who lost jobs at Lacework is thought to be around 200.

Cybereason Only a week after Lacework shocked the cybersecurity community with its layoffs another cash-rich security startup confirmed it was also slashing its payroll to save cash. Endpoint-security firm Cybereason which is based in Tel Aviv Israel and Boston said it was laying off 10 percent of its workforce or more than 100 employees. The move came only four months after Cybereason had filed for an IPO and less than a year after it raised an additional $325 million in funding of which $275 million was raised via a Series F round led by Liberty Strategic Capital a VC firm founded by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The layoff culprit? “As the bullish tech market conditions have turned and the tech IPO market has essentially closed companies like us must now exercise more strict financial discipline and prioritize profitably over top line growth” the company said in a statement. But Cybereason founded in 2012 defiantly concluded: “Our market traction remains strong as we continue to build a company that matters with long-term objectives in mind and plans for a tremendous outcome when the markets – and we – are ready.”

Deep Instinct Deep Instinct’s move to cut its workforce by a reported 10 percent was the third major cybersecurity industry layoff in just two weeks. Crunchbase first reported the Deep Instinct layoffs in early June with CNBC later confirming the action. Officials at Deep Instinct founded in 2015 and based in New York could not be reached for comment by CRN. Lane Bess chairman of Deep Instinct recently told CNBC that the company had to get more efficient with its sales operation. “We took a look and said ‘Where are we being most effective in the enterprise?‘” Bess said.. “Are we doing well in the low end of the market where we have inside salespeople? No. Do we have channel partners that can get to that low end of the market? Yes.’” Over the years Deep Instinct which uses artificial intelligence to detect and prevent malware has raised more than $259 million in funding from investors including BlackRock and Millennium.

OneTrust Software developer OneTrust become the fourth high-profile security startup to announce layoffs in recent weeks – and the sheer size of the reductions were stunning. Founded in Atlanta about six years ago OneTrust provider of privacy security and governance products said that as a result of a company reorganization it was cutting its workforce by 950 people or about 25 percent of the company. “I know this news is surprising especially as you heard last month that the business is on track with record quarters and increasing customer demand” OneTrust chief executive Kabir Barday wrote in a blog post. “However capital markets sentiment shifted to a more balanced approach between growth and profitability and at this time we have decided the best course of action is to reorganize to position OneTrust for continued long-term success.” OneTrust’s layoffs came just over a year after it raised $210 million in new funding led by led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. The company has raised a total of $920 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbmV3LXBoaXNoaW5nLWF0dGFjay1pbmZlY3RzLWRldmljZXMtd2l0aC1jb2JhbHQtc3RyaWtlL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbmV3LXBoaXNoaW5nLWF0dGFjay1pbmZlY3RzLWRldmljZXMtd2l0aC1jb2JhbHQtc3RyaWtlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New phishing attack infects devices with Cobalt Strike,"Security researchers have noticed a new malicious spam campaign that delivers the 'Matanbuchus' malware to drop Cobalt Strike beacons on compromised machines.

Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing suite that is frequently used by threat actors for lateral movement and to drop additional payloads.

Matanbuchus is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) project first spotted in February 2021 in advertisements on the dark web promoting it as a $2500 loader that launches executables directly into system memory.

Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 analyzed it in June 2021 and mapped extensive parts of its operational infrastructure. The malware's features include launching custom PowerShell commands leveraging standalone executables to load DLL payloads and establishing persistence via the addition of task schedules.

Ongoing campaign

Threat analyst Brad Duncan captured a sample of the malware and examined how it works in a lab environment.

The malspam campaign currently underway uses lures that pretend to be replies to previous email conversations so they feature a 'Re:' in the subject line.

The emails carry a ZIP attachment that contains an HTML file that generates a new ZIP archive. This ultimately extracts an MSI package digitally signed with a valid certificate issued by DigiCert for ""Westeast Tech Consulting Corp.""

Running the MSI installer supposedly initiates an Adobe Acrobat font catalog update that ends with an error message to distract the victim from what happened behind the scenes.

In the background two Matanbuchus DLL payloads (""main.dll"") are dropped in two different locations a scheduled task is created to maintain persistence across system reboots and communication with the command and control (C2) server is established.

Finally Matanbuchus loads the Cobalt Strike payload from the C2 server opening the way to wider exploitation potential.

Cobalt Strike as a second-stage payload in Metanbuchus malspam campaign was first reported by DCSO a German security company on May 23 2022. They also noticed that Qakbot was also delivered in some cases.

Interestingly in that campaign the digital signature used for the MSI file was again a valid one from DigiCert issued to ""Advanced Access Services LTD.""

By Ayya Lmahamad

The recent global events have brought the threat of cyberattacks on individuals businesses and nations into sharp focus. As more of our lives have moved online scammers hackers and fraudsters got an opportunity to strike. Cyberattacks are now the fastest-growing crime globally. The frequency of cyberattacks in the world has increased by almost four times. If earlier network threats were recorded every 40 seconds now every 11 seconds.

In this regard more and more nations now are focusing on implementing measures to ensure the countries’ cybersecurity. It is needed to clarify here that cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks.

Azerbaijan like almost any country in the world is also exposed to significant risks due to increasing global cyber threats. Over recent years the country has created special services and taken relevant measures to reduce such risks prevent cyberattacks and protect computers of the most important civil defense and industrial systems.

In the first four months of the year the number of requests in Azerbaijan related to computer security amounted to 1.8 million of which 96.9 percent were reviewed and satisfied. In addition the number of unique cyber incidents in the Azerbaijani segment of the Internet decreased by 20.3 percent last year compared to 2020.

Center for Combating Computer Incidents (CERT)

In this regard the Center for Combating Computer Incidents (CERT) was created at the State Agency for Special Communications and Information Security. Nowadays this structure is an effective mechanism for identifying and preventing threats to web resources and the internet space as a whole.

The agency head Tural Mammadov recently stated that the main types of cyberattacks that have been identified in Azerbaijan over the past year are phishing attacks social engineering and website cloning.

He also added that CERT launched a cybersecurity knowledge testing system - kibergigiyena.az in order to improve cyber hygiene.

Global Cybersecurity Index

The country continuously takes measures to prevent cyber threats and threats related to information security. In 2021 Azerbaijan ranked 40th among 194 countries in the Global Cybersecurity Index.

In this context Azerbaijan has a goal of becoming one of the leading regional and world countries in the information security sphere.

Strategy on cybersecurity

Azerbaijan has developed a strategy for cybersecurity which covers the years from 2019 to 2022. The strategy was developed based on the need to increase the level of national cybersecurity in Azerbaijan and reduce threats to information systems. It is planned to adopt a new strategy for the development of the Azerbaijani cybersecurity sector from 2022 to 2027.

The cybersecurity sector has been included in Azerbaijan’s development strategy until 2030.

Association of Cybersecurity Organizations of Azerbaijan (AKTA)

In April this year a new public association has been created in the country - the Association of Cybersecurity Organizations of Azerbaijan.

The association will unite companies organizations and specialists operating in the field of IT and cybersecurity in the country on a single platform. The main objectives of the association are to coordinate measures to strengthen and ensure the cybersecurity environment in Azerbaijan and support the development of this field in the country.

The association will support the application of scientific and technical achievements in the field of cyber security awareness and information in this area protect national interests from propaganda and disinformation activities make relevant proposals in this fight and coordinate the work done.

Baku Cybersecurity Forum

Baku Cybersecurity Forum will be held in Baku on June 23 2022. The forum will be held with the support of distributor BAKOTECH and cybersecurity solutions manufacturer Palo Alto Networks at the JW Marriott Absheron Baku Hotel.

During the forum industry experts will analyze the modern challenges of corporate cybersecurity and the possibility of building a reliable protection system using a single platform.

Key topics of this year’s forum include constant changes in IT infrastructure lack of staff and other challenges and how to cope with them; is it possible to build endpoint protection network and cloud infrastructure based on a single platform; and efficient solutions for protecting infrastructure and data.

Taking into account all the measures already taken it is possible to say now that Azerbaijan successfully ensures the country’s cybersecurity.

Pierce: Parent company of 2 Utah TV stations may buy a broadcast network,"(The CW) The Nexstar Media Group which owns Salt Lake City TV stations KTVX-Ch. 4 and KUCW-Ch. 30 is reportedly on the verge of buying The CW network.

Two of Utah’s local TV stations may soon be owned by a company that owns a broadcast network but neither station is being sold. It’s the network that’s for sale.

They’re still working on a deal but don’t be surprised when the Nexstar Media Group announces that it’s buying The CW from Paramount Global (formerly known as ViacomCBS) and Warner Bros. Discovery. And Nexstar is the parent company of not just Utah’s CW affiliate KUCW-Ch. 30 but also Utah’s ABC affiliate KTVX-Ch. 4.

Nexstar has a lot of local stations. More than anybody else. It owns or operates 200 stations in 116 markets across the country — from the No. 2 market (Los Angeles) to the No. 197 market (San Angelo Texas) — including the two Salt Lake City stations in the No. 30 market.

The Texas-based company has a reputation for being sort of a benevolent behemoth. Its local news operations don’t have a political bent and its stations aren’t dictated to from company headquarters. That’s a decided contrast to the right-wing propaganda viewers of Sinclair Broadcast Group-owned or operated stations (including KUTV-Ch. 2 KJZZ-Ch. 14 and KMYU-Ch. 12 in Utah) have come to expect.

(Nexstar Media Group) The nation's largest owner of local TV stations is reportedly on the verge of buying The CW network.

Nexstar also has a reputation for being cheap. That comes as no surprise to viewers of KTVX’s newscasts on both Ch. 4 and Ch. 30 who can see that the “New 4 Utah” team is operating on a limited budget.

The company has poured a lot of money into its NewsNation cable channel. It acquired the cable channel then known as WGN America when it purchased Tribune Broadcasting in 2019 and has converted it into a cable news channel.

The plan was for NewsNation to compete with CNN MSNBC and Fox News which hasn’t exactly worked out yet. When WGN became NewsNation ratings plummeted and they’ve remained low. Nexstar has spent hundreds of millions of dollars for a prime-time audience that averages around 40000 to 60000 viewers.

To put that in perspective the 10 p.m. newscast on Nexstar-owned KTLA-Ch. 5 in Los Angeles pulls in audiences that regularly exceed 100000 viewers.

If as expected Nexstar buys The CW local viewers won’t see any changes on Ch. 4. They won’t see any changes to the non-network part of Ch. 30′s schedule. They will like viewers everywhere else see changes to The CW’s schedule. Keep in mind Nexstar’s reputation for being tight with a dollar.

The fact is that The CW has lost money ever since it launched in 2006 a merger of sorts between The WB and UPN. It made economic sense for Warner Bros. and CBS as a platform for shows they produced which were then sold to streamers in syndication and internationally. That’s why The CW regularly renewed virtually all of its schedule despite low ratings.

But that model no longer makes sense. Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery each have their own streaming services Paramount+ and HBO Max respectively.

And the impending sale to Nexstar is why The CW broke with tradition and swung the ax on a lot of shows last month — canceling “Batwoman” “Charmed” “D.C.’s Legends of Tomorrow” “Dynasty” “The 4400” “In the Dark” “Legacies” “Naomi” and “Roswell New Mexico.” It also announced that the upcoming seventh season of “Riverdale” will be the last.

Nexstar isn’t going to pay for a lot of high-priced TV series. The future for The CW will feature fewer hourlong dramas and potentially fewer superhero shows. There will be more unscripted and/or reality shows and more foreign acquisitions. (It already has several including “Family Law” and “Professionals.”) There might be half-hour comedies. There will probably be shows from studios other than Paramount and Warner Bros.

There won’t be as many big-budget productions. There will be shows that look and are well cheap.

And come to think of it local viewers might be affected by the sale of The CW to Nexstar. If the new owner can’t figure out a way to make money on the network — or at least break even — the “News 4 Utah” budget might get even tighter.

Lady Cobham the daughter-in-law of founder Sir Alan Cobham has warned against 'auctioning off' high-tech firms Ultra Inmarsat and Meggitt in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

The deals are being closely monitored on both sides of the Atlantic. Decisions on the trio of aerospace and defence takeovers are expected later this year and are being investigated by Kwasi Kwarteng's Business Department.

Threat: Strategic UK firms are being bought up and swiftly sold on or broken up

However The Mail on Sunday understands Ministers are considering closer scrutiny of the planned purchase of Ultra by US private equity firm Advent. The 'phase two' investigation on whether the deal would threaten Britain's national security could deal a hammer blow to the £2.6billion takeover.

Ultra is regarded as a strategically important company because its work includes making enemy submarine-hunting sonobuoys.

Cobham was the first in a succession of deals targeting some of Britain's most cutting-edge firms. The activity has attracted the ire of the likes of former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine and the one-time head of the Royal Navy Admiral Lord West.

Critics want the Government to use its powers to block more deals on grounds of national security. They are particularly concerned that private equity firms take ownership only for a few years before selling businesses on again.

Advent is buying FTSE250-listed Ultra through what remains of its Cobham business.

But Lady Cobham told The Mail on Sunday 'no one should be taken in' by the fact Cobham is fronting the takeover – as the ultimate owner is a private equity firm.

'They sold off most of Cobham within 18 months of buying it and are bound to do the same to Ultra if the Minister waves this through' she said. 'The threat from Russia and China is growing and we should be investing in our domestic defence capability not auctioning it off.'

Concerns: Lady Cobham's family firm was split up

The Mail on Sunday previously revealed that Advent had agreed to set up a separate board of directors solely to oversee Ultra's contracts with the UK Government to ease national security fears.

Undertakings thought to have been secured by Kwarteng who swiftly intervened in the deal when it was announced last year include maintaining Ultra as a standalone entity that cannot be merged with Cobham. It is believed Advent initially wanted to merge the two then float the enlarged group within a couple of years.

Kwarteng is thought to be concerned by a threat from US authorities to limit defence cooperation with Britain if it blocks the Ultra takeover.

But talks are believed to have stalled over proposals to install a Government appointee on the board.

Despite pledging to be a long-term investor in the company which pioneered air-to-air refuelling technology Advent carved Cobham up and sold much of it off within 18 months. The Government had secured a range of guarantees including a promise to keep the UK headquarters and to alert the Government if it planned to sell off parts of the business. But campaigners including the Cobham family say that failed to protect it. Foreign suitors have also swooped on fellow defence and aerospace firm Meggitt and satellite group Inmarsat.

US aerospace giant Parker-Hannifin is set to buy Meggitt for £6.3billion and another US firm Viasat is poised to pick up Inmarsat for £5.4billion. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng called in the Ultra and Meggitt deals last summer and is investigating both under the old Enterprise Act.

The Inmarsat deal is being scrutinised under a new law the National Security and Investment Act which hands Ministers sweeping powers to investigate tie-ups and investments in 17 sensitive sectors.

An Advent spokesman said: 'Advent is committed to backing the Government's national security imperatives with over £500million invested in Cobham's research and development and strategic initiatives during our ownership and all defence asset disposals kept within the Five Eyes community of our closest allies.'

A Viasat spokesman said it was 'committed to invest heavily in its UK business'.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The famed Italian tenor will make his Sooner State debut with a June 23 concert at Oklahoma City's Paycom Center and Bocelli told The Oklahoman that he relishes the chance to perform in a new place.

""It’s an opportunity that comes ever so rarely having traveled the world far and wide in over a quarter of a century. ... The Oklahoma City concert is thus a special show that gives me great emotions. If it’s true that every time I step on stage I do so with great joy then the positive energy that motivates and recharges me will be even more intense"" Bocelli said in an email interview.

""This debut in the later years of my career is a festive moment that I am anticipating with great interest and eagerness. It’s another reason to give it my all in the hope of sharing an evening dedicated to beauty.

""If members of the audience go home after the concert a bit more serene with a smile on their faces then I will have accomplished my mission.""

Acclaimed tenor's OKC concert to 'call to the driving forces of the soul'

A globally acclaimed singer Bocelli 63 has been entertaining international audiences for more than 20 years while selling about 90 million records worldwide.

Along with his sold-out arena-scale concerts and record-breaking live-streams he has performed at major events like the Olympic Games the World Cup and Global Citizen Festival earned a Golden Globe and numerous other awards and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Bocelli is making his Oklahoma bow as he tours the United States — and later this month heads back to Europe and the UK — in support of his latest album ""Believe"" a collection of arias crossover hits and love songs released in fall 2020.

""The one main distinction I make when choosing my repertory is always between beautiful music and bad music. The challenge for me is to be able to continue to disseminate and promote quality wherever it may be"" Bocelli said.

""I will also be singing songs from 'Believe' an album that contains a mix of different musical choices that are timeless and not tied to any specific genre but capable of sparking — independently of any religious beliefs — moments of serenity and a call to the driving forces of the soul.""

Oklahoma City Philharmonic and Canterbury Voices to back Bocelli

In his Sooner State debut the superstar singer will be performing with the Oklahoma City Philharmonic which he called ""an orchestra about which I’ve heard many great things.""

OKC Philharmonic Executive Director Agnieszka Rakhmatullaev said the local musicians — including several players who recently backed The Who in concert at Paycom Center — are thrilled for the opportunity to perform alongside the world-renowned tenor in their hometown arena.

""Our phenomenal orchestra presents numerous concerts in venues across our city every season and we look forward to performing at the Paycom Center"" she said in an email.

About 60 singers from OKC's Canterbury Voices symphonic chorus also will back Bocelli in his first Oklahoma concert.

Canterbury Voices Executive Director Pam Mowry said the local singers are expected to be on stage for the duration of the concert and perform in French Italian and English as they accompany the tenor on several selections they've been rehearsing on their own and as a group for weeks.

""Our singers are incredibly excited — it's actually kind of hard to contain them. ... It's fun for them to get to sing with someone of his notoriety — and again with the Oklahoma City Philharmonic. We always love performing with them. To our singers especially a lot of them who are classically trained this is a big honor and a big deal"" Mowry said.

""He's obviously the soloist but we add in the middle or at the end of a piece the big wow factor ... to make it so much more exciting.""

Bocelli told The Oklahoman he is happy to perform with local musicians on his tour.

""Of course there’s work to do in advance at the podium. Although time is limited for rehearsal I very much believe in the empathy that is triggered among musicians on stage"" he said.

""It’s part of the magic of this extraordinary universal language that is music.""

Andrea Bocelli to offer 'good music and positivity' in Oklahoma concert

Audiences can expect Bocelli to bring the romance — or since he's Italian the ""romanze"" — to Oklahoma City. He said the first half of his concert will be dedicated to universally known and loved operatic pieces while the second will focus on narrative ballads and contemporary songs.

""So we will be listening to music from the great Italian composers from Giuseppe Verdi to Giacomo Puccini as well as pieces from the French repertoire and not only. Then the second part will feature the 'romanze' (songs) that warm the heart at every latitude as well as some of my most famous pop songs"" he said.

""The purpose is to offer an evening full of good music and positivity.""

By the end OKC audiences can expect to hear him perform his sweeping signature song ""Time to Say Goodbye (Con Te Partirò)"" which has been a global hit since he first debuted it 1995 and became an even bigger smash the following year when he recorded it as a duet with British soprano Sarah Brightman.

""There are songs that the public connects to me and expects to hear from me"" Bocelli told The Oklahoman. ""And it will be a joy and an honor for me to return so much kindness and be able to accommodate them.""

THE STORY of Silicon Valley can't be told without PayPal bridging the gap from the 1990s to the 2000s.

The PayPal saga is one of the most epic tales of a company inventing its own industry parrying competitors and regulators coming out on top and turning dozens of people into technology legends.

6 PayPal alumni have gone on to lead some of the most significant companies of the 21st century

The ""PayPal Mafia"" is an elite group of engineers investors and visionaries who continue to shape Silicon Valley and the world today.

The engineers who got their start at PayPal would go on to have illustrious careers as entrepreneurs and several alumni of the PayPal Mafia are billionaires - all of them are at least multi-millionaires.

PayPal was born out of the collision of two online payment companies: X.com and Confinity.

Both offered free cash bonuses to try to steal the other's users and nearly spent each other into oblivion - they would eventually join forces in a bittersweet merger with X.com and Confinity alum duking each other for executive positions.

The company invented complex security tools revolutionized digital payments and survived startup cardiac arrest on multiple occasions. But PayPal was just the beginning for these tech titans.

Elon Musk

Elon Musk founded X.com with the windfall from the sale of his first company Zip2 - he was already rich but not mega-rich and he risked a $10million dollar chunk of what he had at the time to launch X.com.

He envisioned X.com as the epicenter of digital finance cresting the wave of shifts from analog to digital.

Even though he was still the largest shareholder after the X.com-Confinity merger he was gutted by the 50-50 arrangement of power. He fired the CEO who oversaw the merger and took his place.

PayPal's sale to eBay made Musk immensely rich giving him the funds to get SpaceX and Tesla moving but it didn't happen without a Shakespearean betrayal.

There was contention about the direction that Musk was steering the company in. There was lingering pettiness over whether the company should be called X.com or PayPal.

Musk was eventually removed as CEO while on his honeymoon - the other executives conspired behind his back to have him taken out when he couldn't defend himself.

Musk is able to laugh off his ouster from PayPal. ""Maybe they thought I would come back and convince the board my original strategy and then just fire them"" he told Jimmy Soni author of a PayPal biography called The Founders.

Today Musk owns the X.com URL out of sentimental value. He also owns a space travel company the top electric car brand in the world and if the ink dries on the paperwork he'll own Twitter.

Peter Thiel

While a good deal of Silicon Valley all-stars could be called the ""nerd that made it"" Peter Thiel has more fury to him.

Recent headlines about Thiel are keyed in on his political bankrolling of pro-Trump candidates JD Vance and Blake Masters. He saw to the destruction of the news outlet Gawker using a Hulk Hogan sex tape as his foil in a showdown worthy of an HBO Miniseries.

But once upon a time Thiel was an early investor in Confinity when their flagship product was the ability to beam funds from one Palm Pilot to another.

During PayPal's run Thiel was almost killed in a car accident when Elon Musk totaled the $1million dollar McLaren sports car they were riding in.

As chairman of the board of directors Thiel sanctioned the hit on Musk and stepped into the CEO role himself.

Later on Thiel would become the first outside investor in Facebook. He bought 10% of Facebook for $500000 and sold it for $1billion.

Reid Hoffman

Reid Hoffman brokered the sale of PayPal to eBay - in doing so he turned millionaires into billionaires and business knights into industry kings.

According to Soni's book Hoffman told the eBay executive board ""I have a mandate to sell the company for a billion dollars.""

And he got it.

While delivering the commencement speech at Vanderbilt University Hoffman explained how PayPal's brutal schedule prompted him to plan a year of travel and rest - those plans were aborted when the idea for a professional networking site crystallized in his mind.

Instead of vacationing Hoffman founded LinkedIn the networking site that has become the lifeblood of modern employment and connection.

Hoffman's life motto is aptly loaded with business terminology fitting for a Valley-er: “To change the world for the better at scale.”

Yelp

The executives at PayPal were ultra-savvy folks whose next move after PayPal would be a guaranteed draw for investors.

But the juniors at the company had big ideas too.

Jeremy Stoppelman was a young but trusted engineer at PayPal who saw the company through to its acquisition. When Musk was ousted as the CEO of PayPal a 23-year-old Stoppelman let Thiel have it in a shouting fit detailed in Soni's book.

Stoppelman later took in an investment of one million dollars from PayPal co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Max Levchin to start his own business.

He turned Levchin's $1million dollars into Yelp the local reviews company worth $2billion dollars - adding to his legend status Stoppelman turned down Google's offer to buy Yelp which earned him praise from Steve Jobs.

YouTube

The reach of PayPal alumni somehow goes further than space travel electric cars local reviews and social media networks.

Chad Hurley Stephen Chen and Jawed Karim served honorably as young PayPal employees before founding YouTube in 2005.

Karim uploaded the very first YouTube video called ""Me at the zoo"" - the video has been viewed over 230000000 times.

When the company was bought by Google just a year later for $1.65billion all three received hefty portfolios of Google stock.

eBay spun PayPal out as its own entity in 2015 and later halted the use of PayPal as a payment option on their site in 2021.

PayPals's role in fintech engineering fraud prevention and e-commerce has left its mark on Silicon Valley and the entrepreneurs who were part of PayPal's ascent have tattooed their stamp on the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL2p1bi8xOC9idXktbm93LXBheS1sYXRlci1yaWdodHMtcmVmdW5kcy1taXNzZ3VpZGVkLXJldHVybnPSAWRodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi9qdW4vMTgvYnV5LW5vdy1wYXktbGF0ZXItcmlnaHRzLXJlZnVuZHMtbWlzc2d1aWRlZC1yZXR1cm5z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buy now pay later: your rights over refunds as Missguided collapses,"Buy now pay later (BNPL) firms have pledged to refund shoppers affected by the collapse of the fast-fashion retailer Missguided.

The online clothing brand entered administration on 30 May owing suppliers millions of pounds and leaving customers in the dark about orders and refunds.

Administrators from Teneo are in charge until Frasers Group the retail empire owned by the Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley takes over in August after a £20m deal.

The site’s low prices – it hit the headlines in 2019 for selling £1 bikinis – and BNPL options meant it was popular with shoppers who wanted to try on outfits at home before returning unwanted clothes.

BNPL allows shoppers to buy items and either pay for them in monthly or weekly instalments or delay settling the total balance for 30 days.

Missguided is not paying refunds even for items that have already been returned and customers have been told they are likely to get a “small fraction” of what they are owed from the administration process. Teneo has not responded to requests for comment.

Martyn James the head of media at the complaints website Resolver says: “Because businesses like Missguided are online their business model – one of ordering clothes to try to then processing returns – leaves consumers exposed to big losses if the firm goes bust.”

However big BNPL firms have confirmed that many of their customers will get their money back and have future payments cancelled.

While that is good news for shoppers the unregulated sector has faced criticism for allowing customers to build up debt and for lax affordability checks and should only be used by shoppers who can keep up with the repayments.

Citizens Advice research published this month found that more than two in five recent shoppers relied on credit cards and other borrowing to repay their BNPL debts.

The sector is set to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority but this is unlikely to happen until later this year or in 2023.

Will my BNPL lender give me a refund?

The UK’s big BNPL operators say most customers with a valid claim will be able to get a full refund. You can pause future payments by registering that you have returned items in the BNPL firm’s app or on its website.

Clearpay says customers who do not receive their purchases or who have returned an item will be repaid or have their debts cancelled. “Our customers will not be in a position where they are out of pocket or lose their legal rights to return” a spokesperson says.

Klarna the UK’s biggest BNPL operator with millions of customers says shoppers can open a dispute in the “usual way” and it will offer refunds where appropriate.

Laybuy which allows shoppers to spread payments over six weekly instalments says it will give customers who can show proof of a return a full refund.

PayPal which also offers credit and BNPL options says all of its customers can claim a refund if their purchase does not arrive or match its product description.

You can process refunds or open disputes by logging into your account with the relevant lender.

It helps if you have evidence that you have made a return or have attempted to contact Missguided.

If the BNPL firm decides not to uphold your complaint you can’t take the case to the financial ombudsman but you may be able to get a refund via your bank.

What should I do if I still need to return an item?

Missguided’s website is currently down for “maintenance” and it is not accepting orders or returns but it is still worth making a claim through your BNPL provider if you are stuck with unwanted items.

Laybuy customers are liable for payments if they can’t make a return but the company says it will take a “pragmatic approach … especially if the inability to make a return is likely to cause undue duress or hardship”.

A spokesperson says: “We encourage anyone in this situation to make contact with our customer service team to discuss their situation so that we can work with them to identify a solution. This might include developing a tailored repayment plan pausing repayments or writing off the debt.”

Klarna encourages customers in this situation to open a dispute to allow it to investigate and Clearpay says it will look at claims on a “case-by-case” basis.

What are my rights if I paid by debit or credit card?

Credit card customers have more protection for large orders than BNPL shoppers as transactions between £100 and £30000 are covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.

You don’t get this protection when you use BNPL even if you used your credit card to pay because it was linked to your BNPL account.

Meanwhile if your order was less than £100 or if you used a debit card you will have to ask your card provider for a chargeback.

You can only do this after you have already complained to the retailer and there is a time limit on chargebacks which differs between banks.

You can also do a chargeback if you paid using your debit card through a BNPL platform such as Klarna.

However you have to choose whether to pursue a refund via your bank or BNPL firm first as you can’t have both disputes open at the same time.

If your chargeback request is unsuccessful you can appeal against the decision through the financial ombudsman.

Finally you could follow the administration process but this is likely to take months and you will only get some of your money back if you get anything at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludGVsbGluZXdzLmNvbS91emJla2lzdGFuLXMtaXQtc2VjdG9yLW9uLWZpcmUtYW5kLXRhcmdldGluZy10aGUtdmFzdC11cy1tYXJrZXQtMjQ3OTE2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uzbekistan's IT sector on fire and targeting the vast US market,"One country’s brain drain is another country’s gain. In the competitive business of IT outsourcing Uzbekistan wants to wind up on the right side of that equation.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves through the world of outsourced IT services as sanctions and the exit of Western companies prompted highly trained technology professionals to flee Russia and Belarus in droves. Uzbekistan just a few years into its own tech revolution launched an aggressive drive to attract as many as possible to the capital Tashkent. More than 5000 have arrived since the start of the conflict according to the government and 2000 alone came from the Belarusian capital Minsk after the Uzbek government sent several charter flight to rescue those that wanted to leave shortly after the Ukraine war started. Belarus’ participation in Russia’s war in Ukraine killed what was left of its domestic IT sector.

Mission: USA

Flush with new IT talent Uzbekistan’s Minister for the Development of Information Technologies and Communications (ICT) Sherzod Shermatov is leading a delegation of business leaders on a US trade tour to promote his country’s credentials as a new low-cost destination for outsourcing IT and services from software development to business processes. With stops in New York Washington DC San Jose and Irvine in California the group will meet with executives from companies including Apple Google Meta PayPal and Coursera as well as US and international officials.

Their case? Labour in Uzbekistan is half the cost and Shermatov told bne IntelliNews in an exclusive interview: “The quality is every bit as good as in India and the Philippines two countries that have dominated the IT outsourcing market for decades.” Add to that a friendly tax and regulation regime new infrastructure and a young and growing population taking crash courses in coding and English.

“Currently Uzbekistan has the best proposition for IT companies in terms of tax benefits” Shermatov said in an interview from Tashkent. “If you become a resident of our IT Park you are completely free from taxes.” Wages for business process outsourcing jobs such as logistics are about a quarter of those in the US and significantly lower than those in India and the Philippines he said.

Unprecedented transformation

Uzbekistan is aware that it has come late to the outsourcing party. Besides Russia and Belarus countries including Romania the Baltic states and even Jamaica have been pursuing aggressive growth in the market for years while existing powerhouses continue to benefit from long-established connections. Uzbekistan’s technology and English-language initiatives only began in 2017 a year after Shavkat Mirziyoyev took over as president.

Mirziyoyev has thrown the one-time pariah state open and his comprehensive reform programme that was detailed in the bne IntelliNews report Uzbekistan Rising is “adding value.” The government has taken existing sectors like cotton production and forced local firms to make textiles instead. IT is same and hopes to capitalise on Uzbekistan's young and growing population; the Central Asian republic is one of the very few Former Soviet Union countries to have seen its population grow in the last decade.

“IT is one of the few industries which is a pure net positive to the balance payments” says Shermatov. “If you set up a car plant you have to import machines but with IT you import nothing and everything can go for export. Our competitive advantage is the lower cost of labour but for the average Uzbek the wages they can earn in IT are much better than they can get in the traditional economy.”

Since the start of the IT reforms the country has gone into overdrive engaging in what the World Bank calls an “unprecedented economic and social transformation.” About 1.2mn Uzbeks have completed the “One Million Uzbek Coders” training programme and over a million more are signed up.

Tashkent’s IT Park – created just three years ago – now hosts more than 650 companies – all of which are exempt from paying taxes and customs duties until 2028 better terms than existed in Russia or Belarus even before sanctions were introduced. Customers already there include Amazon UPS DHL and Volvo.

With US help Uzbekistan launched the English Speaking Nation programme spending tens of millions of dollars on raising proficiency in the language. The country’s more than 30000 English language teachers receive US-funded training and government officials are paid a premium if they speak English. The state also opened up the country to a number of foreign universities – creating competition in the educational market and raising standards. There are 6mn children in Uzbekistan and 680000 will graduate this year to join the workforce. The president has put a high premium on not only adding value to industry but also the country’s human capital one of its most valuable resources.

“I was actually minister of public education when we started pursuing projects with the idea that most of our graduates would be able to speak English.’’ Shermatov said. “Then there’s IT Nation where we have a comprehensive approach on changing the curriculum from the idea that school graduates would be able to not just be users of ICT but also the developers who can earn money in IT…. We even encourage our workers to speak with an American accent as that is already our biggest export market.”

High stakes

The stakes are high for the double-landlocked Central Asian republic of 35mn whose main exports are gold copper textiles and agricultural goods. Uzbekistan is dependent on nearby Russia's demand for its exports and it relies on the Russian railway network for access to markets further afield. That’s a matter of growing concern for the country’s leadership and business community analysts say after seeing the Russian military cut off Ukraine’s access to the sea and close its most vital export routes.

IT exports offer a unique solution to the country’s geographic challenges. All you need is English-speaking digital natives and a good and inexpensive internet connection. The cost of a quality connection in Uzbekistan has plummeted over the last couple years thanks to tens of millions of dollars in government investment according to Nodir Ruzmatov the CEO of New York-based business process outsourcing company RevoTech and Uzbekistan’s largest entrepreneur in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and IT outsourcing.

“When we started the park in 2017 it was almost nothing. It was only the tax benefits’’ said Farhod Ibragimov CEO of IT Park Uzbekistan. “There have been huge changes over the last three or four years in Uzbekistan's IT sphere. 58 universities now have IT specialised courses 20 of them are wholly focused on IT. We already have over 20000 high qualified specialists right now and that is going to increase by at least 10000 annually.’’

The conflict in Ukraine has provided an unexpected windfall for Uzbekistan in more ways than one. Besides prompting an influx of IT talent it has also severely restricted the outsourcing businesses of Russia and Belarus two of the biggest competitors in the region. Ukraine is another big player in the IT outsourcing business and has also suffered extreme disruptions.

Open arms

Uzbekistan continues to woo IT specialists introducing special three-year multiple entry IT visas simplifying the process of obtaining residency permits taking IT specialists looking at moving to Uzbekistan on tours to the ancient city of Samarkand the heart of the ancient Silk Road and plying them with plov the country’s signature dish of rice pilaf.

Uzbekistan IT park’s website provides testimonials from IT professionals who have made the swap and has just commissioned a mini-documentary introducing would-be IT immigrants to Uzbekistan. And this may just be the beginning. The Russian Association of Electronic Communications a lobby group said in March that 50000 to 70000 specialists had left Russia and as many as 100000 more might follow them in the coming month.

Cue operation “Tash Rush.” On February 25 the day after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Uzbekistan’s IT Park launched its relocation programme backed by local businesses. Within weeks Uzbekistan had sent 12 chartered flights to the Belarusian capital Minsk to ferry some of the world’s most talented software developers to Tashkent. When Belarus held one of the planes on the tarmac and refused to let it leave Uzbekistan’s President Mirziyoyev jumped on the phone to intervene. The flight took off.

The relocation programme provides perks to tech immigrants including credit cards and sim cards housing assistance help finding jobs for spouses and registration of children at schools and a “One Stop Shop” to deal with red tape recruit personnel and find offices. Working with contacts developed during Uzbekistan’s study of the IT industry in Belarus they got the word out that Uzbekistan was ready to provide a warm welcome.

“The first days of this event were you know a big rush” Ibragimov said in a joint interview with the minister. “Everybody was worried. And even the plane tickets were extremely expensive at the time. We tried to organise and help in everything. Now those companies are happy with us since we were friendly with them when they were in need.”

Growth ambitions

Uzbekistan’s goal is to grow the volume of the country’s IT exports to $1bn by 2028 a 25-fold increase from last year. The target for 2022 is $100mn more than double the total from 2021 and 50-times what IT exports earned in the first year in 2017. At $1bn Uzbekistan’s IT exports would surpass the value of agricultural goods and textiles. In short Uzbekistan is aiming to turn knowledge-based IT exports into the biggest economic driver in the country after gold.

A shift from $6.2mn in IT exports in 2019 to the targeted $1bn in less than a decade would be nothing short of a revolution – reducing the country’s dependence on physical trade routes and lifting more of the population in this low-income country out of poverty. The trip to California throws the opportunity of technology into sharp focus. California roughly the same physical size as Uzbekistan has a GDP of more than $3 trillion. In 2020 Uzbekistan’s was $57.7bn according to World Bank Data. California’s GDP per capita is $85546 (2021) compared with $1900 in Uzbekistan.

In California the trade delegation has fixed meetings with executives from several companies including Apple Google Meta PayPal and Coursera in Silicon Valley according to the minister. The initial meetings in New York and Washington will deal with more general political questions as Uzbekistan’s geopolitical importance has been boosted by Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Taliban take over in Afghanistan.

While the growth targets may seem ambitious from Uzbekistan’s point of view reaching the goal of $1bn would require securing only a tiny fraction of the US market. The US accounts for the lion’s share of the global IT outsourcing market expected to be worth as much as $682.3bn by 2027 – up from just over $526bn last year according to Mordor Intelligence. About 80% of Uzbekistan’s IT exports currently go to the US

“One billion within a few years? Yeah it's pretty doable and we are very confident about it’’ Ruzmatov who has landed dozens of clients in the US in just the last few years said in the interview. “And if business is confident and the government is supportive I think we have everything everything on hand to do it and to make it happen.”

The US appears to like what it’s seeing in Uzbekistan. Daniel Rosenblum the US ambassador to the country visited Tashkent’s IT Park this month to extend his support and Minister Shermatov’s trade delegation has meetings in Washington with the State Department USAID and on Capitol Hill. The US is keen to counter Russian influence in the former Soviet space. Uzbekistan is – arguably – the only country in the region whose foreign policy is not dictated by Moscow.

And Uzbekistan has an in to the US market via the Nasdaq listed EPAM software company. Originally founded in Belarus EPAM was instrumental in setting up the Minsk High Tech Park that catalysed a boom in that country’s IT outsourcing business. EPAM has long since moved its head office to New York but the largest part of its engineers were still based in Minsk. However since the mass protests against President Alexander Lukashenko broke out last year now followed by war EPAM has increased the number of its employees working in Tashkent from 300 to 3000.

Raising the profile

Shermatov a Yale graduate says his job is to raise awareness – noting that when he got his Master’s Degree in 2000 he was always taken aback at how few people had even heard of his country. Awareness of the new Uzbekistan is still a hurdle 22 years on. Despite being named “Country of the Year” by The Economist in 2019 with an aggressive reform agenda Central Asia’s most populous nation needs to do more to raise its profile.

In the 'Doing Business 2020' study by the World Bank Uzbekistan was ranked among the world’s most improved economies for ease of doing business – rising from 141st in 2015 to 69th. The macroeconomic backdrop is also improving. In 2021 the economy grew at a record 7.4% despite COVID-19 and global economic turbulence. Even during the height of the pandemic in 2020 Uzbekistan’s economy grew 1.6% one of the few countries to show any increase.

Uzbekistan’s economic reforms including price and currency liberalisation are also helping the country make friends. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently resumed lending there after a decade-long hiatus. And it’s not just the EBRD. The World Bank the IMF and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are all providing financing to support Uzbekistan’s reforms.

Economically speaking it’s hard to overstate the importance of IT for the country. The average monthly wage in Uzbekistan is still less than $200 a month. To achieve the country’s aim of halving poverty and reaching upper-middle-income status by 2030 Uzbekistan needs more and better jobs according to the World Bank.

Are a few short years of reforms and rebuilding enough to convince US executives to make deals with a country that few of them can pick out on a map?

“We have qualified specialists we have experience and we are ready with the infrastructure as well” said Minister Shermatov. “Before it was always through the other countries Poland Belarus Russia others; now it is time to go and work directly with US companies because we are ready.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vZXNwb3J0cy1uZXdzLWhlLXRydWx5LW5ldmVyLXVuZGVyc3Rvb2QteW91dHViZS1zdGFyLXZhbGt5cmFlLW1ha2VzLWFuLWhvbmVzdC1hZG1pc3Npb24tYWJvdXQtaGVyLWZhdGhlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""He Truly Never Understood.."" - YouTube Star Valkyrae Makes an Honest Admission About Her Father","Popular streamer Valkyrae (otherwise known as Rae) revealed how her Dad used to think she works for PayPal!

Fortunately as the summer of 2022 arrives the 21st of June filling up the fridge or picnic cooler with the latest collection of beverages is an adventure in flavor starting with three new ""spirited"" drinks from the Coca-Cola Company.

These Are Costco's Most Popular Items Right Now

A Jack and Coke Please

Although this new offering from Coca-Cola is debuting in Mexico first before it heads to the U.S. there is no denying that the contents in the striking black—not red—can are an American original most notably in the South where the drink is known simply as Jack and Coke (or JD and Coke)—the ""Jack"" being Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey.

Announced in early June the combo has all the trappings of a hit in the fast-growing ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktail-in-a-can market. After all separately Jack Daniels and Coke are already best sellers. Plus according to the Lynchburg (TN) Times Jack Daniels's hometown newspaper so is the pairing of Jack and Coke which was voted the No. 1 mix in a survey of the most popular New Year's Eve drinks for ringing in 2022.

Before Jack and Coke came premixed in a can fans followed the classic way to enjoy the refreshing combo: a glass of ice and a shot (or two) of whiskey topped with fizzing sweet Coca-Cola.

Coca-Cola's first canned soda cocktail for the U.S. market it will come in regular Coke and Coke Zero flavors. The alcohol content is 5% by volume which is equal to most bottled beers.

Hmm Maybe a Spiked Lemonade

If whiskey's not your thing how about cooling down on a summer afternoon with a tangy lemonade that delivers a punch—something like Simply Spiked Coca-Cola's new alcohol-infused twist on its best-selling line of Simply fruit juices.

Scheduled to hit the shelves this summer Simply Spiked is Coca-Cola's second deal with MolsonCoors. Last year the two teamed up on the launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer.

Next to its line of colas Simply is Coca-Cola's second-largest brand by revenue according to the company sold in single 24-ounce cans and 12-can variety packs. The newly fortified Simply will be available in lemonade strawberry lemonade watermelon lemonade and blueberry lemonade flavors. A 12-ounce can contains 5% alcohol by volume and 170 calories.

Wait How About a Cocktail with a Splash of Fresca?

Earlier this year Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands a brewing company that includes the Corona beer family announced the upcoming release of Fresca canned cocktails.

It is a natural pairing: like Coke with Jack Fresca has long been used as a mixer by design. Introduced in the late 1960s Fresca was ""positioned both as a mixer and a refreshing sparkling beverage as an alternative to bottled waters and seltzers"" according to Coca-Cola.

The new offering is called Fresca Mixed and boasts no calories and zero sugar. To date there is no word on the flavors of the newly fortified Fresca—Spanish for ""fresh""—but the cocktails will be ""using real spirits"" and the flavors ""will be inspired by recipes created by [Fresca] fans from around the globe"" according to a press release from Constellation Brands.

The Fresca products will be produced marketed and distributed through Constellation. ""One of the core tenets of our innovation strategy is a belief in the power of extending strong and trusted brands in thoughtful ways to bring to market unique products that resonate with consumers"" said Mallika Monteiro Constellation's chief growth strategy and digital officer.

'Tis the Season of Bubbly Pineapples

Trader Joe's is celebrating summertime with the release of its new Sparkling Pineapple Juice. Get it now—as a seasonal treat it will disappear from the shelves come September.

Made from real pineapple juice not concentrate the sparkling beverage contains no added sugars and only four ingredients: pineapple juice water carbon dioxide (it makes the bubbles) and ascorbic acid (which maintains color) according to Trader Joe's.

The signature flair of the pineapple drink is the ""ultra-fizzy"" bubbles says Trader Joe's which adds in its own signature style ""this bold beverage sips like a sparkling pineapple daydream on a tropical summer's day.""

For Whom the Bellini Tolls

PepsiCo is reviving if not the spirit at least the memory of a cocktail made famous by Ernest Hemingway. Called the Bellini the original is a mixture of Prosecco Italy's version of Champagne with white peach juice and purée. Created and served at Harry's Bar along the Grand Canal in Venice Italy Hemingway would drop by for a Bellini to sip while he wrote.

The main difference between the real Bellini and PepsiCo's aside from the view and the literary company is that PepsiCo's version is not alcoholic. It's a sparkling water called Bellini Bliss Bubly with no calories no sweeteners no artificial colors.

PepsiCo's ""first-ever mocktail"" the Bellini Bliss is flavored with mango peach and pineapple. Bellini Bliss Bubly will be available for 10 weeks this summer from June 13 to August 19 in stores nationwide and online in exclusive variety packs.

Olé Minute Maid

Minute Maid is going all out to promote its newest drink Aguas Frescas based on the traditional fresh fruit drink of Mexico and Latin America. Aguas frescas means ""fresh water"" in Spanish.

While these are new and exciting there are some canned alcohol options that shouldn't make their way to your cart. Here are 13 Worst Canned Cocktails to Always Leave on Grocery Store Shelves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtY29udGludWVzLXRvLXRlYXNlLXVzLWFsbC13aXRoLXNlbWktc2lnaHRpbmdzLWFjcm9zcy10aGUtdS1zL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtY29udGludWVzLXRvLXRlYXNlLXVzLWFsbC13aXRoLXNlbWktc2lnaHRpbmdzLWFjcm9zcy10aGUtdS1zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla continues to tease us all with Semi sightings across the U.S.,"By

Tesla is continuing to tease everyone excited about its upcoming Class-8 heavy-duty electric truck the Semi.

The truck has now made its third appearance this week and despite CEO Elon Musk’s plead for patience regarding the company’s product roadmap the Semi is making more appearances more often perhaps shifting at a change in tune in the vehicle’s production timeline.

The Semi was sighted three previous times this week: Twice on public roadways and once in Teslarati’s coverage of the truck being tested along with Megachargers at the Frito Lay/PepsiCo. facility in Modesto California. Prior to this the Semi was spotted at Gigafactory Texas’ Cyber Rodeo and other sightings have been on roads between Fremont and Giga Nevada or at company events.

The newest sighting took place earlier this week at the Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn MI. The two-mile speedway has been home to stock car racing events for decades but most recently hosted Tesla’s complete lineup of vehicles including the Semi.

The Semi basked in its glory at the track only serving as a continuous tease at least up to this point. Tesla fans and EV enthusiasts everywhere are interested in Tesla’s upcoming truck releases as the Cybertruck and the Semi have been close to production in the past. Market conditions and supply chain uncertainties have stagnated both of these projects which has pushed projected production start dates back considerably leaving reservation holders at a loss for words and the company with a lack of answers.

Despite this the many sightings of the Semi this week could be a good thing. After Musk pushed Tesla to start volume production of the Semi in mid-2020 the project was inevitably delayed due to a shortage of battery cells. Obviously the Semi requires more cells because of its size and in the current position of the EV market Tesla’s focus has been to transition more passenger vehicles to electrified powertrains not commercial ones. Therefore Tesla’s mass-market sedan Model 3 and crossover Model Y have been where the cells have gone and it has undoubtedly contributed to the company’s streak of nine consecutive quarters of growth in deliveries.

With continuous sightings of the Semi this week two questions remain: Will they continue and will the Semi make it to production sooner than we think?

Tesla continues to tease us all with Semi sightings across the U.S.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL3Nocmlua2ZsYXRpb24taXMtcmVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Shrinkflation’ is real,"AP – It’s the inflation you’re not supposed to see.

From toilet paper to yogurt and coffee to corn chips manufacturers are quietly shrinking package sizes without lowering prices.

It’s dubbed “shrinkflation” and it’s accelerating worldwide.

In the United States (US) a small box of Kleenex now has 60 tissues; a few months ago it had 65. Chobani Flips yogurts have shrunk from 5.3 ounces to 4.5 ounces. In the United Kingdom (UK) Nestle slimmed down its Nescafe Azera Americano coffee tins from 100 grammes to 90 grammes. In India a bar of Vim dish soap has shrunk from 155 grammes to 135 grammes.

Shrinkflation isn’t new experts say. But it proliferates in times of high inflation as companies grapple with rising costs for ingredients packaging labour and transportation. Global consumer price inflation was up an estimated seven per cent in May a pace that will likely continue through September according to S&P Global.

“It comes in waves. We happen to be in a tidal wave at the moment because of inflation” said consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts Edgar Dworsky who has documented shrinkflation on his Consumer World website for decades.

Dworsky began noticing smaller boxes in the cereal aisle last fall and shrinkflation has ballooned from there. He can cite dozens of examples from Cottonelle Ultra Clean Care toilet paper which has shrunk from 340 sheets per roll to 312 to Folgers coffee which downsized its 51-ounce container to 43.5 ounces but still says it will make up to 400 cups.

Dworsky said shrinkflation appeals to manufacturers because they know customers will notice price increases but won’t keep track of net weights or small details like the number of sheets on a roll of toilet paper. Companies can also employ tricks to draw attention away from downsizing like marking smaller packages with bright new labels that draw shoppers’ eyes.

That’s what Fritos did. Bags of Fritos Scoops marked “Party Size” used to be 18 ounces; some are still on sale at a grocery chain in Texas. But almost every other big chain is now advertising “Party Size” Fritos Scoops that are 15.5 ounces – and more expensive.

PepsiCo didn’t respond when asked about Fritos. But it did acknowledge the shrinking of Gatorade bottles. The company recently began phasing out 32-ounce bottles in favour of 28-ounce ones which are tapered in the middle to make it easier to hold them. The changeover has been in the works for years and isn’t related to the current economic climate PepsiCo said. But it didn’t respond when asked why the 28-ounce version is more expensive.

Likewise Kimberly-Clark – which makes both Cottonelle and Kleenex – didn’t respond to requests for comment on the reduced package sizes. Proctor & Gamble Co didn’t respond when asked about Pantene Pro-V Curl Perfection conditioner which downsized from 12 fluid ounces to 10.4 fluid ounces but still costs USD3.99.

Earth’s Best Organic Sunny Day Snack Bars went from eight bars per box to seven but the price listed at multiple stores remains USD3.69. Hain Celestial Group the brand’s owner didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

Some companies are straightforward about the changes. In Japan snack maker Calbee Inc announced 10 per cent weight reductions – and 10 per cent price increases – for many of its products in May including veggie chips and crispy edamame. The company blamed a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials.

Domino’s Pizza announced in January it was shrinking the size of its 10-piece chicken wings to eight pieces for the same USD7.99 carryout price. Domino’s cited the rising cost of chicken.

In India “down-switching” – another term for shrinkflation – is mostly done in rural areas where people are poorer and more price sensitive said head of corporate communications for Dabur India Byas Anand a consumer care and food business. In cities companies simply jack up prices.

“My company has been doing it openly for ages” Anand said.

Some customers who have noticed the downsizing are sharing examples on social media. Others said shrinkflation is causing them to change their shopping habits.

Alex Aspacher does a lot of the grocery shopping and meal planning for his family of four in Haskins Ohio. He noticed when the one-pound package of sliced Swiss cheese he used to buy shrank to 12 ounces but kept its USD9.99 price tag. Now he hunts for deals or buys a block of cheese and slices it himself.

Aspacher said he knew prices would rise when he started reading about higher wages for grocery workers. But the speed of the change – and the shrinking packages – have surprised him.

“I was prepared for it to a degree but there hasn’t been a limit to it so far” Aspacher said. “I hope we find that ceiling pretty soon.”

Sometimes the trend can reverse. As inflation eases competition might force manufacturers to lower their prices or reintroduce larger packages. But Dworsky said once a product has gotten smaller it often stays that way. “Upsizing is kind of rare” he said.

Professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University’s WP Carey School of Business Hitendra Chaturvedi said he has no doubt many companies are struggling with labour shortages and higher raw material costs.

But in some cases companies’ profits – or sales minus the cost of doing business – are also increasing exponentially and Chaturvedi finds that troubling.

He points to Mondelez International which took some heat this spring for shrinking the size of its Cadbury Dairy Milk bar in the UK without lowering the price.

The company’s operating income climbed 21 per cent in 2021 but fell 15 per cent in the first quarter as cost pressures grew.

By comparison PepsiCo’s operating profit climbed 11 per cent in 2021 and 128 per cent in the first quarter.

“I’m not saying they’re profiteering but it smells like it” Chaturvedi said. “Are we using supply constraints as a weapon to make more money?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2J1enotaW4tYmloYXItcmVjZW50LWludmVzdG1lbnRzLXNob3VsZC1ub3QtYmUteWV0LWFub3RoZXItZmFsc2Utc3RhcnQtZm9yLWEtYmFja3dhcmQtc3RhdGUvMjU2NDc0OC_SAZIBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmluYW5jaWFsZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9idXp6LWluLWJpaGFyLXJlY2VudC1pbnZlc3RtZW50cy1zaG91bGQtbm90LWJlLXlldC1hbm90aGVyLWZhbHNlLXN0YXJ0LWZvci1hLWJhY2t3YXJkLXN0YXRlLzI1NjQ3NDgvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buzz in Bihar: Recent investments should not be yet another false start for a backward state,"The speed with which a couple of private ventures in Bihar—a Rs 500 crore PepsiCo bottling plant and a Rs 105 crore ethanol plant —have kicked off is definitely a positive development for the poorest state in the country. Investments are typically attracted to richer industrialised states—reinforcing the Biblical axiom “For whosoever hath to him shall be given.” Last year Maharashtra and Gujarat attracted one-third of filed industrial entrepreneur memoranda (IEMs) and less than half of proposed investments in the country. Bihar accounted for a lowly 1.4% of the same. Over the last five years only 30% of filed IEMs have been implemented in the state. Despite this dismal track record Bihar received big-ticket foreign direct investments by GE and Alstom in 2015—the first such instance in the 169-year history of the Indian Railways—to manufacture diesel and electric locomotives. These projects are up and running but there has been no momentum towards attracting more FDI. This is indeed a state known for many false starts but the buzz around the two projects (and many more in the pipeline) is unmistakable.

The prospect for more industrial investments will indeed be transformative for Bihar a state in which half of the workforce is absorbed in agriculture. The state has the highest percentage of its rural population in poverty. Despite the best agro-climatic conditions this region is the bastion of semi-feudal agriculture and there is a preponderance of marginal holdings with low productivity. The relations of production act as barriers for technological change. The misrule and rampant corruption of successive regimes in the past have ensured limited modern economic development. The persistence of a less productive and less diversified agricultural sector could only sustain a relatively small industrial base—mostly in agro-processing—and petty service sector in the state.

But the big factor of change is the building of infrastructure like roads and bridges with public expenditures increasing 50-fold between 2000-01 and 2020-21 according to the state’s Economic Survey for 2020-21. Almost 18 km of rural roads were built every day since 2005. It is undeniable that better roads are extremely positive for Bihar to become a major centre for food processing among other possibilities. The Rs 500 crore PepsiCo’s bottling unit does appear a big-ticket investment when food processing in the state attracted investments of Rs 349 crore in 2019-20 and 2020-21.

While the two private projects hitting the ground running is noteworthy it is necessary to temper one’s expectations regarding employment. The bottling unit uses automation and AI which limits the scope for employment—only 65 direct employees and 700 indirect ones are employed by it. The ethanol plant also uses automation. Obviously more such projects are needed to provide adequate opportunities for the state’s youth to shift from agriculture to industry within the state. But the good news is that the state government is seized of the imperative to attract more investments by fast-tracking clearances. Land for the bottling unit was cleared on June 25 2021 construction started on June 28 the lease deed was executed on March 6 2022 and operations began on April 15. This is the best augury for future investments to take off and should initiate a cycle that can transform the industrial fortunes of the state."

On June 18 2022 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approved COVID-19 vaccination for young children who are at least 6 months old. This means roughly 20 million children in the United States under 5 years are newly eligible for vaccination. With COVID cases rising many parents are eager to vaccinate their youngest kids. Grace Lee MD associate chief medical officer for practice innovation and a pediatric infectious diseases physician answers frequently asked questions about vaccines for young children.

Why should my baby or young child receive the COVID-19 vaccine?

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there have been over 2 million cases 20000 hospitalizations and 200 deaths due to COVID-19 in children under 5 years of age. The CDC recommends a COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months and older. Stanford Medicine Children’s Health encourages all families to have eligible children vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine.

Scientific evidence has shown that the children who received COVID-19 vaccines during testing developed high levels of virus-fighting antibodies expected to protect them against coronavirus. Vaccines continue to be effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization including in children with and without any underlying medical conditions.

COVID-19 vaccines can also prevent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and may potentially prevent post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)—i.e. long COVID—which can be very debilitating for young children. Vaccines can protect children which in turn can reduce the risk of transmission to others.

What makes this vaccine different from the others administered to kids 5 years and older?

The only COVID-19 vaccine presently available for children older than 5 years in the U.S. is the Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine. For children under 5 we now have two vaccines available. The three-dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine can be given to children 6 months to 4 years of age at a 3 microgram dosage. The two-dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for children ages 6 months to 5 years at a dose of 25 micrograms. These doses were carefully selected to ensure the vaccine was well tolerated for young children.

How many doses of vaccine are needed and on what schedule?

If your child receives the Pfizer vaccine it is a 3-dose vaccine series: Dose 1 then 3-8 weeks later Dose 2 then >8 weeks later Dose 3.

For the Moderna vaccine it is a 2-dose vaccine series: Dose 1 then 4-8 weeks later Dose 2.

Children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may need additional doses similar to teens and adults.

How long does it take for the shots to take full effect?

A child can be considered fully immunized two weeks after the third dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine or two weeks after the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. Children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the final dose in the primary series.

What side effects can parents expect from the vaccines?

The most common side effects parents can expect for their child are a sore arm headache fever and fatigue. Children 6–23 months may be fussy or more sleepy. Symptoms usually occur one to two days after vaccination and are mostly mild and resolve after a few days. Parents should contact their primary care provider if they have any specific concerns about side effects from a shot.

The most common side effects parents can expect for their child are a sore arm headache fever and fatigue

My child is immunocompromised. Can they get the vaccine?

Yes children who are immunocompromised should receive vaccines to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 illness or death. Additional doses are given to children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised since their immune response to vaccines may not be as strong as in healthy people. Please ask your doctor about when to receive COVID-19 vaccines.

Where should young children be vaccinated?

Going to your child’s primary care provider is recommended for this age group. We encourage you to use all available local and state resources to get the COVID-19 vaccine at a place and time that is convenient for your family. You can also review Stanford Medicine Children’s Health resources to help find a vaccination site for your child.

For children who have already gotten COVID-19 is it still worth their getting the vaccine even if they were already exposed to the most recent variant?

Yes it is still worthwhile for these children to be vaccinated. While there is protection from natural immunity it is hard to tell just how durable and protective it is over time—it varies by the individual. The primary vaccine series offers additional and reliable protection against severe illness and/or death.

Vaccines continue to be effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization including children without any underlying medical conditions.

How long after my child’s COVID-19 infection should I wait before getting them vaccinated?

The situation may vary depending on a child’s medical history and the severity of the COIVD-19 infection but waiting until all symptoms have resolved is best.

In addition people who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a primary series dose or their first or second COVID-19 vaccine booster dose by three months from symptom onset or positive test (if infection was asymptomatic). Studies have shown that increased time between infection and vaccination may result in an improved immune response to vaccination. Check with your child’s pediatrician for more information.

What can parents do to reduce their child’s risk of getting COVID-19?

About 59% of 12- to 17-year-olds and around 29% of children ages 5–11 are fully vaccinated according to CDC data. A child is considered up-to-date if they have received all recommended doses for their age. I encourage everyone to keep doing their part to protect themselves and others by wearing a face mask doing proper handwashing and following other steps to keep people with a high risk of infection safe.

Walgreens Expertise in Pediatric Immunizations

In 2020 the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) expanded the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act authorizing licensed pharmacists to administer recommended vaccinations to children aged 3 and older. In that time Walgreens has significant experience in administering recommended vaccinations to millions of children and adolescents for COVID and flu vaccines as well as other immunizations.

Walgreens pharmacy team members are among the most trusted health resources readily available to administer vaccines and provide education to this newly eligible population and their parents or guardians. Pharmacists receive extensive training and assessments to ensure they can properly educate individuals about COVID-19 vaccines and administer them and are frequently updated on the latest CDC guidelines which Walgreens continues to follow closely throughout the pandemic.

COVID-19 vaccines for kids as young as 6 month old could be available next week.

First the CDC has to give a final signoff.

Many experts are already expressing a preference for one brand but both are good options.

Little kids toddlers and babies as young as 6 months old will likely be lining up for COVID-19 vaccines in pharmacies doctor's offices and vaccine clinics across the US in just a few more days.

The Food and Drug Administration gave its vote of confidence for shots from Moderna and Pfizer to start going into little arms on Friday. The move still requires a final signoff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this weekend but the White House is already planning for vaccinations to start ""as early as the week of June 20.""

Because there are two different brands being offered with different formulations dose schedules and side effects parents are already weighing which shot is best for them and their children.

""Both are great options"" ER doctor Jeremy Faust wrote in his Inside Medicine newsletter expressing confidence in both Pfizer and Moderna.

However Faust along with public health expert Katelyn Jetelina and prominent parenting author Emily Oster have all decided that Moderna is the top pick for their own young kids.

Their reasoning boils down to the fact that according to early data Moderna's shot appears to pack a bigger immune punch and it does the job faster. While short-term side effects are slightly worse with Moderna than with Pfizer Moderna kids appear to gain protection against COVID in a matter of weeks not months.

Faster protection with Moderna

Moderna's vaccine for babies and toddlers includes a bigger dose of mRNA than Pfizer's which may be part of the reason why FDA data suggests Moderna's shot prompts faster protection with fewer shots.

""The three-dose Pfizer series takes nearly 90 days to go into effect"" Faust said. ""Moderna's two-dose series is considered effective by day 42. That means Moderna recipients get protection much sooner.""

Faust even created his own model chart forecasting COVID-19 illnesses in little kids based on insights gleaned from the clinical trials. His model shows Moderna kids achieving some protection against COVID-19 illnesses about a month and a half before Pfizer kids do. But keep in mind that these are estimates based on the available data we have so far:

Inside Medicine

According to FDA data sets little kids who received Moderna in the company's clinical trials begin receiving some protection against COVID illnesses shortly after their second dose (administered at 30 days).

Kids under 5 who got Pfizer's vaccine didn't see much of a benefit kick in until they received their third dose which means it took almost three months for them to achieve meaningful protection against symptomatic COVID.

Based on the FDA breakdowns it looks like toddlers over 2 years old gain some immune protection a little faster than babies do both with Pfizer and with Moderna. But generally speaking it's about a month to a month and a half for Moderna versus three months for Pfizer.







""Parents should feel comfortable getting either one of these vaccines"" Dr. Peter Marks who runs the FDA's vaccine division said on Friday during a call with reporters.

""It may be that the Moderna vaccine brings an immune response slightly more rapidly"" he said. ""On the other hand the three dose Pfizer regimen may also bring a greater immune response after the third dose.""

Pfizer's 80% efficacy appears better than Moderna's — but Faust is skeptical about it

Pfizer said its three-shot vaccine was around 80% effective during trials. But this is a preliminary number based on only 10 COVID cases observed over the course of 40 days.

Moderna's roughly 40% to 50% vaccine efficacy estimate for kids 6 months to 6 years old includes more kids and a longer follow-up period of around 70 days.

Faust speculated that Pfizer's high effectiveness numbers might've been indicative of a ""honeymoon phase"" for the vaccine where the three jabs initially provide outstanding protection against infection. While public health experts agree that 80% figure may fade Faust is confident that protection against ""serious outcomes"" like hospitalization and death will ""hold up over time.""

""Infections were starting to occur in a few Pfizer recipients just at the end of the assessment period"" he said. ""It's likely that with a few more weeks of data Pfizer's efficacy might have dropped some leading to numbers closer to Moderna's.""

Some parents might prefer Pfizer's milder side effects

Because Pfizer's vaccine is a much smaller less potent mRNA dose than Moderna's it appears to come with easier side effects in the days after vaccination. The main ones for babies are irritability and drowsiness.

For toddlers and pre-schoolers arm pain was far more common for Moderna-takers than for those who got Pfizer.

""Pfizer also might be especially attractive to parents of children who have already had COVID"" Faust said since those kids may already have some immune protection.

Bottom line: there isn't a 'wrong' choice

Parents should be comforted to know that whatever vaccine they choose for their children is a good one.

""The correct answer here is: whatever vaccine your healthcare provider pediatrician has that's what I would give my child"" Marks said.

Vaccines help prevent long COVID and while they aren't flawless at stamping out infections they still slow the spread of disease through communities by reducing the amount of time people are infectious and by preventing some disease especially (and importantly) the severe kind.

""It's nice for parents of young children to have two options in the fight against COVID-19 instead of none"" Faust said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlZXZhLmNvbS9jdXN0b21lci1zdG9yaWVzL3BmaXplci1yZWltYWdpbmluZy1jb250ZW50LXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer: Reimagining the Content Supply Chain at Light Speed| Veeva,"Anuj Maheshwari vice president HCP and Patient Engagement Enablement Pfizer recently fielded questions from Emma Hyland vice president for commercial content strategy for Veeva in the EU about reimagining the content supply chain.

EH: What does it mean to enable Pfizer’s marketing and medical functions?

AM: As an industry there is an opportunity to elevate our game. Customers are asking for more fluidity of content and greater personalization. Our team thinks about operations that enable a full commercial function to serve the needs of physicians and patients. The team oversees services that enable marketing and medical content creation approval and dissemination. We also oversee our data ecosystem—everything associated with managing and capturing information and helping steward healthcare professional (HCP) interaction data.

We recently expanded support to the medical affairs team. As such we are now thinking about how content gets stood up in our ecosystem and gets disseminated to our customers agnostic of the domain.

EH: What are your key priorities for the year?

AM: The first one is accelerating the movement from multichannel to omnichannel. We are used to connecting and communicating with customers using many different channels but now we must connect with them better and enable more personalized interactions. The second one is around the expansion of our support to our Medical Affairs group. The third is to harness the power of metadata—the data that underlies these activities. If I were to include a fourth it would be about the future needs—we’re considering how modular content and agile content creation get included in our end-to-end processes.

EH: What makes multichannel to omnichannel hard to do?

AM: If you get five stakeholders in a room you’ll probably get six different omnichannel definitions. When you are shifting from multichannel to omnichannel you are likely going to face the challenge of integrating channels that have been operating independently. If they naturally cannot talk to each other you will either spend the time to stitch them together or want to start afresh. Either way the shift is significant plus on top of this you will need to bring in new capabilities like metadata that might have been back of the mind to the fore to inform data-driven decisions as well.

EH: Where should people start?

AM: I took on this role within Pfizer about a year ago and I’m standing on the shoulders of giants. Many intelligent people have applied their skills to get us this far. The first step is to lay out the current processes tools and technologies for content creation and interaction with physicians or patients.

Second I suggest you look at the critical areas causing the most inefficiencies. Start with the places where there is the biggest gap to help you prioritize what those efforts are. Then you can create a plan for each one of those areas. You must think about the long-term implications. For example if you think that the website is the channel that will provide the most upside then it behooves you to get those channels closer to your content repositories so that it’s a lot more seamless. We learned that one of the more significant gaps was metadata and we want to close it. These are some considerations if you’re going to become omnichannel marketers of the future.

EH: When you talk about metadata are you referring to tagging materials and assets?

AM: There are three parts—the first one is planning: The upfront items are defining taxonomies that you will use prioritizing the parts of the user experience you want to capture metadata for aligning on the metrics to use. Next comes getting that process stood up and integrated into the content creation process.

The second part is enabling the process—getting deeper into the engineering… there are tags associated with how people interact with content which change based on the channel. If it’s the web it’s clicks; if people watched a video you want to know how long they watched and the drop-off rate.

The third one is reporting and closing the loop with actions. How are you harnessing everything to help you render insights? If you are doing all these things how do you make decisions based on the information and take action that wraps into your overall content management strategy?

EH: Do you have recommendations the industry can make to develop content at light speed?

AM: Many content creators will tell you it takes way too long to create content. You need to identify the biggest points of a failure to drive efficiency. For example when people created content briefs they had to interact with different systems which took too long. We identified opportunities to drive automation and efficiency.

The second big driver was our approach to review and approval processes. We simplified and streamlined the work. We created a tiered review process where based on the magnitude of changes would require different types of reviewers. For example there may not be anything new to approve for a small change that’s already covered in the global policy.

And a third element was reinforcing global to local content creation which has been part of our lexicon for a few years. We want people to use globally created content locally. You don’t need to create new bespoke content for something that already exists in a global repository.

EH: Can we get to 100% medical legal and regulatory (MLR) automation in our industry?

AM: Setting a goal of 100% automation given the regulatory risk associated with it is likely a stretch in the short term. This being said we should ensure we are enabling review time for the parts that matter by applying tiering grouping or modularizing commensurate with the risk. I think advancements in technology would always balance with knowledgeable folks’ domain expertise.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has approved COVID-19 vaccines for children as young as six months allowing a nationwide rollout to start next week.

The CDC’s decision on Saturday came after a panel of advisers to the institution voted to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for those children.

“We know millions of parents and caregivers are eager to get their young children vaccinated and with today’s decision they can” Rochelle Walensky the CDC director said in a statement.

The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized Moderna Inc’s shot for children aged six months to five years and Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine for children aged six months to four years. Pfizer’s vaccine is already authorised for children over the age of five.

“This infection kills children and we have an opportunity to prevent that” Beth Bell one of the doctors on the advisory panel said following the vote. “Here is an opportunity to prevent a known risk.”

US President Joe Biden hailed the decision as a “monumental step” and said his administration plans to roll out the vaccines to the under-five age groups as early as next week.

“This coming week parents will be able to start scheduling appointments at places like pediatricians’ offices children’s hospitals and pharmacies” Biden said in a statement on Saturday.

“Appointments will ramp up as more doses are shipped out and in the coming weeks every parent who wants a vaccine will be able to get one.”

Roughly 18 million children will be eligible but it remains to be seen how many will ultimately get the vaccines. Less than a third of children ages 5 to 11 have done so since vaccination opened up to them last November.

Pfizer-BioNtech’s vaccine is for children 6 months to 4 years old. The dose is one-tenth of the adult dose and three shots are needed. The first two are given three weeks apart and the last at least two months later.

Moderna’s is two shots each a quarter of its adult dose given about four weeks apart for kids 6 months through 5 years old. The FDA also approved a third dose at least a month after the second shot for children with immune conditions that make them more vulnerable to serious illness.

CVS Health Corp says it plans to provide vaccines to children aged 18 months and older while Rite Aid Corp and Walmart Inc plan to offer these shots for kids who are at least three years old. Infants are traditionally vaccinated at a doctor’s office.

Public health officials have been pushing for childhood vaccinations ahead of the new school year as they hope shots for the age group will help prevent hospitalizations and deaths if COVID-19 cases rise again.

COVID-19 is generally milder in children.

Still since the start of the pandemic some 480 children under age five are counted among the nation’s more than 1 million COVID-19 deaths according to federal data.

So-called long COVID is also a concern as is multisystem inflammatory syndrome a rare but serious post-viral condition.

“It is worth vaccinating even though the number of deaths is relatively rare because these deaths are preventable through vaccination” said Dr Matthew Daley a Kaiser Permanente Colorado researcher who sits on the CDC’s advisory committee.

The CDC advisers will meet again next week to consider whether to back the use of the Moderna vaccine for children and adolescents aged 6-17.

There has been some concern about the rate of rare cases of heart inflammation in teenage boys and young men from the Moderna vaccine and the advisers are expected to consider that data."

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: Four-star transfer PG Miro Little has committed to Utah,"On Tuesday Craig Smith and the Runnin' Utes picked up a very valuable transfer portal addition after former Baylor guard and four-star transfer Miro Little announced his commitment to the program. This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

It’s all over for the Prince George Cougars.

Josh Davies ended the Cats’ terrific season 5:40 into double overtime with a gut-wrenching shot from 30 feet out sending the Portland Winterhawks to the WHL championship series with a 2-1 victory in Game 6 of the Western Conference championship Monday at CN Centre.

The longest game in Prince George’s 30-year WHL history ended in sudden death and it came seconds after Borya Valis’s close-range shot at immortality at the other end of the rink was blocked by Portland defenceman Tyson Jugnauth. The puck skipped to Josh Mori who fed it up to Davies and he wired a low wrist shot into the far corner behind Joshua Ravensbergen.

“They got a couple good chances in our end and we got a good block Josh Mori made a nice play and I joined the rush and after that I kind of blacked out” said Davies. “I saw the puck go in the net and the rest is history.

“Our team was ready for big moments like this this is what we grinded out all year for. Now that the moment has come we couldn’t be happier. We’re in the dance now and we’re ready to go.”

The Winterhawks will now await the winner of the Saskatoon Blades-Moose Jaw Warriors series to determine who they will be playing in the next round.

Davies a Florida Panthers draft pick in 2022 missed four games of the series with an injury and his return to the lineup after being sidelined in Game 1 came just in time for the ‘Hawks.

Both teams had glorious chances to end it in the first overtime period.

Portland failed to convert a 3-on-1 chance just before the three-minute mark when Ravensbergen stuffed the shot from Diego Buttazzoni. Thirteen minutes into overtime ‘Hawks captain Gabe Klassen got the puck in deep and tried to tuck it between the goalie’s legs but Ravensbergen somehow came up with the stop.

The Winterhawks took a penalty 8:20 into overtime and came out of it unscathed holding the P.G. power play without a shot. The Cougars buzzed the net numerous times with great looks but came up empty trying to put one past Spunar.

The opening goal of the game came with a minute left in the second period but nobody knew that for certain until after the clock had run out. The goal from Winterhawks exquisite playmaker Nate Danielson came as a result of a close-in shot that crossed the line and was instantly cleared by Cougars defenceman Hudson Thornton as the Portland players briefly celebrated. The play continued and the period ended with Thornton bouncing a high shot that nearly found the back of the Portland net behind Jan Spunar.

The Cougar coaching staff was already heading into the locker room when video goal judge Lance Van Helvoirt confirmed Danielson’s shot had indeed crossed the goal line. He got on the phone with referee Bobby Jo Love to tell him it was a good goal giving the Hawks a 1-0 lead to take into the second intermission.

It didn’t take long for the Cougars to tie it up.

Zac Funk gained the puck behind the goal line and pushed it over to Riley Heidt who wasted no time dumping it out into the slot for Valis who blasted it in for his ninth of the playoffs much to the delight of Cougar fans in a sellout crowd of 6016 who leapt to their feet with an ear-splitting roar.

Both teams had their chances gunning for the go-ahead goal. Mori joined the rush and Ravensbergen kicked out a dangerous-looking shot just before the Cougars went on the power play midway through the third period. The puck was in the Portland zone for most of that two-minute session but they couldn’t beat Spunar.

With less than two minutes left in regulation time Chase Pauls made a nice play with his glove at the blueline to knock down a Portland clearing attempt and his shot deflected off Ondrej Becher in the slot and just missed the net high.

Winterhawks head coach and general manager Mike Johnston noted that while the series produced a few lopsided scores he thought all six games reflected how close the two teams were. The Cougars finished just one point ahead of Portland atop the Western Conference standings and both teams raised their game in the series to an amazing level that produced highly-entertaining hockey that impressed everyone in the building.

“I know there was some games where there was a spread on the score and it looked like one team was maybe winning it easier but I don’t think through the whole series there was more than a one-goal difference between the teams” said Johnston. “Both teams played outstanding in the series. Both teams have a core of really good players and both play a style that up-tempo and fast as you saw tonight.

“I’ve been on the other side with a good team like P.G. had and you’re home trying to squeeze it out and you miss it. We were fortunate You got to get a bounce and we got a bounce. It was a big character win for us because we were down a few players. Playing a series without (Luca) Cagnoni our top-minute defenceman was a big loss for us but they lost (Terik) Parascak a really key player for them.”

The Winterhawks were eliminated in the second round in the previous two playoff years and Johnston said the core of his team learned from that and used it to overcome their adversity this season.

“Now we pushed through the third round it’s hard in playoffs” he said. “Getting that experience with P.G. having a lot of returning players they’ve got to be one of the favourites heading into next year.”

If that is the case Cougar overagers Funk Thornton and Pauls won’t be there to see it having now played their last junior hockey game.

“I’m almost speechless it’s such a tough feeling honestly” said Thornton the Cougar captain after spending about half an hour after the game in the room with his teammates. We’ve been through so much this year as a group and we’ve come so far and this city deserves so much.

“We try to give our best every single night and at the end of this you wanted to give them a championship and obviously we didn’t do that so it’s pretty disappointing. Overall we had a tremendous season and the group that we have is so special we’re brothers for life.”

The Cougars established franchise records for wins and points and finished the season as the No. 1 ranked team in Canada. They truly believed they had what it took to go all the way.

“That’s what’s so disappointing and the guys really feel it we didn’t think we were going to lose” said Cougars head coach and general manager Mark Lamb. “It was a really good year when you get by the disappointment which I can’t get by right now yet. When I look back in a couple days and reflect on it it will be a lot better but it really hurts right now.

“Winning is so so hard and the guys really got a feeling of it tonight. They played so well bit they will learn. Portland is a winning organization and they have been for a few years now and we look at that and that’s where we’re at now. We’re turning into one of those organizations .”

Spunar picked up his 12th win in 14 playoff starts and looked unbeatable at times as did Cougar goalie Josh Ravensbergen and they put on a classic goaltending clinic with both teams testing them relentlessly. The Cougars outshot Portland 49-38.

Just as they did in their two wins in the series in Portland the Winterhawks got off to a great start and the 17-year-old rookie Ravensbergen was the reason they were not be down by a goal or two after the opening period.

Led by Danielson the WHL’s player of the week who came into Monday’s game with a goal and nine assists in the series the ‘Hawks forced the Cougar goalie to make three saves in the opening minute.

The Cougars finally got their offence untracked on a four-minute power play that came 4:17 in when Davies took exception to Nick McLennan’s crushing hit that knocked Ryan Miller off his feet and into the boards and was served a double roughing penalty.

The penalty came seconds after Davies was denied by spectacular glove stop from Ravensbergen off the rush on a feed into the slot from Miller. With Davies in the box came close a couple times but the 19-year-old Czechian goalie was locked in on the task at hand.

Portland came out guns-a-blazing in the second period and severely tested Ravensbergen at least three times in the first five minutes including a glove stop to deny Kyle Chyzowski on a 2-on-1 setup and keep the game scoreless.

Inspired by their goalie’s heroic efforts the Cougars were finally able to deliver sustained pressure for the first time since their extended power play in the first period. The Funk-Heidt-Valis line delivered a dominant shift and threw everything but the kitchen sink at Spunar and he had to come up with three huge saves.

The Eastern Conference final resumes with Game 7 Tuesday night in Saskatoon. Four of the six games in the series have required overtime.

LOOSE PUCKS: The Cougars’ previous longest game happened April 10 1997 in Game 1 of the Western final in Seattle. Peter Roed ended it for the Cougars 1:59 into the second overtime. The Thunderbirds went on to win that third-round series in six games … The Winterhawks will board an Air Canada charter for the flight back to Portland Tuesday morning … Cats forward Hunter Laing was named the WHL’s rookie of the week. The 17-year-old Kelowna native scored his first career WHL playoff goal in Game 5 in Portland. He is ranked 86th on NHL Central Scouting’s final draft list …. The WHL U.S. Priority Draft will go ahead on Wednesday and on Thursday the league will have its Prospects Draft. The Regina Pats have the first pick in the U.S. draft while the Everett Silvertips will get to pick first in the Prospects Draft a result of the Joel Hofer trade the Silvertips made with Kamloops at the deadline last year …. The Cougars pick 21st out of 22 in the Prospects Draft and hold the 21st and 43rd choices when the league selects draft-eligible Americans ... Former Cougar captain Brett Connolly is back visiting his former hometown and brought his young son to the game from their home in Toronto. The 32-year-old longtime NHL’er who won the Stanley Cup with the Washington Capitals in 2018 just finished his second season playing in Switzerland.

These 5 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks Can Help,"You could be earning money while you sleep. Need I say more?

Retirement doesn't necessarily have to wait until you are in your 60s; working becomes optional as soon as your passive income covers your living expenses.

Buying dividend stocks which make so much money that they give a chunk of their profits on a regular basis to shareholders can eventually build a waterfall of cash that can set you financially free.

So if you're looking to retire as soon as possible consider these ultra-high-yield dividend stocks with solid financials to support their hefty payouts.

1. AT&T: The telecom giant

Dividend yield: 5.7%

AT&T (T 0.53%) is one of only a few wireless carriers in the United States. Its network supports roughly 67.5 million customers who pay their monthly bills like clockwork because smartphones have become a vital part of everyday life for most of them. The company generates more than $160 billion in annual revenue and uses some of that to pay out a quarterly dividend of $0.278 per share that currently yields a whopping 5.7%.

You'll see in the above chart how AT&T recently reduced the dividend a result of AT&T's fresh spinoff of its entertainment assets to form Warner Bros. Discovery. The lower payout also lowers the dividend payout ratio to roughly 40% of free cash flow per management's estimates. That frees up some cash for AT&T to get its debt levels under control as well as giving it the wherewithal to continue raising the dividend going forward. This gives investors plenty of reason to expect those dividend checks to keep coming.

2. Altria: The tobacco king

Dividend yield: 7.9%

Altria Group (MO 0.83%) is the largest tobacco company in the United States. Its history goes back more than 100 years as owner of the best-selling Marlboro brand of cigarettes (at least in the U.S.). It's well known that fewer people are smoking than in previous generations. Still Altria has used its robust pricing power for decades to offset declining cigarette volumes with price increases. That continued profit allows it to consistently grow its dividend to the point where it qualifies as a Dividend King with 52 consecutive annual dividend increases.

Altria spun off its international business as Philip Morris International (the owner of the Marlboro brand outside the U.S.) in 2008 which you can see in the above chart. Still the company has done fine since then steadily growing its operating profits at a mid-single-digit pace over the past 10 years. Investors can enjoy a whopping 7.9% dividend yield covered by Altria's 78% dividend payout ratio.

3. Enbridge: An oil and gas pipeline stalwart

Dividend yield: 6.2%

Enbridge (ENB 0.44%) is one of the largest energy companies in North America. Its primary business is pipelines which carry oil and natural gas from Canada to the Gulf Coast. Pipelines are like toll operators on a highway; they get paid for the traffic or materials that pass through their pipes in Enbridge's case. This has made Enbridge more stable than most oil companies because it's not as dependent on oil and gas prices to profit.

Enbridge's business does nearly $40 billion in annual revenue and the company has paid and raised its dividend in each of the past 26 years. Investors can enjoy a 6.2% yield at the current share price; the payout consumes under 60% of Enbridge's distributable cash flow making the dividend (and its continued growth) sustainable.

4. AbbVie: Pharmaceutical leader

Dividend yield: 4%

AbbVie (ABBV -0.11%) is a pharmaceutical company that was born when it split from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. However you can see how quickly the business has grown in nearly a decade thanks to massive sales from its blockbuster drug Humira which generated more than $20 billion in 2021. Shareholders have enjoyed a 4% dividend yield while management has raised the payout by an average of 17% annually over the past five years.

AbbVie's exclusive rights to Humira in the U.S. expire next year which will likely cause revenue growth to slow as competitors flood the market. AbbVie has moved to develop and acquire assets that could help replace lost business. The dividend payout ratio is just 43% of cash flow so the dividend should be able to endure some short-term turbulence if there is any.

5. Realty Income: The monthly dividend company

Dividend yield: 4.5%

Realty Income (O -0.78%) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) a specific business structure that invests in real estate and shares its cash profits with shareholders as dividends. Realty Income specializes in retail properties; it's a net-lease REIT owning the building and charging its tenants for rent and letting the tenants handle the taxes insurance and maintenance.

Realty Income's tenants are businesses that tend to operate discount services making them recession-proof and reliable tenants. Realty Income's properties generate steady cash flow so much so that it pays shareholders a monthly dividend instead of the quarterly payout that's more common among U.S. companies. It even refers to itself as The Monthly Dividend Company. A Dividend Aristocrat with 28 years of consecutive annual dividend raises investors can take Realty Income's 4.5% yield to the bank.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Love hasn’t been with the team since the program announced on Feb. 19 that Love had been suspended with pay due to an undisclosed “personnel matter.”

At about the same time starting guard Ashley Scoggin was permanently removed from the team with both moves occurring after a road trip to Penn State on Feb. 17.

Nebraska coach Amy Williams wouldn’t say why either had been removed from the team or who had made the decision.

Love wasn’t on the bench for Nebraska’s final eight games of the season. While Love wasn’t expected to return he remained listed on the team’s online roster until recently while his suspension was reviewed through the human resources process.

Love came to Nebraska when Williams became coach in 2016. Last summer Love was promoted to associate head coach and had his salary increase to $175270.

On Friday morning Love posted a statement on social media: “I have come to the decision to move on and be with family and explore other opportunities. I will never forget how amazing this fan base has been.”

A Nebraska spokesperson confirmed that Love had resigned but said the Athletic Department has no further comment about the situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

LIVE! at PNC Bank Arts Center

He concludes his performance with a bouncy rendition of Sam Cooke’s “Twisting the Night Away” which has audience members twisting along at their seats.

Medugno provides a tribute to Jay and the Americans’ lead singer Jay Black with a powerful interpretation of “Cara Mia” that has the crowd reacting with avid hoots and hollers.

“Are you ready to go back in time tonight?” inquires Medugno. He opens tonight’s show singing Freddy Cannon’s “Palisades Park” the sound of his rich tenor filling the amphitheater as he dances his way across the stage. Segueing into Dion’s “Runaround Sue” Medugno changes the song’s “She took my love then ran around/With every single guy in town” lyric for the NJ crowd to “With every guy from Middletown.” The audience chuckles while singing and clapping along to the music.

“Hello my friends!” exclaims Morrow. After informing the crowd “I am trying to bring everyone together during this difficult time. My radio show is four hours where people can get away from what’s going on in the world” Morrow introduces the audience to a surprise performer — fellow 77-WABC DJ and entertainer Vinnie Medugno.

Gravino welcomes tonight’s emcee Cousin Brucie who takes the stage as audience members stand cheer and dance to his radio show theme song.

Following the interview we make our way out to the open-air PNC Bank Arts amphitheater where Garden State Arts Center Foundation VP Ron Gravino takes to the podium to thank the sponsors of tonight’s program — PNC Bank Live Nation Entertainment and 77-WABC Music Radio. He also thanks the production staff at the PNC Bank Arts Center the volunteers of the Garden State Arts Foundation and GSAF executive director Cookie Santiago.

Lastly James tells us he has a message he’d like us to share with his many fans saying “I am very flattered and honored and so blessed to have such wonderful fans. They’ve let me go in so many directions over the years and they’ve stuck with me coming to my shows time after time” before concluding “I thank the Lord for them and I cherish them; they are so loyal and good!”

We also learn that James recently video-recorded an acoustic version of his song “Crystal Blue Persuasion” which has been sent to the Ukrainian Ambassador to share with the people of Ukraine. Because “music is the best communication” James believes the song will “give people hope” with lyrics like “So don’t you give up now/So easy to find/Just look to your soul/And open your mind/Crystal blue persuasion.”

James also talks about the progress on the movie version of his memoir Me the Mob and the Music — a book which explains his precarious association with Morris Levy the president of Roulette Records and a known mobster — acknowledging “Hollywood shut down during the pandemic for two years but casting for the film will be the next step. First we’ll be focusing on the Morris Levy character and then we’ll be casting the Tommy James character followed by other roles” before confessing “I have various ideas who should play these characters but I’m going to keep them to myself for now.”

James tells us about his Sirius XM radio program declaring “The radio show has been so great! It’s broadcast over all of North America and it’s been a great way to stay in touch with the fans.” He’s also excited to reveal that several of his songs are being considered for use in upcoming television and film projects disclosing “There’s a new NBC-TV series Candy that plans to use ‘Sweet Cherry Wine’ and there’s a new movie National Anthem that wants to use ‘Nothin' to Hide” prior to adding “This would be the first time that particular song has ever been licensed and it’s for a movie which is a Western.”

Before the event begins we slip backstage for a pre-show interview with Tommy James. When asked what it’s like to be doing performances again following the pandemic James replies “For a year and a half or more there were no concerts but now we’re back to a full schedule. It’s a lot like being an athlete who’s out of shape. At first I actually got very winded and my heart was pumping hard. It took a few gigs to get back into it but I’m feeling fine now” before exclaiming “It feels so good to get to mix it up with the fans again!”

Music lovers by the thousands are currently streaming into the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel NJ this June 9 2022 evening for a highly-anticipated free concert presented by the Garden State Arts Foundation. Featuring classic hits from Tommy James and the Shondells Little Anthony and The 1910 Fruitgum Company tonight’s show is hosted by 77-WABC radio DJ Bruce ‘Cousin Brucie’ Morrow.

Cousin Brucie retakes the stage to show the crowd his “happy socks” which are decorated with yellow guitars before introducing tonight’s next act The 1910 Fruitgum Co.

The members of the group — John Roginsky on guitar/keyboards Glen Lewis on bass Keith Crane on drums Mick Mansueto on vocals Frank Jeckell on guitar and Eric Lipper on keyboards — take the stage to open their set with a lively version of the 1968 bubblegum hit “Yummy Yummy Yummy” which has the audience snapping along to the happy beat.

Moving on to the group’s 1969 single “Indian Giver” Keith Crane’s driving drumbeat compels the audience to tap their toes as they sing along with the band.

Following cover versions of The Vogues’ “You’re the One” and Manfred Mann’s “Do Wah Diddy Diddy” the group moves on to another one of their hits 1968’s “1 2 3 Red Light.”

To conclude their set The 1910 Fruitgum Co. perform the 1967 smash which made them a household name — “Simon Says.” On this number Cousin Brucie joins the band on stage and has his hands in the air playing the game along with members of the crowd before they respond with animated cheers and applause.

Cousin Brucie introduces tonight’s next artist Little Anthony calling him “a great dramatist and great star” who “has the lock and key to our hearts and our souls.”

Following an overture of hits played by his talented backing orchestra Little Anthony opens his set with a poignant and soulful version of Eric Carmen’s “All By Myself.”

After he sings “All by myself/Don’t wanna be/All by myself/Anymore” four backup singers — Deanna Caroll Susan Marten Sarah Tracey and Johnny Britt — join Anthony onstage for the song’s dramatic conclusion.

The crowd cheers and Anthony and the singers give a potent performance of Marvin Gaye’s Motown classic “I Heard it Through the Grapevine” where they soulfully rock the estimated crowd of over 7000 music lovers.

Anthony greets the audience before taking them back in time with his 1959 hit“Tears on My Pillow.” He follows up with a performance of his dramatic 1964 ballad “I’m on the Outside (Looking In).” The arrangement — which features smooth backup vocals a dramatic orchestration and Anthony singing with style and flair — ends with great audience applause.

After talking about how he’s getting on in years — joking “My hair is white but I don’t sing with my hair!” — Anthony and company perform a spirited version of Little Richard’s “Lucille.”

Upbeat rocking and rollicking the number features several instrumental solos before the audience echo-sings along with the singers having fun on this classic ‘50s tune.

Anthony and the orchestra follow up with a song which he says “was our ticket into the 2009 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.” On his 1964 smash “Goin’ Out of My Head” Anthony sings with ease as the orchestra swells bringing enthusiastic cheers and a standing ovation from the crowd.

After the audience settles down Cousin Brucie asks Anthony to talk about his latest album Anthology telling him “We adore you we love you and we thank you for the decades of music.”

Following a short intermission Cousin Brucie invites his colleague fellow 77-WABC talk show host and Guardian Angels’ founder Curtis Sliwa on stage to chat. The men talk about their admiration and respect for one another with Brucie acknowledging “We both want the same things — peace harmony safety and goodness.”

Brucie introduces tonight’s headliner Tommy James who takes the stage along with his band The Shondells featuring Jonathn Ashe on bass John Golden on guitar Glenn Wyka on drums Mike DiMeo on synthesizer and John Korba on organ.

The crowd claps to the driving beat as James counts off the rockin’ intro to his 1971 solo hit “Draggin’ the Line.”

His voice sounding as fresh and clear as ever James sings “Makin’ a livin’ the old hard way/Takin’ and givin’ by day by day/I dig snow and rain and the bright sunshine/Draggin’ the line” as lights flash vocal harmonies ring out and the band’s wall of sound resonates throughout the amphitheater.

“Jersey! Everybody alright?” inquires James before exclaiming “Thanks for coming out! This is a great place to see a concert. Let’s put your energy together with ours and let’s make this happen!”

Blue lights flash to the beat as a tremelo electric guitar plays and James croons the lyrics to his 1968 hit “Crystal Blue Persuasion.”

Audience members happily sing along before clapping and cheering for this fan favorite.

Toes tap to the rhythm of the group’s next number “Say I Am” before James picks up an acoustic guitar and tells the audience that his memoir Me the Mob and the Music is slated to become a motion picture. He describes the final musical number in the film as a slowed-down version of his classic tune “I Think We’re Alone” which he and the band play in a mainly “unplugged” arrangement.

Following cheers Tommy and the band move on to a powerful and driving rendition of “Ball of Fire” — a song which features stunning live vocal harmonies — before continuing with the 1970 hit James co-wrote and produced for the group Alive N Kickin’. Filled with mighty harmonies and power chords lights flash as he and the band put a fresh spin on the million-seller “Tighter Tighter.”

The crowd roars as Tommy and the band ramp things up even further with a performance of James’ 1968 #1 smash the psychedelic “Crimson and Clover.” Tommy sings with feeling “Ah now I don’t hardly know her/But I think I could love her/Crimson and clover” on this classic rock ballad.

The crowd whistles and cheers and James and the Shondells respond with a song that really gets the audience moving — 1966’s “Hanky Panky” — the crowd clapping and cheering heartily at the end.

Tommy and the boys follow up with a second version of “I Think We’re Alone Now” — this time an up-tempo rendition à la the one heard on the original 1967 recording. The musicians rock the amphitheater as lights flash and audience members dance and cheer to the music.

Following 1968’s catchy “Do Something To Me” the James’ gang launches into an electric version of one of the greatest party songs in the history of pop music Tommy’s 1968 smash “Mony Mony.”

Music lovers dance on the sidelines while the band vamps and Tommy ventures offstage and out into the audience. After shaking hands with fans in the crowd he makes his way back onto the stage his talented musicians finishing the song with flair as the audience stands and cheers.

The company will sell new shares worth ₹300 crore while parent Delta Corp. Ltd will sell existing shares worth ₹250 crore.

The proceeds from its new issuance worth ₹150 crore will be used for marketing and business promotion to achieve organic growth and ₹50 crore will be deployed to strengthen technology infrastructure.

The company said it is in consultation with the bankers on the issue and may consider a preferential issue of shares or any other method aggregating up to ₹50 crore. If the placement is completed the company will reduce the sale of new shares.

The offer is being made through the book-building process with not less than 75% of the shares on sale to be allocated to qualified institutional buyers 15% of the shares will be offered to non-institutional bidders and 10% to individual retail bidders.

Lee followed the State Council’s announcement by presenting to the public his 26-member team including seven incumbent political appointees two undersecretaries six serving or retired civil servants and four lawmakers. Chief Executive’s Office director Eric Chan Kwok-ki will take up the role of No 2 official as the chief secretary.

Beijing on Sunday announced the appointment of Hong Kong’s principal officials to incoming leader John Lee Ka-chiu ’s cabinet hailing it as a “diversified team” while also laying down its expectations for the new administration to unite society and make “greater achievements”.

The State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) issued a statement hailing the team as demonstrating professionalism commitment and international vision.

But it also laid out five expectations for the incoming administration asking it to tackle the city’s social issues such as housing address the wealth gap and youth development implement the “one country two systems” governing policy in an accurate manner facilitate integration with the nation’s development and do more for education technology culture and health.

Beijing’s liaison office also spelled out expectations in what it described as a critical phase of the city’s transition “from stability to prosperity”.

“The new government is expected to … broadly unite people from all walks of life uphold the principle of ‘patriots ruling Hong Kong’ to improve governance and tackle deep-seated issues” the office said.

Facilitating the city’s integration with national development and enhancing its international competitiveness were also the stated goals.

“Respond to expectations with practical actions and make greater achievements at the new starting point” the office said.

Twelve days ahead of Lee’s swearing-in on July 1 to take over from Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor as the city’s next chief executive the team he unveiled reflected some continuity as well as a considerable shakeup under the self-described “conductor” of Hong Kong’s “new symphony”.

Paul Chan Mo-po will stay on as financial secretary while former Bar Association chairman Paul Lam Ting-kwok replaces Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah as justice secretary confirming earlier reports by the Post.

“My team and I will reach out listen to and communicate with the public with sincerity. We will be proactive in winning the trust of the people and make policies that meet with demands” Lee said.

The chief executive-designate’s governing plan entails a massive restructuring which could cost taxpayers an extra HK$120 million (US$15.3 million) a year with 15 policy bureaus – increased from 13 – reporting to three secretaries of bureaus and their deputies.

Lee 64 a former career policeman-turned-top bureaucrat was the security chief when Hong Kong was rocked by anti-government protest chaos in 2019 but he now takes over a city where such turmoil has been wiped out under the national security law imposed by Beijing.

Speeches on Sunday by Lee and most of the attending principal officials including three who headed disciplinary forces highlighted their priorities in safeguarding national security on all fronts ranging from financial to educational.

“Some bullying countries have hoped to scare our officials by using sanctions … This will only make us more persistent to carry on maintaining national security” Lee said.

“I only have one goal: to fulfil my responsibility to the country through safeguarding its sovereignty safety and development interest. That is the responsibility of being a Chinese citizen.”

Financial Secretary Paul Chan said various measures had been prepared to respond to the possibility of more American sanctions adding that officials would also actively spread the message to the international community that Hong Kong remained competitive and would continue to prosper with the nation’s backing.

Lee and his aide Eric Chan were among officials targeted by the sanctions over the national security law which Washington said had “undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy and restricted the freedom of expression”.

Lee expressed confidence in former immigration official Chan’s ability to oversee nine policy bureaus citing his experience in a wide range of policy areas while serving in the Chief Executive’s Office.

Chan 63 thanked the incoming leader for his “full trust” in him and pledged to enhance communication with policy bureaus as well as mainland officials.

Beijing greenlit Lee’s proposed team line-up more than a month after he was chosen by the city’s powerful Election Committee.

When asked if his list of candidates was passed to national security police before it was submitted to the central government he replied: “My selection of officials are my own ideas and of course there will be necessary procedures to go through in accordance with the law and normal procedures.”

Lee’s incoming administration marks the first start of a new government term under the national security law while a powerful vetting committee has been established to conduct political screening of election candidates but not officials.

Sunday’s announcement will later trigger a by-election in the legislature for the seats vacated by four incumbent lawmakers from the Election Committee constituency who are now in the new cabinet.

Lee said the lawmakers and two other professionals he had picked from outside the government had their “own strengths experiences and a strong will to serve Hong Kong”.

The two lawmakers from the city’s major pro-Beijing parties are Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan vice-chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong who will take up the role of deputy secretary for justice and Alice Mak k Mei-kuen from the Federation of Trade Unions who becomes secretary for home and youth affairs.

The two professionals are mainland China-born scientist Sun Dong who will take over as secretary for innovation technology and industry and accountant Nelson Lam Chi-yuen who will become the new director of the Audit Commission.

Sun the only one who spoke in Mandarin at the press conference stressed that he had established extensive connections with different sectors in Hong Kong over the past two decades.

Elaborating on his “result-oriented” governance style leader-in-waiting Lee said it did not mean a disregard for following established procedures.

“[Procedures] are created by policies and laws. If they are outdated or if they are repetitive we should improve them so as to make it easier to get results. I also believe people would like to see this happen” he said.

Lee also thanked departing leader Carrie Lam who congratulated the new government expressing her wish for it to focus on development in accordance with “the spirit of not avoiding any difficulties” in solving economic and livelihood issues.

In another sign of Lee going for continuity Chris Tang Ping-keung and Erick Tsang Kwok-wai will remain as secretary for security and constitutional and mainland affairs minister respectively.

The three new deputy secretary posts have been created in recognition of the growing work of the bureaus.

Among those taking them up are two seasoned civil servants: former permanent secretary for innovation and technology Cheuk Wing-hing who will serve as deputy chief secretary after his 38 years in government; and development minister Michael Wong Wai-lun who will become deputy financial secretary.

Professor Anthony Cheung Bing-leung a former transport and housing minister said it had proven that administrative officers were still the backbone of the government.

“The central government might have questions over the loyalty of these administrative officers due to what had happened in the last few years in the city with some negative comments targeting them as colonial remnants but things have settled after the compulsory oath-taking for all civil servants” said Cheung who specialises in public administration at the Education University of Hong Kong.

“Who are the ones who are most familiar with policies and what changes are necessary? That must be our civil servants.”

University of Hong Kong emeritus professor John Burns raised concerns about the key performance indicator (KPIs) approach Lee had pledged to introduce with his team.

“Remember that the people already have their own KPIs for the government such as public housing waiting times number of families living in subdivided flats” he said. “Lee’s KPIs are worthless if he and his team fail to address the people’s KPIs the real measures of performance.”

When meeting the press Winnie Ho Wing-yin who will serve as housing minister stopped short of giving concrete targets of shortening the queue for public housing or the number of new flats to be built in the next term. She said they would “resort to all means” to speed up the process.

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

At Mike's request there will be no service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvcHJvY3Rlci1nYW1ibGUtcGctcTMtMjAyNC1lYXJuaW5ncy5odG1s0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvcHJvY3Rlci1nYW1ibGUtcGctcTMtMjAyNC1lYXJuaW5ncy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter & Gamble sales disappoint as price hikes slow down,"In this photo illustration Pantene and Head & Shoulders hair products are displayed on July 28 2023 in San Anselmo California.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Key Metric: Prices

Procter & Gamble rode higher prices to increased revenue in its December quarter. But the upcoming earnings report could show the lowest price increases by the consumer goods seller since the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with analysts forecasting that P&G will hike prices by 2.75% in the quarter.

It could also be the first quarter in two years where the consumer giant reports positive annual growth in sales volumes with expectations for a 0.35% increase.

Business Spotlight

Procter & Gamble’s report comes after it detailed a $1.3 billion impairment charge for its subsidiary razor business Gillette forcing the company to reduce its 2024 full-year guidance for earnings per share (EPS). However the company said it was able to maintain its forecasts for 2024 revenue and it announced earlier this month that it would boost its quarterly dividend by 7%.

“We delivered strong results in the second quarter enabling us to raise our core EPS growth guidance and maintain our top-line outlook for the fiscal year” Procter & Gamble CEO Jon Moeller said after last quarter's results.

Analysts expect P&G to report its largest gains from its biggest segment with revenue from fabric and home care expected to jump about 3.6% year-over-year while its healthcare sales are also expected to increase across the same period. After beauty and personal care products helped pace P&G’s sales in fiscal 2023 revenue from that segment is expected to ease about 1%.

A component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) P&G has had a good start to the year with its shares up about 6.8% so far in 2024 as of Tuesday compared with a DJIA that has started the year flat. It’s also outperforming the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector (XLP) exchange traded fund (ETF) which also is flat so far this year."

While memorializing Juneteenth as a national holiday was long overdue we shouldn’t forget that the celebration’s roots are in Texas where the largest population of Black people in the United States currently live. For Black Texans Juneteenth holds a special significance that’s worth learning and if you’re educator like myself teaching.

While memorializing Juneteenth as a national holiday was long overdue we shouldn’t forget that the celebration’s roots are in Texas.

Although the Emancipation Proclamation freed all enslaved Black people in Confederate states in 1863 the Union had not yet swept far enough into the Deep South to fully enforce it. It wasn’t until two years later on June 18 that Union Army General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston to occupy Texas and announced the following day that all enslaved people were free.

This history explains part of the reason why Galveston became the center of Juneteenth commemorations but it’s also because the city was a major slave port. By 1860 Galveston was the most populated city in Texas serving as a commercial hub within the Confederacy. Prior to the Union’s advance almost every Black person in Galveston was enslaved due to a de-facto law from 1836 that banned free Black people from residing in Texas. It was no accident that Granger chose the city of Galveston to make his decree.

Granger according to historian Gerald Horne approached the city with an army that was close to 75 percent Black. With free Blacks banned and white settlers now threatened by Union occupation Black Galvestonians could trust what Granger said as Black soldiers stood with him.

Before Juneteenth became Juneteenth it was first celebrated in 1866 in Texas as Emancipation Day. Other places had their own Emancipation Days including the states of the states of Florida and Mississippi and the District of Columbia. But importantly outside of Texas Emancipation Day took place on January 1 rather than in June to match with the anniversary of the 1863 signing of the Emancipation Proclamation.

And while Galveston was the last Confederate territory where enslavement was declared dead it was still allowed in a handful of states—Delaware and Kentucky for example—until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865.

Early Juneteenth celebrations looked like community gatherings: sports were played cookouts were held and Black folks prayed danced and lit fireworks. But at their core these events were an opportunity for both community empowerment and for families broken up by enslavement to reconnect.

The legacy of Juneteenth the truest Independence Day we have deserves to be taught in schools and commemorated by everyone.

Juneteenth gatherings customarily feature red foods—such as strawberry pie barbecue watermelon hot sauce red rice red velvet cake and red sausages—to symbolize resilience and joy. But no celebration would ever be complete without Red Drink as Sunyatta Amen explained in The Washington Post:

“Throughout enslavement in the Americas Red Drink was seen as a healing beverage used to cool overheated bodies working on plantations. . . . Combined with the warmth of ginger and the pluckiness of traditional African spices the bitter and sweet flavors of Red Drink were a liquid love letter in remembrance of a distant homeland.”

Juneteenth’s popularity among Black people outside of the South can be traced back to the Great Migration. From 1910 to about 1970 Isabel Wilkerson writes in The Warmth of Other Suns “The people from Texas took Juneteenth Day to Los Angeles Oakland Seattle and other places they went.”

Although Juneteenth celebrations declined somewhat during this same period in Texas (which was also the first state to establish Juneteenth as a government-approved holiday in 1979) it’s unlikely that the holiday would have become a federal holiday today without Black people spreading it.

The legacy of Juneteenth the truest Independence Day we have deserves to be taught in schools and commemorated by everyone. That said we’ve got to be specific about its origins lest we unintentionally erase the holiday’s meaning for Black Texans. And then like many other holidays Juneteenth is also in danger of becoming commodified by corporations looking to capitalize on racist tropes.

But keeping in mind how Juneteenth has been celebrated across generations we can avoid both of these issues and honor the day with respect for the history and humanity of Black people—especially Black Texans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2U0ZTg0ZWFjLTg1MDItNGE3Zi1iNTFiLWMzNzI3NTJiNGIzONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Disney lost Florida,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Cross Bay Ferry to run with discounted Pinellas subsidy | June 14

While the Tampa Bay Ferry is a pleasant ride for tourists or Tampa Bay Area residents it does absolutely nothing to move us closer to a viable mass transit system in the region. Virtually nobody can rely on the ferry for transportation to work or to the airport. For an infrequent user the ferry is a pleasant alternative to Interstate 275 just as the “Beach to ‘Burg” SunRunner bus will be merely a fancier version of the Central Avenue Trolley. When if ever will we develop a unified practical mass transit system? The ferry is merely a diversion one requiring endless public subsidies.

Recall not end of story

The boiling over of America | Column June 13

Columnist Peggy Noonan sees the recall of San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin as proof of a nationwide rebellion against progressive leadership in big cities due to rising crime and violence. With little evidence Noonan suggests minority neighborhoods are fed up with progressives’ soft-on-crime policies. Yet most experts say increasing crime is more an outgrowth of the pandemic than lenient sentencing policies. Before 2020 crime had been decreasing for decades in most cities including those under progressive leadership. While Boudin lost the recall by a 60-40 percent vote another progressive prosecutor Philadelphia’s Larry Krasner won re-election last year with 65 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary and over 70 percent in the general election. Krasner the subject of the Peabody Award-winning documentary “Philly D.A” is one of a number of progressive district attorneys elected in recent years including Hillsborough County’s Andrew Warren who won re-election in 2020. Krasner ended cash bond for misdemeanor offenses and non-violent felonies refused to pursue charges for marijuana possession and against sex workers. Those policies were not popular with police but they were welcomed by a minority community devastated by hyper-aggressive policing and over-incarceration. It remains to be seen whether Boudin’s recall or Krasner and Warren’s re-elections most accurately forecast the future of progressive leadership in U.S. cities.

Unerring Russian marketing

Russian McDonald’s open as Tasty-period | June 14

I love the new name for Russian McDonald’s stores Tasty-period. I also read it translated as “Tasty — That’s It!”

It really sings. It’s so so Russian too. Basically “Eat it and keep your trap shut!”

Other finalists for the name included “Food — Like it or lump it”; “Gruel — Eat it and be quiet!”; and “Vladdy’s — Clean your plate or else!” Near misses were “Cold Dumplings — What did you think they were smart aleck?” and “Gulag Food — It’s not just for breakfast anymore!”

It’s marketing genius is what it is.

Politicians inflate distort or intentionally misuse words to con their voters. In Uvalde Texas 19 young children and two teachers were butchered with an assault rifle. The only answer to the problem of mass shootings is to keep assault rifles from the hands of the general public. They are designed to kill in wartime — period.

John Mellencamp was correct when he said on a recent MSNBC interview that the media needs to show graphic photos of the horrific damage assault rifles do to our children. Seeing those mangled little bodies just might energize voters to get rid of our political garbage.

A veto adds pain to the abortion debate | June 12

As a registered Republican in Pinellas County I rarely agree with most of your editorial content. However your editorial on the governor’s vetoing of the $2 million allocation for reversible contraception was spot on. I believe that being proactive with potential pregnancy is by far the better choice. No matter which side of the abortion issue you stand on I think most would agree that abortion is not the answer if prevention is readily available. This especially applies to those who cannot readily access those services as easily as others. I’ve emailed our governor expressing my dismay over this veto. Thank you for bringing this issue to light.

Homeowners’ insurance fix

Florida lawmakers pass insurance bills with $10000 for home upgrades | May 25

In 1995 Florida created the Save Our Homes Assessment Cap for homesteaded properties. That amendment to the state constitution saved many Floridians from being taxed out of their homes. After receiving my new homeowners’ insurance policy with its 30% increase over last year I believe it is time for a insurance fix much like the Save Our Homes tax cap. Many older homeowners are being force to either sell their homes and drastically downsize which is a shame or go without insurance which is also bad. Our representatives in Tallahassee need to get their act together and fix this mess or reap the wrath of a lot of very upset homeowners this November.

Throughout June advertisements from brands featuring Pride imagery appear on televisions billboards and especially social media feeds. Companies ranging from local businesses to multinational corporations drop new Pride-themed products and add touches of rainbow decor to their logos all in the name of LGBTQ allyship.

But if the policies products and political activities of a company during the other 11 months of the year don’t line up with its colourful advertising during Pride month they are increasingly likely to be called out for “rainbow washing” — public displays of support for the LGBTQ community that are temporary and not backed up by action.

“When companies try to push their own agenda while including the community those are the (campaigns) that make me mad” says Horner who is gay.

But his feelings on the matter aren’t black and white. He believes there is value in marketing and advertising campaigns during Pride month especially if there is nuance noting that the visibility is particularly helpful for individuals who might live in rural areas feel alone or aren’t entirely comfortable with who they are yet.

Horner is not alone in finding the issue nuanced.

“I think that sponsorships from mega companies can often be beneficial to queer creators and financial backing in that regard can often propel us to the next level” drag performer Kendall Gender says. “I do however (have) an issue when (sponsorships are) inauthentic.”

Gender is working with Canadian cosmetics company Annabelle on a Pride collection and campaign this year. Annabelle says monetary donations will be made to Rainbow Railroad an organization that helps LGBTQ+ people escape violence and persecution in their home countries.

Marketing industry watchers agree authenticity matters and that Pride month campaigns can serve a positive purpose but there needs to be substance behind them.

The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world.

Scott Knox is the founding president of PrideAM an organization working to ensure LGBTQ people are more visible at marketing agencies and that portrayals of the community in advertising are not one-dimensional.

He finds that Canada’s advertising industry tends to do a better job compared to other markets he’s worked in when it comes to ensuring authentic LGBTQ representation and around Pride month specifically.

“In Canada we are part of the fabric of how brands talk to (consumers)and sell products” all year round he says.

At the same time he says big businesses need to reflect on whether they actually value the LGBTQ community or are just trying to cash in when Pride month rolls around illustrating his point with the example of a hypothetical business adding rainbows to a branch of its operations located in Toronto’s Gay Village during Pride month but not at any other location and at no other time.

“They are safely in the space of the community but will they do something in another country in another city at a different time of the year other than Pride month?” he says.

5:32 How the Pride flag came to be and how it continues to evolve

Craig Pike owner of Craig’s Cookies points to a level of shallowness and lack of understanding on the part of some bigger organizations that he’s come across. He says they have been coming to his small business which has a location in Toronto’s Gay Village for free cookies for their Pride campaigns rather than paying for them.

“We have been approached by banks hotels and other huge food brands asking us to donate cookies for their Pride events” he says. “In my opinion if you want to support small queer businesses during Pride put your money where your mouth is.”

The cookie business makes its own efforts all year round by hiring diverse groups of employees that best represent the people it bakes for ensuring it is always visibly queer and learning how it can do better for marginalized individuals within the broader LGBTQ community.

For bigger businesses there are some easy actions that can be implemented at the policy and system level long before Pride month that represent tangible support for the LGBTQ community says Feminuity co-founder and CEO Sarah Saska. Feminuity helps organizations improve their diversity and inclusion efforts.

She emphasizes the importance of setting up data collection tools for customers and employees that aren’t limited to gender and sexuality so there is a better understanding of who people are and what they need and to help the company determine whether its products are inclusive.

Another example is around benefits in particular working with health and benefit providers to expand insurance to cover gender-affirming medical care for transgender and non-binary people. Making sure dress codes are not gendered is another easy starting point she adds.

This is just a start of course. Saska says consulting with the LGBTQ+ community to see what other actions are beneficial and whether or not plans a business has are actually useful needed or helpful can go a long way.

At the end of the day Horner believes being a progressive company goes beyond a checklist to satisfy during Pride month.

“Being progressive is a way of being. If you really want to do something you’ll just do it” he says."

The trade union federation’s real estate arm Mercatus Co-operative has hired JP Morgan to market its 2.13 million square foot (197880 square metre) portfolio of four malls for an undisclosed sum including a half-stake in a shopping centre which it co-owns with PGIM Real Estate China’s CIC and a unit of Prudential according to sources familiar with the discussions which were first reported by Bloomberg.

In a separate transaction NTUC Income the insurance arm of the co-operative this month concluded a tender for its 37-storey Income at Raffles office tower. That process drew offers from 10 players with the top bid coming in at over S$950 million ($687 million) based on an account by the Business Times. Competitors in that contest included a joint venture between BlackRock and City Developments Ltd as well as local private equity firm TE Capital Mingtiandi has learned.

Should Mercatus succeed in selling its mall portfolio the disposal would rank at the largest property transaction in Singapore so far this year with the reported amount equivalent to nearly half of the S$9.9 billion in properties that have changed hands since January based on independent research.

Mall Heavyweight Wants Out

Deliberations on the potential sale of the mall portfolio are still ongoing but assets might fetch around S$4 billion Bloomberg reported late Thursday citing anonymous sources.The reported price tag on that deal roughly matches the S$4.15 billion valuation for the mall portfolio which Mercatus listed in its 2021 annual report.

All four malls are at least 99 percent occupied and yielded S$323.7 million in combined revenues last year which was down by 4.5 percent from the S$339 million that the portfolio generated prior to the pandemic in 2019.

Dubbed as one of the largest sets of suburban shopping centres in Singapore the biggest asset in Mercatus’ portfolio is Jurong Point a S$2 billion mall located in the western portion of the city-state which spans 720000 square feet of net lettable area.

Next largest on the list by valuation is the S$1.96-billion NEX mall in Serangoon district where it maintains a 50 percent stake alongside partners PGIM Real Estate Chinese sovereign wealth fund CIC and a subsidiary of US giant Prudential Financial.

Also in the portfolio is the 320000 square feet big AMK Hub that connects directly to Ang Mo Kio MRT station and was valued at S$846 million as of last year as well as the S$203 million Swing By @ Thomson Plaza shopping mall on Upper Thomson Road that spans 110000 square feet in NLA.

Mingtiandi reached out to representatives of JP Morgan and Mercatus for comment with neither party having responded by the time of publication.

Headquarters Set to Stay

While Mercatus is marketing its entire retail portfolio it is being more selective in disposing of its office assets as the Lion City experiences a boom in demand for desk space.

Market sources said Mercatus is planning to keep its One Marina Boulevard property in the downtown core a 31-storey building which serves as headquarters for the real estate manager as well as for its parent NTUC Enterprise.

Also called NTUC Centre One Marina Boulevard is located near the Raffles Place MRT station and houses corporate tenants including law firm Allen & Gledhill.

The fate of Mercatus sole Australian property 1 Bligh Street in Sydney appears more uncertain.

After teaming up with Australia’s Dexus to jointly purchase a 33.3 stake in the 29-storey downtown office tower for A$375 million (then $288.1 million) in March of last year market sources informed Mingtiandi that Mercatus intends to retain its sole asset Down Under. However a report from the Business Times stated that JP Morgan is also gauging interest on a potential sale of 1 Bligh Street.

While the co-op plots the sale of its en-bloc properties it has yet to make any public moves regarding its portfolio of strata-titled assets which measure 360000 square feet in net lettable area. Spread out across 33 locations those strata assets yielded S$30.8 million in total revenues last year and were valued at S$437 million as of end-2021.

Carrying over S$10 billion in assets under management the co-op saw its profit attributable to its members dip by 10 percent to S$53 million last year from S$58.6 million in 2020 partly due to the continued impact of pandemic-induced travel curbs on its retail holdings.

“With many of our tenants adversely impacted by the various COVID-19 measures and restrictions we had reached out to them with targeted rental operational and marketing support to help them tide over this difficult time” Mercatus chairman Soong Hee Sang said in the firm’s annual report. “We can all look forward to steady recovery and growth in 2022 as Singapore transits to living with COVID-19.”

Offices Assets Near Sale

While its sister firm is busy looking for new owners for its malls industry sources told Mingtiandi that NTUC Income is nearing a sale of its office tower at 16 Collyer Quay in Raffles Place and that its 11-storey Prinsep House commercial block near Bencoolen MRT station has also received offers.

Income at Raffles received bids around S$950 million during the closed expression of interest exercise that ended earlier this month according to the Business Times an amount that translates to S$3436 per square foot of its 276450 square feet in leasable area.

The 999-year leasehold property garnered 10 offers with the sellers having since narrowed the field to just three shortlisted bidders including the CDL-BlackRock JV Chinese investment firm Bright Ruby Resources and Sukanto Tanoto an Indonesian tycoon who founded the Royal Golden Eagle (RGE) group conglomerate which purchased the Tanglin Shopping Centre in February of this year.

Other reported bidders were SGX-listed builder GuocoLand a tie-up between TE Capital Partners and KKR and a Angelo Gordon-TCRE Partners joint venture.

Located in the heart of Singapore’s central business district with direct access to Raffles Place MRT station NTUC Income first purchased a 49 percent stake in the building for S$101 million in 2011 and then went on to buy the remaining stake in 2013 for S$660 million.

Market sources said the insurer has also received offers for the 1992-vintage Prinsep House for an undisclosed sum. That 47215 square foot property is part of an NTUC Income office portfolio which also includes NTUC Income Tampines Junction and NTUC Income Tampines Point in northeastern Singapore.

Just one MRT stop east of Prinsep House another Singapore office tower is the subject of negotiations.

Per the terms of the deal an affiliate of UnitedHealth's Optum business in the U.K. Bordeaux UK Holdings II Limited has offered 1925 pence per share in cash reflecting a 49% premium to EMIS’ closing price on Thursday.

Shares in the Leeds-based healthcare software maker closed 47% higher at 1901.95 pence on Friday in London giving a market capitalization of about 1.2 billion pounds.

Reuters reports that the EMIS directors intend to unanimously recommend the deal to shareholders.

EMIS provides healthcare software information technology and other services in the U.K. with a focus on primary care and pharmacy systems.

Optum's U.K. business has worked in the country for 20 years supporting the state-run National Health Service (NHS) according to an announcement. The company describes itself as a healthcare software services and consultancy business delivering population health management programs to more than 45 million people in the U.K. and medicines optimization services across the country.

Optum UK CEO Rob Sergeant said in a statement the deal to acquire EMIS will bring more advanced technology solutions and capabilities to the NHS and general practitioners to improve patient care.

The combination will strengthen EMIS’ capabilities as a leading U.K. healthcare technology company with an enhanced ability to deliver important benefits for patients clinicians and the NHS Optum UK executives said.

""We believe this combination will have the resources and expertise to enable us to better support the NHS and clinicians through technology innovations"" said Andy Thorburn CEO of EMIS in a statement.

""EMIS’s long-standing track record of delivering effective technology solutions and strong financial and operating performance combined with UnitedHealth Group’s resources and expertise will enable us to accelerate our development. We therefore consider that the combined group will be well-positioned to serve its customers and partners in the UK’s healthcare system whilst ensuring EMIS remains a strong organization supporting the NHS thereby fulfilling EMIS’ purpose of enabling better care through technology innovation"" Thorburn said.

The proposed transaction would be UnitedHealth’s largest disclosed acquisition in Europe since British executive Andrew Witty became CEO last year according to Bloomberg.

In the U.S. Optum has been on an acquisition hot streak reportedly scooping up Healthcare Associates of Texas earlier this month. In March UnitedHealth announced plans to buy home health provider LHC Group in a $5 billion deal and quietly purchased behavioral health company Refresh Mental Health.

In addition in April it was reported that the healthcare giant would pick up Houston-based Kelsey-Seybold Clinic.

UnitedHealth is also embroiled in a legal scuffle with the federal government over its planned acquisition of Change Healthcare which would join the Optum fold. The Department of Justice sued to block the deal on antitrust grounds and a trial is set for August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L2ZlYXR1cmVzL3Bhbm9yYW1hL3N1bmRhcmJhbi1jb3VyaWVyLXNlcnZpY2UtMTAwMDAtc3Ryb25nLWNvbXBhbnktZGVsaXZlcnMtYW55dGhpbmctbmVlZGxlLWNvdWNo0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGJzbmV3cy5uZXQvZmVhdHVyZXMvcGFub3JhbWEvc3VuZGFyYmFuLWNvdXJpZXItc2VydmljZS0xMDAwMC1zdHJvbmctY29tcGFueS1kZWxpdmVycy1hbnl0aGluZy1uZWVkbGUtY291Y2g_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sundarban Courier Service: The 10000-strong company that delivers anything from needle to couch,"In 1983 two friends Iamamul Kabir Shanto and Hafizur Rahman Pulok returned to Bangladesh from Germany with a plan up their sleeves: to build a courier service company.

But why a parcel delivery company of all things? ""In Germany Shanto and I saw how the Deutsche Bundespost German state-run postal service and telecommunications business was run by private organisations and we realised that with a growing population Bangladesh will need this service"" said Hafizur Rahman Pulok Sundarban Courier Service's Vice Chairman.

Until 1983 there was an air express service in Bangladesh meaning that the document and non-document parcels were transported through the use of airways. This posed a problem because the air express service depended on the availability of an airport or at least a runaway for the airborne parcel carriers. Bangladesh Post Office also operated parcel delivery service but like many other government services it was not very reliable.

To address this problem Shanto and Pulok wanted to offer the service of a 'courier.'

Then one day in 1983 the air express service came to a halt. And on the first day of November Sundarban Courier Service (SCS) started their journey as a parcel and document delivery company along with three other delivery service companies: Continental air express Dolphin air express and Dreamland air express.

Currently 150 to 200 e-commerce companies use SCS for deliveries outside Dhaka. Photo: Noor-A-Alam

But there's a catch. Among the four companies just mentioned only SCS operated as a by-road courier service agency making it the country's first private courier company. ""We wanted to go to people's doorsteps which was not possible for the air express"" said Pulok.

And that they did. Because today after nearly four decades in operation Sundarban Courier Service has become the largest courier service company in Bangladesh. Starting from a small room in Shegunbagicha in 1983 this company now has 10000 employees with more than 700 branch and agent offices around the country in 64 districts.

But why did they choose the name Sundarban and a tiger as their logo? ""Shanto and I both are originally from the Sundarban belt of the country; he is from Kushtia and I am from Khulna. And what could symbolise Sundarban better than our very own Bengal Tiger?"" replied Pulok.

SCS has international branches in Singapore and Malaysia as well. However since the death of the company chairman Iamamul Kabir Shanto in 2020 the international branches remain inactive.

Stupendous scale of operations services and e-commerce support

The company has 700 covered vans and every day 110 vans travel to Dhaka with products from all over Bangladesh and 110 vans leave Dhaka every night. General Manager Toufiq Islam said ""Everyday we get bills of Tk30 lakh at our head office just for the 110 vans that arrive and leave Dhaka.""

The company also has a dedicated wing for e-commerce enterprise support which includes product delivery and cash collection. This wing was created in 2012.

Currently 150 to 200 e-commerce companies use SCS for deliveries outside Dhaka and more than 10000 products are delivered through the company. Additionally 100 regular bikers are appointed all around the country to deliver these products.

Naznin Afroza owns Vermillion BD a Dhaka-based e-commerce business. She operates mainly through Facebook and Instagram and sells women's accessories that include purses jewellery etc.

Afroza uses the SCS branch near her house to deliver her products outside Dhaka. ""It's convenient as most areas have an SCS branch and I don't usually get any complaints from my customers"" Afroza told The Business Standard.

The company also has a service called 'liqupack' which is essential for delivering liquid products like honey ghee mustard oil palm jaggery etc.

Mango fever and SCS

A special SCS team maintains the fruit delivery section during the mango season. Currently SCS is delivering more than 1000 kg of mangoes every day this season according to Toufiq.

He also mentioned that during the fruit season is the time of year when SCS receives the most complaints from customers as fruits tend to spoil and rot.

And sometimes once in a thousand your mango cart may get misplaced. ""In that case we first listen to the customer's complaint and then compensate with another crate of mangoes or the amount"" said Toufiq because customer satisfaction is what SCS prioritises.

Customers can call the SCS call centre to complain. Al-Amin the head of the SCS call centre said ""We are a team of 38 people taking calls from our customers 24/7. In three shifts we take our customer's calls and listen to their frustrations and afflictions.""

Al Amin said that his team attends to at least 15000 calls from around the country daily regarding problems they are having with their parcels or to make enquiries about the service.

Security concerns

The company delivers everything from a needle to a couch. And the fee is decided according to the weight and space it is going to take.

The document fee ranges between Tk8 to Tk25. And for the non-document parcels SCS has three polybags - the yellow bag (priced at Tk100 and carries 1kg in weight) the white bag (priced at Tk140 and carries up to 3kg in weight) and lastly the blue bag (priced at Tk200 and carries up to 5kg in weight).

Apart from these three the company has another polybag for the e-commerce products and it costs Tk130. The speciality of this one is that it is transparent which allows them to monitor if the right product is being parcelled or not.

""Whatever you send be it an e-commerce product or anything you send for your family you will have to show it to us. We have clear SOP [standard operating procedure] guidelines from the Department of Narcotics Control and also the Ministry of Home Affairs that allows us to check this. It's basically to prevent drug trafficking"" explained Pulok.

However from first-hand experience I can say that not always the package content is checked. But an official does ask what is being sent.

The company has proposed to the Courier Services Association of Bangladesh (CSAB) to arrange for scanners at the courier service centres. Pulok also the president of CSAB told us that currently there are more than 500 courier service organisations in Bangladesh among which only 75 are licensed and 150 companies are connected with the association.

But the rest of the companies are absolutely off the radar. ""This puts us at risk of building an unprofessional sector. And we don't know if these unregistered companies are connected with drug trafficking or not"" said Pulok. This is the reason the association has proposed to the ministry to make the companies register and get licences.

Sundarban Courier Service has contracts with DHL Overseas Communication Service (OCS) of Australia and Desk to Desk Courier and Cargo (DTDC) of India to deliver parcels worldwide. The company also plans to further expand their business outside the country.

""For now we are trying to revive our international branches in Singapore and Malaysia. And we are also planning to open one more branch in London and another one in Dubai"" said Toufiq.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcnRlbC5pbi9iMmIvaW5zaWdodHMvYmxvZ3Mvc3RhcnR1cC1jb21wYW55LWEtY29tcHJlaGVuc2l2ZS1ndWlkZS1jb3ZlcmluZy1ldmVyeS1hc3BlY3Qtb2Ytc3RhcnR1cHMtaW4taW5kaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Startup Company: A Comprehensive Guide for Startups in India,"The first step you should take when exploring how to initiate a business startup is to find an issue and it’s probable solution. Successful startups first come up with strong business ideas that fill the needs of customers.

However your concept doesn’t always have to be a new one. As a startup you can even innovatively update present products or services for your consumers.

Let’s further explore the startup ecosystem.

Some Facts about Indian Startups

India has the 3rd most powerful startup ecosystem in the world; projected to observe YoY progress of 12 to 15%. Furthermore there are 50000+ startups in India and around 8900 to 9300 of these valuable startups are in the technology domains. The statistics indicate that 2 to 3 technical startup businesses commence each day.

When discussing the top business startup across India names like Flipkart Paytm Zomato Swiggy or Ola cannot be forgotten. These are the actual applications that have hand-picked India into the top position in the startup business ecosystem of the world.

Drivers of the Startup Ecosystem in India

The global enterprises comprehend the disruptive likelihood of Indian startups and thus invest in them. Instances of corporate backing in India include:

Corporate Connect

Facebook is partnering and investing in Indian startups. Recently the company disbursed cash grants of around $50000 each to the best five Indian startups. The 10000 Women program by Goldman Sachs offered women entrepreneurs corporate training guidance and access to funds for startup businesses. Microsoft Ventures Accelerator Program in India has freshly chosen sixteen leading startups.



Government Backing

The Indian Government is comprehending the worth of working with disruptive innovators and leveraging their innovations to enhance public service delivery. Animal Husbandry and Dairy Department awarded the best startups in 5 groupings with prize money of 10 lakhs INR. More than 26 states in India have specific startup policies.



Types of Businesses for Startups in India

The startup business founders can get confused with an utter number of necessities the Government places on different types of businesses. To make this progression straightforward here are the significant features of each type of business entity:

Private Limited Company: A startup company can choose this business structure as it enables external funding to be raised effortlessly bounds the liabilities of its shareholders and allows them to provide employee stock choices to bring onboard skilled employees and stakeholders. Since these entities arrange board discussions and file yearly returns they are considered more credible than an LLP or General Partnership structure. Limited Liability Partnership: This type of business entity where one joins as a partner as opposed to a director in a Private Limited form of company. Most startup businesses go with a partnership form since there is lesser compliance.

The other positive point of this structure is that it binds the liabilities of its partners to their business participation and provides every partner shield from negligence or ineffectiveness of the other partners.

General Partnership: It is a distinct business structure that involves two or more individuals operating a business as per the Partnership Deed. This structure is less preferred as partners have unlimited liability which means they are individually liable for the business debts. This structure is a practical choice for home businesses that cannot take on any business debt. Company registration is elective in the case of General Partnerships. Sole Proprietorship: It is a business owned and handled by a single person. You could have it operating within ten days of application making it handy in the unorganised segments predominantly small-sized traders and merchants. They are recognized by a service or sales tax registration. One Person Company: It is better than a sole proprietorship. It offers a single promoter complete control over the firm while restraining liability to participation across the business. This individual will be the mere director and shareholder. So there is no possibility of raising equity funding or providing staff stock options as a startup business.

Startups Should shield their Intellectual Property by Leveraging their IPR

Once the essentials of deciding the precise business structure are opted IPR assists in distinguishing your business from the competition.

IPR offers you benefits like:

Can sell or licence for building an added revenue channel.

Provide unique products/services to your clients.

It can turn into a vital part of your branding tactics.

Intellectual properties are assets that you can leverage for loans.

Use your IP smartly making it more logical to safeguard your business and legally defend your Intellectual property. Follow these tips:

Here are the categories of IPR that businesses could necessitate

Copyrights: A specific shield is automatically provided to the author for their unique inventive or rational work. A startup can make the Copyright registration request obligatory to safeguard the exclusivity of their work. Trademarks: Startups can register their trademark digitally as this acts as a brand component distinctive to your products and services from other players in the market. It generates a discrete identity for your startup company and thereby secures a business brand from being imitated. Patents: A patent can be applied by a business startup when exploring to shield an original discovery or invention and can be leveraged uniquely to ease people’s lives.

A year after the government headhunter failed to find any suitable candidate for top job at ONGC  the oil ministry has proposed raising of eligibility age as well as a shorter tenure for the new chairman and managing director of India's top oil and gas producer.The ministry has proposed that any candidate to be eligible for consideration should not be more than 60 years of age on the date of occurrence of vacancy according to the ministry's office memorandum sent to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on June 17.The vacancy arose after Shashi Shanker superannuated on March 31 2021.Presently the minimum age prescribed for being eligible for the top job is 45 years. Besides internal candidates need to have two years of residual service as on the date of vacancy and three years for external candidates.What the ministry has proposed now is that any eligible candidate who is not more than 60 years of age at the time of occurrence of vacancy which was April 1 2021 should be considered eligible. This would essentially mean that the current acting chairman Alka Mittal who otherwise would retire in August-end and was ineligible would come under the zone of consideration.The ministry has also proposed appointment for a period of three years from the date of joining instead of the present five-year term according to the letter.The selection will be done through a three-member search-cum-selection committee headed by PESB chairman and composed of oil secretary and former Indian Oil chairman B Ashok (outside expert).The panel was formed on February 4 2022 but the terms of reference are being framed only now.Most board-level appointments at public sector companies are done on the basis of recommendations of the Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) but the government headhunter in June last year did not find anyone suitable among nine candidates including two serving IAS officers to head Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).""Keeping in view the strategic importance and vision for the company and its future the board did not recommend any candidate and decided to constitute a search committee"" the ministry letter said referring to PESB's interviews on June 5 2021.The panel was constituted after eight months of that recommendation on February 4.The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet ( ACC ) approved ""consideration of central government officers including those of the armed forces of the Union and the all India services for the post on immediate absorption basis.""""Energy security is critical for the nation. ONGC plays a pivotal role in exploration as India's National Oil Company (NOC). Its activities need to be scaled significantly and rapidly. As an NOC  it is necessary to have a specially designed 'sui generis' job description for ONGC in order to attract the best talent available"" it said.If accepted the proposal will throw open the field for ONGC's former director (finance) Subhash Kumar as well as current acting chairman Alka Mittal who otherwise were ineligible for the post.As per the practice PESB recommends a name for a board-level position at least three months prior to arising of the vacancy. However in the case of ONGC PESB advertised and interviewed candidates after the retirement of Shashi Shanker on March 31 2021.After Shanker retired Subhash Kumar director for finance and senior most director on ONGC board  was given the additional charge of chairman and managing director.Kumar retired on December 31 2021 and Alka Mittal Director for Human Resources ONGC was given additional charge. She will superannuate in August.Other internal directors of ONGC would also become eligible due to the age relaxation.The committee route for appointment of PSU board members has very sparingly been used in the past. In 2016 current NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh was appointed through the route. Last appointment using the route was that of Sanjeev Kumar as the chairman of Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL).PESB had on June 5 2021 interviewed nine out of the 10 candidates who had applied for the post of chairman and managing director of ONGC. Those interviewed included senior bureaucrats Avinash Joshi and Niraj Verma. MRPL ) director-finance Pomila Jaspal and ONGC director for technology and field services Om Prakash Singh were the other prominent names who were interviewed as per the PESB notice.Both the bureaucrats are from the 1994 batch of IAS officers belonging to the Assam-Meghalaya cadre.Others interviewed by PESB were ONGC executive directors Sandeep Gupta Pankaj Kumar and Omkar Nath Gyani ONGC additional director general Anand Gupta and Container Corporation of India director-finance Manoj Kumar Dubey.Security Printing and Minting Corp of India Ltd director-finance Ajay Agarwal who had applied for the job did not appear for the interview.This was the second time in one-and-a-half decades that a suitable candidate was not found among those who had applied.In August 2006 PESB chose R S Sharma to head the company but the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in February 2007 vetoed his appointment as it wanted the selection process to be widened by inviting candidates from the private sector.In June 2007 PESB again selected Sharma and his candidature was this time endorsed by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC).While a replacement to the PSU board position is often selected before the incumbent retires PESB did not hold any interviews for almost seven months as its chairman wasn't appointed. The government in April 2021 named Mallika Srinivasan chairman and managing director of Tractors and Farm Equipment (TAFE) Ltd as the new chairperson of PESB.She is the first person from the private sector to be appointed as the head of PESB.",,,

Geographical Survey

Within five hours the agency reported nine earthquakes three of which were barely minutes apart. At 2:54 a.m. the first earthquake was felt. The magnitude was 3.8. Eight more had struck by 7:01 a.m.

Small earthquakes in Oregon

At 4:56 a.m. the series' greatest earthquake struck. The magnitude was 5.6 according to statistics.

There were no tsunami warnings according to Joan Gomberg a U.S. government official. Seismologist at the Geological Survey in Seattle.

It's nothing to be concerned about and these are minor in comparison to their distance offshore"" Gomberg added.

The seafloor must move up or down to cause a tsunami and in this situation the bottom is moving sideways.

The earthquakes occurred in the Blanco Fracture Zone a fault between two tectonic plates that runs roughly 300 miles northwest of the Oregon coast and is known for producing numerous small earthquakes according to Gomberg.

The Blanco Fracture Zone according to Gomberg should not be confused with the Cascadia Subduction Zone a 600-mile fault that spans from northern California to British Columbia on the West Coast and is capable of delivering potentially disastrous earthquakes of magnitude 9.0.

The Blanco Fracture Zone is 200 miles closer to the Oregon coast than the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

The movement of the plates in subduction zones where two tectonic plates meet thrusting one plate beneath the other may build mountains and volcanoes as well as significant earthquakes and tsunamis.

In fracture zones however tectonic plates move side to side and parallel to one other resulting in significantly smaller earthquakes on average according to Gomberg.

Earthquake technology that automatically stops or slows trains

In the case of an earthquake Metrolink's Earthquake Early Warning System (EEW) is improving with new technology that automatically applies the brakes for safe and speedy slowing or stopping of trains.

A prior version of the system which Metrolink began using in September 2021 could send automatic instructions to train personnel instructing them to begin slowing or stopping the train but it did not have automated brake enforcement.

The second phase of this technology deployment is being tested between Riverside and Perris on Metrolink's 91/Perris Valley Line which is sponsored by cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) Survey of Geology (USGS).

The EEW is built on a connection between ShakeAlert which is run by the USGS and Metrolink's Positive Train Control (PTC) system.

ShakeAlert is an EEW system that gives critical information about an earthquake within seconds of its detection such as the earthquake's origin timing position and magnitude so people and systems may be warned before shaking occurs.

PTC is intended to prevent train-to-train collisions over-speed derailments and other potentially dangerous situations.

According to Metrolink CEO Darren Kettle the combination of ShakeAlert and PTC is a genuine game-changer.

This newest development reflects Metrolink's continued leadership in system safety and marks a significant milestone in our dedication to safeguarding our passengers employees and infrastructure.

The new system will also give improved data to help train network inspection and service restart following an earthquake.

Wiganers have been left feeling nostalgic after news that a former town centre nightclub will be turned into a storage unit and apartments. Standishgate’s Bryan House was home to Maximes nightclub which was a popular spot in the 90’s amongst locals with Manchester Evening News reader even admitting he met his “mrs” there.

Manchester-based Hurstwood Holdings has launched Hurstwood Self Storage which is set to open before the end of the year. Having already secured planning permission Hurstwood is also in negotiations to convert the upper floors of the building into 45 one-bed apartments.

Hurstwood plans to roll out its self-storage concept nationwide with further sites already identified in Lancaster North Shields and Dumfries.

Formerly Tiffany's Maximes nightclub in Wigan ran from the early 80's catering for both dance and rock music events. It helped promote upcoming bands and featured big names including Iron Maiden and Def Leppard and even has a Facebook group 'Maximes first friday rock night' in it's honour.

This is what M.E.N readers had to say about this news:

Neil Wilson said: “Spent many Saturday nights in the early 90’s absolute buzzing place to be.”

Craig Gerrard said: “Wigan pier now Maximes! And let's not forget the gallery. Wigan is just going to be a hostel.”

Simon Collier said: “Need one last walk round for two hours.”

Angela Griffiths said: “I went there every Sunday evening to the under 18’s disco great memories.”

Jonathan Cowap said: “Can we have one last all nighter first though.”

Francesca Ryder said: “Aw loved Maxine’s!! Miss my feet sticking to the floor and having to wipe them on the way out.”

Gary Fitzsimons said: “Had some good nights there when it was Tiffanies in the 80’s. Met my first Mrs there.”

Stewart Lomax said: “Back to the old school every Saturday in the late 90’s.”

Keith Stanier said: “Had some good times there.”

John Davies said: “It was Tiffany's in the late 70’s.”

Although not all the readers were caught up in the nostalgia and wanted to discuss what this move meant for the town centre:

Anthony Highton said sarcastically: “Just what we need that's 3.5 million flats in a dying town.”

Barbara Dworzecki said: “Need to start attracting shops to the town centre.”

June Brown said: “I wonder who will live in the apartments.”

James Hall said: “Some more apartments that are gonna be way over priced and mostly empty good idea that.”

Despite touting various improvements over the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 the latest SoC continues to lag behind Apple’s newly announced M2. Let us see how vast those differences are.

Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 Also Fails to Beat the M1 Showing How Far Behind the Competition Is Compared to Apple’s ARM-Based Silicon

The Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 currently only powers the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s a $1200 ARM notebook that runs Windows. Likely due to the lack of availability of the chipset Lenovo could not bring the ThinkPad X13s faster to the market but now that it is here one Twitter user with the handle SkyJuice shared how fast the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 actually is.

The Lenovo ThinkPad X13s was tested back in April of this year and as you can tell the scores are not impressive especially when you consider the massive performance gap existing between the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 and the M2. In Geekbench 5 Qualcomm’s premium silicon obtained a single-core score of 1111 and multi-core score of 5764. The M2 in our earlier benchmark report secured a single-core score of 1919 and multi-core score of 8929.

Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 performance results

This makes the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 55 percent slower than the M2 in the multi-core category. If that was not bad enough Qualcomm’s fastest notebook chipset is slower than the M1 too which was the very first entrant of the Apple Silicon family and launched back in 2020. These scores reveal that one analyst was correct about Apple’s dominance in the ARM notebook space and has up to a 3-year lead against the competition.

Qualcomm earlier stated that it will take advantage of the Nuvia acquisition to bolster its future chipset’s performance in a bid to take on Apple’s M-series. Unfortunately we have to yet see any worthy silicon materialize. We have heard talks about a potential M1 competitor so perhaps Qualcomm will provide a preview later this year alongside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for future flagship smartphones.

Apple M2 performance results

Unfortunately Apple is not sitting around waiting for what its competitors come up with next as a previous report stated that the faster M2 Pro and M2 Max will undergo mass production on TSMC’s cutting-edge 3nm architecture later this year making them more power-efficient than their direct predecessors the M1 Pro and M1 Max.

What do you think of these results so far? Do you think Qualcomm will be able to catch up to Apple in a short time span? Tell us down in the comments.

The results for the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 are not only well behind those of the Apple M2 but they also lag behind the M1 SoC from 2020.

The apparently delayed Lenovo ThinkPad X13s is now on sale and those interested in snapping up an ARM-based Windows laptop that should offer at least incredible battery life can purchase one for a price starting at US$1192.95. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chip powering the ThinkPad X13s laptop was launched back in December 2021 with promises of “extreme performance and efficiency”. However where the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 is clearly a good step up from the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 it appears to be years behind the Apple M1 and Apple M2 ARM-based rivals.

Several Geekbench appearances for the ThinkPad X13s/Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 have already surfaced with the best-performing results dating back to April 2022. With a Geekbench 5 record now available for the Apple M2 it is possible to compare Qualcomm’s chipset with the latest from Cupertino – and it does not make for pleasant reading for the former. While the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3’s highest results of 1112 points (single-core) and 5764 points (multi-core) look incredible against our recorded median marks for its predecessor (Gen 3: +39.5% and +85.01% respectively) they pale into comparison against the Apple chips.

The Apple M1 leads the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 by a hefty +55.58% in the single-core test and +31.47% in the multi-core benchmark – bearing in mind that’s comparing our median marks for the M1 against the theoretical best for the Windows on ARM-based laptop. Understandably the advantages for the Apple M2 are even greater with the new MacBook Air/Pro processor snagging a massive +72.57% lead over the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 in the single-core run and enjoying a +54.89% multi-core difference. So while the Qualcomm processor does offer a very attractive generational performance leap over its own family it is clearly a distant runner-up to the Apple M-series which will likely be soon bolstered by the even more impressive M2 Pro and M2 Max processors.

Qualcomm MediaTek Samsung and HUAWEI might rule the mobile processor roost but that doesn’t mean they’re the only players in town. We’ve also seen another player emerge in the last five years in the form of China’s Unisoc mainly gaining ground in the entry-level sector.

Unisoc (formerly Spreadtrum) founded in 2001 is slowly making waves thanks to deals with players like Nokia realme and ZTE. In fact Unisoc’s most high-profile customer in the last few years was Samsung so there’s a small chance you’ve used a device powered by this brand before.

What should you expect from Unisoc processors though? We put together a beginner’s guide to Unisoc SoCs. More SoC coverage: Qualcomm Snapdragon processor guide — Specs and features explained

The low-end Unisoc chips

Unisoc’s first foray into low-end chips starting in 2012 yielded chips that were lacking features even back then. Some chips in their initial lineup lacked 3G capabilities but we did see single-core A7 or dual-core A5 CPUs and single or Mali 400 GPUs.

Fast-forward to the modern era and its current range of low-end chips consists of the SC9863A SC9832E and SC7731E all being built on ancient 28nm designs lacking UFS storage support and offering Bluetooth 4.2.

The SC9863A is the most capable SoC of the lot serving up an octa-core Arm Cortex-A55 CPU and a PowerVR GE8322 GPU which should deliver decent everyday performance. Other notable specs include Cat 7 LTE (300Mbps downlink speeds) LPDDR4X RAM support FHD+ display resolution and 16MP+5MP dual camera support.

Next on the totem pole is the SC9832E serving up a distinctly budget quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU and a pretty old Mali T820-MP1 GPU. The chipset cuts things back when it comes to cellular connectivity (Cat 4 LTE) RAM support and display resolution among other things.

The entry-level Unisoc chipsets have found their way into several low-end devices such as Android Go phones.

Finally the SC7731E is an obsolete design that doesn’t even have LTE offering HSPA support instead. The quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU is something from a decade ago while the Mali-T820 GPU is newer but still super-old by the standards of rival chip designers Qualcomm Samsung and MediaTek.

Broadly speaking these chipsets are comparable to Qualcomm’s older Snapdragon 200 series and older Snapdragon 400 range in many ways. But the last few generations of Snapdragon 400 processors blow these chips out of the water in terms of power and/or efficiency.

Unisoc launched its Tiger range of chipsets several years ago and it’s since expanded this family so you can now find a variety of processors at a number of price points.

The T310 was one of the first chipsets in this segment launching back in 2019 with a rather interesting quad-core CPU (one Cortex-A75 and three Cortex-A55) and modest PowerVR GT7200 graphics.

The firm’s other mid-range processors are the 4G-enabled Tiger T600 series (namely the T606 T610 T612 T616 and T618). These chips are equipped with an octa-core CPU (two Cortex-A75 and six Cortex-A55) varying in terms of clock speed.

We also get Arm’s Mali-G5x series graphics here namely the Mali-G52 MC2 for the T610 and T618 the Mali-G52 MC1 for the T606 and the Mali-G57 MC1 for the T612 and T616. Thankfully these chipsets are all built on a 12nm process which should translate to relatively efficient designs in theory. Recommended reading: What is an SoC? Everything you need to know about smartphone chipsets

Other common features here include Bluetooth 5.0 support for FHD+ display resolutions LPDDR4X RAM support and Cat 7 LTE speeds. The SoCs do vary in terms of camera capabilities though with the T618 offering the most impressive support.

These chips achieved some solid design wins in the past appearing in phones from Motorola realme and Samsung albeit restricted to low-end devices. We also saw the T610 notably find its way into the Nokia T20 tablet while the T606 landed in the repairable Nokia G22. Either way you can expect these chips to go up against processors like the Snapdragon 460 and Helio G80.

Unisoc’s top-end chips

Unisoc

Unisoc doesn’t really have any flagship processors that can go up against current Snapdragon Samsung and MediaTek silicon. Nevertheless the company’s top-end chips were the Tiger T770 and T760.

Starting with the most capable SoC of the lot the T770 was pretty impressive for the Chinese chipmaker. You’ve got a 6nm design here along with a 2.6GHz octa-core CPU (one Cortex-A76 three Cortex-A76 four Cortex-A55) and a Mali-G57 GPU.

Unisoc's high-end processors were a few steps behind industry leaders but it seems like this business segment is dormant.

The T770 certainly ticks plenty of boxes elsewhere such as a sub-6GHz V510 5G modem an NPU delivering 4.8 TOPs of power support for 108MP cameras 4K/60fps video recording and 120Hz support at FHD+ display resolutions (or QHD+ at 60Hz).

Meanwhile the T760 is very similar to the T770 but makes cutbacks in a number of areas. This includes CPU clock speeds NPU power video recording refresh rate and camera support.

Oddly enough neither chipset is listed on Unisoc’s website anymore suggesting that they were either canceled or didn’t receive any device wins.

The firm also offered the 2019-era Tiger T710 chipset as its previous “flagship” processor of sorts although this didn’t have an integrated modem. Core specs include an octa-core CPU (four Cortex-A76 and four Cortex-A55) PowerVR 9446 graphics and a relatively powerful NPU for the time. Interestingly the T710 later gained a sub-6GHz 5G modem and became the Tiger T740.

It looks like only the Tiger T740 has a made commercial appearance in smartphones to date. OEMs have turned to Qualcomm and MediaTek for their high-end or upper-mid-range needs instead.

It’s safe to say that move has been transformative for the Mac range.

Apple not only has greater control over the production line but is also able to deliver a faster performance than the likes of AMD and Intel making its Macs more appealing compared to Windows-based machines.

It’s been a nightmare move for Intel and AMD which have missed out a huge chunk of revenue since Apple no longer requires their components. But the situation could become even worse for the duo in the next couple of years.

AMD and Intel can at least be glad there’s no chance of Apple supplying its processors to other manufacturers. Apple will want to keep the M1 and M2 chips (and so on) for itself to make the brand as appealing as possible. But it looks like the success of M1 chips may have inspired another company to copy the same tactic.

Qualcomm has been making computer chips for several years now. You’ll find its Snapdragon processors inside laptops such as the Samsung Galaxy Book Go Acer Chromebook Spin 513 and Samsung Galaxy Book S. But due to restrained performance and compatibility issues with Windows we’ve only really seen these processors prove popular in Chromebooks – they’ve hardly been successful enough to make AMD or Intel sweat.

But now Apple has shown the world that chips with Arm architecture can indeed offer high-end performance it looks like Qualcomm is keen to replicate the success of the MacBook.

Galaxy Book S with Snapdragon chip

During an interview with CNET Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon confirmed that the company plans to launch a new range of Arm-based Nuvia processors for laptops. Such chips will differ to the current Snapdragon range as they will target a high performance for both the CPU and GPU – sound familiar?

“We’re aiming to have performance leadership in PC on the CPU period” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon reportedly said during the interview. Qualcomm isn’t just aiming to play catch up with AMD Intel and Apple but to leapfrog the trio with the world’s fastest laptop chip.

It’s an incredibly ambitious goal but I’d be hesitant to bet against Qualcomm. After all its acquisition of Nuvia back in 2021 has ensured it has chip manufacturers on the team who previously worked for the likes of Arm Apple and Google. I also remember people being sceptical about Apple’s hopes to release one of the most powerful laptop processors on the market but nobody’s doubting Tim Cook now.

AMD and Intel have every right to be worried about Qualcomm’s plans. Apple’s move to M1 was a big setback but the duo’s loss of market share was at least limited to the Mac ecosystem. If Qualcomm proves successful it’s possible that major AMD and Intel clients – such as Acer Asus Dell Lenovo and more – could be tempted to use the incoming Nuvia chip rather than those from the next generations of Intel Core and AMD Ryzen.

MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip

Of course AMD and Intel both have time on their side. The Qualcomm Nuvia isn’t expected to arrive until the end of 2023. And even once the Nuvia processor is available it would take a long time for third-party manufacturers to switch over due to the strong relationships they have with the current chip suppliers.

As AMD has found no matter how powerful its mobile processors are it’s still incredibly difficult to displace Intel as the main chip supplier. You still can’t buy a Dell XPS laptop with an AMD processor and Razer only launched its first ever AMD-powered Blade in 2021.

Regardless of the performance power on offer it’s going to take a long time for Qualcomm to make a dent in the market. But if Qualcomm can produce a chip as impressive as Apple’s M1 range then it has every chance of becoming a serious competitor to both AMD and Intel.

The sweater saga began in November 2019 when Texas resident Gloria Miramontes bought a women’s burgundy lightweight V-neck from a Ralph Lauren Polo Factory store in El Paso.

Miramontes believed the sweater was made exclusively of pima cotton based on the tags which boasted “Fine luxurious yarns crafted from Pima Cotton fibers distinguish this signature design knit in a fine gauge stitch for lightweight comfort and an exquisitely soft hand” court documents show.

Pima cotton is a higher-end product with a longer fiber than conventional cotton. It has a reputation for producing a smooth fabric that’s soft to the touch wrinkle-resistant and ultra-durable.

But consumers were short-changed the Manhattan Federal Court lawsuit alleges because the fibers in the sweater were a few tenths of an inch too short to be pima which the US Department of Agriculture measures at 1.3125 inches long on average.

Lab tests proved the Ralph Lauren sweaters weren’t 100% pima cotton said Miramontes’ attorney Spencer Sheehan.

Miramontes claims she would not have forked over $39.99 if she had known it was not entirely pima the suit says.

Pima cotton is typically more expensive so “there is great incentive to mix cotton byproducts and shorter fibers with higher value longer fibers” according to the court papers which were filed in New York based on the Manhattan location of Polo’s headquarters plaintiff’s attorneys said.

Lab tests proved the garment was actually not 100% Pima cotton an attorney said. Spencer Sheehan

The Lauren V-neck sweater was sold in “thousands of locations” according to the $5 million class action lawsuit which includes customers from 19 states including New York.

Fans gather after anxiously awaiting the arrival of Chris Martin and his band to awe them in a stunning and long anticipated performance of their newest album ‘Music Of The Spheres’. The concert at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida was their final performance on their United States leg of the tour.

Before they perform two announcers asked the audience to gaze towards the stage to watch a short video covering the band's efforts they made to cut their CO2 tour emissions in half while still providing an unparalleled show and celestial atmosphere. From the beginning neon bright lights and creative digital design enveloped/douse the audience in elation. Upon entry volunteers hand out 100% compostable bracelets that would be used as part of the production to simultaneously light up in unison with the songs and themes while the band perform.

Raymond James is home of the Bucs football team but on nights such as this one the outdoor sporting ground becomes a vibrating and sensational arena for the community of Tampa Bay and beyond. Chris Martin silences the crowd at one point to express his gratitude for Tampa; he mentions fans came from all over including countries like Puerto Rico and Cuba to experience Coldplay that night.

It’s difficult to make each and every fan feel seen and appreciated in a stadium that holds 50000 people but Chris Martin has no trouble finding a way to do that. ‘Music Of The Spheres’ is an almost divine experience with the thematic elements of aliens and the concert felt intimate despite the grandiose physical attributes. Towards the end of his performance Martin overhears a fan yell that he wanted to propose; Chris delayed playing one his top acoustic pieces 'Sparks' and instead sings 'I Will Always Love You' while allowing the fan to propose on stage in front of the crowd a moment that shows the true character of such a lead singer as Martin.

Coldplay has managed to maintain a mixed and diversified audience and gain attention from varied demographics one recognizable hallmark of the concert. Their newest album seems unlike most things Coldplay has ever created with Chris had the whole crowd singing along with him 'Viva La Vida' a fan favourite that cut across most boundaries.

It's these unique moments that make this concert a one-of-a-kind event. Chris illustrates himself both as a performer throughout his performance making it feel as though he really wore his heart on sleeve. After only seven seconds into his performance of ‘Sky Full Of Stars’ Chris stopped his band gathered tightly with them to discuss what the audience soon heard shortly after. He proposed and asked so kindly that for this one song every person put their technology away – “no phones no videos voice memos apple watches computer televisions… so we can all be here in this moment together.”

One of the final songs Chris performed was an impromptu appreciation song for Tampa with a slightly comedic appreciation for having the opportunity to play in a stadium with a pirate ship.

James Hawkins affectionately known as “Hawk” was known as a proud military veteran who showed his fighting spirit until the end.

James Alfred Hawkins was born in Roanoke VA on March 25 1945. He was the son of the late Madison Hawkins Sr. and Emily (McGuire) Hawkins. He spent his childhood in the Amsterdam/Cloverdale area of Botetourt where he graduated from Central Academy High School. He later moved to Vinton VA with his family.

James served three years in the United States Army and fought in the Vietnam War. Upon his return home he met and married Esther “Tootie” Henderson. His daughter Letitia Hawkins-Beatty was born from this union.

Later he married his devoted wife Greta (Anderson) Hawkins. Their union remained until his passing. Greta and James celebrated more than 40 years together. He was a dedicated husband and step-father to Terrance Anderson (late) Jeffrey Anderson and Sharon Anderson.

James worked as a driver for many years. He retired from Chandler Concrete where he was employed as a truck driver. He took great pride in his work and the years he put into it.

James was also a “car man.” He took great pride in keeping his cars in mint condition. He had a fun-loving spirit and enjoyed story-telling and laughing with friends and family. He was an enthusiastic Dallas Cowboys fan and could always be found either watching a game or a western. James was a very stylish man known for his sharp dressing and full afro in his younger years. Singing was also one of his favorite pastimes. It seemed that he found his calling when he joined the men’s singing group at First Mt. Airy Baptist Church over 20 years ago. He will be remembered for his smooth tenor and cool demeanor.

James Hawkins was preceded in death by his siblings Madison Hawkins Jr. Sallie Whitten Lawrence Hawkins Thomas Hawkins and Arthur English.

Those of his family who remain to cherish his memory are his loving wife Greta Hawkins daughter Letitia (Tim) Hawkins-Beatty Jeffrey Anderson and Sharon Anderson sisters Carolyn (Raymond) Lewis and Margaret (James) Robertson grandchildren Sela Beatty his namesake Titus “James” Beatty Vinzetta Minor Derrick Leftwich and Cedric Leftwich long-time neighbor and friend Paul (Gloria) Brewer and a host of nieces nephews and cousins.

Two months after getting into a relationship with his now-wife Gisele Bundchen Brady’s ex-girlfriend told him about the pregnancy. Bridget Moynahan revealed that while she was giving birth to her child Brady was not present alongside.

In this case the model said “He certainly wasn’t holding my hand while I pushed.” Although Moynahan has not explicitly expressed her feelings about her relationship with the couple she has her views on raising a child together with them.

Additionally she commented on her feelings about raising a child with Tom and the child’s extended family. She said “I never made a comment about Gisele or Tom publicly. I have a relationship with these people on a daily basis. I’m raising a child and it’s public. My son has two loving parents and an extended family whether it’s cousins or stepmothers or boyfriends. My son is surrounded by love.”

Even though Gisele expresses her love for her stepson publicly; Moynahan remains reserved about the supermodel’s reaction. Bundchen often says that her stepson John Edward Thomas Moynahan is the sweetest little angel. Furthermore she said that it feels like John is 100% her child.

The partnership between Galaxy Dodowo Bemoe and Station B has precipitated one of the most bizarre-looking GeForce RTX 30-series (Ampere) graphics cards we have ever seen. The design pays tribute to a cartoon dog with the body of a vegetable.

If you were a fan of this dog which we think is a character called Caigu in the Dodowo animations then this will be a very appealing package. There are plenty of supporting accessories in the box besides the pastel yellow GPU with red flourishes on the front and a happy Caigu shouting encouragement on the back. The package includes a 360 x 275mm mouse mat an intelligent device stand with clock a 55mm square die with six facial expressions posted by Caigu and the gift box.

We should look at the graphics card more closely as that is our job here but it is nothing special under the dog/cabbage-themed paint job. The GeForce RTX 3060 is suitable for playing mainstream AAA games at 1080p with smooth frame rates and support for graphics technologies like real-time raytracing DLSS and Nvidia Reflex. Regulars will know from one of several reviews RTX 3060 we have published. Coincidentally we reviewed a Galaxy-made model the Galax GeForce RTX 3060 EX in November last year.

This new limited edition model is a triple fan model but won't be much different compared to the twin fan models we have reviewed. An RGB logo provides additional eye candy on the cooling shroud and RGB fans. We guess Dodowo fans will set them to a cabbage green and leave them like that.

You are probably desperate to buy one of these cute Galaxy GeForce RTX 3060 designs. However it looks like this limited edition will be limited to China where the Dodowo animation is created and has an established fan base.

The dog/cabbage gift boxed and themed set has a limited edition of 500 and went on sale at 8 pm. They sell for 3099 yuan in China and if we change that to USD directly at the time of writing it would be equivalent to $460. That isn't much of a premium over competing branded standard RTX 3060 graphics cards when we checked online retailers in China today. Happily even with the not terrible pricing we don't think many of these cute graphics cards will go to the crypto miners. Cryptocurrencies are further declining this weekend with ETH for example valued at under $950 at the time of writing.

The power limits include both desktop & mobile parts.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Desktop & Mobile GPU Power Limits Detailed: Ada Lovelace Powered AD102 Flagship Desktop Maxes Out at 800W Flagship Mobile AD103 Maxes Out at 175W

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series lineup based on the Ada Lovelace graphics architecture will come in both desktop and mobile flavors. We have heard various reports of how the flagship is going to feature a TGP of up to 900W but as we know the power limits are the max the GPU can reach and are not reflective of the actual TGP/TBP figures. These limits may only be reachable by heavily overclocked and custom-cooled variants.

A truth. The power limits:

AD102 800W;

AD103 (DT) 450W AD103 (Mobile) 175W;

AD104 (DT) 400W AD104 (Mobile) 175W;

AD106 (DT) 260W AD106 (Mobile) 140W.

But I don't think we need to use the full power cap. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 18 2022

So coming to the power limits we have four NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU SKUs the AD102 AD103 AD104 and AD106. All GPUs except the AD102 will receive a mobile variation and the reason is simply that the flagship chip has much higher power requirements that the laptop platform can't support. The same was the case with the GA102 GPU so the GA103 became the fastest mobile offering.

Starting with the desktop lineup the NVIDIA AD102 GPU will feature an 800W power limit the AD103 GPU will feature a 450W power limit the AD104 GPU will feature a 400W power limit & AD106 will feature a 260W power limit. As for mobile parts the AD103 mobile GPU will feature a 175W power limit AD104 mobile GPU will feature a 175W power limit and the AD106 mobile will rock a 140W power limit. Rounding up the figures we have:

NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Desktop GPUs:

AD102 - 800W Max Power Limit

AD103 - 450W Max Power Limit

AD104 - 400W Max Power Limit

AD106 - 260W Max Power Limit

NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Mobile GPUs:

AD103 - 175W Max Power Limit

AD104 - 175W Max Power Limit

AD106 - 140W Max Power Limit

This is a drastic increase in the power limits for the desktop and mobile parts. The AD102's 800W power limit is already bonkers but the actual graphics card that utilizes it will end up with a 600W TGP. The AD103 and AD104 GPUs are very similar to each other so the TGP figures are almost the same on mobile and a 50W difference on the desktop segment. The AD106 is in the mainstream 260W segment while the actual graphics cards using it will end up close to 200W TGPs. The mobile parts max out at 175W power limits because that's the best the platform could do in the given area. Anything more would require a major redesign of existing laptops and coolers for them and it looks like most manufacturers don't want to make that extra investment right now.

Based on the power limit differences between the desktop and mobile parts there's once again going to be a huge performance difference between the two NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU segments. But that's only due to the limitations on the mobile platform still we expect to see a major boost when it comes to performance on the mobile side while desktops take things to the next level.

GeForce RTX 4000 series cards codenamed Ada Lovelace could consume 50 to 100 W more than their predecessors across the board with flagship models breaking new ground.

Veteran leaker kopite7kimi who nailed the specifications of Ampere weeks before anyone else has updated his forecasts of Ada Lovelace's power limits. It's important to note that power limits are not the same as TDPs or TBPs; they're an upper bound that only comes into play when overclocking is involved. However they're still a good guideline for power consumption just an overestimate.

Coming to torture our power supplies is the flagship AD102 with a limit of 800W. Going down a level the desktop AD103 has a limit of 450W the AD104 of 400W and the AD106 of 260W. In the past the xx106 has been used by entry-level GPUs and the xx104 by mid-range GPUs but Nvidia could change that up.

As you'd hope the leaked laptop power budgets are tamer. Kopite reports that the mobile versions of the AD103 and AD104 have limits of 175W and the AD106 has a limit of 140W. However because they're laptop parts manufacturers will have a lot of leeway to tweak them anyway.

Back to the numbers you're probably still reeling over: 800W. It's achievable with a pair of the new PCIe 5.0 power connectors which can handle 600W each (if the card used 8-pin power connectors it would need six!). But there aren't very many power supplies with two of those ports and that much power on the market.

Cooling will also be an interesting challenge. But setting those practical concerns aside for a moment is an 800W ceiling that unreasonable for a GPU with 18432 CUDA cores (according to the information from February's hack)?

In its fully unlocked state the AD102 will consume 0.0434W per CUDA core which is only marginally more than the 0.0419W per core consumed by the RTX 3090 Ti. As Steve pointed out in our RTX 3090 Ti review that GPU is a power-hungry monster but theoretically the AD102 is only equally as awful.

And remember 800W is the (probable) hard limit not the TDP. A past report said that Nvidia was testing a 600W TDP for the 4090 that would improve the GPU's efficiency and leave 200W as overclocking headroom.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvY29tcHV0aW5nL2RlbGwteHBzLTg5NTAtZGVza3RvcC1yZXZpZXctbG90cy10by1sb3ZlLWluc2lkZS1hbmQtb3V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dell XPS 8950 Desktop Review: Lots to Love Inside and Out,"8.5 / 10

Design still doesn't live up to XPS laptops

Every year the gap between desktop and laptop performance gets smaller. A laptop will always have the portability advantage and with more workers splitting time between home and the office being able to easily pick up and work anywhere is a plus. Then again more people are working from home full-time and a desktop such as Dell's XPS 8950 might be the best move now.

Joshua Goldman/CNET

Dell revamped its premium XPS desktop for 2022 with a larger chassis that accommodates a greater variety of components. That means this midsize tower gives you room to expand and increase performance down the road -- the biggest benefit of a desktop over a laptop. With a generous port assortment front and back there's no need for a dock or hub. Plus with new power supply and liquid-cooling options the XPS 8950 can be a discreet gaming PC a productivity machine and a content-creation system all in one box.

Dell XPS 8950 Desktop Price as reviewed $1713 CPU 3.7GHz Intel Core i5-12600K Memory 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR5 4800MHz Graphics 8GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Storage 512GB NVMe M.2 PCIe SSD (boot) + 2TB 7200rpm SATA 6Gb/s (storage) Networking Killer Wi-Fi 6 1675 802.11ax Bluetooth 5.2 Connections USB 3.2 Type-A Gen 1 (x2 rear x3 front) USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C (x1 rear x1 front) USB 2.0 Type-A (x2) 3.5mm combo jack 7.1 audio stack gigabit Ethernet SD card slot Operating system Windows 11 Home

The Dell XPS 8950 Desktop starts under $735 but at that price you're paying extra for the case and future upgrade opportunities. (A similarly configured desktop from Dell's Inspiron line is just $588.) Even spending a little more for an XPS configuration around $1000 will get you a much better PC experience. The configuration I tested which is far from fully loaded is available for around $1700. Component options vary by region but a similar configuration is AU$3599 in Australia and £1666 in the UK. But unlike in the US the XPS 8950 configurations in the UK and Australia are not as configurable before they ship.

Get more power

Dell offers a lot of component options for the XPS 8950. A lot. You can choose from 12th-gen Intel Core i5 i7 or i9 processors including unlocked K-series versions of each. There are three Nividia GeForce GTX graphics cards seven RTX cards up to the RTX 3090 and four AMD Radeon options including the RX 6900 XT. It supports up to 128GB of memory. And there are four single-drive and eight dual-drive selections for storage. There are even two case color choices night sky and platinum silver although only the latter comes with little metal feet; the night sky case gets rubber feet.

Liquid cooling can be added to the K-series Intel CPUs for $50. Joshua Goldman/CNET

Regardless of what components you go with if you plan to upgrade the processor or graphics card post-purchase strongly consider maxing out the power supply. Dell offers a 460- 750- and 1000-watt PSU and since it's not a standard size it's best to spend $50 or $100 extra and get more power up front. Also if you go with a K-series processor you can add liquid cooling for $50.

Well connected

Along with the case being overall larger with more room inside than its predecessor the XPS 8950 has a redesigned exterior. The silver version I tested has an aluminum front panel a resin grill and aluminum feet and sides. It definitely looks nicer than the plastic front of the XPS 8940 but it still falls short of the clean streamlined bodies of the XPS laptop line. The front bezel and interior layout is designed to pull air from the front to back across the graphics power supply and M.2 SSD storage. The cooling system is quiet too.

A full complement of audio video and data connections are on the back. Joshua Goldman/CNET

Dell markets the XPS 8950 toward content creators and the port assortment backs that up. The front panel has you covered for quick connections with a headphone jack SD card slot and USB-C and USB-A ports. That continues on the back with 7.1 audio jacks as well as Gigabit Ethernet and USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C for fast data transfers.

It might be tempting to go with a gaming laptop or one made for content creators instead of a desktop. You can certainly get models that can rival desktop performance. But if you honestly don't need portability you really are better off with a desktop such as the XPS 8950. You can get it configured for your performance needs even if that includes video and photo editing and gaming. It's also a solid pick if you're looking for something somewhat compact and attractive that can start out with a more modest configuration and be built out as your needs change. It's the flexibility you won't get with a smaller Mac Mini-type computer or an all-in-one but not so big you'll lose a bunch of floor or desk space to it.

There is no question that this is still a high-quality premium product which you can already see when looking at the price of 3000 Euros (~$3135). However in the test the multimedia laptop also shows a couple of weaknesses that slightly mar the overall impression.

In our opinion the largest problem is the performance. While the new Intel processor basically offers decent performance values it doesn't bring any major advantages under constant load compared to the predecessor. But this isn't really Dell's fault since the new Alder Lake CPUs just consume a lot of power. So the best Dell could do is switch to AMD but this is another subject. The graphics performance of the RTX 3050 is also okay by itself but we don't understand why Dell runs the GPU with less power compared to the predecessor further reducing the effective gaming performance as a result. Under combined load the XPS 17 is also unable to shine and the performance isn't quite stable in CPU-intensive games for example. At the same time the XPS 17 isn't particularly quiet under load either. Another problem is the WLAN module since despite using a modern Wi-Fi-6E module the XPS 17 doesn't support any 6-GHz networks at all.

The XPS 17 shines particularly with its extremely accurate-color AdobeRGB panel which makes it especially suited for image processing. However you have to accept some compromises in the performance and despite using the same cooling Dell has slightly reduced the performance of the graphics card compared to last-year's XPS 17 9710.

The case continues to offer a very high-quality workmanship but it is no lightweight at 2.5 kg (~5.5 lb) either. The real highlight is the display since this is one of the last laptops with a real high-quality panel that covers the AdobeRGB standard in contrast to most competitors who jumped on the DCI-P3 bandwagon at this point including the DreamColor displays from HP. While the panel should still be calibrated there are no limitations afterwards.

All in all the XPS 17 continues to be a very good multimedia laptop but Dell has to be careful not to miss the boat compared to the competitors. The MacBook Pro 16 or the ThinkPad X1 Extreme for example already have been using the 16-inch form factor and are just more compact while offering comparable (or even better) performance values. We are curious how Dell will handle this situation in the future. While the well-known designs of the XPS 15 and XPS 17 might still be available for a while we could also imagine that the manufacturer will also reintroduce an XPS 16 to the market in the near future."
O,Realty Income,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L3dhbnQtMTAwMC1pbi1wYXNzaXZlLWluY29tZS1idXktMzM3LXNoYXJlcy1pbi10aGlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want $1000 in Passive Income? Buy 337 Shares in This Dividend Stock,"With a giant portfolio of properties to support its generous dividend this reliable REIT pays you each month.

Shifting from building a nest egg to building your passive income is something you are probably thinking about if you are near or already in retirement. It's a great strategy for making ends meet as you look to supplement your Social Security checks. One name that you might want to consider adding to your portfolio is Realty Income (O -0.78%).

Working in round numbers

When it comes to money it's just easier to work with round numbers like $1000. This way you can simply scale up (or less likely down) to hit the dollar figure you have in mind. On June 14 Realty Income increased its annual dividend to $2.97 per share. So to create $1000 in annual passive income you would need roughly 337 shares at a cost of about $21700 of this industry-leading real estate investment trust (REIT).

You can easily get to $1000 in dividend income with plenty of other stocks but there are a couple of things that set Realty Income apart from the pack. For starters most companies with dividends pay quarterly while Realty Income pays monthly. In fact it has trademarked the name ""The Monthly Dividend Company.""

Receiving a monthly dividend check makes budgeting much easier than trying to spread a quarterly check out over three months. It sounds silly but don't underestimate how comforting it is to know that in roughly 30 days or less you'll see another dividend check hit your account.

But there's more to ""The Monthly Dividend Company"" than just the frequency of the payment. Realty Income is also a Dividend Aristocrat with an impressive 27 consecutive years of annual dividend increases including a string of nearly 100 quarterly hikes. So not only are you getting a monthly paycheck but you are getting reliable annual raises too.

Those increases meanwhile have averaged about 4.4% which sounds low today in the face of rampant inflation. But historically inflation has averaged closer to 3%.

Still some numbers will help. Realty Income estimates that if you had purchased the stock on the last day of 2011 your yield would have been around 5%. Thanks to regular dividend hikes however your yield on a purchase at the end of March 2022 would have been 8.5%. That's the power of slow and steady dividend increases.

An industry leader

With a roughly $39 billion market cap Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT you can buy. Net lease means that the REIT owns single-tenant properties for which the lessees are responsible for most property-level operating costs. Across a large-enough portfolio this is a very low-risk way to invest. Realty Income owns over 11000 properties.

The bulk of its portfolio (78% of rents) is in the retail sector where the buildings are fairly interchangeable and relatively easy to release or sell if there's a vacancy. The rest of the company's assets are largely industrial/warehouse though there is a small ""other"" grouping that accounts for about 6% of rents (this comprises vineyards and a recently added casino). Meanwhile about 10% of the company's rent comes from Europe another fairly recent portfolio shift that opens up a new avenue for long-term growth.

This portfolio rests upon an investment-grade-rated balance sheet so Realty Income has access to relatively cheap debt capital. And given its impressive dividend history and position as a bellwether net lease REIT it is usually afforded a premium stock price. Thus it also tends to have ample access to cheap equity capital too. This lower cost of capital gives Realty Income an edge when it comes to finding and sealing new property deals.

Time to add some passive income

Realty Income's current dividend yield is around 4.6%. Relative to the broader market that's a pretty generous number. To be sure there are other net lease REITs with higher yields. But none of them can boast the combination of benefits that exist here and for many investors paying a premium price to get on board this passive income stream is likely to end up a worthwhile decision over the long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzE5L3dhbnQtcmV0aXJlLWVhcmx5LXVsdHJhLWhpZ2gteWllbGQtZGl2aWRlbmQtc3RvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want to Retire Early? These 5 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks Can Help,"You could be earning money while you sleep. Need I say more?

Retirement doesn't necessarily have to wait until you are in your 60s; working becomes optional as soon as your passive income covers your living expenses.

Buying dividend stocks which make so much money that they give a chunk of their profits on a regular basis to shareholders can eventually build a waterfall of cash that can set you financially free.

So if you're looking to retire as soon as possible consider these ultra-high-yield dividend stocks with solid financials to support their hefty payouts.

1. AT&T: The telecom giant

Dividend yield: 5.7%

AT&T (T 0.53%) is one of only a few wireless carriers in the United States. Its network supports roughly 67.5 million customers who pay their monthly bills like clockwork because smartphones have become a vital part of everyday life for most of them. The company generates more than $160 billion in annual revenue and uses some of that to pay out a quarterly dividend of $0.278 per share that currently yields a whopping 5.7%.

You'll see in the above chart how AT&T recently reduced the dividend a result of AT&T's fresh spinoff of its entertainment assets to form Warner Bros. Discovery. The lower payout also lowers the dividend payout ratio to roughly 40% of free cash flow per management's estimates. That frees up some cash for AT&T to get its debt levels under control as well as giving it the wherewithal to continue raising the dividend going forward. This gives investors plenty of reason to expect those dividend checks to keep coming.

2. Altria: The tobacco king

Dividend yield: 7.9%

Altria Group (MO 0.83%) is the largest tobacco company in the United States. Its history goes back more than 100 years as owner of the best-selling Marlboro brand of cigarettes (at least in the U.S.). It's well known that fewer people are smoking than in previous generations. Still Altria has used its robust pricing power for decades to offset declining cigarette volumes with price increases. That continued profit allows it to consistently grow its dividend to the point where it qualifies as a Dividend King with 52 consecutive annual dividend increases.

Altria spun off its international business as Philip Morris International (the owner of the Marlboro brand outside the U.S.) in 2008 which you can see in the above chart. Still the company has done fine since then steadily growing its operating profits at a mid-single-digit pace over the past 10 years. Investors can enjoy a whopping 7.9% dividend yield covered by Altria's 78% dividend payout ratio.

3. Enbridge: An oil and gas pipeline stalwart

Dividend yield: 6.2%

Enbridge (ENB 0.44%) is one of the largest energy companies in North America. Its primary business is pipelines which carry oil and natural gas from Canada to the Gulf Coast. Pipelines are like toll operators on a highway; they get paid for the traffic or materials that pass through their pipes in Enbridge's case. This has made Enbridge more stable than most oil companies because it's not as dependent on oil and gas prices to profit.

Enbridge's business does nearly $40 billion in annual revenue and the company has paid and raised its dividend in each of the past 26 years. Investors can enjoy a 6.2% yield at the current share price; the payout consumes under 60% of Enbridge's distributable cash flow making the dividend (and its continued growth) sustainable.

4. AbbVie: Pharmaceutical leader

Dividend yield: 4%

AbbVie (ABBV -0.11%) is a pharmaceutical company that was born when it split from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. However you can see how quickly the business has grown in nearly a decade thanks to massive sales from its blockbuster drug Humira which generated more than $20 billion in 2021. Shareholders have enjoyed a 4% dividend yield while management has raised the payout by an average of 17% annually over the past five years.

AbbVie's exclusive rights to Humira in the U.S. expire next year which will likely cause revenue growth to slow as competitors flood the market. AbbVie has moved to develop and acquire assets that could help replace lost business. The dividend payout ratio is just 43% of cash flow so the dividend should be able to endure some short-term turbulence if there is any.

5. Realty Income: The monthly dividend company

Dividend yield: 4.5%

Realty Income (O -0.78%) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) a specific business structure that invests in real estate and shares its cash profits with shareholders as dividends. Realty Income specializes in retail properties; it's a net-lease REIT owning the building and charging its tenants for rent and letting the tenants handle the taxes insurance and maintenance.

Realty Income's tenants are businesses that tend to operate discount services making them recession-proof and reliable tenants. Realty Income's properties generate steady cash flow so much so that it pays shareholders a monthly dividend instead of the quarterly payout that's more common among U.S. companies. It even refers to itself as The Monthly Dividend Company. A Dividend Aristocrat with 28 years of consecutive annual dividend raises investors can take Realty Income's 4.5% yield to the bank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbmR5LWdhcmNpYS1sb25naW5nLXJldHVybi1jdWJhLTIyNTQyMjkyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andy Garcia on Longing to Return to Cuba “Every Day” and Why He Won't: “I've Been Critical of That Regime”,"Andy Garcia is explaining why despite a desire to go back to Cuba he would never return to the country.

In an interview with The New York Times promoting his work on Father of the Bride Garcia spoke about how the film represents the generational divide in Spanish-speaking among Latin families his own daughters getting married around the film’s release and where he drew inspiration from for his character an architect and father of the bride named Billy.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

While discussing the way Billy is an “amalgamation of everybody I’ve ever known” Garcia began to speak about how being a Cuban immigrant and “in our case … political exiles” has shaped his sense of work ethic and identity as an American. When asked whether he longs to return to Cuba the answer is “every day” but the actor says he won’t go back.

“It’s like asking a Jewish person if they’d go back to Nazi Germany” he says. “Everybody has their own personal reason to go and I don’t pass judgment. But I’ve been critical of that regime; if I went they would use it to say ‘See he believes we’re doing the right thing. He’s here vacationing.'”

Garcia goes on to note that it’s not a place where they will “let us in there to do a concert and speak my mind.” He does however recount visiting the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base with Gloria and Emilio Estefan for a concert in 1995 for around 16000 Cuban refugees “in an interim camp.”

“One time the U.S. interests section in Havana invited us — at the time there wasn’t an embassy there — to show my movie The Lost City” Garcia said revealing his 2006 film set in Cuba. “I said ‘Can you guarantee my safety?’ They said ‘We cannot.’ And I said ‘Thanks for the invite.'”

The threat of surveillance according to the Father of the Bride star is what will also keep him away. “I know many people who have gone to Cuba who are in the public eye. The Cuban ones who have gone they’re watched. They have government people following them around.”

Looking at the S&P 500 right now you might be convinced the stock market is destined for doom in 2022.

The benchmark index rose nearly 27% last year. This year it’s already down 22%. Plenty of stocks are deep into correction territory.

Yet JPMorgan’s global head of equity macro research Dubravko Lakos sees a major rebound on the horizon.

“People are basically positioned for a recession. Our base case is that this is not going to be a recession in the next 12 months” Lakos told CNBC earlier this month. “And we think from that angle the portfolios are wrong footed.”

Lakos reiterated a year-end price target of 4900 for the S&P 500. Since the index sits at 3736 today his target implies a potential upside of around 31%.

If you’re aligned with Lakos and are looking ahead to a potential reversal here’s three stocks JPMorgan finds particularly attractive right now.

Smartsheet (SMAR)

This work-management platform helps companies implement organize and automate their processes. Smartsheet says its application is used by more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies.

And business is growing. In the fiscal quarter ended April 30 revenue surged 44% year over year to $168.3 million driven by a 44% increase in subscription revenue.

Notably Smartsheet’s dollar-based net retention rate was a solid 133%.

But the stock is far from being a hot commodity. Year to date shares are down a painful 61%. That could give contrarian investors something to think about.

Last week JPMorgan analyst Pinjalim Bora reiterated an “overweight” rating on Smartsheet. While Bora also lowered his price target from $80 to $58 the new target is still 96% above where the stock sits today.

Microsoft (MSFT)

Tech stocks are getting dumped in this market downturn. Even mega-cap behemoths like Microsoft aren’t immune to the bearish sentiment.

The stock has tumbled 26% in 2022.

But business remains on the right track. In the March quarter Microsoft’s revenue grew 18% year over year to $49.4 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $2.22 per share up 9% from the year-ago period.

Story continues

The tech gorilla is also returning a massive amount of cash to investors. For the quarter Microsoft’s dividends and share buybacks totaled $12.4 billion representing a 25% increase year over year.

JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy recently raised his price target on Microsoft to $320 while maintaining a “buy” rating. That implies a potential upside of 30%.

Eli Lilly (LLY)

This American pharmaceutical giant commands more than $270 billion in market cap with products marketed in 120 countries around the world.

Unlike the other two names on this list Eli Lilly is not a beaten-down stock.

In Q1 Eli Lilly delivered 15% revenue growth driven by a 20% growth in volume. The company paid nearly $900 million in dividends and spent $1.5 billion on buybacks during the quarter.

Shares are actually up 7% so far in 2022 and JPMorgan expects the trend to continue.

On June 1 analyst Chris Schott reiterated an “overweight” rating on Eli Lilly while raising his price target from $340 to $355.

Considering that shares trade at around $291 apiece right now the new price target implies a potential upside of 22%.

Learn about some of the pros and cons of this treatment option the auto settings wireless connection and whether it is the right model for you.

New Design and Features of ResMed’s AirSense 10 CPAP

The AirSense 10 has a sleek new design appearing much like a modern alarm clock with its bright and easily readable display. The integrated clear humidifier chamber slides easily into place on the right side. At the opposite end the filter flap and data card are both accessible. The tubing either ​heated or standard connects at the center of the back with a rotating fixture.

One of the biggest changes with the AirSense 10 compared to the S9 model is the wireless capability. There is an internal modem that can wirelessly connect to a local cell tower. This allows data to be shared with your durable medical equipment provider to document compliance. Your physician can also access it to make pressure adjustments remotely. To eliminate electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure the wireless can be turned off by placing the device in airplane mode (though the display will often prompt you to turn it back on).

The device can be ordered as an AutoSet allowing the machine to sense whether you continue to experience airway collapse with the ability to respond by increasing the pressure within a preset prescribed range of options. The Expiratory Pressure Relief (EPR) can add comfort by making it easier to breathe out with a briefly lowered pressure.

Humidifier and Heated Tubing Controls Can Be Automated

The heated humidifier and climate line tubing can be manually or automatically controlled. The humidifier allows settings from 1 to 8 when turned on. The heated tubing temperature can be set from 60 to 86 degrees. This may need to be optimized based on your needs which depend on personal preference as well as your climate and bedroom temperature. The automatic mode takes over these controls and seems to work well.

One of the drawbacks of the AirSense 10 is the design of the water chamber itself. It has a very low profile and seems to contain less water than the S9 model. This may encourage nightly cleaning and refills. It also contributes to unintentional spills out the end if it is overfilled. It also seems to fit less snugly as it is repeatedly taken out and replaced. This may lead to some air leak and noise if it is not replaced properly. If you prefer an end cap can be placed without humidifier use.

Pros and Cons of the New AirSense 10 CPAP Machine

There are a few other pros to the AirSense 10 CPAP to consider. It is extremely quiet hardly making any noise with a proper mask seal. The same filters standard tubing and masks can be used as were used with the S9 device. The heated tubing differs in design and is not interchangeable. It comes with a nice quality bag for travel with convenient pockets and compartments. This bag may be slightly small if you use a large full-face mask. There is an option to turn on supply reminders that appear on the display to keep you on schedule for equipment replacement. There is an automatic ramp function that is able to detect the regularity of breathing and turns itself up once it notes a transition toward a sleep-associated pattern.

When comparing it to the prior model a few drawbacks also come to mind. The power cable differs so the old one won’t function as an extra if you upgrade your device. The machine itself is slightly wider especially when comparing just the blower component of the device. This makes it a little less friendly for compact travel. It tips over a little more easily with the hose lifting up the back and shifting the device forward. When placing the climate line tubing there isn’t the loud click that was present before but it should be evident that it is securely in place (especially if you review the temperature settings).

There is a standard version of the AirSense 10 and also a “for Her” model. The latter is slightly more feminine in color with neutral tones rather than black and has a leaf pattern imprinted on it. It also functions slightly differently with the ability to increase the pressure in response to subtle changes in the airway as may more commonly occur in women with sleep apnea.

Considering the Pricing and Insurance Coverage

Finally it is always important to consider the price of these devices when looking at upgrading. In general most insurance (including Medicare) will pay 80% to 90% of the cost of the device every five years. Fortunately ResMed has maintained the pricing as the same as the prior S9 model. Therefore if you are given the option you may consider the pros and cons of these past few models and select the one that best fits your needs.

However the Woodbury-based company has found it also must offer rich — and creative — benefits.

So its 350 headquarters workers now receive unlimited mental health counseling for themselves and their families. Plus they get Fridays off during the summer free tattoos waxing and gym memberships. And if employees read a book and turn in a report to executives they can get $50 to $200.

In Minnetonka family-owned King Technology will soon spend more than $1 million buying and renovating a nearby building so the pool and spa water treatment company's 70 workers can have more space adjustable desks a bigger fitness center airy windows access to Lone Lake Park and for the first time a food market.

In Alexandria Minn. the growing aluminum extrusion firm Alexandria Industries has 60 job openings. In April the company boosted factory wages by $2 an hour. It also recently cut employee medical premiums nearly in half and offered its 561 workers $2000 ""referral bonuses"" for each new hire they bring to the company.

""There is more. We've thrown the book at this"" said spokeswoman Patty Hoffman whose company faced a tight workforce before the pandemic and an even more competitive landscape now.

Like Alexandria Industries and Anytime Fitness more employers are pressing the accelerator on wage hikes and strong benefits designed to retain workers and woo new ones as they grapple with the Great Resignation historically low unemployment and high job vacancies that recently breached a record 214000 positions in Minnesota.

Last week employment services firm Robert Half Inc. found that 41% of workers in Minneapolis plan to look for a new job. In Minnesota — and nationally — labor officials report there are now two job openings for every unemployed person.

""It's just crazy"" and it puts a lot of pressure on employers said Jim Link chief human resources officer of the 316000-member Society for Human Resource Management.

Minnesota employers have raised wages by 3.4% on average over the past year the state said last week. They also are adding more benefit perks flexible work options and a new category of ""worker lifestyle"" enhancements so people will join and stay on board Link said.

Some perks even extend to pets.

""I don't think there is a business in Minnesota today that is not rethinking every element of what they offer an employee to make themselves an attractive place to work"" said Steve Grove commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. ""Workers are in the driver's seat.""

SHRM found that workers want higher raises than many employers can afford. Employers are trying to make up the difference with benefit enhancements and lifestyle perks such as flexible hours and help with elder or child care Link said.

Chuck Runyon CEO and co-founder of Anytime Fitness' parent firm Self Esteem Brands said his company has consistently had a strong culture.

""Now we are going to take it to another level"" he said. ""Employees have more leverage than they ever had before. They can literally choose to work anywhere.""

And employers can choose how they respond to the pressures. Runyon chooses to use it as inspiration for a better workplace.

At Anytime Fitness many of its franchised gyms were shut down temporarily in 2020 because of COVID-19 restrictions. The parent company saw revenue plunge nearly 30% and laid off 80 workers.

The business recovered staff was rehired and annual revenue rebounded to $2 billion. But its recovery coincided with what people are calling the Great Resignation as a crunch for workers means its harder to both keep and hire staff.

Self Esteem Brands hired 44 workers this year and needs about 35 more by the end of the year Runyon estimates. It has put aside roughly 1% of net revenue for the wellness personal and professional development of its 700 employees half of whom work in Woodbury.

""We don't see it as a cost or expense. At the end of the day we see this as an investment in our team that grows the business. If they are growing the business will grow"" Runyon said.

An Anytime Fitness worker got a free tattoo during the company’s annual meeting in November 2021.

Benefits include subsidizing college expenses offering free wellness classes nutrition coaching and mental health counseling in addition to health insurance and a 401(k) match.

But Runyon said he believes that smaller things can also make a big difference. The book report is to motivate workers to keep learning. And then there's the free wellness coaching the tattoos the waxing.

""It's just those little things that show 'We want you to grow. We care about you and we want to nudge you to your best performance'"" Runyon said.

Like many corporations Self Esteem Brands now offers hybrid work options with office workers on campus two days a week. It also has no meetings on Wednesdays so employees can focus on deep-thought projects. It also has no work Fridays for the summer.

Other employers have their own recipe to retain workers. Installed Building Products like several corporations is offering subsidized emergency child care services.

King Technology started offering workers subsidized ""Legal Shield"" and identification theft protection services during the pandemic and decided that it would greatly expand its fitness center in its new building in Minnetonka said co-owner Alex King.

The firm also brings in chair massage services and is shifting to a ""Flex Hours"" program so workers can take off every other Friday.

""There are things we are investing in that are very important and that are helping get people in the door. But ultimately this is about our vision and mission and our enriching lives daily"" King said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvcm9iZXJ0LWRlLW5pcm8tYWwtcGFjaW5vLXJldW5pdGUtdGhlLWdvZGZhdGhlci01MHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXNjcmVlbmluZy10cmliZWNhLWZpbG0tZmVzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert De Niro Al Pacino Reunite for The Godfather 50th Anniversary at Tribeca Film Festival,"Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are still repping the family business half a century later.

The screen legends reunited Thursday for a 50th anniversary screening of The Godfather at United Palace hosted by the Tribeca Film Festival which De Niro 78 co-founded in 2002 to revive the cultural scene of lower Manhattan in the wake of 9/11.

Pacino 82 and author Michael Hainey participated in a discussion about the seminal mafia title from director Francis Ford Coppola before Tribeca screened the film's restoration.

De Niro and Pacino previously joined Coppola 83 onstage at the 94th Academy Awards where the iconic director reflected on his magnum opus' milestone anniversary.

""I feel moments like this should be sincere and brief"" he said turning to De Niro and Pacino. ""And I'm so grateful for my wonderful friends to come here to help me celebrate with you.

""This project that we began 50 years ago with really the most extraordinary collaborators many of them legends and so many of them that I can't take the time to list them all but you know them all well. So I'm going to only thank two from the bottom of my heart"" Coppola added.

Pacino told The New York Times that he's been ""deeply honored"" to see the film's lasting acclaim over the past 50 years while musing on the anniversary.

""It's a piece of work that I was so fortunate to be in. But it's taken me a lifetime to accept it and move on"" Pacino said in March. ""It's not like I played Superman.""

The Academy Award winner added that he's ""surprised"" when people tell him they've never seen the movie adding: ""They've heard about it. You get that. 'Oh I heard — were you in that? That was a film wasn't it?'""

The Godfather tells the story of the Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) as his youngest son Michael (Pacino) joins the mafia and tries to juggle the violent family business with his marriage to wife Kay (Diane Keaton).

The film which is based on screenwriter Mario Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name has been widely regarded as one of the best films of all time since it premiered in 1972. It won three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay in addition to nominations for Coppola and Pacino.

Many who realized they were unfulfilled or undercompensated decided to leave their posts sparking what has become known as the “Great Resignation.”

As employees sought increased levels of flexibility and improved work-life balance employers found themselves faced with two options: adapt to accommodate the changing needs of their workforce or risk a mass migration that could potentially leave them scrambling to fill positions.

To find out which small midsize and large companies did a great job navigating these tumultuous times according to their associates employee engagement platform Energage reached out to New Jersey-based employers with 50 or more employees and surveyed staff members to determine the state’s Top Workplaces. Public and private companies nonprofit organizations and government entities were eligible. This is the fourth year of the initiative which is run in partnership with NJ.com and Jersey’s Best.

Bob Helbig media partnerships director of Pennsylvania-based Energage explained that a free overview of results from the Top Workplaces survey is provided to employers. This data can help employers assess their company’s health as findings validate achievements reveal problem areas and assist in establishing a foundation for new goals.

“We invited 6197 companies to participate and have surveyed 149 of them” Helbig said. “The surveyed companies employ 79661 people in New Jersey; 42498 New Jersey employees have received surveys and 20135 have responded — double last year’s figure.”

And what was the universal theme among respondents? Based on results it’s fair to say 2021 was a year of reflection.

“People were asking ‘Is this really what I want to be doing with my life?’ "" said Lisa Black director of data science at Energage.

Family First Funding LLC (midsize No. 3) has spent four consecutive years on the Top Workplaces list. Photo courtesy of Family First Funding LLC

Because the first half of 2020 was dominated by uncertainty in the job market as the pandemic sparked widespread layoffs people wanted psychological safety in 2020 and avoided looking for new opportunities.

“People were happy to have a job” Black said.

But in 2021 many workers decided that if their employers were calling them back to the office they no longer wanted to commute or they didn’t want to give up the flexibility of working from home Black added.

At Toms River-based Family First Funding LLC (midsize No. 3) which has spent four consecutive years on the Top Workplaces list in the midsize category (150-499 employees) the “f” word — flexibility — is cherished by employees.

“We all work as a team and not against each other” said an anonymous survey respondent. “I do not feel overworked and can balance work and family life so much better than before. I truly appreciate being part of the FFF Family.”

Chad Barris branch manager and loan officer noted that Family First Funding is consistently a Top Workplace because of the “positive company culture bold mission to help others and passion for providing exceptional service.

“We are more than just a workplace; we are a family. I have been in the business for almost 20 years and this company is by far the best place I have ever worked at” Barris said.

Its commitment to employee satisfaction has enabled SWK Technologies Inc. (midsize #2) to land on the Top Workplaces list in 2022. Photo courtesy of SWK Technologies Inc

That same commitment to employee satisfaction enabled SWK Technologies Inc. (midsize No. 2) which also made the Top Workplaces list in the midsize category to “come out of the two-year challenge stronger than ever” according to Selya Stone chief human resource officer. Stone shared how the business management software and IT solutions provider accomplished that feat.

“The nature of the economy over the past two years has been painfully unpredictable” Stone said. “Instead of chasing market data or trends we chose to focus on our employees. We delved deep into our ocean of culture from where our success has always risen. What we found was a well-poised group of people more enthusiastic to work closer together than ever to support each other our customers and our communities.”

An employee at SWK Technologies echoed those sentiments when explaining why they loved their job. “I am able to suggest ideas and projects and execute them to make the company better. I have a great team of people who are excellent in their jobs. We set goals and achieve them. It is very exciting!”

Finding Meaning in Helping Others

Responses from surveyed employees in New Jersey were in line with the rest of the nation when it came to the strong desire to find meaning and fulfillment in their work.

As the pandemic brought on an array of health-related concerns employees in the caregiving sector saw their value and impact daily.

Named among the Top Workplaces in the large company category (500 or more employees) for the third consecutive year Bridgeway Senior Healthcare (large No. 2) is proud to be one of the few family-owned and -operated health care providers in the state.

“In our organization our mission is to care for people like family in communities that feel like home — and this applies to our residents patients and employees alike” said Director of Business Development and Strategy Jessica Pelligrino Tsoukalas a third-generation family member-owner. “Health care is a particularly challenging field these days but we are grateful for our amazing staff and employees who contribute to making Bridgeway one of the top senior living and care companies in the state.”

“I feel like I make a difference daily” stated one of the Bridgewater-based employees in the survey’s comment section.

An employee at MTF Biologics (large No. 4) named to the list in the large company category for the third year in a row also noted the importance of helping others. “To have the ability to be part of a foundation that saves and heals lives every day is priceless” the respondent said.

Joe Yaccarino CEO of MTF Biologics added “This is a survey of our employees and it speaks to the importance that we place on employee engagement and satisfaction. We strive to constantly improve the experience of working at MTF Biologics where everyone on our team is part of saving and healing lives!”

Working as a Team

One area where employees nationwide expressed more positive sentiment in 2021 was inclusiveness.

Marty McGann owner of Red Bank-based financial services firm PCI (small No. 1) said he’s “overjoyed” to see the company make its debut as a Top Workplace in New Jersey within the small company category (50 to 149 employees).

“We thrive on creating a comfortable culture for our employees encouraging creativity collaboration and growth” he said.

AnnieMac CEO and Founder Joseph Panebianco noted that beyond all the new branches tools and programs the company has acquired its most valuable resource remains its employees whose responses saw the residential mortgage lender named to the list in the large company category for the second consecutive year.

“We wouldn’t be who or where we are without the hard work and dedication of the AnnieMac (large No. 1) family so knowing that we continue to provide them with a perfect place to work to learn and grow fills me with pride” Panebianco said. “I am truly thankful for our entire team’s dedication because we are just as dedicated to their success and fulfillment as they are.”

An anonymous employee described their feelings about the company this way: “AnnieMac changed my life and I get to change others’ lives in the process.”

Areas that Need Improvement

While the views of New Jersey’s surveyed employees were mostly in line with those of workers nationwide Garden Staters are far less positive when it comes to compensation and benefits.

Helbig said given the cost of living and inflation this isn’t surprising. Additionally he noted that it’s rare to find an employee who wouldn’t appreciate an increase in pay.

With competition to hire and retain talent increasing the distinction of being named to the list of Top Workplaces carries weight as employees seek out companies recognized as leaders that operate by a strong set of values.

“Companies need to authentically represent their brand to job seekers” said Eric Rubino CEO of Energage. “The employee experience needs to be on the mission-critical list. Leaders who embrace a people-first culture will benefit greatly. By giving employees a voice and showcasing your authentic culture through employer branding organizations can attract those job seekers who complement their culture. Culture drives performance.”

Helbig said he commends employers for not only being brave enough to ask their employees for feedback but also for listening to their staff members’ concerns and then implementing changes to enhance employee satisfaction.

“Companies really earn their way on to this list” he said.

The following are 88 companies named to New Jersey’s Top Workplaces list as nominated by their employees and evaluated by Energage based on questionnaires answered by their employees. They’re broken down by size and ranking.

Design plans are underway as the company hopes to open in the fall of 2023.

The Stark County Regional Planning Commission recently gave conditional approval for a 6897-square-foot building fuel canopy and patio on the east side of Erie Avenue/Rt. 21.

Ryan Balko engineer and project manager told the Planning Commission the company is in a period of growth and continues to seek new locations in Northeast Ohio where they believe Sheetz can be successful.

The new site will do well because of its proximity to existing stores and its proximity to U.S. Route 30 and state Route 21 Balko told the commission.

It will include a new prototype building with a drive-thru and fuel canopy as well as high-flow diesel pumps for truck fueling.

New business:Chick-fil-A 'actively pursuing' site for city's first location

The Planning Commission gave conditional approval to the project while seeking additional conditions before giving the final OK. Sheetz must provide final construction plans that include grading and utilities as well as a stormwater management report.

The commission also wants additional information about improvements to Erie Street and Ortt Road SW.

Sheetz officials did not return calls seeking comment for this story.

Perry Township Fiscal Officer Craig Chessler said the township will see a financial benefit via the state's gas tax as it does for other stations.

Ohio motorists pay a 0.385-cent tax for each gallon of regular fuel and 0.47-cent tax for each gallon of diesel fuel. The tax money received by Perry Township is used to fund Road Department projects such as paving he added.

""With the last state budget there was an increase in the tax and we have seen a larger amount of revenue that we have used for road projects"" Chessler said.

More about Sheetz

Based in Altoona Pa the family-owned convenience store got its start in 1952 when Bob Sheetz purchased one of his father's five dairy stores.

In 1963 the second store opened. By 1972 the company doubled in size expanding to 14 stores. Later that year gas pumps were added and self-serve gasoline was introduced to Central Pennsylvania according to the company's website.

More:$500000 remodel of Ross Dress for Less store began in April at Massillon Marketplace

Today there are Sheetz stores in six states including Pennsylvania Ohio Maryland North Carolina Virginia and West Virginia.

The new store along state Route 21 will be the 60th Sheetz in the state. Stark County has five with one in Perry Township at 5057 Tuscarawas St. W and others in Alliance Hartville Jackson Township and North Canton.

SR 21 corridor becoming hub of development

Perry Township has seen interest from businesses along the state Route 21 corridor.

A new Auto Zone store is being built near the proposed Sheetz site.

""I do see it coming to fruition what had been predicted 20 years ago in a transportation study that the area would become an up-and-coming area for development"" Chessler said. ""With Henderickson and Tractor Supply's facilities it is starting to fulfill that expectation.""

Tractor Supply is building a 900000-square-foot distribution center at the former Stark County Farm in Navarre. The warehouse is expected to create about 375 new jobs.

In 2019 Hendrickson USA built a 180000-square-foot facility an expansion of Hendrickson’s Canton operation at Prospect Park. Suspension systems and components for tractor-trailers are manufactured at the facility that is expected to employ about 300.

The “Aquaman” star was spotted shopping at discount department store TJ Maxx in the Hamptons on Thursday.

Sources told The Post in early June that the 36-year-old actress is “broke” due to hefty legal fees associated with her and Depp’s bombshell trial — and that was before she was ordered her to pay millions for defamatory statements.

When asked if the actress had the means to cover the judgment handed down by the jury her lawyer Elaine Bredehoft said “Oh no absolutely not.”

Still Heard was shopping at the TJ Maxx in Bridgehampton NY — where the average home goes for around $3.8 million according to Zillow — so she probably isn’t maxing out her credit cards at the big box chain.

Pictures taken by a sneaky shopper show Heard wearing jeans and an oversized white button-down T-shirt while looking at clothes.

Sources told The Post in early June that the 36-year-old actress is “broke” due to hefty legal fees associated with her and Depp’s bombshell trial.

She was accompanied by her sister Whitney Henriquez who has been by her side throughout the trial and testified on her behalf.

It’s not clear what if anything Heard bought at TJ Maxx.

Multiple sources have told the Post that Heard was relying on her homeowner’s insurance policy to cover the cost of her attorneys.

Depp sued Heard for $50 million after she wrote that she became a “public figure representing domestic abuse” in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed and won all three of his defamation claims against her. Heard meanwhile won only one of three defamation claims she made against the “Pirates of the Caribbean” in a $100 million countersuit.

Her net worth has been estimated at between $1.5 million and $2.5 million according to the Celebrity Net Worth site and other outlets — a far cry from what she owes Depp.

Court testimony revealed that Heard was paid $1 million for 2018’s “Aquaman” and another $2 million for the sequel which will premiere next year. Her role in that movie has been significantly reduced.

Heard also never made good on her promise to donate the $7 million she received from Depp in their 2016 divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.",,,,,,,,,

The author in her stateroom. Joey Hadden/Insider

Because most cruise ship staterooms are meant to hold at least two people booking a room by yourself often means you still have to pay higher prices that are equivalent to two people. According to Cruise Critic this is because most cruise ships don't have solo cabins that are meant for just one person. Some do but it's not common. For example mine didn't.

The listed rates for my ship were per person not per room when I booked my cruise. But when switching between one and two guests in my search the cost per person doubled when I had just one person selected. This is known as paying a ""single supplement"" as it helps the cruise line make up for the lost revenue that would have come from having a second person on board according to the LA Times.

For $2000 I got an ocean-view stateroom to myself. It would have cost about half the price per person if I had brought someone with me.

Insider paid for the room per the company's reporting standards.

We are sailing through the Bay of Biscay today a patch of sea that has been feared by sailors for hundreds of years. Due to its exposure to the open Atlantic waters the bay often encounters treacherous weather conditions and swells making ports inaccessible.

While we did not encounter treacherous seas like many unlucky sailors in the past the sea was far from calm and the weather was quite dreary throughout the day. There was no rain but was quite cloudy and chilly outside. I'm hoping we encounter more sunlight later on in this cruise!

Despite traveling west the ship's time shifted one hour forward today to match with Spain and France's time zone. I took it easy this morning with a small breakfast at Cafe @ Two70 while catching up on blogging.

I had reserved a 12PM lunch at Jamie's Italian on this cruise so I was looking forward to a delicious Italian meal! While I plan to eat primarily at complimentary dining venues on this cruise I did treat myself and my friend Samantha to lunch at Jamie's with onboard credit I received when booking the sailing.

Jamie's Italian is my favorite Royal Caribbean specialty restaurant and we ordered quite a few dishes to try. Starting our meal was the black truffle arancini ultimate garlic bread and burrata.

For the main course I ordered my go-to dish of eggplant parmagiana and penne pomodoro. Samantha loved her baked lasagne and truffle tagliatelle.

I was far too full so I took my dessert (Amalfi lemon cheesecake) to go!

The meal was fairly quick with us in and out in a little over an hour. The food was up to par (and maybe even a bit better) with Jamie's Italian on other ships and our server Ronald was fantastic!

Funny enough Jamie Oliver himself was onboard Anthem of the Seas for the day yesterday to work with the staff on training and quality! It definitely paid off as the meal was delightful.

After lunch I decided to test my luck with my Crown & Anchor Society free play money at the casino. I quickly turned $8 into $30 but I am not much of a gambler so I decided to cash out my winnings instead of losing it all.

Following today's (extra large) winnings I took a walk around the pool deck to get some air. I fully expected the pool deck to be nearly empty so I was extremely surprised to see a ton of guests ""sunbathing"" under the cloudy skies!

I've never seen so many guests on the pool deck during a dreary weather day in the Caribbean so it was fun to see the cultural differences in attitude toward far from ideal weather.

After a few rounds of cards in the Solarium we attended an afternoon ""Where in the World?"" trivia session at Schooner Bar. We were given a series of clues in order to guess where in the world the trivia host was describing. To my surprise we did pretty well!

After such a large lunch at Jamie's Italian we decided to skip the Main Dining Room in favor of a lighter meal at Solarium Bistro.

Solarium Bistro is a Mediterranean-inspired complimentary restaurant served buffet style (with main dishes ordered via a menu). From hummus to falafel grilled vegetables and salmon it hit the spot for a quick dinner. Not many people even know this restaurant exists so it was relatively empty.

This evening's festivities first brought us to karaoke in Boleros followed by tonight's big band jazz performance in Two70. I love jazz music and Royal Caribbean always has amazing big band jazz performances so I was excited to check it out.

Tonight's performance definitely did not disappoint and it has been my favorite entertainment thus far onboard. Samantha and I were both in jazz band throughout high school so we are total geeks when it comes to jazz music! From the musicians' excellent improvising skills to watching guests dance to the tunes it was a wonderful way to end our second day on Anthem of the Seas.

Tomorrow we are docked in La Rochelle France!

Stray observations:

There was a Titanic staircase backdrop for formal night photos tonight.

There are no chairs on the promenade deck aside from the smoking area. Usually there are chairs to sit and watch the view but I haven't seen any on this ship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGUtNzA5NzYx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Onboard 'Wonder of the Seas' the world's largest cruise ship,"It’s not every day a larger-than-life over-the-top Mad Hatter strolls up to your dining table as you’re brushing water on an empty whiteboard on which a menu appears as if by magic.

But this is Wonderland one of 11 specialty restaurants onboard Royal Caribbean International’s (RCI) record-breaking new ship Wonder of the Seas. The service in Wonderland is impeccable and the presentation akin to something out of a fairytale. Diners declare the food divine. And because the kitchen has details of your special food requirements ahead of time the dishes are tailor-made to suit.

Dining options at sea

There are excellent eateries throughout the ship’s eight neighborhoods: Mexican Southern US Japanese Italian and many others. If you don’t want to pay the extra for a specialty dining experience the ship’s main dining areas offer excellent buffet and waiter-service options. (If you keep kosher make sure to let RCI know well ahead of time.)

Between meals there are cafés and food stations all over for quick snacks and coffee breaks. And there is a plethora of bars dotted around the decks. You can choose to drink sundowners at the cantilevered Vue Bar sample an Old Fashioned in the Rising Tide a bar that gently rises and falls through the decks or even sip a Bloody Mary in the Bionic Bar which is a marvel of modern technology where guests watch in awe as their drinks are made to order with precision and flair by robots.

But of course food and drink are not the only reasons to sail on Wonder. The ship is a veritable leisure wonderland. There are endless dining options onboard the Royal Caribbean International’s (RCI) record-breaking new ship Wonder of the Seas (credit: MarkDavidPod)

Fun for all ages

There’s something for every guest type: groups couples singles and families. Play areas abound for the young – splash pools adorned with myriad water features. There are areas just for teens too.

Slides on board aren’t just for the kids. It’s a brave person who takes on the heart-pumping Ultimate Abyss – a 10-story test of courage on the tallest slide at sea. Talking of brave the zip-line crosses nine decks in the air above the Central Park neighborhood thankfully with lots of staff on hand to make sure safety comes first. Budding surfers can try to stay upright on the FlowRider and there is also laser tag and an escape room to while away the day.

For the slightly less adventurous mini-golf table tennis a sports court a carousel and many more activities are on board to say nothing of the exercise classes trivia quizzes and spa facilities.

The entertainment is world-class with Vegas- and Broadway-style shows on stage ice air and water. If you’ve previously sailed with RCI you’ll know about the high-quality acts but the new AquaTheater Show inTENse takes diving high-wire acrobatics and synchronized swimming to the next level. There are always musical performances to catch somewhere on board – Country Latin Irish and many others. And if you fancy yourself as a crooner there’s always Karaoke. There is something for everyone to enjoy onboard Royal Caribbean International’s (RCI) record-breaking new ship Wonder of the Seas (credit: MarkDavidPod)

It’s also both a great place to meet new friends and get away from the crowds. People are usually friendly and happy to chat dine together or share a bottle of wine. Perhaps the friendliest people are the multinational crew who greet you with large genuine smiles at every turn. However if you are looking for peace and quiet the huge solarium is adults only and offers dining a bar whirlpools and plenty of lounging options.

Wonder of the Seas is the fifth vessel to enter service in RCI’s Oasis class. The company says an Oasis ship “packs more adventure into one week” than any other vacation. That’s a bold statement. But Wonder is crammed full with enough thrills entertainment drink and relaxation offerings to suit any traveler.

Wonder is immense. It is nearly 365 m. long and more than three times larger than the Queen Elizabeth 2. To put the dimensions into context “if you complete 2.4 circuits of the jogging track that’s more than a mile” says Lucy from the RCI press team.

The stats speak for themselves: 6980 guests 18 decks 24 guest elevators 2867 staterooms 2300 crew and so much more. Bigger in every way.

Onboard though you don’t necessarily feel the size. The ship is divided into eight neighborhoods – with adult-only spaces a fun-filled boardwalk and the delightful Central Park with its upscale restaurants wine bar and bountiful greenery. And with a ship this size you don’t feel the movement of the sea.

This summer the ship is offering seven-day Western Mediterranean sailings out of Barcelona and Rome. At the end of October there’s a 14-day transatlantic cruise followed by week-long Caribbean cruises many including stops at RCI’s private island Perfect Day at CocoCay.

While RCI’s Rhapsody of the Seas is sailing out of Haifa this summer the company knows Israelis love to cruise and many will be tempted to hop on a short flight and join Wonder from Spain or Italy. As many as 20000 Israelis are expected to sail with RCI in 2022 alone.

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor. The couple has an adult son and three lively dogs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpZ2hlaGFtaWx0b24uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvYW50b25pby1mb250ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antonio S.

Salesforce a company known for its cloud-based business functionality software for customer relationship management is embracing the world of Web3 with the inauguration of its NFT Cloud. With a pilot of the new platform launching last week Salesforce customers will now be able to use the virtual space to mint manage and sell NFTs.

As per the platform’s official site the NFT Cloud will enhance customer experiences in three ways with the first being through bridging physical and digital experiences to engage communities in ways which were unavailable in the Web2 realm. This will include IRL events of the NFT-gated variety which is a concept that is becoming ever-more prevalent across the industry.

The second is improving customer loyalty through digital assets as customers will be able to mint on-brand NFTs on the platform which they can then keep or sell on. The third and final avenue of customer experience enhancement is the NFT Cloud’s ability to build trust and sustainably as audits and data collection can be securely conducted through leveraging smart contract technology.

Although a full launch date for the platform hasn’t been confirmed a company spokesperson had this to say about its pilot release: “Salesforce NFT Cloud has been made official starting its pilot phase in June 2022. The aim is for customers to drive an entirely new breed of communities a shift from being a customer to an audience and now to a true community due to the element of ownership. Salesforce have thought this through carefully. NFT Cloud will go to market with trust and sustainability two of Salesforce’s core values by design”.

With regards to the sustainability ethos of the company and in line with its net zero emissions commitment the NFT Cloud pilot will automatically calculate the carbon emissions each user emits when using the platform which they will then be able to offset through trusted high-quality carbon credits. It will also be collaborating with organisations such as the ‘Crypto Climate Accord’ to develop sustainability in the Web3 space.

This explicit dive into Web3 from Salesforce wouldn’t come as much surprise to those who’ve stayed up to date with the company’s blockchain interest and activity as last month it published an article on the necessity for businesses to have a Web3 strategy whilst it also added a ‘Web3: The Future of the Internet’ module to its Trailhead learning site.

At age 45 Chris Downey had pretty much constructed the life he'd always wanted. An architect with a good job at a small housing firm outside San Francisco he was happily married with a 10-year-old son. He was an assistant little league coach and avid cyclist and then - doctors discovered a tumor in his brain. He had surgery and the tumor was safely gone but Downey was left completely blind.

As we first reported in early 2019 what he has done in the decade and a half since losing his sight -- as a person and as an architect -- can only be described as a different kind of vision.

Chris Downey with correspondent Lesley Stahl

Several mornings a week as the sun rises over the Oakland estuary in California an amateur rowing team works the water. It's hard to tell which one of them is blind. And Chris Downey thinks that's just fine.

Chris Downey: It's really exciting to be in a sport where nobody looks in the direction they're going. You face this way in the boat and you're going that way. (LAUGH) So okay even-steven. (LAUGH)

It's not exactly even-steven in this design meeting where Downey is collaborating with sighted architects on a new hospital building. But he hasn't let that stop him.

Lesley Stahl: Here you are in a profession that basically requires you to read— read designs and draw designs. You must've thought in your head ""That is insurmountable?""

Chris Downey: No. I never thought—

Lesley Stahl: You never thought— you never thought the word ""insurmountable?""

Chris Downey: Lots of people— (LAUGH) friends that were architects and anybody else would say ""Oh my God it's the worst thing imaginable to be an architect and to lose your sight. I can't imagine anything worse."" But I quickly came to realize that— the creative process is an intellectual process. It's how you think so I just needed new tools.

New tools? Downey found a printer that could emboss architectural drawings so that he could read and understand through touch.

Chris Downey: They look like normal prints normal drawings on the computer. But then they just come out in tactile form.

Lesley Stahl: So it is like Braille isn't it?

Chris Downey: Right.

And he came up with a way to ""sketch"" his ideas onto the plans using a simple children's toy — malleable wax sticks that he shapes to show his modifications to others. And he says something surprising started to happen. He could no longer see buildings and spaces but he began hearing them.

Chris Downey: The sounds the textures. And the sound changes because there's a canopy overhead.

Lesley Stahl: You can sense that we're under a canopy?

Chris Downey: Yes. It's all a matter of how the sound works from the tip of the cane.

Chris Downey: I was fascinated— walking through buildings that I knew sighted. But I was experiencing them in a different way. I was hearing the architecture I was feeling the space.

Lesley Stahl: It sounds as if you began almost enjoying in a way being the blind architect.

Chris Downey: It was sort of this— this excitement of ""I'm a kid again. I'm— I'm relearning so much of architecture."" It wasn't about what I'm missing in architecture it's what— was about what I had been missing (LAUGH) in architecture.

Chris downey's upbeat attitude doesn't mean that he didn't go through one of the most frightening experiences imaginable — and struggle. He and his wife Rosa were living in this same home with their son Renzo then 10 when Downey first noticed a problem while playing catch with Renzo. The ball kept coming in and out of sight. The cause turned out to be a tumor near his optic nerve. Surgery to remove it lasted nine and a half hours. He says his surgeon had told him there was a slight risk of total sight loss but that he'd never had it happen.

Rosa Downey: When he first came out of surgery he was able to see.

But then things started to go wrong. The next day half his field of vision disappeared. And then —

Chris Downey: The next time I woke up it was— all gone. It was just black.

Lesley Stahl: Complete and total darkness? No light you can't see—

Chris Downey: No light—

Lesley Stahl: —anything.

Chris Downey: It's dark. It's all dark.

After days of frantic testing a surgeon told him it was permanent. Irreversible. And sent in a social worker.

Chris Downey: She says ""Oh and I see from your chart you're— you're an architect so we can talk about career alternatives.""

Lesley Stahl: Career alternatives right away?

Chris Downey: I hadn't been told I was officially blind for 24 hours— and—

Lesley Stahl: And she's saying you can't be an architect anymore—

Chris Downey: Yeah and she was saying we could talk about career— alternatives. I felt like these walls were being built up around me just like ""Yeah you're gettin' boxed in.""

Chris with his wife Rosa and son Renzo

Alone that night in his room Downey did some serious thinking. About his son and about his own father who had died from complications after surgery when Downey was seven years old.

Chris Downey: I could quickly— appreciate the wonder the— just the joy of ""I'm still here.""

Lesley Stahl: It was actually joy?

Chris Downey: Yeah it was like ""I'm still here with my family. My son still has his dad.""

Lesley Stahl: You know your eyes are tearing up. You know that.

Chris Downey: Yeah sorry (laugh). I always have a hard time talking through that.

He knew that how he handled this would send a strong message to Renzo.

Chris Downey: I had been talking with him about the need to really apply himself. At the age of ten it's that point where if you want something you really have to work at it. And here I am facing this great challenge.

So motivated to set an example he headed back to work only one month later.

Bryan Bashin: This was the most healthy thing about Chris.

Bryan bashin is executive director of the non-profit LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired in San Francisco and is blind himself.

Bryan Bashin: He waited a few days until the stitches were out of his skull and 30 days after brain surgery he was back in the office thinking ""Okay there's got to be a way to figure this out. And I'm going to figure it out.""

Bryan Bashin with correspondent Lesley Stahl

Bashin's organization the LightHouse helps people new to vision loss learn how to figure things out.

Bryan Bashin: When someone becomes blind the odds are 99 percent they've never met another blind person.

Lesley Stahl: Is that right?

Bryan Bashin: Yeah that really is true. Blind people need those role models how to be blind how to hold down a job how to live an independent life.

Specifically how to work in the kitchen safely. How to navigate public transportation. How to use screen reading software to listen to emails as quickly as the rest of us read them.

Lesley Stahl: Did you understand that?

Chris: Yes.

Lesley Stahl: No!

And most critically how to get around in the world alone. Downey learned that at the LightHouse.

Lesley Stahl: When you first crossed a big street like this on your own was it terrifying?

Chris Downey: Absolutely terrifying.

Lesley Stahl: I can imagine. I can totally imagine.

Chris Downey: I remember that day stepping off the curb and it was like you would have thought I was stepping into raging waters. Take a deep breath and go for it. You gotta push through it.

Within a few months he was travelling the streets on his own and getting back to normalcy with his son.

Chris Downey: The first Father's Day came up Rosa was like ""So what do you wanna do? Do you wanna go on a picnic go on a nice lunch? ""I wanna play baseball."" (LAUGHTER) ""with Renzo."" Renzo was like— he pops up. I could just— I could feel him like jump to the edge of his chair. ""Baseball you wanna play baseball?"" (LAUGHTER)

Renzo Downey: So Dad would throw to me. And I'd play like I was playing first base.

Lesley Stahl: How could he throw the ball to you?

Renzo Downey: I'd just call out ""I'm over here."" And he'd point and I'd say ""Yeah that's right."" And then he'd throw it at me.

Chris Downey: That's something I really loved about our relationship He quickly was looking for possibilities. He wasn't saying ""You can't do that."" He was like ""Well why not?""

Downey seems to have a knack for finding windows when doors slam shut. Just nine months after going blind the recession hit and he lost his job. But he got word that a nearby firm was designing a rehabilitation center for veterans with sight loss. They were eager to meet a blind architect. What are the chances?

Lesley Stahl: You had to believe that God's hand came down—

Chris Downey: It took my disability and turned it upside down. All of a sudden it defined unique unusual value that virtually nobody else had to offer.

Lesley Stahl: Nobody.

Chris Downey: Yeah.

Starting with that job Downey developed a specialty making spaces accessible to the blind. He helped design a new eye center for Duke University Hospital consulted on a job for Microsoft and signed on to help the visually impaired find their way in San Francisco's new four-block-long Salesforce Transit Center which we visited during construction.

Chris Downey: If you're blind you don't drive. Right? (CHUCKLE) They don't like it when we drive. So— (LAUGH) you know we're committed transit users. So the question was ""How on Earth do you navigate this size of facility if you're blind?""

His solution: grooves set into the concrete running the entire length of the platform.

Chris Downey: I would just follow this following those grooves.

With a subtle change from smooth to textured concrete to signal where to turn to get to the escalators.

Chris Downey: Would you like to give it a try?

Lesley Stahl: Okay. I know to go straight 'cause of this line. And I feel— (SCRAPING) Oh my. Oh my. So it's pretty obvious.

Chris Downey: I can hear the difference from here.

It's something sighted people might never notice and that's precisely the point. Downey believes in what's called universal design — that accommodates people with disabilities but is just as appealing to people without them. It's the approach he used for his biggest project yet consulting on the total renovation of a new three-story office space for his old training ground the LightHouse for the Blind.

""I'm absolutely convinced I'm a better architect today than I was sighted.""

Bryan Bashin: Coming into blindness need not be some dreary social service experience but rather more like coming into an Apple store — thinking that there might be something fun around the corner.

One of Downey's ideas was to break through and link the three floors with an internal staircase that sighted people can see and the blind can hear.

Bryan Bashin: In blindness it's so wonderful to be on the 9th floor and hear a burst of laughter up on the 11th floor or to hear somebody playing the piano on the tenth floor.

For the hallways Downey chose polished concrete. Because of the acoustics.

Bryan Bashin: I can hear the special tap of somebody's cane or the click of a guide dog's toenails.

Lesley Stahl: The click of a g— (LAUGH)

Bryan Bashin: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: — dog's toenails?

Bryan Bashin: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: Well is that good or bad?

Bryan Bashin: That's great. It's like your seeing somebody coming down the hall. I know the sound of individual people who work here by the way they use their cane or the kind of walk they have.

Lesley Stahl: You can really distinguish between people by how they tap their cane?

Bryan Bashin: Absolutely.

Lesley Stahl: If you hadn't had Chris working on this building a blind architect—

Bryan Bashin: It wouldn't have been as rich or so subtle for sure.

Last spring marked the 10-year anniversary of Downey losing his sight. So what did he do? He threw a party. A fundraiser for the LightHouse — where he's been student architect and president of the board.

Chris making toast at party: Maybe a slightly bizarre thing celebrating my 10 year blind birthday (LAUGHTER) but when you're 55 and you have a chance to be 10 again you take it.

Lesley Stahl: I get the feeling that you actually think you're a better architect today.

Chris Downey: I'm absolutely convinced I'm a better architect today than I was sighted.

Lesley Stahl: If you could see tomorrow would you still wanna be able to feel the design?

Chris Downey: If I were to get my sight back— it would be— (SIGH) I don't know. I would be afraid that I'd— I'd sorta lose what I've really been working on. I don't really think about having my sight restored. There's— be some logistical liberation to it. But— will it make my life better? I don't— I don't think so.

Chris Downey continues to have a thriving architecture practice helping design museums and campuses for the blind and visually impaired. He's still rowing and this past semester taught a graduate architecture course at UC Berkeley.

In this interview Sophie talks about CGG’s path into the future.

After a successful international career with Schlumberger Sophie joined CGG in 2013 and was appointed CEO in 2018. The collapse in oil price Covid-19 pandemic and energy transition have created a tough business environment during her near four-year tenure in this role but also created opportunities. In this interview Sophie talks about CGG’s path into the future.

Geoscience expertise is a core CGG strength. How will CGG capitalise on this resource in the race to net zero?

Sophie Zurquiyah CEO CGG.Yes we have a lot of geoscientists at CGG! We currently have around 1200 Masters and PhDs across our various disciplines within geoscience and we are very proud to be a geoscience technology leader. Geoscience together with our advanced technical capabilities is central to the energy transition. This combination of technology and skills within the geosciences will provide the insights necessary to fully understand navigate and optimise our approach across many of the energy transition challenges.

At CGG along with our core businesses that support the efficient and responsible discovery and development of oil and gas which will be required throughout the transition we can see that our geoscience and technical expertise along with our earth data library are and will continue to be critical for many efforts around the ‘race to net zero’. This includes: cloud-based high performance computing (HPC) environmental monitoring growth of minerals and mining to access the critical minerals required to support the energy transition the development of geothermal energy and the industrialisation of carbon capture utilisation and sequestration (CCUS) to reach the scale required.

As the first female CEO in CGG’s 90-year history what do you think is required to introduce more diversity into the energy industry?

It is a tough challenge and I have spent a lot of time understanding the ‘issue’ because at the end of the day it is not right and we should have more females in senior management roles across our industry. I believe it starts with recruiting where there is a gender imbalance at the university level in the disciplines that we require and because of this getting more than 30-40% female recruits is difficult. After that women get promoted at a lower rate than men unless companies make the effort to correct the selection biases. That is how an industry ends up with around 20% female in mid-management and less than 10% at senior management levels. One action that many companies have taken is to ensure candidates from both genders are considered for any promotion. At CGG we currently have 24% women in our most senior positions which places us very well within our sector and are taking actions to ensure we increase that number moving forward. Our ultimate ambition is to match the overall percentage of women in the company which is closer to 30%.

As an industry we must make it clear that we are committed to gender diversity and take all the actions needed to reduce biases and create an inclusive and equitable environment. In our industry we have the added complexity of being very international and considerations around diversity vary country by country and by culture.

I will finish by saying that the need to consider diversity goes beyond gender as it also includes ethnicity national origin age cultural identity and sexual orientation. Being inclusive allows us to tap into the best talents to drive our success as well as best support our diverse clients.

CGG is repurposing its business and has sold its seismic and multi-physics acquisition and geosoftware businesses in recent times. How do these divestments particularly the software sale fit into CGG’s long-term strategy?

We engaged back in 2018 in our own transition recognising that our markets were evolving and that we needed to define our own path into the future. We have become asset-light after exiting the acquisition businesses (Land Marine and Multi-Physics) and are focusing on our three core businesses of Geoscience Multi-Client and Equipment where we are differentiated have less HSE exposure including greenhouse emissions and have leading technology/market positions.

GeoSoftware is a specialised commercial software business with the brands of Jason and HampsonRussell. They enjoy a leading position in a particular part of the larger upstream subsurface software market. We realised that to become a significant player in the commercial software business and expand beyond seismic reservoir characterisation we would need to make large investments in a commercial software platform and expand into other parts of the E&P workflow and this is a very crowded market.

Instead we decided to divest GeoSoftware and focus on our data equipment and services businesses in geology and imaging identifying opportunities to invest in the technology required including HPC and advanced software that supports our services so that we could further differentiate these and leverage our unique and leading capabilities to expand into adjacent and rapidly growing areas such as digital or environmental sciences.

In line with most of the industry CGG has had to significantly reduce its headcount. As the business environment improves post-pandemic what challenges if any do you see in re-staffing?

It is always a difficult decision to reduce our personnel as we have strong professionals that give the company their best. We also invest heavily to train and develop our people. Recognising that it would take several years before the business recovered to the same level as 2019 we did make the decision to reduce staff. However in our model we never stopped recruiting entirely as our skill sets are constantly evolving. This also helps as we start ramping up as we already have the people and processes in place to bring new employees on board. While we see increased competition from the large tech companies we are generally able to attract talented profiles to CGG because we are known for operating at the cutting edge of what is possible in computational science including IT software and imaging algorithms. Today we have some of the largest HPC capabilities in the world. As a recent graduate and scientist I remember being attracted by the technology challenges that a company could offer me and I think this still holds true for those entering the industry.

The oil and gas industry faces significant challenges and opportunities. How do you see CCG adapting as integrated oil companies strive to become integrated energy companies?

It is clear that the energy transition is here progressing rapidly and that our industry is embracing the future. This is excellent to see. Capital is being heavily injected and reallocated by the E&P companies into solar wind and batteries which are the new energies attracting most investments right now. Geothermal is also receiving more interest and it will be important to watch technology trends closely especially for breakthroughs around geothermal energy from shallow sedimentary basins.

In parallel it is equally critical to recognise that for an effective well-managed and equitable energy transition the responsible management of oil and gas will remain vital for decades to come. At CGG along with our core businesses which support the efficient and responsible discovery and development of oil and gas we have decided to develop new businesses in rapidly growing sectors that are adjacent to our existing businesses leverage our capabilities and support our clients’ challenges. These include digital sciences – to help our clients extract the most from their subsurface data and provide the cloud-based HPC needed for the most advanced algorithms; energy transition – which includes technologies and services for CCUS geothermal and mining; environmental sciences – where we leverage our HPC and artificial intelligence lab capabilities along with our earth science expertise to provide data analytics-driven intelligence to monitor and mitigate environmental risks; structural and earthworks monitoring – solutions that utilise our sensor acquisition and monitoring expertise and technology to deliver systems for the continuous monitoring of the physical integrity and to extend the life of structures such as rail tracks buildings or bridges; and finally our earth data library because data provides the foundation for good decisions.

These new business initiatives where we currently employ around 150 people and are expanding represent an increasing share of our total revenue and provide an avenue for the growth and development of our employees.

You were appointed a director of TechnipFMC earlier this year. Given the synergies with CGG do you see benefits in future collaborations with Technip?

TechnipFMC is a great company and I am very honoured to be a director. They are a leading technology provider both in the traditional and new energies industry delivering fully integrated projects products and services. They operate in many of the same geographies that CGG does and often with the same clients as ours but the procurement for their products and services is fairly disconnected from the procurement of geoscience products and services and we do not work with the same groups within our clients’ organisations. Of course we could collaborate where it makes sense on a case-by-case basis.

Where do you see CGG in 2031 on its 100th anniversary?

Wow! It is amazing to think that CGG has been celebrating its 90th anniversary this last year! During that timeframe we have seen oil production grow from virtually nothing to 100M barrels of oil/day offering affordable energy around the world playing a key role in global economic growth over the decades and now a key concern in global warming that must be urgently addressed.

In a way I find it even more remarkable that CGG has remained all that time in geoscience which is very exposed to industry cycles. During this time CGG expanded the range of its products and services from land acquisition to processing to equipment. We also moved offshore developed the multi-client business model and expanded from a focus on the seismic market to covering the full spectrum of geoscience technology and expertise.

Today through our recent strategic journey we are now an asset-light technology company focused on our leading and differentiated businesses of Geoscience Multi-Client and Equipment. Looking forward I see our future continuing to be strong in geoscience a lot more digital and expanding significantly into other areas and industries which I’ve already mentioned.

Last year we changed our branding and updated our tag line to ‘See things differently’. This is because we believe we have a unique perspective on our planet thanks to our people and technology. Along with the importance of our geoscientists this change also recognises the importance of the rapidly evolving trends in IT and HPC which push forward the limits of the problems we can solve.

I am confident that we have the brains and the capability to create a positive future in these changing times and in these rapidly growing new markets while remaining true to our technology and geoscience history. I look forward to our 100th anniversary and seeing just how far CGG will have progressed along its continued journey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMi8wNi8xOS9sb3ZlLWlzbGFuZC0yMDIyLWdlbW1hLW93ZW4td2VhcmluZy0yMDAwMC1uZWNrbGFjZS1zYXlzLWZhbnMtMTY4NTMwNTcv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9tZXRyby5jby51ay8yMDIyLzA2LzE5L2xvdmUtaXNsYW5kLTIwMjItZ2VtbWEtb3dlbi13ZWFyaW5nLTIwMDAwLW5lY2tsYWNlLXNheXMtZmFucy0xNjg1MzA1Ny9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Love Island 2022: Gemma Owen wearing '£20000 necklace' says fans,"Gemma is rarely seen without it (Picture: Tiffany / REX)

Attentive Love Island fans have been eyeing up Gemma Owen’s signature necklace which some believe to be a vintage Tiffany piece.

The international dressage rider 19 has been rocking the statement necklace from day one and is often seen wearing it during show challenges through to late night parties

Gemma’s go-to jewelry staple which features a string of linked Xs has become a hit with fans and many are wondering where they can purchase a dupe.

‘I categorize the best #LoveIsland seasons according to how quickly I buy jewelry items that I see on the girls. So now I need to find a jeweler to custom make me Gemma’s necklace’ one person tweeted.

However one viewer did some digging and revealed that the much-loved accessory came with a£20000 price tag.

According to the fan the exclusive piece is actually from the American luxury retailerTiffany & Co and was designed as part of a collection by gifted jewellery artisan Jean Schlumberger in the 1980s.

Might have to put some pennies aside for this one!

Although Gemma the daughter of ex-footballer Michael Owen certainly made her presence felt during the launch of the new series after fans branded her ‘rude’ it’s safe to say she’s in a happy place since coupling up with 23-year-old fishmonger Luca Bish.

However despite criticism from viewers for her ‘bad attitude’ Gemma’s family have signed her up to Off Limits Entertainment the PR agency who look after former Love Island finalist Maura Higgins as well as ex-Islanders Chris Hughes Shaughna Phillips ex-boxers Amir Khan and Carl Froch and TV personality Jake Quickenden.

A spokesperson from Off Limits Entertainment told Metro.co.uk: ‘We are super pleased to confirm that Off Limits Entertainment are Gemma Owen’s exclusive management company. We’re so excited to watch her journey and help progress her career.’

Fans are still waiting for Gemma to reveal who her dad is(Picture: Instagram)

According to The Mirror Gemma’s family have been ‘working behind the scenes to try and boost her profile’ with this signing.

After Gemma’s ex-boyfriend Jacques O’Neill made his villa debut last Sunday fans were convinced that he would be the one dropping the bomb over Gemma’s famous father Michael.

The former football legend played as a striker for Liverpool Real Madrid Newcastle United Manchester United and Stoke City as well as for the England national team.

After making his debut in the Premier League in 1997 the sports star finished as joint top scorer with 18 goals sharing the Premier League Golden Boot. He played his first match for England in 1998 becoming England’s youngest player and youngest goalscorer at the time.

Love Island returns tonight at 9pm on ITV2.

As you drive into Round Top on Highway 237 past familiar meadows dotted with wildflowers and thick stands of majestic trees something new punctuates the landscape. Three bungalows are reminiscent of early Texas farmhouses with pitched metal roofs and screened porches their charcoal-painted shiplap and striking red doors shutters and antlers a tonal starkness against a milky blue sky.

The new Red Antler Bungalows — a boutique hotel of sorts — is the creation of John Cone and Greg Fourticq both from Houston. Fourticq spent a decade in New York working for Donna Karan Home and Calvin Klein Home opening boutiques for Carolina Herrera and designing his own stunning apartments along the way. Cone the managing partner for family businesses ranging from commercial construction consulting to insurance follows art and interior design with a passion.

“The bungalows started as a hobby and we found we really love it” Cone says.

Their first three Red Antler Bungalows opened in March just before the Round Top Spring Antiques Show while three more are slated to open in January 2023 in time for next year’s Winter Antiques Show. Round Top population 90 swells to several hundred thousand during the thrice-yearly antiques and design shows attracting well-known designers from around the world a slew of HGTV and Bravo home design stars and entertainers such as Gwen Stefani.

It’s this influx — a design-savvy sophisticated crowd — that spurred Cone and Fourticq. With antiques show shoppers sometimes booking hotel rooms as far away as Austin there was a very real need for accommodations where design is at the heart.

“Round Top has some very cool boutique hotels — Hotel Lulu The Frenchie and the Round Top Inn as well as some great B & Bs — but there aren’t enough” Cone says. “People are booking rooms a year out.”

Round Top is also becoming a very busy little town year-round with many antiques venues testing the waters by opening Thursdays through Sundays all year new retail shops open year-round and great restaurants and live music most nights in a growing number of bars and watering holes.

Holloway Homes (formerly Texas Farmhouse Homes) located an hour away in Hockley built the bungalows to Cone and Fourticq’s specifications.

“We wanted something that fit with Round Top’s culture so we kept a country aesthetic but did them a bit different” Fourticq says. The dramatic exteriors are painted Sherwin Williams Black Magic with Rave Red accents and Gauntlet Gray trim. Each 1300-square-foot bungalow has two bedrooms and two baths separated by a pitched great room with fireplace and full kitchen.

Large screened porches overlook a creek with chairs handmade from bent willow branches by Rick Pratt from Around the Bend out of Ohio who sells during the shows at The Halles. There’s also a glamorous round pool with red-and-white striped cabanas and a fire pit overlooking the creek.

While the exteriors are uniform each of the interiors is a different world and expresses a mood and personality. Furnishings and accessories are a clever mix of items bought in Round Top Houston and at auction along with objects and art from the couple’s own extensive collections.

“When we started this project we didn’t know how to begin” Fourticq says. “Every time we saw something great we’d buy it and put it in storage. We ended up with five storage units filled to the gills.”

Fourticq kept a big binder with pictures of everything they bought plus an inventory sheet of everything needed for each bungalow from beds and sofas to glassware and drinks trays. “I’d just check the box as we went along” he says.

One bungalow has a preppy Palm Beach vibe; a pair of pink velvet armchairs a rattan coffee table and a navy rug were discovered at the Bassett warehouse in Houston an unexpected new haunt where they’ve found sturdy furniture basics. Flanking the fireplace a pair of chinoiserie-inspired chairs from Memorial Antiques & Interiors (MAI) in Houston were perfect as-is covered in chartreuse leopard spot upholstery.

In one bedroom a pair of exquisitely worn blue nightstands came from Round Top Ranch Antiques which specializes in Swedish Antiques. The details are divine and include the couple’s charming collection of antique porcelain monkeys which decorate a pair of chests in a living area and in a dining area there’s an ancient sculpture of a Chinese scholar that Fourticq discovered decades ago in Paris.

For each bungalow they commissioned black-and-white umbrella stands made by artisans just outside San Miguel de Allende in Dolores Hidalgo an area known for ceramics. Beautifully colored handwoven alpaca throws on the beds in all three bungalows are from Alan Vogt at Manos De Sur who sells during the shows at The Compound in Round Top. Six vintage Knoll Brno chairs covered in red mohair and snagged from a dealer going out of business started the basis of the design for the modernist bungalow.

“There’s a mix of contemporary and traditional with some Asian references” Fourticq says. “That’s my style and if you look at Florence Knoll design books she always included orientalist pieces in her interiors. It all naturally fits together.”

The Red Antler Bungalows are stylish but it’s a hotel so furniture has to be long-lasting and comfortable. A plump sofa made by online company Grandin Road is slipcovered in blue linen so that it can be easily cleaned and a pair of rattan chairs from another online source Article have a hint of Asia with elegant swooping arms. In one of the bedrooms there’s an old rattan desk that came from 209th Designs about 40 minutes from Houston in Tomball which owners Troy and Mandy Garza lacquered a stunning navy blue with new hardware. The Garzas also lacquered the red antlers appended to the bungalows’ exteriors.

Art and objects from the couple’s collections include brilliantly hued minerals and crystals and graphic black-and-white photographs of horses by photographer Steven Klein whom Fourticq met while shooting an advertising campaign eons ago for Calvin Klein in New York.

Layered in pale brown gray and ivory a more neutral bungalow is an all-around guest favorite Fourticq says. “People react to its monochromatic look. But it’s not boring at all — we went far enough with the design to keep it interesting.” In front of the fireplace is a bench with spool legs scallop carving and an intricately woven seat they discovered at Lewis & Maese Antiques & Auctions in Houston.

Cone also sourced a lot of furniture from Memorial Traders a private Facebook shopping group including a coffee table and pair of chests from Houstonian Robin Goodland who finds and refinishes vintage furniture.

“She has a good eye for simple shapes and lines and spot-on pieces that she takes down to the wood” Fourticq says. There’s also a pair of smoky Murano glass lamps Cone found in Italy years ago and black Wedgwood bowls and vases a burgeoning obsession of theirs.

“A lot of these things you would love to have in your own house or probably already have — that’s kind of the point” Fourticq says. “People want where they stay to be at least as nice as their own homes and that’s what we’re shooting for.”

Longtime Houstonians Cone and Fourticq fell in love with Round Top’s rolling countryside as well as the people who live there.

“It’s a cool little town with cool people doing all kinds of unusual things you might not expect in a small Texas town” Fourticq says. Cone grew up on a farm in Austin County not far from Round Top and was familiar with the town’s lively vibe. “You can go dancing or listen to live music or go to a great restaurant” he says. “People are very social entertain and host dinner parties.”

The couple are building a house nearby and plan to move permanently in a few years when their youngest daughter graduates high school. Red Antler Bungalows was conceived as a way to stay busy once they retire.

“Our goal is to create something unique and personalized” Cone says. With seven-day notice prior to arrival they can arrange car service from airports in Austin and Houston and stock your refrigerator pantry and bar.

For the uninitiated a first trip to Round Top can feel a little like being marooned at sea. The town’s only mercantile closes at 6 pm on weekdays and even earlier on Sundays many restaurants are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.

“I tell people it’s like a yachting experience — you have to plan in advance” Cone says.

Red Antler has already caught the attention of top interior designers. They won’t name names but “we’ve had a lot of prominent designers stay here from all over” Fourticq says. “One recently flew in from San Francisco and there’s a lady based in the Bahamas who’s very well known.”

Recently the high-profile owner of a Dallas private club reserved all three bungalows for friends flying in from New York and Los Angeles. Fourticq and Cone filled a big silver bowl — shaped like a deer’s head with antlers — with champagne rosé and white wine. “It was a huge hit and they had a blast” Fourticq says.

“Next up is Fourth of July weekend” says Cone “a serious holiday in Round Top which hosts the 172nd annual Fourth of July parade the longest-running Fourth of July parade west of the Mississippi and on July 3 fireworks and music at The Compound.”

Flanked by supporters and standing in front of the recently installed Lorain sign at the corner of East Erie and Broadway avenues Springowski on June 17 said she’ll challenge incumbent and fellow Democrat Jack Bradley in the May 2023 primary.

Springowski is serving her fourth term on council. She was elected to her first term in 2016 and has won re-election three times.

A vocal union leader who on occasion makes references to her employment at Ford during council meetings Springowski said if elected she’ll aggressively push to bring businesses and jobs to the city.

“As your mayor I will lead an administration that is focused on aggressive economic development to bring the jobs of the 21st century just like I have with Intel and other chip manufacturers. We will work towards safer more vibrant neighborhoods for every resident because nobody deserves to live in a forgotten neighborhood. And we will work to expand recreational opportunities to live up to the creed of saying welcome instead of goodbye” Springowski said in a news release.

Springowski began lobbying Intel about a move to Ohio in April of 2021 The Morning Journal has reported.

A letter or email she wrote made its way to Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger. It included reasons the company should consider Lorain as a place for expansion. She cited access to fresh water highway transportation Lorain County Community College and Cleveland’s hospitals and universities.

Jason Bagley senior director for state government relations in Intel’s law and policy group contacted Springowski.

That started a dialogue between Intel and Team NEO the One Columbus economic development group JobsOhio Gov. Mike DeWine and his administration and more according to Team NEO CEO Bill Koehler.

Northeast Ohio ultimately didn’t land the plant but Koehler still gave Springowski credit for her work in luring Intel to Ohio.

“At the end of the day the important thing here is this: Mary was a catalyst” Koehler told The Morning Journal in February weeks after Intel’s announcement to come to Ohio. “She took the initiative she made the phone call to the folks at Intel and that helped raise the opportunity that we saw and it shows how valuable the network can be.”

Bradley was not surprised by Springowski’s decision to challenge him in 2023. He said before he took office she told him she planned to run against him.

“I said ‘God bless you’” Bradley recalled.",,,,,,,,,

Gerald Shiew of Snap-On was presented the recognition during the chamber’s monthly luncheon.

Snap-On was founded in the 1920s to serve the automotive industry. “In 1920 a cultural shift was underway in the United States as the automobile was rising in popularity creating the need for an emerging automotive repair industry” the business shared. “Joseph Johnson an engineer from Milwaukee had an idea that would revolutionize repair and make work easier for professional mechanics.”

The result was five unique handles and ten sockets that snapped on interchangeably coined “Five do the work of Fifty.” This invention went on to shape an industry as the company grew throughout the decades developing quality tools and an innovative business model.

The business now operates as a franchise which Shiew oversees locally. Snap-On offers thousands of products through 4800 mobile stores worldwide serving more than 130 countries. The company has kept its ties to the United States with headquarters based in Wisconsin and 13 manufacturing facilities across the country.

This article explains how to unblock someone on Snapchat for iOS and Android devices.

How to Unblock Someone on Snapchat

Because blocking people on Snapchat hides their accounts from you and yours from them you can't search for their names and then unblock them. Instead access your list of blocked users from the Snapchat settings. Here's how.

Open Snapchat and tap your Bitmoji or username in the upper-left corner of the screen. Tap the gear icon in the upper-right corner to access Settings. Swipe up to see the Account Actions section then tap Blocked. You'll see a list of usernames of people you blocked. Tap the X that appears to the right of the username of the person you want to unblock. Snapchat prompts you to confirm. Tap Yes if you would like to unblock this person. After you unblock someone their username disappears from your Blocked list.

What to Do After Unblocking Someone

Blocking cuts off all contact between you and the blocked user and the person is removed from your Friends list. After unblocking you'll need to search for the friend and add them back.

To do this type the username into the search field at the top then tap Add to the right of the profile picture and username. If the friend isn't a public user they have to add you back as well.

More About Unblocking People on Snapchat

Below are some of the most commonly asked questions and answers about unblocking someone in Snapchat.

What Are the Limitations to Blocking and Unblocking Users?

Snapchat has been known to place time restrictions on users who re-add friends they recently deleted or blocked. So if you blocked unblocked and tried to re-add them in a short time Snapchat might prevent you from re-adding them for 24 hours.

Do Blocked People Know When You Unblock Them?

Snapchat doesn't notify users when you block or unblock them but they might figure it out. For example if someone notices that your account has disappeared they might search for you from another Snapchat account and confirm that they were blocked. If they see a new friend request from you they may realize that you're adding them back.

Is There an Alternative to Blocking People on Snapchat?

Instead of temporarily cutting off all contact with someone and then re-adding each other as friends silence notifications. When you turn on this option for any friend they remain on your Friends list. You'll still receive snaps and chats but without any of the notifications that come with those snaps.

To silence notifications from a Snapchat user open their contact page by selecting the image next to their name. Once you're on their contact page use the three-dotted menu at the top to select Message Notifications. Choose Silent.

Turn this feature on or off at any time without your friend ever knowing and enjoy the freedom of opening their snaps and chats at your leisure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS90aGlzLXdlZWstaW4tcG9rZW1vbi1wb2tldG9vbi1zaGlueS1jbGVmYWlyeS1naWZ0LXBva2Vtb24tc25hcC1zd2l0Y2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Week In Pokemon: New Cartoon Shiny Mystery Gift And Pokemon Snap On Switch,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS90aGlzLXdlZWstaW4tcG9rZW1vbi1wb2tldG9vbi1zaGlueS1jbGVmYWlyeS1naWZ0LXBva2Vtb24tc25hcC1zd2l0Y2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvcmViZWwtd2lsc29uLXNoYXJlcy1sb3ZlZC11cC0yNzI2OTkyN9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvcmViZWwtd2lsc29uLXNoYXJlcy1sb3ZlZC11cC0yNzI2OTkyNy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rebel Wilson shares loved-up snap with girlfriend after newspaper's attempt to 'out' her,"Rebel Wilson 42 is currently enjoying a sun-soaked break in Italy and shared a snap holding hands with her ""Disney Princess"" on Instagram on Saturday

Rebel Wilson shares loved-up snap with girlfriend after newspaper's attempt to 'out' her

Rebel Wilson put on a defiant display as she shared loved-up snaps with her girlfriend Ramona Agruma days after hitting out at an Australian newspaper for trying to 'out' her sexuality.

The actress 42 is currently enjoying a sun-soaked break in Italy and shared a snap holding hands with her ""Disney Princess"" on Instagram on Saturday.

Rebel beamed from ear-to-ear and showed off her dramatic weight loss in a stunning yellow maxi dress while jewellery designer Ramona cut a sophisticated figure in a black Prada suit with white piping.

She teamed the look with a Dior tote bag and gold sandals.

The couple looked happier than ever with Rebel captioning the shot: ""ciao bellas"".

The snap was inundated with comments from Rebel's famous friends with Paris Hilton typing: ""So happy for you love!"" while Vas J Morgan commented a string of red heart emojis.

The lovebirds' holiday comes just days after the pair were thrown into the spotlight after Sydney Morning Herald tried to write a story about her sexuality.

Last week the Pitch Perfect star took to I nstagram to tell the world she had met her ""Disney Princess"" which she was met with huge congratulations and well wishes.

Speaking about her love life the actress shared a snap of her and the fashion and jewellery designer with the caption: ""I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess.”

For good measure she added the caption: ""#Loveislove"".

In a tweet Rebel thanked fans for their support and wrote: ""Thanks for your comments it was a very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace.""

The pair attended the Vanity Fair Oscars Party together in March where they both looked incredible.

While it appears that Rebel never felt the need to 'announce' her relationship it seems that she was given very little choice by the Sydney Morning Herald who gave her two days to respond to questioning about her sexuality.

However the private columnist who is openly gay himself appeared to be angry when the actress decided to take control of the narrative around her love life.

He said that Rebel had ""gazump"" the story and appeared to question her sexuality by mentioning her ex-boyfriend.

The article attracted fury from the LGBTQIA2S+ community and allies who said that the paper and journalist had no right to force Rebel's hand.

The newspaper's editor Bevan Sheilds wrote a statement where he denied any wrong doing and wished the couple well.

Hornery has also spoken out about his original piece reflecting on the ""tone"" of the article.

""I genuinely regret that Rebel has found this hard' Hornery said in a column that replaced Sunday's article.

""That was never my intention. But I see she has handled it all with extraordinary grace.""

He added that ""As a gay man I'm well aware of how deeply discrimination hurts. The last thing I would ever want to do is inflict that pain on someone else.""

By Jason Collins |

While the fans of the original 1999’s Pokemon Snap a first-person photography game got to enjoy 2021’s New Pokemon Snap on Switch Nintendo has decided to make the original N64 game available on the console as well via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. The game itself is part of the original batch of games revealed during the Nintendo Switch Online N64 games announcement alongside other classics such as Zelda and Banjo Kazooie. You can check out the trailer below:

The original Pokémon Snap returns! 📸



Get those (camera) trigger fingers ready for when it comes to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members on June 24. pic.twitter.com/HKsg9IUcZL — IGN (@IGN) June 17 2022

Nintendo announced that the original Pokemon Snap would release for their Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack on June 24 and gamers will be able to play the game with both the Switch’s N64 Controller and the console’s standard Joy-Con. The announcement trailer showcases the game played on Nintendo’s handheld whose price recently dropped. Much like all other N64 titles that have found their way to Switch the game runs in a 4:3 aspect ratio and allows users to create save states at any point within the game.

Of course this isn’t an entirely faithful port of Pokemon Snap since it allows gamers who haven’t bought Switch’s N64 controller to play via the console’s Joy-Con but with customizable button bindings. This should allow smoother gameplay between two versions of the game. Also the older version of the game had fewer Pokemon compared to the New Pokemon Snap which is fair considering that there was only one generation of Pokemon back in 1999 when the original game was released.

The original Pokemon Snap was a spin-off of the main series of Pokemon titles where gamers assumed a role of a budding photographer called Todd whose assignment was to go into Pokemon-filled areas and take photos and interact with Pokemon. This was done via on-rail paths similar to sightseeing tours and the game also had puzzles the players had to solve to get a rare Pokemon to appear.

Professor Oak a vital character in the Pokemon Snap game judges the photographs based on several factors such as how close the Pokemon is and if they’re in the center of the frame so getting the perfect photo aim was quite important. Of course better photos would earn more points which unlocked additional levels and to be quite honest the game has aged remarkably well and even without its re-release for Switch it’s still a relevant gaming piece to this day.

This means that the Switch re-release of the original Pokemon Snap is something the gamers will welcome with open arms considering just how beloved the original game was. Its addition to the Switch Online Expansion Pack wraps us every game that was originally announced and with any luck Nintendo will come up with more N64 icons that are worth transitioning to their most recent gaming hardware. Besides Pokemon Snap witnessing Goldeneye N64 would be nice but the list of legendary N64 titles is as vast as the console’s legend itself so adding all those games would perhaps subtract a lot from the original Nintendo Switch releases."

Do a Tour and Tasting at Palmetto Distillery

The fun started more than a decade ago when brothers Trey and Bryan Boggs opened South Carolina's first legal moonshine distillery in Anderson. Since then they've grown the collection of spirits at Palmetto Distillery to include not only award-winning flavored moonshines (Try the Pina Colada Peach or Salted Caramel) but also a line of craft whiskeys and ready-to-drink cocktails.

And leaving your pet at home while traveling isn't always an option. So you may be researching the Southwest Airlines pet policy including approved Southwest pet carriers and the Southwest dog policy.

Fortunately flying with a dog on Southwest is possible if your pet route and carrier meet specific requirements. Likewise it's also possible to fly with a cat on Southwest. But before you plan on bringing your pet with you you'll want to ensure your pet will be allowed on board.

So before you bring your pet to the airport here's everything you'll need to know when flying with a dog or cat on Southwest.

Southwest pet policy

With the Southwest pet policy small domestic cats and dogs of at least 8 weeks old can travel with you in the cabin. In particular your cat or dog can fly under the seat in front of you.

Pet carriers are only allowed to travel with a paid customer and unaccompanied minors aren't allowed to bring a pet on board. While only one pet carrier is allowed per ticketed passenger you can carry up to two pets of the same species in your carrier.

Your pet must stay within its carrier at the gate area during boarding and deplaning and throughout the entire flight. Additionally if your pet presents disruptive behavior — such as scratching excessive whining or barking growling biting lunging or urinating — Southwest may not allow you to board with your pet.

Unfortunately you can't bring your pet on international Southwest flights. Additionally when traveling to or from Hawaii you can't bring a pet with you. However Southwest will allow you to bring your pet on flights between Hawaiian islands.

Additionally even though Southwest has an open seating policy customers can't occupy an exit row seat or a seat with no under-seat space in front of it (typically the first row).

Booking your pet on your Southwest flight

For flights within the U.S. you must add your pet to your reservation in advance by calling Southwest directly.

Then passengers traveling with a pet must check in on the day of travel with their pet at the ticket counter. By doing so Southwest personnel can approve the pet and pet carrier.

Southwest charges a fee of $95 per pet carrier each way but this fee is fully refundable if you end up not traveling.

You'll want to book your pet as soon as possible before each flight since only six pets are allowed per flight. And pet reservations are taken on a first-come first-served basis. However Southwest makes it clear that there might be special circumstances where more or fewer than six pet carriers will be allowed on a flight. For example Southwest will sometimes waive this cap on flights out of a region expecting a hurricane.

Now if you also are bringing a trained service dog with you on your Southwest flight — along with a pet in their carrier — and your trained service dog is larger than a child under the age of 2 you must purchase an additional seat on your Southwest flight. Then you'll need to place the carrier under the seat in front of the extra purchased seat.

Southwest pet carrier requirements

When flying Southwest you must carry your pet in a carrier no larger than 18 1/2 inches long by 8 1/2 inches high by 13 1/2 inches wide. The pet carrier must be leakproof and well ventilated although both hard-sided and soft-sided carriers are allowed. All pets must be able to fit completely inside the carrier and also be able to stand up and move around.

You can also purchase a Southwest pet carrier at the ticket counter or online. This Southwest-branded pet carrier is 17 inches long by 9 1/2 inches high by 10 inches wide — which is slightly smaller than the maximum size allowed.

Remember even though Southwest has an incredibly generous baggage policy pet carriers count as your one personal item. When bringing a pet carrier on board you are still allowed to bring another personal item or a regular-size carry-on bag.

Southwest cargo pet policy

Southwest Airlines doesn't carry any pets — including cats and dogs — as cargo. So the only way to take your cat or dog with you on a Southwest flight is in the cabin in a pet carrier.

Bottom line

With the Southwest pet policy dogs and cats are allowed to fly in the cabin as long as they fit in a carrier of the aforementioned size. Of course this doesn't help if you have another type of pet — or a larger cat or dog — since Southwest doesn't allow any animals to fly as cargo.

But if your pet fits the requirements you can bring your beloved cat or dog with you on your next vacation. Best of all flying with a dog or cat on Southwest is relatively inexpensive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3dpdGgtYS1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLW1vdmUtc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLXRyaWVzLWZvci1iZXR0ZXItY3VzdG9tZXItc2VydmljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With a controversial move Southwest Airlines tries for better customer service,"Happier now? Southwest Airlines

Has an airline made you happy lately?

Or has it driven you to levels of despair last experienced when well you last flew on an airline?

Too often it seems that airlines promise to deliver heightened levels of service and only end up delivering heightened levels of angst and grief.

Oddly though one major airline has taken a large step toward -- perhaps -- relaxing your furrowed brow. A smidgen at least.

You see Southwest Airlines which prides itself on smiles and jokes -- a little difficult when you're cancelling tens of thousands of flights -- just veered toward even cheerier customer service.

Perhaps you didn't think it was possible for Southwest to be any cheerier. Its staff are always so very happy except when they finally lose their temper with some recalcitrant oaf of a passenger. (And who can blame them for that?)

Still the airline just announced that the customer service voice you hear on the other end of the line -- if you can finally get through that is -- will possibly sound even more inclined to help.

No the airline didn't use those words. But in a fit of holy humanity Southwest announced it's closing its customer service call centers. Yes all of them. Every single one. During the COVID-19 pandemic many did already work remotely. But now Southwest is fully committed to homespun service.

No longer will your customer service agent be huddled right next to another customer service agent who'll be wishing they weren't huddled right next to anyone.

Instead they'll be huddled next to their dog their cat or a strange green statue they bought on vacation in South Carolina.

Now why would Southwest do something like this? Is it to improve the level of customer service? It might be. Is it to make its customer service employees happier? It could be. Or it could be that the airline finds it so hard to recruit anyone right now that even the slightest additional benefit might tip the scales.

We're talking after all about the airline which suffers from 20% of its new hires not turning up on their first day at work.

Here's Southwest's statement alluding to such dire realities: ""Evolving to a fully remote workforce brings increased flexibility both in attracting and hiring new employees from across the country and in scheduling current employees who have worked at record efficiency in a remote work environment.""

I fear those of excessively rational countenance will suggest this is a bad move. How can these people now be managed effectively? Moreover some research suggests that working from home may dull your productivity.

As can be the case with research other research insists this is bunkum. Which hasn't stopped some companies -- hullo Apple -- from insisting their employees return or face ejection from the spaceship.

Moreover most of Southwest's biggest rivals such as United Delta and American still herd customer service staff into vast bullpens of discomfort.

But is there or has there ever been a reason why those trying to please customers -- or at least calm them down -- should be sitting in call centers with cacophony all around them? Has it always merely been an attempt at management control? If I can see you I know you're there so you must be working.

At heart what customers care about is whether the customer service agent actually comes on the line and whether they can then solve their problem preferably with a touch of empathy.

There's at least now a chance that Southwest's customers will see a slight improvement in mood from their customer service agents.

Southwest Airlines canceled thousands of flights last weekend that left some passengers stranded.

Travelers with canceled flights are owed a refund and can push for hotel stays and alternate travel.

Trip insurance can help get expenses reimbursed if it's due to a flight delay or cancelation.

Southwest Airlines is still canceling flights after a weekend meltdown during which more than 1700 flights were cut from the schedule.

At least 365 flights have already been canceled for Monday according to flight tracking company FlightAware and more may be on the horizon as the airline recovers from a chaotic weekend.

There's no foolproof method to avoid being stranded when flight cancellations and delays strike but travelers should take precautions before heading to the airport to increase their chances of resolving airline-related issues.

Here are 5 tips to deal with delayed and canceled flights.

Know how to contact an airline

At the airport airline gate staff and customer service agents can help rebook flights in the event of a cancellation or delay. Travelers should find the closest customer service center as early as possible.

Airline phone numbers are also available on their websites and apps; it can be worth saving those numbers into your phone's contact book ahead of time.

Southwest's customer service phone number is 1-800-435-9792. The call center is open 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Southwest's baggage service phone number is 1-888-202-1024 group travel is 1-800-433-8747 and the Spanish language phone number is 1-800-826-6667.

Social media also can be a useful resource – sending an early direct message to Southwest's Twitter can act as a virtual placeholder on the customer service line.

Use an airline's mobile app or website to rebook

Airlines have made it easier for passengers to rebook with a mobile app. Flight change fees will be waived in those cases and travelers in theory should be able to find and book backup flights.

During high-traffic periods including ones following airline meltdowns however availability might be scarce as thousands of fellow passengers are also trying to rebook. If online means of rebooking aren't being helpful talking to an airline representative is the next best bet.

Know your traveler rights

Airlines must provide a refund to travelers who cancel their bookings outright according to the Department of Transportation.

Travel credits offered by the airline can often only be used on that airline while a refund gives travelers additional freedom whether it be to scrap a trip outright or rebook with a different airline. However the airline may not be inclined to help once a booking is fully canceled and refunded.







Travelers can also request vouchers for meals and hotel stays if the disruption to a trip is severe. In the latest case Southwest is blaming issues outside of its control however so passengers might be limited in what they can get.

Understand travel insurance and credit card coverage

The Chase Sapphire Reserve and American Express Platinum travel credit cards.

Certain travel credit cards including the Chase Sapphire Reserve and American Express Platinum Card have built-in trip insurance when you book with those cards.

One event that may apply is if you can't reach your destination for at least 24 hours ""due to severe weather (or another covered reason)"" traveler insurer Allianz's website reads.

But not all policies require a 24-hour delay. The ""trip delay reimbursement"" benefit on the Chase Sapphire Reserve provides reimbursement if your travel is delayed more than 6 hours or requires an overnight stay.

This reporter used the reimbursement policy on a recent trip and was covered for all expenses.

Settle in for a long wait – and know when to jump ship

Remember that airlines will be handling the same issues for thousands of customers as well as trying to return to its normal schedule. Long lines and waits will be incredibly common.

Travelers might consider alternate means of transportation if flying doesn't look immediately possible. A rebooked flight might also be canceled or delayed as the airline gets back on its feet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL3NvdXRod2VzdC1sYXVuY2hlcy00LW5ldy1ub25zdG9wLWZsaWdodC1yb3V0ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Launches 4 New Nonstop Flight Routes,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

The two other stores where employees approved union contracts voted Monday. The employees at the Lindbergh and Clayton location at 1500 Lindbergh Blvd. in Ladue voted 12-3 and at the Kingshighway and Chippewa location at 3700 Kingshighway Blvd. employees voted 9-4 according to Mariana Orrego an organizer with the labor union Chicago & Midwest Regional Joint Board of Workers United (CMRJB).

The Chicago & Midwest Regional Joint Board of Workers United (CMRJB) a labor union and affiliate of Washington D.C.-based Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has represented all the local Starbucks employees that have filed for a union representation vote.

Workers United represents more than 86000 workers in the apparel textile industrial laundry food service manufacturing warehouse distribution and nonprofit industries in the U.S. and Canada according to its website.

The employees at the Ladue Starbucks were the first in the area to file a petition through the National Labor Relations Board requesting a vote to approve a union contract in March. Employees at seven other St. Louis-area Starbucks locations followed suit in the weeks following.

The Starbucks unionization push began last year when two locations in Buffalo New York filed for representation. Since then workers at more than 150 company-owned Starbucks locations have followed suit according to CNBC. The Buffalo locations became unionized.

A Starbucks spokesperson said last month ""we're listening and learning from the partners in these stores as we always do across the country.""

""And so with this petition our position has not changed"" the spokesperson said. ""Starbucks success past present and future is built on how we partner together always with our mission and values at our core.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vOTAwODEwL3JlZGRpdC1pcy1zb3VuZGluZy1vZmYtYWJvdXQtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLW9hdG1lYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reddit Is Sounding Off About Starbucks Oatmeal,"Reddit Is Sounding Off About Starbucks Oatmeal

Known for its coffee Starbucks has developed quite the following. In fact Referral Candy calls the chain the ""most popular global coffeehouse."" But as popular as Starbucks may be it isn't without its critics and sometimes its coffee drinkers and employees can be the most critical. Everyone needs a place to vent about the workplace or the food they order from time to time and Reddit seems to be a destination where employees can ""unofficially"" roast a complicated Starbucks order or patrons can express unhappiness over Starbucks' new summer menu. But those aren't the only things they discuss.

Many have taken to this social media community to share their point of view about the chain's loaf cakes and to call the company out for the apparent shrinkage or ""quality control"" of its grilled cheese sandwich. Others have shared inspiring topics like an artistic Starbucks name board of which the internet couldn't get enough. The conversations really run the gamut. Well now the community is sharing its feelings about the coffee shop's oatmeal. This menu offering is leaving some Starbucks employees wondering if it's worth the money — and they are sounding off about it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA2LTE4L25ldy1zdGFyYnVja3MtYmF0aHJvb20tcG9saWN5LWNvdWxkLWxlYXZlLXlvdS13aXRoLW5vd2hlcmUtdG8tZ2_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Starbucks Bathroom Policy Could Leave You With Nowhere to Go,"Why did this happen?

Starbucks has come a long way. Since the first store in Seattle's Pike Place which was advertised only by as per Starbucks itself a ""modest"" 45-year-old sign the Starbucks brand has expanded to over 20000 stores throughout the world. Some stores have taken on local style and ambiance like carved mahogany ceilings and traditional wool fabric found in London cafes or a round community table and copper details in stores in Turkey. When Starbucks Partners began sharing photos of a cafe inside a geometric glass dome we had to learn more.

On average Koreans drink more than 12 cups of coffee per week; Seoul alone has over 18000 coffee shops — the most per capita in the world — and is home to more Starbucks than any other city (via Seoul Inspired). According to Go! Go! Hanguk spending time in cafes is a popular Korean pastime and coffee shops cater to the Instagramming crowd making sure desserts and coffees are worthy of posts and stories. For those looking for unique experiences some cafes have cats dogs and raccoons on the premises (via BoBo and Chichi). Yet even without animals one particular Starbucks seems to be in a league of its own."

Hill grounded out to Blake Grimmer at first base and the Eaglets defeated the Norsemen 1-0 at Michigan State's McLane Stadium to win the Division 1 state championship. St. Mary's finished the season 44-0 capping a dominant first season in Division 1.

""We were trying to not let it affect us the whole season"" said St. Mary's right-hander Cieran Caughey. ""But now that we're here we can kind of look back and say 'Wow we really did that' and really take it in.""

In a tight pitcher's duel both teams' power arms traded miscues before baserunning errors sunk North.

Norsemen left-hander Brennan Hill did everything he could to limit the opposition but his costly first inning pickoff error brought OLSM's Nolan Schubart to third after a single. Then catcher Ike Irish an Auburn commit and potential 2022 MLB draft pick grounded out to shortstop driving in the game's only run.

In six innings Hill finished with three hits allowed and nine strikeouts and was proud of how he competed against likely the best team in the country.

""They've got double-digit Power Five commits"" Hill said admitting some initial nervousness. ""But I just knew that I trusted my stuff and I was in the zone and I was competitive. I knew I could do what I did today.""

North looked poised to tie when Caughey's errant pickoff attempt moved James MacAuley from first to third. After a hit by pitch the Norsemen tried to rundown-scheme St. Mary's.

But OLSM had seen that play four times in other games and practiced for it then picked off MacAuley on Saturday to end the threat.

The throwing error took Caughey a Kent State commit out of the game but he still impressed with nine strikeouts and two hits allowed in 5⅓ innings. In a rotation that includes Brock Porter — a potential first-round draft pick Caughey is sometimes overshadowed though not in his coach's eyes.

""Brock gets a lot of the accolades and certainly well deserved but Cieran's been just as good"" said St. Mary's coach Matt Petry. ""He did an excellent job as he has done throughout his career and especially this season.""

Replacing Caughey Oliver pitched the last 1⅔ innings surrendering one hit and two walks while scrapping for the save. The Norsemen put two runners on in the top of the seventh but Hill was caught in a rundown after a comebacker to Oliver resulting in teammate Cam Schafer being tagged out.

""How they represented Grosse Pointe North and they represented our community brought some pride back to this program and to this school that has been missing for a while"" North first-year coach Kevin Shubnell said. ""And I'll be forever grateful that they believed in what we were trying to preach (and) the culture we were trying to create in this program.""

Two batters after Hill's base path gaffe Oliver induced the final out and Saint Mary's was free to celebrate.

""I know in 10 (or) 20 years I'm gonna be telling everyone about it"" Caughey said. ""Everyone will know I'm a national champion.""

The Friars collected 24 wins under head coach Mike Massa giving this group the record for most wins in a season in school history. They culminated their season with their fifth consecutive CHSAA championship and their second consecutive state title.

“We hit we play good defense we had pitching depth” Massa said. “We knew we were a team everyone was hunting but we had all the necessary ingredients for success.”

St. Anthony's tossed a 12-0 shutout over Archbishop Molloy in the state semifinal and finished the day off with a 10-1 win over St. Mary’s of Lancaster in the final. Those run totals for the opposition were commonplace for a dominant pitching staff. CHSAA pitcher of the year Mila Fiordalisi and Lia Fong anchored a group that tallied 15 shutouts.

Massa described Fiordalisi as a “power pitcher” and Fong as more of a pitcher using “movement and spins”. It’s hard enough to beat one of them but Massa occasionally deploys both in the same game something he did to close out the state final. Fong pitched the first five innings and struck out seven. Then Fiordalisi closed it out.

“I feel confident putting either one of them out there at any given point” Massa said. “Both of them could really respond whenever called and we even had some other girls [Skylar Wicklund and Sarah Bielski] who picked up shutouts.”

Whether they need it or not that duo gets plenty of support from a deep lineup that can swing the bats and track down any ball on defense.

“We have depth and we’re versatile. Anyone of those girls in the lineup was capable of having a big day” coach Massa said. “We even have plenty of girls on the bench who can play.""

Bielski a freshman drove in five runs in the semifinal win over Archbishop Molloy. She then hit a single to score the game’s first run in the final and launched a two-run home run to cap off her day.

“It was a great experience. Those were probably my two best games of the season” Bielski said. “I performed pretty well made some great contact and was able to knock in a bunch of RBIs.”

With a roster that featured six sophomores and three freshmen don’t be surprised to see St. Anthony’s three-peat as state champs next season.

“Our team is full of young talented players so I think we’re going to do really well in the future” Bielski said. “I hope we keep this streak going I think we’ll be able to win again next year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXR5LW9mLWVhc3Qtc3QtbG91aXMtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy02MTgtZGF5LWFuZC1qdW5ldGVlbnRoL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXR5LW9mLWVhc3Qtc3QtbG91aXMtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy02MTgtZGF5LWFuZC1qdW5ldGVlbnRoL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,City of East St. Louis Celebrates 618 Day and Juneteenth,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox2now.com/news/city-of-east-st-louis-celebrates-618-day-and-juneteenth/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXR5LW9mLWVhc3Qtc3QtbG91aXMtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy02MTgtZGF5LWFuZC1qdW5ldGVlbnRoL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXR5LW9mLWVhc3Qtc3QtbG91aXMtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy02MTgtZGF5LWFuZC1qdW5ldGVlbnRoL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmpvdXJuYWwuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTgvY2xhc3MtZC1iYXNlYmFsbC1zdC1kb21zLWhvbGRzLW9uLXRvLWVhcmx5LWxlYWQtdG8tZGVmZWF0LW1hY2hpYXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Class D baseball: St. Dom's holds on to early lead to defeat Machias and win state title,"GORHAM — When Saint Dominic Academy reaches a state baseball championship game the Saints tend to bring the trophy home and that’s just what they did Saturday.

The Saints defeated Machias 3-1 for the Class D state championship at Ed Flaherty Field at the University of Southern Maine.

They won their past four state championship appearances in 2007 2009 2011 and 2015 which all came in Class C. In all the Saints have won six state championships winning in the 2005 Class C state championship before losing in the 2006 state final.

“It’s been seven years since we’ve won one and this is my first one down this way” said St. Dom’s coach Bob Blackman who has been on the coaching staff for all six championships. “The other five were all (won) up in Bangor. It was good to take that monkey off our back and win one down this way.”

This was Machias’ second-straight Class D state championship appearance. The Bulldogs lost to Searsport in 2021.

The Bulldogs hope to make a few more state championship appearances in the coming years.

“It was a good baseball game St. Dom’s is a great team” Machias coach Sam Whitney said. “It would be nice to have some games like that against them in the future. They are a very young team so I know they will be back and we have some great young talent coming up through so I think it could lead to a rematch.”

Much of Saturday’s action took place in the opening inning.

The leadoff hitter for the Bulldogs (16-3) Kason Fergerson sent a line drive to center field to start the game off with a bang.

St. Dom’s starter Ashton Hammond got Kashman Feeney and Jayden Rhodes to fly out to center. Machias’ cleanup hitter Kyle Anderson sent a line drive to the right-field gap that scored Fergerson from first.

“We got a hit to fall which we couldn’t do the rest of the game” Whitney said. “We hit the ball well but it was right at them. They made some plays as you can see. We out-hit them 6-2.”

The top of the first ended with Hammond striking out Ethan Foss.

The Saints’ (10-8) top of the order Timothee Ouellette and Miles Frenette each reached base. Both runners stole second base and cleanup hitter Tanner Berry-Hart singled up the middle to score both for a 2-1 lead.

Berry-Hart didn’t think his two RBIs would hold up.

“I thought we were going to get more (runs) but it worked out” Berry-Hart said. “I wasn’t expecting to score two but I was expecting one when I was up to bat. I knew I had a job to do.”

Berry-Hart stole second base with Thomas Casserly at the plate but starting pitcher Feeney picked him off at second to end the inning.

Blackman said he thought the game could have been a slugfest after that first inning with the number of pitches both pitchers had thrown the past week and a half.

“I think both pitchers weren’t 100 percent coming off of 10 days of baseball” Blackman said. “We kept making plays and once we did that and made plays we didn’t have to strike out everybody.”

Hammond settled down in the second and third innings only facing seven batters across the two frames.

“They are a good team; their top four hitters can get the bat on the ball” Hammond said. “I was a little nervous but I settled in the second inning.”

A big turning point in the game according to Blackman came in the third inning when Saints catcher Ridge Dionne threw out Rhodes at second base.

“That basically set the tone they weren’t going to run on us” Blackman said.

The Saints loaded the bases again in the bottom of the fourth and a Miles Frennette walk drove in Curtis Wheeler to give St. Dom’s a 3-1 lead. It was the lone run the Bulldogs gave up in the inning.

“We only went 1-2-3 in one inning” Blackman said. “If we could have got the clutch hit we probably could have blown it open.”

The fourth was the last inning Machias’ starter Kasman Feeney pitched. In four innings of work he allowed three runs on two hits and had six strikeouts. Kyle Anderson threw two innings of relief allowing no hits and striking out two.

After Hammond hit Foss with a pitch Ouellette came on in relief with one out in the top of the fifth. Brayden Barker singled but he couldn’t get back to first in time on a Kasen Fergerson pop-out which ended the inning.

Machias had another inning-ending double play in the sixth.

“We had two double plays that killed any momentum that we had” Whitney said.

Hammond who came back to pitch at the start of the sixth inning got the Bulldogs to go down in order in the top of the seventh to end the game.

Hammond went 6 1/3 innings allowing five hits with three strikeouts and a hit batter.

When Hammond was taken out in the fifth inning Blackman told him he would be back on the bump to finish the game.

“I was told I would go back in” Hammond said. “I just needed to cool down. A big game a lot of nerves. Also a lot of pitches were thrown the last week so I definitely had a tired arm.”

For instance the U.S. Army is planning to use a number of “gateway” technologies in its upcoming Project Convergence experiment to quickly connect air ground and even surface nodes and attack platforms to one another in real-time. One such system slated for Project Convergence 2022 is the Vertex Corporations Gateway Mission Router 1000 a technology that enables interfaces between otherwise incompatible transmission formats.

Using upgradeable commercial-off-the-shelf systems a Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) consisting of common intellectual property standards interfaces and protocols and a small eight-pound hardware device Vertex has engineered a vehicle-transportable gateway system able to translate otherwise incompatible formats.

Pat Renwick senior director at The Vertex Company told The National Interest in an interview that soldiers can “seamlessly log in.” In an abbreviated sense GMR configures “1s” and “0s” in a manner that allows otherwise disconnected information systems to both secure transmission and enable paradigm-changing levels of technological interoperability.

“You can start and maintain the situational awareness that you had before in the battle space with your software defined radios. You can jump in a Stryker Bradley or helicopter and you've got the ability to maintain that connectivity to the battlespace and to your compatriots basically being able to see an action on any feed that was available to you on that network” Renwick explained. GMR-1000 uses standard WiFi Ethernet Serial 1553 ICS and ARINC-429 hardware interface protocols. The vehicle-integrated GMR-1000 uses a Gigabit Ethernet Switch with a five-port router and what Vertex data calls “authentication servers.”

As part of ongoing development and extended software upgrades Vertex developers are seeking to align and enable the kind of artificial intelligence(AI)-enabled connectivity central to Project Convergence; GMR-1000 is slated to participate in the U.S. Army’s upcoming Project Convergence 2022.

“We will marry this up in the future with AI and set up the structure to give the best decision aids for that operator. And for that warfighter basically taking stuff off his plate and providing him actionable information that is stored and parsed appropriately for what he's doing at the time. They need anything that cuts down that fog and friction of war and GMR is one of those products” Renwick explained.

With a hardware form factor of roughly eight pounds the GMR-1000 is designed to be what developers call low SWAP or size weight and power. This means the system can integrate into drones helicopters and ground vehicles without adding weight or requiring a large hardware footprint.

“It's very small with low SWAP. It is able to be installed in a very small package size that is able to seamlessly fit within the tech spaces available in those types of platforms and vehicles. Right now we’ve got an installed rack that was developed for adding capability into the UH-60M (Black Hawk)” Renwick explained.

For instance we have our own way of spelling things pronouncing things and doing things. What may be the norm around here just might be totally bananas somewhere else. For example what do you see in this field? If you're not from Louisiana you might see cow poop or dirt mounds. If you are from Louisiana you see a feast waiting to happen!

Canada SailGP completed the first day of racing of the second round of Season 3 of SailGP topping the leaderboard in the T-Mobile United States Sail Grand Prix.

They did the same on the first day of Season 3 in Bermuda much to the chagrin of the more established teams - who were shown the way around the Great Sound in Bermuda by a team having its first racing in SailGP.

The ""Crazy Canucks"" posted a remarkable 411 scorecard after three races of just over 10 minutes sailing in a 14kt breeze.

""We were trying to set our expectations low but we keep blowing them out of the water. It's tricky"" said skipper Phil Robertson reflecting on the day's racing.

Excellence in starting was the key to the Canadian's performance. The ""Crazy Canucks"" lived up to their self-styled sobriquet showing little respect for the rockstars of the sailing world who made up the nine-boat fleet.

[The ""Crazy Canucks"" was the nickname for a group of World Cup alpine ski racers from Canada who rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. They earned themselves a reputation for fast and seemingly reckless skiing in the downhill event. Their exploits were encapsulated in a 2004 movie called the ""Crazy Canucks"" based on the team's history.]

""I guess our team has come from a similar background and story"" Robertson said of the new Crazy Canucks moniker that has appeared on the F50.

""I guess it's been a bit of a saying in our team that we're not too dissimilar to them. And we're crazy enough. Our whole team's crazy. We've taken that tagline on and put it into action.""

The prime position on the line was at the Committee boat end starting with pace and judging the time on distance to the start with great precision.

Double America's Cup champion Olympic Gold and double Silver medalist Peter Burling went for that startline spot in Race 1 and continued on for a reasonably comfortable win.

The Canadians owned that slot for the next two races timing their run to perfection and continuing to win both races.

""Yes the start was the key to success today. We managed to do a pretty good job of getting off the line in good shape and pushing over the whole fleet. It makes it easy after Mark 1 if you're in front.

""The key to winning races is really at the start"" he added.

Coy about starting secrets

Robertson wouldn't spill the beans on exactly how they achieved two perfect starts in the second and third races. ""We've worked quite hard on our communication loop and being a new team you've got to focus on that.

""I think we're communicating well around the whole track. And that's that goes into the start as well. And I guess my background is quite suited for a start box like that where there are some interesting features like the breakwater.""

The startline at Chicago is set just outside the harbour breakwater and its effect is similar to a pitlane start in F1.

In SailGP the F50's have to make a call about where and when to exit through the breakwater and charge at the start line. It's not for the faint-hearted and fortune certainly favours the brave.

""I felt like it was easy. It's easy to know what to do and where to be. And we managed to execute it pretty well"" Robertson reflected on two start and race wins.

""The whole fleet has exactly the same onboard software"" Robertson explained. ""So everyone's getting the same information.

""What changes is that three minutes before the start a rolling three-minute average of all the wind is used to make all the time on distance and other starting calculations. So that's quite I guess that's quite key. ""

""You also need to know whether the software is a bit behind or ahead for each day.""

""Position at the start is key. That's huge. The other key focus is to be fast. We knew it was quite tight from the pin and boats will be slow down there. So we knew there was a huge opportunity to be up the line. And if you're fast you'll get over and we managed to push the boat really well on the reaches to make sure we got over the fleet. To be able to round Mark 1 in the top three in the fleet is huge.""

Hard lessons in Race 1

The Canadians started Race 1 in the middle of the line and paid the price of having to contend with turbulent air from the boats to windward.

""Race 1 was interesting. We got a good start and executed our plan. I guess. We were in second closing on Mark 1 when we got into a tricky situation with boats gybing off to starboard diving down inside us and holding us to a straight course. It was a bit of a new one.

""We didn't execute it well as a crew - sailing with two boards down and having to sail a straight course until we had room to turn down. That stitched us up but we managed to sail back through the fleet. The key was to keep the tactics super simple.

""We managed to do two tacks instead of three on one of the beats which everyone else had to do. That set us up to be different to the main pack. When you're in the middle of that fleet we try not to be dictated to by other boats. So being free and by yourself and able to sail your own race is a big part of it.""

Upwind the race course didn't seem to have a favoured side allowing the crews more latitude in race strategy if they had to play catch-up.

""It was pretty even. I was a little bit surprised about that. Because obviously the city front was right there. And there is a big Navy Pier sticking out into the course which tends to create quite a big wind shadow.

""But it seemed to be fairly even everywhere you went. And to be honest I don't think you could ask for a better day in Chicago.

""With that race track and where we were racing it's the perfect conditions and with 14 knots of breeze and flat water and coming out of the north running up and down the city front made ideal racing.

""There were probably 20-degree shifts maximum. So you're constantly keeping an eye on it and tracking it and knowing what phase you're in and I guess playing your course - based off that and whether you're in a fast mode or a high mode and where we're positioning against other boats. When we were racing the changes in the breeze didn't seem huge but they were definitely there.

""The pressure was up and down mainly around Mark 1 maybe due to the Navy Pier. It also seemed to drop off towards the left side of the course and the boundary there was a little patchy. The right side of the course was usually constant in wind pressure. We had to be a little bit careful going to the left.""

Catch-up doesn't go to plan

Chicago was just CanadaSailGP's second regatta following their first in Bermuda last month. The team blew their first day's practice capsizing their wingsailed catamaran just a few minutes after starting the session while still strapped alongside their chase boat.

""We had a challenging lead-up to this event"" Robertson told Sail-World. ""Five minutes before Race 1 it was still not going 100% to plan.

""The second practice day was super light. And we managed to sail with four crew which we've never done before. So it was a new day for our team and very challenging.

""For us it has been a case of one step back and two forward in the lead-up to the event. But today I think it was a real testament to the team of how well they've learned and being able to pull it out on race day. Our recovery in Race 1 one was pretty cool to see.""

Between Bermuda and Chicago the Crazy Canuks took advantage of sharing everyone's data along with seeing the onboard footage and audio comments.

""That's but it's a huge shout-out for all the newer teams and you can learn a lot"" says Robertson. ""The top teams are doing it as well and you can spend endless hours watching and learning. We also went to Portugal to do some more training on the water in our GC32 and spent two days in the simulator in Belfast.""

""We're spending much of that simulator time developing depth into our squad as well. We're not probably not using it with the race team as such but more just as a development platform for new team members.""

""The purpose of the GC32 training is to develop everyone's skill set around foiling and knowledge. It's been really beneficial for that.""

Women crew 'a massive benefit'

Skipper Phil Robertson (NZL) and wingsail trimmer Chris Draper (GBR) raced today with four Canadian nationals.

Olympic 49er campaigner Georgia Lewin-Lafrance performs the co-pilot and strategist role. Billy Gooderham is the flight controller. Tom Ramshaw is a forward-facing grinder and we rotate the two powerhouses Jareese Finch and ex-American Magic grinder Tim Hornsby.

""The two internationals make us competitive and facilitate the learning of the others"" Robertson explains. Not all teams sail with a co-pilot behind the driver.

""We came in with a fresh approach and managed to figure out a way to utilise our female athletes in the way we sail the boat and helping hugely with all the technical and strategic planning and communication.

""A point of difference between the more established teams and ours is how our co-pilot/strategist plays a big role in fleet management and ensuring we aren't in a collision situation. It is a massive benefit having women sailors on board that's for sure.""

With the forecast being light for the second day of racing Robertson says they will have a reset overnight.

""Tomorrow is forecast to be an entirely different day. We're going to have the 29-metre (light weather) wing. So it's straight back to the drawing board and figure out how we handle that because we've never done that as a team.

""We're going into a race day with a boat configuration that we've never sailed before and conditions in which we've probably never sailed. And possibly a crew configuration with which we have probably never previously raced.""

""In the state we are in at the moment every day is a completely new day for our team. So it's a big learning opportunity for our team.

""Thankfully we probably put in quite a solid day today to set us up for tomorrow.""

It was another great day for team founder Fred Pye. ""He's pretty pumped after today's results"" says Robertson.

""He's a very passionate guy and quite emotional. So he travels the ups and the downs- and he's obviously on a bit of a high at the moment. So it's cool.""

""He's also very realistic and knows that it's a sport and a day like today is to be cherished and enjoyed. Tomorrow is a new day where we need a new focus. So he's a good man. He's down to earth.""

With 27pts Canada sits on top of the points table after Day 1. Great Britain skippered by five-time Olympic medalist Ben Ainslie is second just one point behind with 26pts. A much improved New Zealand team comprising the crew who won the last two America's Cup is third overall with 23pts. The Season 1 and 2 SailGP champion Tom Slingsby (AUS) with a crew of former America's Cup champions is fourth on 21 points.

Two races will be sailed tomorrow with the top three progressing to a three boat winner takes all final.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL3NhaWwtZ3JhbmQtcHJpeC1jaGljYWdvLXNhaWxpbmctbmF2eS1waWVyLWxha2UtbWljaGlnYW4vMTE5Njk1NTgv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3Y2hpY2Fnby5jb20vYW1wL3NhaWwtZ3JhbmQtcHJpeC1jaGljYWdvLXNhaWxpbmctbmF2eS1waWVyLWxha2UtbWljaGlnYW4vMTE5Njk1NTgv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sailing GP: Sail Grand Prix kicks off at Chicago's Navy Pier,"Chicago marks the first time Sail GP's global championship races on fresh water this weekend.

Few companies have been closer to the forefront of this advancement than Square. Let’s take a look at the Square business model to get a deeper understanding of how this amazing company operates.

A brief history of Square

Square is a subsidiary of Block Inc. (formerly Square Inc.) the brainchild of Jack Dorsey (Twitter co-founder and former CEO) and Jim McKelvey (current Chair of the St. Louis Fed). The company is a financial services and digital payments firm which was founded by the duo in 2009 and launched its first product in 2010.

They currently hold about 53% of the market share with a clientele base of over 2 million merchants. The company was initially formed in response to the difficulties encountered by customers and merchants when trying to make payments across different platforms and offered a more streamlined approach.

However it has since expanded to include a host of other products and services such as Square Payroll Square Market Square Capital and so on. Through these subsidiaries it has since gone from simply offering easy-to-use payment processing services to including inventory services sales tracking analytics software financial services general and administrative services and much more.

Who Owns Square

Even though Block Inc. was founded by Dorsey and McKelvey it became a publicly-traded company in 2015. The largest shareholders include Jack Dorsey (12.7%) Morgan Stanley (6.8%) Vanguard Group Inc. (6.3%) T. Rowe Price (3.4%) and Jennison Associates (3.4%).

Square’s Mission Statement

The Square mission statement states: “We believe that every individual must have an equal chance to build themselves in the economic world. We believe that the economy of any country and the world grows collectively when every citizen has access to the economic world. Therefore we aim to make commerce easy for everyone”.

Their vision statement says: “We are here to assist businesses of all scales and sizes. We will help them to start function and then grow towards a better future in economies. And we do it because we believe that the growth of one business is the growth of every other business”.

How Square makes money

Let’s take a closer look at some of the key income streams of Square below.

Service Fees

The platform charges a service fee or transaction fee on many of the services offered by its subsidiaries. For example Square’s standard processing fee is 2.6% + 10¢ for contactless payments. Payments that are made via manually keyed-in transactions have a 3.5% + 15¢ fee.

Subscription Fees

Several Square subsidiaries and packages offer monthly subscription fees as well.

Hardware Sales Revenue

The company also sells a line of hardware products like the Square Stand Square Card readers for NFC and EMV chip cards barcode scanners receipts printers cash drawers and so on. Square uses a blade and razor approach which means that the hardware is usually sold at a loss or below market price while profits are made through the revenue generated via the service fees of using Square services like Cash App Square Debit Card and so on.

By Issuing MCAs to Other Businesses

Merchant Cash Advances (MCAs) are a form of non-traditional loans which offer guarantees on the “sale of future income”. This means that in exchange for giving small businesses loans upfront Square recoups a portion of this debt directly from digital payments made to the business.

Software and Data Product Revenue

Square also gains revenue through the sale of its various software and data tracking products such as inventory software data analytics programs payroll software and POS software.

Two sources told Axios about Stadia’s involvement in these games in a report published yesterday (June 17) with neither The Quarry nor High On Life having any publication connections to Google Stadia as of publication.

The sources say that both titles were initially being billed as major flagship releases for Stadia but that the cloud streaming service’s change in direction shifted focus away from these games.

Back in 2020 The Quarry developer Supermassive Games announced a partnership with Google Stadia although when the game was announced there was no word of any partnership exclusivity.

According to Axios a Take-Two representative (which published The Quarry) said that Supermassive Games “was looking for a publishing partner as the project came to completion” whilst a Google representative didn’t reply to a request for comment and a Squanch Games representative (the developer of High On Life) gave nothing away either.

The Quarry is the next ‘80s horror movie-inspired title from Supermassive Games which sees camp counsellors at the end of summer getting involved with some grizzly goings-on when left alone for the night.

In our three-out-of-five star review for the game we said: “Despite a slow start The Quarry delivers even more ways to feel terrible when your actions fail a tropey teen (or six). It’s not as scary as Until Dawn but there’s so much love for the horror genre and you’ll definitely want to dive in to see how it could all have played out.”

In a statement Void Interactive blamed a ""suggested trademark infringement"" for the downtime and apologized for the issues hoping it ""was not too inconvenient"" for players.

It took two days for the studio to fully detail why the game have been taken offline in the first place. After it had been mysteriously pulled on June 16 Void Interactive finally released a statement yesterday saying that it wanted to ""address the rumors surrounding the takedown of Ready or Not"".

""A takedown request was issued via Steam concerning a suggested trademark infringement in our recent Night Club map that was shared as part of our most recent Steam update"" the team said. ""We take IP concerns very seriously and in a show of good faith we have decided to remove the subject materials and any reference to them from Ready or Not and from any of our social media or other publications.

""Ready or Not will return to the Steam store once we complete the changes"" the statement continued. ""We have also removed the AI update video from our YouTube channel and from our Steam Store page and anticipate that these will be restored after an editing process is completed.""

That didn't seem to take Void Interactive long as later that same day the developer tweeted again confirming that the shooter was ""once again available"".

Void didn't detail what precisely the trademark issue was all about but some players who got to try the update before it was pulled have suggested it may have been because the fictional nightclub - called ""Prysm"" in the game - was a touch too similar to that of a UK nightclub chain of the same name (thanks NME ).

Grand Theft Auto's relationship with Scotland has been heavily documented and alluded to in the games with Dundee the Forth Road Bridge and comedian Frankie Boyle all making an appearance in the franchise however it's connection with Aberdeen is somewhat forgotten.

Leslie Benzies was born in Aberdeen before he moved away to Elgin where he taught himself how to code aged 11.

The Aberdonian made the move to DMA Design now the famous Rockstar North which was based in Dundee in 1995. He was the lead developer of the Nintendo 64 hit 'Space Station Silicon Valley.'

Up until that point the Grand Theft Auto franchise was four games in including two spin-offs but none of the instalments had shook the foundations of the industry.

In 1998 Benzies was given the reigns to assemble a team to create GTA III. This move would be revolutionary for the gaming industry as Benzies produced a truly earth-shattering game.

Upon it's release in 2001 it was met with critical acclaim for it's 3D open world and mature story line. The title would win a number of accolades such as Game of the Year and is widely believed to be one of the most important video games to ever hit stores.

It was the first in the franchise to break 10 million sales worldwide hitting a total of 17 million but this was merely the beginning for the Aberdonian who would go onto produce another nine titles within the franchise.

His next massive success came four years later with GTA: San Andreas which became the highest ever selling game for PlayStation 2 taking in $235million within the first week and selling 27.5million copies worldwide.

For his contribution to gaming Benzies received a special Bafta in 2005 however he was just getting started.

Benzies returned to his developing roots when he delved into Wild West epic 'Red Dead Redemption'. The Elgin native took up the role of lead developer in what would later be named one of the most expansive video games ever made.

After it's release in 2010 it picked up numerous awards and was nominated for the title of game of the decade.

However it was the most recent instalment in the GTA franchise that would be Benzies' most successful piece of work.

GTA V hit the shelves in 2013 and was quickly snatched off them by gamers. Within 24 hours the game had made $815million making it the fastest selling entertainment product in history.

A total of 135 million copies were sold worldwide more than five times the numbers of the last instalment.

However following the release of Rockstar North's most successful game of all time the relationship between Benzies and the company broke down.

The former President of Rockstar North sued the parent company Take-Two Interactive Software Inc for $150million after he claimed he was forced out of the business.

After a three year legal battle both sides came to an agreement over compensation and now Benzies has moved onto pastures new with his own developers Build a Rocket Boy Games who are set to release 'Everywhere' soon which has been dubbed the 'GTA Killer'."

In this article we focus on three proposals that may impact non-Israeli residents who own residential homes in Israel.

Land Appreciation Tax (“Mas Shevach” in Hebrew) is a type of capital gains tax levied on sellers of real estate in Israel.

Background – old linear tax

Due to past legislative changes Land Appreciation Tax rates vary over the period of ownership. This necessitates splitting the total period of ownership pro rata into the respective numbers of days on a “linear” basis. It is a number-of-days arithmetic split without revaluing the property on each date. And that is after adjusting the gain for inflation up to the end of 1993. Construction at the entrance of Jerusalem (credit: MARC ISRAEL SELLEM/THE JERUSALEM POST)

An individual (not a corporation) selling non-residential real estate is subject to Land Appreciation Tax on taxable gains at the following rates: gain accruing up to November 6 2001 – regular rates up to 50%; gain accruing from November 7 2011 to December 31 2011 – 20%-23%; gain accruing since January 1 2012 – 25%-28% (we refer to the above tax rates and rules as the “Old Linear Tax”).

Background – homes in Israel

Under the current law enacted in 2013 Israeli and foreign residents who sell a home in Israel are granted a “Better Linear Tax Reduction.” This means exemption for the gain accruing up to December 31 2013 calculated on a time-apportionment basis. Any gain accruing since January 1 2014 is generally taxed at rates of 25%-28%. There are circumstances in which an individual may be exempt from Land Appreciation Tax altogether when selling a home in Israel. Generally non-Israeli residents are not entitled to such an exemption unless they can prove that they do not own a home in their country of residence (but they can rent).

Proposed changes

The Bill proposes various changes including:

1. Denying a non-resident the Better Linear Tax Reduction.

This proposal means that a non-Israeli resident selling a home in Israel acquired before 2014 would be required to pay Land Appreciation Tax spanning the entire period in which the gain accrued. In other words a non-Israeli resident selling a residential home in Israel would be subject to Israeli tax according to the Old Linear Tax rules. Advertisement

For example: Suppose an individual bought an Israeli home on January 1 1990 for NIS 100000 and sells it now for NIS 2000000. If that person is granted the Better Linear Tax Reduction he would pay Land Appreciation Tax of approximately NIS 105000. However if that person is taxed according to the Old Linear Tax rules he would pay Land Appreciation Tax of approximately NIS 515000.

2. No sale exemption at all – This is proposed for a non-Israeli resident even if that person does not own a home in his country of residence. This proposal means a non-Israeli resident would be required to pay Land Appreciation tax under the Old Linear Tax rules.

3. No rental exemption – According to the current law if a person rents out one or more homes in Israel and the total monthly rent does not exceed NIS 5196 (in 2022) that person may be exempt from Israeli income tax thereon. The Bill proposes to deny this exemption to a non-Israeli resident.

Timing

The Bill proposes to introduce these amendments on 1st of January 2024.

Comments

It seems these proposals might be considered discriminatory under Israel’s tax treaties.

With regards to purchase tax no change is proposed in the Bill. A non-Israeli resident purchasing a residential home would generally remain subject to purchase tax ranging from 8% to 10%.

Furthermore non-Israeli resident sellers (and US immigrants) should check whether they are liable to tax in their home country and whether they can claim a credit for the Israeli tax under a tax treaty with Israel or domestic tax law in the home country.

To conclude if you are a non-Israeli resident who owns residential property in Israel and you are contemplating selling it it may be wise to consider doing so before the end of 2023.

Please note the Bill is still being legislated and it remains to be seen what will be enacted and when.

As always consult experienced legal and tax advisers in each country at an early stage in specific cases.

Children and teenagers are essential cogs in a machine that is now drawing the attention of French lawmakers.

In March 2021 Roblox Corporation's $46 billion initial public offering was big news in the video game industry. The US-based company started in 2004 with the simple idea of a platform for games created and tested by the players themselves. It is now one of the most popular companies in the world both among investors and gamers. In the first quarter of 2022 some 54.1 million users including 15 million in Europe logged on to Roblox every day. That figure is up more than 28% over the last year according to the firm's latest balance sheet.

Roblox is targeting a very specific audience though. Nearly half (47% in early 2022) of the platform's users are under the age of 13 making it one of the most popular video game services among children and teenagers. While Roblox is distinct from its competitors in the simplistic designs of the games in its catalog it is above all the functioning of its online environment that appeals to the youngest users. On this community platform anyone can create and host their own game (Roblox prefers the term ""experience"") for free using development tools designed for beginners.

Therefore all the company has to do is administer its platform maintain servers and update its development software while it capitalizes on the games built by its very large number of apprentice developers a large majority of whom are minors. Le Monde took an interest in the fate of these young internet users who keep Roblox's video game empire alive by being both the labor force and target consumers of an Uberized economic model.

'Roblox is full of microtransactions'

Offering players the opportunity to build the games they themselves play is nothing new. Minecraft (Mojang Studios) Garry's Mod (Facepunch Studios) or more recently Fortnite (Epic Games) with its creative mode have all operated this way. At Roblox all you have to do is type a few lines of code into the free Roblox Studio software and publish your ""experience"" to be listed on the official website accessible from any web browser. It's child's play.

But even though all the games in Roblox's vast catalog are free the notion of money is omnipresent. The platform even has its own money Robux a virtual currency indexed on the dollar that allows its players to buy all sorts of optional content (clothes accessories development plug-ins etc.). These microtransactions are an integral part of Roblox's business model especially in the so-called pay-to-win ""experiences"" or those featuring loot boxes the famous virtual surprise bags containing prizes varying in value.

Designed by FXCollaborative and developed by Alchemy-ABR Investment Partners and Chelsea 23rd Realty Corporation an LLC affiliated with JJ Operating the 173-foot-tall structure will yield 132700 square feet with 190 rental apartments and multiple levels of retail space on the lower floors. Leeding Builders Group is the general contractor and Square Mile Capital and Pacific Western Bank provided $183 million in construction financing for the Midtown Manhattan project which is located along Eighth Avenue between West 23rd and West 24th Streets.

At the time of our last update in mid-January demolition of the former low-rise occupants of the plot was still ongoing with the structures standing two stories above street level. Excavation progressed quickly through the spring season and crews are now in the process of forming the reinforced concrete foundation walls and multi-level foundation slab with only a minor amount of excavation remaining. Steel rebar protrudes where the inner columns and walls will soon be poured.

Several black steel frames have been put in place against sections of the foundation walls for temporary support. We could likely see the superstructure begin to rise above street level in a few more months followed by the topping out of the edifice sometime next year.

The following photographs were taken in early June.

Below is an aerial photograph of the area from late April showing multiple excavators working behind the sidewalk fencing.

The rendering in the main photo illustrates a relatively tall design clad in contrasting light and dark paneling framing a staggered grid of floor-to-ceiling windows. A U-shaped setback around the middle of the building separates the podium from the upper floors and a landscaped rooftop and mechanical bulkhead sit on top. A pocketed open-air terrace sits behind a tall column on the northeastern corner of the building.

However our recent visit shows a different iteration represented in a black-and-white elevation diagram of the main western façade.

This drawing closely resembles the envelope and setback layout in the following renderings seen on loopnet.com. The web page dates them from February 2021 and depicts Target anchoring the southern end of the ground floor with smaller commercial spaces to the north. Above are subtly recessed floor-to-ceiling windows arranged in an asymmetrical layout of rectangular and square cutouts. Dark mullions further divide much of the glass surface.

YIMBY last reported that the development will contain 33000 square feet of ground-floor and below-grade retail space with Target occupying 28000 square feet. Residential amenities will include a roof-level terrace an additional outdoor terrace on the second floor a fitness center a communal lounge a speakeasy touchless elevator and lobby access and a bicycle room.

258-278 Eighth Avenue is slated for completion on May 16 2024 as noted on the construction board.

India’s largest city and de facto financial centre could lead the way in India’s low-carbon economic transition through inspired and innovative action.

Collaboration among stakeholders will be key to reach this ambitious target.

Cities account for over 70% of global carbon emissions. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require rapid and far-reaching transitions in urban areas. It is heartening to see the recent announcement by Mumbai to become net-zero by 2050 – the first Asian city to commit to such an ambitious target on climate action.

Given the importance of such climate initiatives in sprawling metros Mumbai has the unique potential to embark on a larger bolder mission to steer the entire nation toward an inclusive resilient and net-zero future. Mumbai the financial centre

Mumbai is home to large corporations banks and financial institutions. It is also the nerve centre of financial regulations in the country. This ecosystem has enormous potential to shape India’s future. The flag bearers at the helm of these institutions can influence India’s climate actions. Show Full Article

Collective action by key stakeholders can make a meaningful change to decarbonize the economy. There is a need for consensus to establish partnerships for climate actions and the city can facilitate the creation of such a tightly knit cohesive sector-specific peer group. This coordination of different stakeholders can enable dialogue build consensus promote shared knowledge expand expertise consolidate existing initiatives and document and transfer best practices.

It is imperative for the city to play an important role in bringing the stakeholders together. The city can form a leadership group with members from financial and non-financial companies. For example all the banks and financial institutions with headquarters in the city can form a coalition to facilitate financing for net-zero targets.

As divestment in carbon-emitting businesses continues engagement with corporates is the best strategy to decarbonize the economy. As a group they can engage with their borrowers to facilitate the transition towards net-zero. They can set and follow uniform net-zero lending and investing standards to motivate borrowers to make business decisions to achieve net-zero. They can collectively move through proxy votes and proposals concerning climate change thereby influencing the corporate business practices.

The leadership group can coordinate with policymakers and regulators based in Mumbai to build the right policy and regulatory mechanism to reduce carbon intensity over time.

The example of Paris

Mumbai should emulate Paris in providing climate leadership for the region. Paris seized the opportunity to host one of the most seminal climate-action episodes in humanity’s history namely COP21. Paris’ emergence as a location of choice was thanks to it being the capital of a country that has to a large extent decarbonized its electricity. About 90% of France’s electricity supply comes from clean energy sources like nuclear hydrogen wind and solar. Mumbai in turn can summon diverse stakeholders for decisive climate action.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) armed with its Mumbai Climate Action Plan 2022 is best positioned to initiate such a move. It can provide a collaborative platform to facilitate action-oriented dialogue among corporates financial actors and financial regulators. BMC can bring civil societies research institutions and NGOs together to collaborate.

A Climate-Action-Council (CAC) can be formed through this collaborative platform which will take the climate actions of the coalitions forward. BMC can ensure the success of its unique endeavour by becoming an active contributor to the CAC’s resource pool. It can provide smart incentives to corporates based in Mumbai and provide partial relaxation/rebate/reduction of property tax to organizations that pledge and deliver on the milestones towards achieving net-zero.

BMC’s critical role in Mumbai’s electricity distribution and public mobility sectors (through Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking) provides it with unique and powerful levers to offer tangible financial incentives to boost faster adoption of climate-smart actions by corporates and their employees. Moreover it can offer at concessional rates outdoor advertisement avenues on BEST vehicles bus stops street furniture and digital billboards to showcase climate actions. Such initiatives can entice more stakeholders to join the net-zero march."

Or follow us on Google News

My wife and I enjoy road trip vacations. We’ve driven in all 50 states. On our last big road trip in 2018 we left our home in San Marcos California drove to British Columbia and turned east until we got to Nova Scotia. Then we wound our way south and west until we got home. That took 8 weeks in our Honda CRV. We decided that was a little too long.

In 2022 we had a specific list of people rather than places that we really wanted to see and we didn’t want to take 8 weeks. That meant we would spend a lot of time on boring/terrifying interstates which we usually avoid. Fortunately for me my wife doesn’t mind doing most of the driving on freeways. We had just traded in our 2019 Model 3 Standard Range for a Long Range (358 mile) version with FSD (not Beta). So we made a plan.

THE ROAD TRIP: I had recently made contact with two friends I hadn’t seen in over 50 years (I’m 75) one in Maryland and one in Cape Cod Massachusetts. On the way we decided to see old friends in Houston (with a side trip to see the new Tesla plant in Austin) and South Carolina. And on the way back we’d see family in West Virginia and an old friend of my wife’s in Colorado. And we threw in a visit to Cape Hatteras just for us. Plotting it out we set a goal of no more than 28 days and it looked doable as long as we were willing to put in a lot of 500+ mile days between visits. In the end we had 10 layover days and 15 drive-all-day days. We drove through 28 states.

THE CAR: We traded in our 2019 Model 3 for two main reasons: longer range and better sound insulation — the two most important features for road trips. But we also got a better sound system faster computer (AMD chip) more efficient heating (octovalve!) all-wheel drive faster acceleration and — surprising to us — noticeably better handling. We didn’t think it could get better than what we had but it is SO sure-footed. It performed beautifully the whole trip with never a problem. The only maintenance was rotating the tires after we got back.

THE DRIVE: Typically we’d make about 2 to 4 Supercharger stops on a 500-mile day. Our longest leg without stopping to charge was 199 miles. Obviously we could have gone further but why? We have grown to love the rhythm of a Tesla road trip stopping every 2 or 3 hours to charge for 20–30 minutes go for a walk find a bathroom get something to eat switch drivers and maybe watch YouTube or Netflix. We’re refreshed and ready for another 2 or 3 hours. We were on Autopilot (FSD but not Beta) 95% of the time on the interstates. We are so much more relaxed when we don’t have to steer and we just have to be aware of who’s around us. The result was we were much more relaxed at the end of the day than in our ICE car days. Another advantage of shorter legs is that we never charged the car beyond 310 miles range about 86% and usually kept it to about 280 max. The battery charges faster and it’s healthier for the battery.

AUTOPILOT: The only Autopilot features we used on our road trip were autosteer and automatic lane changes. People without FSD won’t have lane changing which is a real convenience since you don’t have to take it out of Autopilot to change lanes. Still autosteer is the most important feature by far. Of course we’re constantly monitoring the situation but it’s so much more relaxing when you don’t have to worry about staying in your lane or slowing down for the car in front. We often took it out of Autopilot usually for brief periods. It’s so conservative! When traffic is thick and cars are cutting in and out we often switched to manual to make a lane change more aggressively than Autopilot would. Also I really wish it would move over more in the lane when a truck is close to the line beside us but it seems to want to stay right in the center until it really has to move. We often took it out of Autopilot and moved over at those times. And phantom braking continues to be a problem once or twice a day. We got really good at responding immediately by pressing the accelerator.

SUPERCHARGING COSTS: We stopped at 62 Superchargers spending $740.21. That works out to about $0.09/mile which is about half what I’d pay for gas in my ICE car. Charging at home I pay $0.09/kW which is just over $0.02/mile. The cheapest rate was $0.21/kW in Philadelphia while several western states charged $0.40/kW. Louisiana Mississippi Alabama and Georgia charge by the minute. I had heard of this but wasn’t aware of how I was being charged until later when I reviewed my charges in my Tesla account. It’s weird! For example this is how Georgia charged me according to Tesla:

1 min @ $0.12/min

14 min @ $0.31/min

10 min @ $0.58/min

1 min @ $0.93/min

It’s weird because they charged me the least for the period I was using the most kW. It was a 250 kW charger and it will draw 4 kW/minute at first but after 15 minutes it’s only drawing 1–2 kW/minute.

SUPERCHARGING PROBLEMS: We only had to wait one time out of the 62 times we stopped at Superchargers during our road trip which I think is pretty incredible. And that time was in a small Louisiana town with eight 150 kW chargers. Four were temporarily out of commission but Tesla was already there working on them. They told us what was going on and within a few minutes they had a 5th one working for us. While we were charging they got the others working. I was impressed because I’m sure this little town didn’t have Tesla people standing by. I wondered where they’d driven from. At one other place in South Carolina 4 out of 8 charger weren’t working but the other 4 were fine and one was available. We notified Tesla.

SUPERCHARGING EXPERIENCES: The longest distance between Superchargers we saw was 140 miles. That was in West Texas. Finding a charger simply wasn’t an issue. The furthest we had to go off our route to reach one was about 2 miles but they were usually within a few blocks of the freeway exit. All 62 locations had recommendations on the Tesla website for restrooms so that was no problem at all. Many chargers were at Hilton Express Holiday Inn Express or Hampton Inn. That was fine except they don’t serve food (They could have planned for that using an app like Chargeway that allows you to check for amenities near charging stations. –Ed.). Our favorite chargers were at travel centers where they serve food and have nice restrooms. In the east Sheetz and Wawa were both common locations for chargers and they have good food choices. Many were also at Targets which have restrooms and good food to buy. All in all we have good memories of our Supercharging times. On a 500-mile day we typically spent an hour to an hour-and-a-half charging.

EFFICIENCY: In my opinion the most important thing to understand in planning and executing a road trip like this is efficiency — that is miles-driven/charge-miles-used. For example if your car shows 200 miles of range and you drive 80 miles your car may now show 100 miles of range. So your efficiency was 80%. You may get 100% efficiency if you’re driving quietly at 50 mph but you certainly won’t on the interstate unless you have a tailwind. We drove mostly at 70–75 mph and our average efficiency for the trip was about 85% (most numbers here come from TeslaFi an extremely useful app). On one 105-mile stretch in Utah with 30 mph headwinds we only got 56% efficiency! I don’t like to worry about running out of charge so I usually planned for the worst case and made sure I had twice as much range as the distance to the next charger and then added more if I planned to skip that charger. On that Utah stretch we had planned to skip the first charger and go to the next one 64 miles further away. But we routinely check the Energy Monitor which gives an estimate of how much range you’ll have left when you reach your destination. So useful! We could see that the estimate was dropping each time we checked (due to the headwinds) and it became obvious it would be too risky to keep going. No problem. We had plenty of charge to reach the nearer one. I usually planned to have 40 or 50 miles charge when we arrived in case the Superchargers were out of order and we would have to search for somewhere to charge. Fortunately that never happened. I’ve heard so many horror charging stories from people taking road trips in non-Tesla EVs. I can’t imagine how different our experience might have been in another electric vehicle or whether it would even be possible to go as fast and far as we did.

We didn’t take this road trip to prove anything. Our shorter trips in the Standard Range car were great except for the need to charge more often. We had no doubt the trip was feasible and would be comfortable even with the somewhat rushed timeline. It was wonderful having the extra range so we never felt the need to charge close to 100%. If Tesla really does double the number of Superchargers in the next few years it’s going to be ridiculously easy to take a trip like this.

STATS:

Longest leg: 199.49 miles.

Superchargers: 62

Cost to charge: $740.21

Miles: 8182

Days: 25

Trip efficiency: 81.77%

Worst efficiency: 56.5% (59.42 actual miles 105.13 rated miles 20–30 mph headwinds).

David Zalubowski/AP

Tesla will lose its title of the world's biggest EV maker by 2024 Bloomberg Intelligence concludes.

It expects Volkswagen to become world's biggest producer by increasing European and Chinese sales.

Tesla accounted for 75% of global EV sales in the first three months of this year.

Tesla faces losing its crown as the world's biggest electric car maker to Volkswagen by 2024 according to new research.

A study by Bloomberg Intelligence expects the German giant to double production to more than 2 million battery-powered vehicles in 2024 overtaking Tesla.

Rising battery costs and limited production capacity meant most other competitors including Ford and General Motors lacked an incentive to catch up as quickly as Volkswagen the report said. Tesla is therefore likely to remain the biggest EV seller in the US for some time.

Volkswagen's production and sales are focused on Europe and Bloomberg expects the company to expand further in China rather than America. US sales accounted for less than 10% of VW's total last year according to its annual report.

Tesla sales in China where it now makes two models were likely to suffer as a result Bloomberg said.

Tesla was an early entrant to the EV revolution and accounted for 75% of all electric cars sold in the US in the first quarter of 2022 according to Kelly Blue Book. Competitors are slowly taking advantage of their scale to eat into some of that market share though.

Ford has led the charge with its Ford F-150 Lightning which has received 200000 orders while GM is pushing ahead on its next-generation ""Ultium"" batteries. Volkswagen is also considering of its sports car maker Porsche which also has an electric model.

But Tesla has also expanded production and taken advantage of the economies of scale present in early adopters. It began shipping cars from its Berlin gigafactory in March where it aims to produce 500000 cars annually.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has tried to bat off the threat of legacy automotive manufacturers joking that he was getting ""free advertising"" from his competitors in a tweet on Friday that highlighted similar marketing strategies among manufacturers.

In an interview on the Tesla Owners Silicon Valley YouTube channel released on Tuesday Musk said competitors Rivian and Lucid faced bankruptcy if they didn't cut costs.

Tesla is continuing to tease everyone excited about its upcoming Class-8 heavy-duty electric truck the Semi.

The truck has now made its third appearance this week and despite CEO Elon Musk’s plead for patience regarding the company’s product roadmap the Semi is making more appearances more often perhaps shifting at a change in tune in the vehicle’s production timeline.

The Semi was sighted three previous times this week: Twice on public roadways and once in Teslarati’s coverage of the truck being tested along with Megachargers at the Frito Lay/PepsiCo. facility in Modesto California. Prior to this the Semi was spotted at Gigafactory Texas’ Cyber Rodeo and other sightings have been on roads between Fremont and Giga Nevada or at company events.

The newest sighting took place earlier this week at the Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn MI. The two-mile speedway has been home to stock car racing events for decades but most recently hosted Tesla’s complete lineup of vehicles including the Semi.

The Semi basked in its glory at the track only serving as a continuous tease at least up to this point. Tesla fans and EV enthusiasts everywhere are interested in Tesla’s upcoming truck releases as the Cybertruck and the Semi have been close to production in the past. Market conditions and supply chain uncertainties have stagnated both of these projects which has pushed projected production start dates back considerably leaving reservation holders at a loss for words and the company with a lack of answers.

Despite this the many sightings of the Semi this week could be a good thing. After Musk pushed Tesla to start volume production of the Semi in mid-2020 the project was inevitably delayed due to a shortage of battery cells. Obviously the Semi requires more cells because of its size and in the current position of the EV market Tesla’s focus has been to transition more passenger vehicles to electrified powertrains not commercial ones. Therefore Tesla’s mass-market sedan Model 3 and crossover Model Y have been where the cells have gone and it has undoubtedly contributed to the company’s streak of nine consecutive quarters of growth in deliveries.

With continuous sightings of the Semi this week two questions remain: Will they continue and will the Semi make it to production sooner than we think?

Previously Polestar was known for being Volvo’s performance arm. But that has changed. Now as their own company they focus solely on electric vehicles.



So does this Scandanavian newcomer have what it takes to topple the American king? Let’s find out.



Find the section you want to read.



Polestar 2: A Brief Overview

Although Polestar is no longer officially attached to Volvo the long-running Swedish manufacturer’s influence is certainly evident in the 2’s design.



The front lights body panels and front grille look as though they’ve been lifted from the Volvo XC40. And that’s because they have been.



In fact the Polestar 2 shares many mechanics with the XC40 but not everything. The Volvo is a crossover on the verge of an SUV whereas the 2 is more of a raised saloon/hatchback type – not really like anything else we see on the road.



And there are several other differences between the two even if the original ingredients remain the same.



The biggest shift can be witnessed inside. Whereas the Polestar 1 – a highly-expensive limited-edition super-coupe – cloned the inside of a Volvo S90 the Polestar 2 is very much its own being. (We’ll take a closer look at that shortly.)



Originality can also be found through the frameless door mirrors which add an edge of sophistication to the design as does the full-width light bar at the rear.



So yes the Polestar 2 may be based on a Volvo XC40 but it has enough of its own spirit within it to be classed as a separate entity. And to look at it’s really quite eye-catching.

Polestar 2 vs Tesla Model 3: Design & Practicality

Putting both the Polestar 2 and Tesla Model 3 side by side you can see a significant difference in styling influence.



The Polestar is very much conservative yet modern striving towards the less is more philosophy. While the Tesla’s striking curves and long body look as though they’ve been crafted by the designers at Porsche.



And while which is better looking will depend on personal preference – we’re torn between the two if you’re interested – something that won’t be is how practical the design is.



In the back there’s ample legroom in both the Polestar 2 and Tesla 3. Both challenge the luxurious super saloons of Mercedes-Benz Audi and BMW in terms of comfort.



But where the Polestar falls down compared to the Tesla is headroom. The 2 comes with a panoramic roof as standard. And while it may be a welcome feature for some – giving the interior ample natural light and creating an airier ambience – it does compromise on space for your rear passengers.



Another downside to the Polestar in the back is the large central beam running along the floor from underneath the front armrest towards the boot.



This is a common occurrence in petrol and diesel-powered cars but it’s not in an electric. And it doesn’t feature in the Tesla meaning the Model 3 is both easier to get in and out of as well as more comfortable in the back.



In the boot however it’s not the same story. Both the Polestar and Tesla have two storage spaces – one where you’d expect it to be at the back – and one where an engine would usually sit at the front.



With the seats up the 2 has a 405-litre boot with an extra 35 litres under the bonnet. Meanwhile the Model 3 can only house 425 litres – 15 litres less.



Yet with the front boot in the Polestar being so shallow you won’t fit much more in than your charging cables. In the Tesla you’ll comfortably get a cabin bag under the bonnet.



In both cars you can drop the rear seats to create a bigger space which is where the legroom we discussed earlier really benefits.



And even though the Polestar is easier to load than the Tesla given its rear styling the Model 3 has more useable space. And for that reason the American claims victory.



Polestar 2 vs Tesla Model 3: Technology

As you’d expect the Polestar 2 and Tesla Model 3 are awash with tech.



In both the majority you can see and use is housed in a large centre touchscreen infotainment system.



But that can cause an issue while driving as the absence of physical dials can make it tricky to use either system without taking your eyes off the road. And it’s for this very reason the Polestar 2 comes out on top in the technology category.



Both give you Sat Nav music streaming and an abundance of other features. But the Polestar also has a second screen where a conventional car’s dials would be behind the steering wheel.



This readout provides data such as current speed – which is only available through the big central screen in the Tesla – as well as remaining charge and all the other facts and figures you’d expect.



Another feather in the Polestar’s cap is their centre-screen interface. Working in partnership with phone OS provider Android the 2’s infotainment system feels like a big tablet with processes simplified and customisation easy.



Yes the Model 3 also has a user-friendly interface but with a second screen and a more refined system the Polestar 2 just edges out the Tesla on this occasion.



Polestar 2 vs Tesla Model 3: Speed & Range

An electric vehicle’s range has always been its downfall in the past. Despite them often being more fun to drive than petrol or diesel cars and of course more economical and friendly to the environment they just haven’t been practical.



But that belief began to change when Tesla came onto the scene. They proved that you can live with an electric car on a day-to-day basis.



So how does the Polestar 2 stack up in comparison?



Although its numbers are impressive – a WLTP range of 275 miles which would get you from London to Newcastle on a single charge – it’s still around 50 miles shorter than the Tesla Model 3 Long Range.



And when it comes to charging the Polestar faces more challenges.



The 2 will charge 80% in just 40 minutes through a 150kw charging point although they’re few and far between.



The 50kw charger is more realistic in everyday life which will cover between 20% and 80% in an hour.



Meanwhile an 11kw charger which is the one you’d use at home takes eight hours to complete a full charge – which works out just under 35 miles of range per hour.



They’re not deal-breaking waiting times but when put up against Tesla’s Supercharger network which is now more than 16000 strong across the UK it’s a grave comparison.



The same can be said for the speed. The Polestar 2 will break 60mph from a standing start in just 4.5 seconds.



On the face of it that’s blisteringly quick. A time to rival – and beat in a lot of cases – most sports cars. But it’s still over a second slower than the Tesla Model 3 Performance which does it in 3.2 seconds.



Therefore there’s only really one winner in this category and deservedly so; the Tesla Model 3.



Polestar 2 Figures

Range: 275 miles

0% – 80% Charge (150kw): 40 minutes

20% – 80% Charge (50kw): 60 minutes

20% – 80% Charge (50kw): 53 minutes

0% – 100% Charge (11kw): 8 hours (Model 3 Long Range will take longer)

0-60mph: 3.2 seconds (Model 3 Performance)

Polestar 2 vs Tesla Model 3: Comfort

There’s no denying the Polestar 2 has a nicer interior compared to the Tesla Model 3. It’s also better equipped in the technology department.



However the ride is a different story. The 2 weighs 2123kg which is around 300kg more than the Model 3 and almost the same weight as a Range Rover.



As we’ve seen the extra weight doesn’t hamper performance in a straight line with the Polestar reaching 60mph in 4.5 seconds. But in the corners the chunkiness stands out.



It’s not overpowering and it doesn’t spoil the drive but the 2 certainly isn’t as dynamic as the Tesla. The steering isn’t as responsive and there’s a lack of feel.



And when you’re pushing the Polestar around the bends the ambience of quiet electric power is broken by suffering suspension as it tries to support the two tonnes of electrified motoring.



It’s not such a problem at low speeds and the 2 absorbs standard road surfaces and speed humps well. But if you drive over a pothole you’ll know about it.



You do have the option of changing the ride settings through the Polestar’s centre screen. You’re given light standard and firm but really there’s limited difference between then.



In the Model 3 however these issues don’t arise nearly as much. It’s a complete car. Obviously the Performance version is a tougher ride than the Long Range but you accept that for eye-watering speed.



So again we have a clear winner when it comes to comfort. The Polestar 2 may be a nicer place to sit aesthetically but the Model 3 is certainly the better ride.



Polestar 2 vs Tesla Model 3: Price & The Verdict

If by reading this you think the Polestar 2 isn’t worth buying then you’re wrong. It’s still a genuinely fantastic car with a stunning interior and face-splitting speed.



It’s practical good-looking and as it comes in under £50000 as new it also qualifies for the UK government’s £3000 plug-in grant.



Really the Polestar 2 is a fantastic electric vehicle and another great stride towards an all-electric future.



But while it’s a competitor for the Tesla Model 3 it’s not quite there yet. The Model 3 still has the edge in almost every category even if by only the smallest of margins.



The Tesla has a better range it’s faster off the mark it’s a better drive and it sits in the same price bracket as the Polestar 2.



There will be more variety added to the Polestar 2 range as time goes by but for now the Tesla Model 3 still reigns supreme.

After all there's a reason why it's the best-selling EV of all time. But it's not without its problems. And it's also rather expensive - around $10000 more than it was when it first went on sale. Hence alternatives that benefit from the full $7500 Tax Credit like the Polestar 2 are beginning to make more and more sense.

Most ""Tesla Cult"" YouTubers have nothing but praise for their Model 3s. But often they're coming from far inferior vehicles and don't know a lot about cars in general. It's rare that we hear a Model 3 review from a true petrolhead who actually knows a lot about the auto industry. So when we do we sit up and listen. Mark Holubetz who runs the channel ExoticCar PlayPlace has an extensive history with enthusiast cars. For example he recently sold a Lamborghini Gallardo and currently owns a Jaguar F-Type R and BMW M5. He also has a Tesla Model 3 which he seemingly regrets buying.

Mark first talked about the 11 recalls the 2021 Model 3 currently has. Although he did not mention this the vast majority of those recall issues can be resolved via OTA updates. Another thing he dislikes is Tesla's use of cameras for its self-driving features. He doesn't understand why Tesla refuses to use radar like most other automakers. To be fair that is a good point. Ever since Tesla CEO Elon Musk went against radar in favor of camera-only ""Tesla Vision"" occurrences of Phantom braking have seemingly spiked. He also noted that the Model 3's cameras often fail to recognize the difference between kph and mph on speed signs when driving between Canada and the US.

The windows don't defrost properly according to Mark or at least as well as some other vehicles in the Model 3's price bracket. The front suspension lateral link has come loose for him and is a known issue. He noted that the paint quality was poor and is often too thin in places. Rusting can be a problem as well. He isn't a fan of the numerous panel gaps on his car either. Mark also highlighted that water can leak into the front headlights and trunk resulting in mold.

Furthermore Mark mentioned alignment issues on the door panels. He also discussed ""Emergency Shutdowns"". Although rare it is a known issue where the Model 3 can decide to shut down due to an issue with its high voltage controller.

Mark concluded that while on paper the Model 3 is a good car quality control needs to be improved - particularly for colder climates where vehicles are more prone to electrical and mechanical issues. Although he isn't entirely against the 3 he does note that there are now a lot of similarly priced better-built alternatives from traditional manufacturers (e.g. the BMW i4). Equally although he didn't mention it in the video there are also several EVs that are beginning to outperform Tesla from a self-driving perspective too - for example according to Consumer Reports testing GM's radar-based SuperCruise system is now ahead of Tesla Autopilot. Equally Ford CoPilot is now capable of hands-free self-driving on pre-mapped US routes.

But what are your thoughts on the Model 3? A good car but not worth upwards of $46990? Or do you think the Model 3 is still hands-down the best electric sedan? Let us know in the comments below."

In fairness that’s to be expected. Half a century is a long time in technology.

More surprising is that the computer on board the US space agency’s New Horizons probe which reached Pluto in 2015 was also less smart than the best smartphones. So too is the computer on board NASA’s Orion spacecraft that will one day send humans to Mars.

It may appear rather strange. NASA has been at the forefront of technology for decades giving us cordless vacuum cleaners solar cells wireless headsets and air purifiers among a host of other goodies. Yet it also tends to lean towards the tried and tested.

“For us it’s all about reliability” says Alan Stern principal investigator of the New Horizons mission. “After all you can’t fit technology on the way to Pluto so reliability and long parts and operations experience far trumps the need to use the fastest newest computers in the spacecraft we send off to the planets.”

In the case of New Horizons which launched in 2006 astronomers made use of a 32-bit Mongoose-V RISC processor with a clock speed of just 12MHz. Created by Synova it was based on the MIPS R3000 CPU introduced in 1988 – a CPU that actually got used in the original PlayStation a few years later. To ensure the chip could withstand its long and arduous journey into space (the probe is now more than 50 times farther from the Sun than Earth is) the processor was radiation-hardened.

Even though it perceivably lacked power the computer has been responsible for the bulk of the spacecraft’s processing capability guided by intricate flight software. It collects and processes instrument data distributes operating commands to each of the probe’s subsystems and runs algorithms that check for problems correcting them if necessary. It has been nothing short of a success.

“When we plan a mission there’s always an involved process of parts selection” Stern says. “We set technology requirements and then find a flight computer that meets our needs same for all missions.” And yet at one time NASA did rely purely on cutting-edge tech for its spacecraft.

The birth of Silicon Valley

Although the New Horizons computer is far more powerful than the one used aboard Apollo 11 that landed the first humans on the moon the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) was advanced for the time. Then again computing was still in its infancy so it had to be.

Developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) the AGC contained thousands of silicon chips yet it only had 74KB of ROM 4KB of RAM and it operated at 0.042MHz. The use of such chips was relatively new. The first working integrated circuit had only been demonstrated in July 1958 by American electrical engineer Jack Kilby while working for Texas Instruments and a patent was filed the following year.

NASA’s Apollo Program seized the opportunity to make use of the technology becoming the largest consumer of semiconductor chips between 1962 and 1967 – snapping up more than 60% of those made in the United States. It took 300 people seven years at a cost of $46 million to create the mission software including the on-board programme Luminary yet the move was pivotal.

NASA’s fierce appetite for integrated circuits led to the rapid rise of Silicon Valley and it helped the price of the chips to plummet so much they were selling for $15 by the time Neil Armstrong was making his one small leap.

The important thing is that the technology – while primitive by today’s standards and no better than a pocket calculator – was more than sufficient. It not only got humans to the Moon it ensured they arrived back.

Astronomers would use a calculator-style keyboard to input commands using numerical codes (the digits representing verbs and nouns) and these would tell the spacecraft what to do. It was a method that worked and the performance of the computer was so great it would be another eight years or so before consumers could start to enjoy similar technology in the likes of the Apple II and Commodore PET.

Heavy-duty machinery

Apollo’s mission control computers on the ground were a tad more advanced however. The engineers and flight technicians used five IBM System/360 Model 75 mainframes released in 1965 among other systems and they were among the most powerful computing systems in the world.

One of these machines was used to calculate the lift-off data used in Apollo 11 for the flight back to Earth according to IBM. “We use up-to-date computers in our Mission Control too because they can be repaired or replaced easily” says Stern.

But that’s not always the case. James Mason who today works as a research scientist and engineer at the Applied Physics Laboratory at John Hopkins University in Baltimore Maryland US recalls a visit to the US government’s White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico. The laboratory contains computers that support the sensors on board NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory which launched in 2010.

As reported in the journal Nature data was streaming to a desktop computer dating back to the 1980s. “It was a TD-plus and I’ve spent a lot of time trying to find information about it” Mason says. “But I’ve seen this kind of thing at NASA before as well as at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology because well basically if it ain’t broken don’t fix it.

“If we had an abundance of time and money then we’d keep those systems up to date but we’ve just got other things to do that are more directly related to the end-goal of why we are at such facilities in the place – to get a new instrument calibrated or to launch a telescope into space to gather the data.

“Even without keeping all of the resources like the computers constantly up to date and the whole team trained on what’s changed we have months of work leading up to and after each of these events. So that’s why these systems get used.”

It suggests an underlying ethos that proven technology should be retained until it proves unreliable. Once a computer looks to be on its last legs or if there is a compelling reason to upgrade to do a job better and equally reliably then it will be replaced – assuming it isn’t millions of miles away.

As further proof Commodore Amigas were number crunching and analysing images in NASA’s research offices from the 1980s until 2004 long after the range was discontinued in 1996. The computers proved to be a good way of processing launch vehicle telemetry until something better came along.

Is the old 1980s computer at White Sands though still in use? Alas no. It ended up being ditched in 2015 because a connector and ribbon cable – “one of those old wide rainbow ones” said Mason – were starting to fail. Yet it would have made life easier had it continued to work well.

“The connector in particular was not staying connected and we’d get intermittent dropouts” he adds. “But I have to say that working with the replacement has been a mixed bag. Yes it’s got a really cool display that looks a lot like the Hollywood depiction of NASA but it’s also vastly more complex and it took us multiple weeks just to get it configured correctly at our most recent launch in September last year.

“The TD-plus was super simple and it never changed year-to-year so it would take about five minutes to get it set up for each launch. It didn’t look like much but that time we didn’t spend fiddling with something new was time we could spend on more pressing parts of the rocket schedule.”

Space invaders

The replacement would have been introduced after much research into its suitability however although personal preference and cost is also taken into account. An insightful video dating back to 1998 for example in which Gary Jones then NASA’s principal systems engineer shows Amiga computers at Hanger AE. The machines were supporting the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavour to the Russian Mir space station but Jones says the first choice had been a selection of Apple Macs until NASA realised they were too much of a closed system.

Jones also reveals the space agency had wanted to use PCs running Windows 95 and NT instead but the engineers kept insisting they weren’t fast enough. DEC Alphas based on 64-bit RISC architecture were proposed but deemed too expensive.

Oddly it was felt the Amiga didn’t cost enough but they made it into the building nevertheless. As if to show how widely they were used one Commodore computer – an Amiga 2500 released in 1987 – was also put up for sale on eBay 30 years later having been used by NASA’s Telemetry Lab. It sold for more than $5000.

But those are machines on the ground. The computers sent skywards as integral parts of spacecraft are generally tested much more thoroughly. “There’s an entire branch of NASA called the Space Technology Mission Directorate that among other things flies a lot of satellites specifically to see how new technologies will perform and ‘de-risk’ them for future science missions” Mason says. “But even in those cases most of the satellite will be heritage components so that we can be sure to get data back about the new technology in question.”

How to run classic versions of Windows on modern PCs

NASA is certainly more than happy for the Orion spacecraft to contain processors that are getting on for 20 years old. After all it needs the craft to journey to Mars through the Van Allen belts above Earth where it will be bombarded with radiation. The Honeywell flight computer runs on two IBM PowerPC 750X single-core processors that have been around since 2002. Originally used in Boeing 787 jets the processors are considered to be more than up to the job.

“In general it takes about three years to build flight hardware and get it ready for flight” Matt Lemke NASA Orion avionics power and software manager says. “We are limited in what processors we can select due to the need for extreme reliability as well as the radiation environment that ground systems don’t need to be concerned with.

“Once we have gone through the expense of selecting a processor and building it into the flight hardware we don’t change unless there is a compelling reason. The selected processor for Orion has all the computing power we need and it has been working great. So far it has been used in our pad abort flight test the Exploration Flight Test -1 mission the upcoming Artemis I flight and we anticipate using this processor all the way through Artemis XII.”

Even so precautions have been taken. “We build them into a ruggedised custom design” says Lemke. Indeed the computer has been placed within a larger case and the hardware and circuit boards are thicker. Just in case the worst happens though three computers are going to be on board – the third one acting as a backup should the other two go kaput or at least end up have to be reset (if this happens they’d be down for 20 seconds and that can be a rather long time when travelling at great speed).

Personal computing out of this world

Astronauts also use personal computers in space and these too are carefully selected. The first laptop to fly on the Space Shuttle was the GRiD Compass which after beginning development in 1979 was released three years later. Starting with model 1101 it used a clamshell case made of magnesium alloy and it weighed 4.5kg which was less than half that of its main competitor the Osborne 1.

Packing a 16-bit Intel 8086 chip 340KB of magnetic bubble memory and a 1200bits/sec modem the computer also had a 320 x 240 8.5in plasma screen. It included a magnetic storage system too and the lack of moving parts made it ideal for the rigours of space which is why NASA sent it on board the Space Shuttle Columbia on 28 November 1983.

Codenamed SPOC (or Shuttle Portable On-Board Computer) astronauts used it for on-board navigation tracking fuel and checking other data on board the shuttle. Plus for planning their time including photo shoots. NASA’s faith in the GRiD Compass was proven in January 1986 when it survived the terrible Challenger shuttle disaster which claimed the lives of all seven crew members aboard. Once recovered it continued to work.

There have been many other computers on board spacecraft since including a few Raspberry Pi devices. In 1997 Asus saw its P6300 laptop launched into space and two P6100 laptops lasted the full 600 days aboard the Mir space station the following year. Asus marked the 25th anniversary of this moment in its history by launching the ZenBook 14X OLED Space Edition this year. It says the new machine could also withstand going into space having been put through its paces by NASA and that standards have improved greatly over the years.

“The testing procedure is now rigorous and includes being tested at high altitudes extreme temperatures (high and low) extreme shock pulses and being exposed to sand dust fungus and solar radiation” says Ciprian Donciu Asus UK country manager who adds that the device has to continue working throughout.

“But this was not the case 25 years ago. The requirements for space testing were completely different yet our laptops lasted. After the Mir station experienced electrical and some technical issues the laptop itself was one of the few items onboard that was able to be successfully used by the Russian astronauts consistently. It was so reliable that the cosmonaut personally thanked Asus.”

It’s likely that space agencies will continue to mix old with new for some time to come selecting tech entirely on its merit rather than age. Although NASA could afford the most cutting-edge computer components there is simply too much at stake. “We have to work with a known quantity” Mason says. “It simply poses a lower risk.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0aXJ3b3JsZC5jb20vc2VlLW5ld3MtdmlzaXRvcnMtbWludC10aGVpci1vd24tZ2VuZXJhdGl2ZS1hcnQtbmZ0LWF0LWFydC1iYXNlbC0yMDIyLWluLXN3aXR6ZXJsYW5k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visitors mint their own generative art NFT at Art Basel 2022 in Switzerland,"At this year's Art Basel in the Swiss city Basel the pioneering exhibition Chance Encounters in New Mediums: Generative Art presented by Tezos is highlighting the modern resurgence of generative art.

For generative artists blockchains like Tezos are helping to re-imagine the digital canvas. Art like technology is in a perpetual state of change. The show looks at how art and technology are evolving together and how artists around the world are redefining what generative art might be in this new medium. The Tezos art exhibition encourages visitors to immerse themselves in this environment and learn first-hand about the importance of NFTs in the arts and beyond. The generative art platform fx(hash) is at the heart of the show. It is a one-of-a-kind tool in the field of NFT art allowing collectors to interact with generative art in a whole new way via the blockchain technology. The interactive aspect of the exhibit powered by fx(hash) allows visitors to scan a QR code to start the process of producing a new artwork created autonomously by one of the artist's algorithms. Each contact with the exhibit is a chance encounter; an opportunity to initiate the development of a new generative artwork that is instantly minted as an NFT and given to visitors.

MONDRIAN (1979/2010/2022) is a dynamic visual and sound software created by Herbert W Franke in 1979 for Texas Instruments. It was named after Piet Mondrian a Dutch artist who was a founder of the constructivism movement in the early 20th century. Strong horizontal and vertical features as well as blocks of colour characterise Mondrian's work which is generally painted in rich brilliant tones. On Tezos the sequence has been coined as an NFT.

Tezos has attracted a wide global community of artists collectors and builders due to its energy-efficient architecture and low costs for minting and transacting NFTs. More artists are choosing to produce on Tezos than ever before thanks to prominent NFT platforms like fx(hash) Objtk.com and Teia.art. Tezos art marketplace sales have increased by 70 per cent in the previous 30 days with Objkt.com the largest marketplace in the Tezos ecosystem just surpassing $100 million in sales.

The single-engine aircraft took off for the first time on Thursday and remained in flight for two hours and a minute the company said.

“This flight is another vitally important step for the Beechcraft Denali program as the aircraft will be used primarily for testing aircraft systems like avionics cabin environmental control and ice protection” said Chris Hearne senior vice president Engineering & Programs.

The first Beechcraft Denali prototype performed its maiden flight in November 2021 and so far has more than 250 hours flown.

The certification program is expected to pick up pace in the second half of the year with three test aircraft and three more full ground test airframes with plans to enter service in 2023.

Autonomy to fly between Los Angeles and Chicago

The Denali is the second blank slate project Textron Aviation has developed in recent years along with the twin-engine SkyCourier which has just entered service with FedEx.

The single engine however will compete with the PC-12 in the executive segment. It is equipped with GE’s new Catalyst engine with 1300 SHP of power and which uses the FADEC system and also McCauley 5-blade propellers.

According to Textron the Denali can reach a cruising speed of 285 knots and fly 1600 nautical miles nonstop enough distance to fly four passengers between Los Angeles and Chicago or New York to Miami.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ25pdHltZW1vcmlhbC5jb20vZW4tY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jb2xsZXl2aWxsZS10eC9qdWxpYW4tamVua2lucy1qci0xMDgwMTk0MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Julian Jenkins Jr. Obituary - Colleyville TX,"Julian Lawrence (“Larry”) Jenkins Jr. of Grapevine TX went to be with our Lord on Sunday June 19 2022.

He will always be remembered as a devoted and faithful husband father grandfather and friend to all those who knew and loved him.

Larry was born on June 29 1934 in Goldsboro NC to the late Julian Lawrence Jenkins Sr. and Ollie Moore Jenkins. Larry graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Richmond VA where he was a star basketball player. He matriculated to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville VA where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity and played college basketball. In the mid-1950s he served in the U.S. Army while stationed in Stuttgart Germany. He met the love of his life while at Virginia Beach and was soon united in marriage to Sue Bledsoe Amory on December 27 1958. After his military service he returned to college and graduated in 1960 with a bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering. He began his career at NASA – Langley (VA) Research Center later the same year where he participated in numerous wind-tunnel tests of experimental rotors. The young couple started their family and then settled in Hampton VA. Larry went on to earn his Masters in Aerospace Engineering completing a thesis on rotor-blade stability. During his NASA years he developed computer code that was built on his thesis. In 1978 he was presented with the opportunity to be the Chief Research Engineer at Fort Worth TX-based Bell Helicopter a division of Textron Corp. so he moved his family to Arlington TX.

At Bell he was promoted multiple times and ultimately became the head of the Research & Technology division. Over his career he worked on many federal government-sponsored contracts led experimental projects mentored many engineers and authored or contributed to numerous technical papers. Larry contributed to one of the most innovative aircraft ever designed the tiltrotor which became the V-22 Osprey. He was a member of the American Helicopter Society and held many roles and offices over several decades within the organization. He retired from Bell in 1998 and then he and Sue relocated to Williamsburg VA to be near old friends and family.

Larry was a man of God. Over the years he was an active member of several churches: First United Methodist Church in Hampton VA Pantego Bible Church in Arlington TX and Williamsburg Community Chapel in Williamsburg VA (where he was a leader of Crown Financial Ministries).

Larry was a man of many talents and varied interests and was known for both his intellect and sense of humor. He loved to travel with Sue and passionately followed his Cavaliers. He was extremely well-read had a passion for American History and read the paper daily along with completing the crossword puzzle. He loved boating on the waterways of Virginia and Lake Granbury and was a skilled captain. Larry was also a self-made master mechanic electrician and carpenter; he could fix or build anything. Despite his technical background and leanings he was witty and always had a story. He was happiest when spending time with his family and friends. Most importantly he was the patriarch and role model for his entire extended family he will be greatly missed.

Survivors include son Julian Lawrence Jenkins III and his wife Andrea of Charlotte NC; son Brian Amory Jenkins and his wife Deborah of Colleyville TX; daughter Christy Jenkins Van Duinen and her husband Scott of Dallas TX; seven grandchildren – Nicole Jenkins Williams and her husband Ryan of North Richland Hills TX; Lauren Elizabeth Jenkins of Nashville TN; Brian Amory Jenkins Jr. of Euless TX; Kristen Alexandra Jenkins of Newport Beach CA; John “Jack” Ryan Van Duinen Caleb Fulton Van Duinen and Ethan Amory Van Duinen all of Dallas TX; one great-grandchild Emersen Deborah Williams and several nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his wife Sue Amory Jenkins and his sister Jean Jenkins Middleton of Durham NC.

A Celebration of Life will be at 10:00 am on Wednesday June 29 2022 at Bluebonnet Hills Funeral Home Hall located at 5725 Colleyville Blvd Colleyville TX 76034.

Design plans are underway as the company hopes to open in the fall of 2023.

The Stark County Regional Planning Commission recently gave conditional approval for a 6897-square-foot building fuel canopy and patio on the east side of Erie Avenue/Rt. 21.

Ryan Balko engineer and project manager told the Planning Commission the company is in a period of growth and continues to seek new locations in Northeast Ohio where they believe Sheetz can be successful.

The new site will do well because of its proximity to existing stores and its proximity to U.S. Route 30 and state Route 21 Balko told the commission.

It will include a new prototype building with a drive-thru and fuel canopy as well as high-flow diesel pumps for truck fueling.

The Planning Commission gave conditional approval to the project while seeking additional conditions before giving the final OK. Sheetz must provide final construction plans that include grading and utilities as well as a stormwater management report.

The commission also wants additional information about improvements to Erie Street and Ortt Road SW.

Sheetz officials did not return calls seeking comment for this story.

Perry Township Fiscal Officer Craig Chessler said the township will see a financial benefit via the state's gas tax as it does for other stations.

Ohio motorists pay a 0.385-cent tax for each gallon of regular fuel and 0.47-cent tax for each gallon of diesel fuel. The tax money received by Perry Township is used to fund Road Department projects such as paving he added.

""With the last state budget there was an increase in the tax and we have seen a larger amount of revenue that we have used for road projects"" Chessler said.

More about Sheetz

Based in Altoona Pa the family-owned convenience store got its start in 1952 when Bob Sheetz purchased one of his father's five dairy stores.

In 1963 the second store opened. By 1972 the company doubled in size expanding to 14 stores. Later that year gas pumps were added and self-serve gasoline was introduced to Central Pennsylvania according to the company's website.

Today there are Sheetz stores in six states including Pennsylvania Ohio Maryland North Carolina Virginia and West Virginia.

The new store along state Route 21 will be the 60th Sheetz in the state. Stark County has five with one in Perry Township at 5057 Tuscarawas St. W and others in Alliance Hartville Jackson Township and North Canton.

SR 21 corridor becoming hub of development

Perry Township has seen interest from businesses along the state Route 21 corridor.

A new Auto Zone store is being built near the proposed Sheetz site.

""I do see it coming to fruition what had been predicted 20 years ago in a transportation study that the area would become an up-and-coming area for development"" Chessler said. ""With Henderickson and Tractor Supply's facilities it is starting to fulfill that expectation.""

Tractor Supply is building a 900000-square-foot distribution center at the former Stark County Farm in Navarre. The warehouse is expected to create about 375 new jobs.

In 2019 Hendrickson USA built a 180000-square-foot facility an expansion of Hendrickson’s Canton operation at Prospect Park. Suspension systems and components for tractor-trailers are manufactured at the facility that is expected to employ about 300.

By Jade Ruggieri

An angel appeared recently on University Avenue.

A maple oak tree sits on Charlie Chico’s lawn across from WVU’s law school and splits into two large branches about 6 or 7 feet almost like wings. For anyone else a dying tree means cutting it down but when Chico had a local contractor cut down the higher branches he told the contractor to stop because he saw something else.

After searching “and searching and searching” Chico found the Mason Dixon Boys who specialize in wood chainsaw carving. He gave them a call they came up and within five hours or less the job was done. Not just a maple tree anymore — it is now Sylvia’s Angel Tree.

Married for 57 years both Charlie and Sylvia Chico are Morgantown natives who met at the Chico Dairy Company when Charlie’s father hired her as a receptionist. Chico said he and Sylvia’s secret to their marriage was “every day is a new day” which they would cling to when they disagreed. Not that it happened often — Chico said they agreed 95% of the time.

Sylvia passed in April 2022 but left a lasting memory on the city of Morgantown.

“I never left her side — never” Charlie Chico said. “Every minute she was in the hospital I was in the hospital with her.”

For 53 years Sylvia volunteered for Mental Health America for Monongalia Marion and Preston counties and received the Jefferson Award for Community service. Sylvia started Operation Santa Claus with the help of volunteers local businesses and the Monongalia Sheriff’s Department to spread holiday cheer at William R. Sharp Jr. Hospital formerly Weston State Hospital.

Additionally Chico participated in the Kitchen Angels at St. John’s University Parish in Morgantown providing food for funerals and special occasions at the church.

“To me [she] should be considered an angel — that’s what angels do. She collected angels for a long time she’s an angel to the Mental Health Association and the patients at the hospital she’s a Kitchen Angel and she was my angel.”

While Chico said Sylvia would be embarrassed by the tree because she is a giver not a taker he also said Sylvia would be happy with it.

“What they [The Mason Dixon Boys] did was probably close to 10000 times better than I ever expected” Chico said.

When coming up with the idea Chico saw the branches and the tree thinking it could become a large angel before the carving started. The tree reminded him of a story he heard about a boy with had mental challenges who carved a beautiful horse. When asked how the boy carved the horse he responded “Well I saw the horse so I just cut everything away that wasn’t a horse.”

Travis Crook and Joe Yancey owners of the Mason Dixon Boys started their company in 2018 full-time and said they’ve been very blessed to have the gift of chainsaw carving using their skills across several states and their partnership with Tractor Supply Company.

With a lot of research as Crook and Yancey usually operate through Facebook or word-of-mouth Chico found and emailed them about his vision for the tree. From there Crook and Yancey leaned on their own faith to help bring that vision to life.

“We’re just a couple of chainsaw carvers saved by grace” Crook said. “The tree he had had some bad spots in it and we had to pray a little bit about how we were going to do it. Through the grace of God he found a way for us to put an angel in there that was a pretty good rendition of Sylvia that Charlie told us.”

Crook said the importance of doing projects like these is about talking to people and what they want and often asking the Holy Spirit to help guide them. Much like Chico’s story the Mason Dixon Boys said wood carving is induction art where pieces are taken away to make the final piece just without an eraser.

When they finished the project they were relieved because they wanted to fulfill Chico’s vision as a visual translation.

“It’s something you can’t mess up; you only get one shot” Crook said. “When you get that project completed there’s an overwhelming relief. Especially in Charlie’s case when you have such a spiritual connection to it you get a very big rush of emotion.”

The reason the angel is darker in color than the outside wood is that the Mason Dixon Boys put oil on the angel to preserve the carving and to keep bugs and water out so the angel can withstand the outside climate.

Through this process Chico said he did not tell anyone of his plans until halfway through the day of the carving. Chico called his daughter Lisa who lives in Morgantown and said “Get up here and get up now.”

Lisa’s response when she saw the tree was “Dad he’s already done a better job than I expected to see at the end”

While Yancey and Crook were grinding with their chainsaws about 10 or 15 people honked their horns to let them know they were doing a great job. Since completed Chico said people have pulled off to the side of the street and taken pictures.

“One of my wife’s friends said ‘She’s making people smile and her bright smile looking at that tree is brightening up everything in heaven’” Chico said.

While he’d rather have his wife sitting at the dinner table than see the tree representing her what might surprise those who have seen the carving is that Chico said he has not really thought about the tree as accomplishment for himself. Instead Chico said he is touched by the outpouring of support from the community reaching out to him.

“I’m proud of that tree. It’s a wonderful tribute to her and it makes me feel good to see it myself but to get all these phone calls emails and text messages makes me proud that I did what I did.”

In FY21 the assemblers raised prices by Rs92000-196000. An assembler said rupee devaluation and higher freight rates are making an adverse impact on the cost of imported parts.

In FY22 the government continued the relief package that allowed the supply of imported farm machinery and equipment at reduced tariffs (customs duty 0-2pc and GST at 5pc).

In budget 2022-23 the government had proposed to exempt tractors from the 5pc GST which may bring down tractor prices.

The number of operational tractors is 670000 versus 612000 in FY21 resulting in the availability of around 0.09 horsepower (HP) per acre against the required power of 1.4HP in both fiscal years.

According to a comparison of Economic Surveys of 2020-21 and 2021-22 NH-480 (55HP) NH-480 Power Plus (55HP) Ghazi 65HP 640 (75H) and Dabang (85HP) assembled by Al Ghazi Tractors Ltd are now priced at Rs1.228 million Rs1.282m Rs1.419m Rs1.819m and Rs1.879m as compared to Rs945000 Rs969150 Rs1.082m Rs1.441m and Rs1.479m.

Various models of Millat Tractors Ltd like MF-240 (50HP) MF-350 PS (50HP) MF-260 (60HP) MF-360 PS (60HP) MF375 4WD (75HP) and MF385 4WD (85HP) carry prices of Rs1.251m Rs1.449m Rs1.446m Rs1.527m Rs2.436m and Rs2.530m as compared to Rs997500 Rs1.092m Rs1.150m Rs1.197m Rs2.016m and Rs2.152m.

The Economic Survey 2021-22 has also carried a box item titled “Tractor Industry a Success Story: Made in Pakistan” claiming that the industry has established itself on a firm footing by achieving more than 90pc localisation.

Pakistan was a net importer of tractors a few years ago and imported $195 million worth of tractors in 2017. The country had exported tractors worth $47m in FY21 the survey said.

During July-March FY22 Pakistan’s export of tractors was $29.9m.

It claimed that due to the high level of localisation Pakistan’s low-priced tractors are well-received in Afghanistan and African countries. Botswana Nigeria and Kenya have emerged as the largest export destinations for tractors.

Massey Ferguson sales in 11MFY22 shrank by 4pc to 30616 units from 32051 while Fiat sales improved by a massive 53pc to 20741 from 13587 units in 11MFY22.

(Published 2022),"A $50-a-day offer to sail on a Caribbean cruise ship with pools water slides restaurants and Broadway-style entertainment says a lot about the turbulence some cruise companies are facing.

But for thrifty travelers it means deal season — or “wave season” in industry parlance usually a first-quarter phenomenon — is back. Normally cruise lines fill their ships during the winter when they typically offer discounts and generous perks a pattern disrupted this year by the Omicron variant. Now many cruise companies have put their trips on sale again relatively late in the year.

“Omicron knocked a lot of business off the books” said Anthony Hamawy the president of the travel agency Cruise.com. “Then Ukraine and the situation with the international policy of retesting all returning travelers for Covid affected bookings abroad.”

Though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently rescinded the requirement to test travelers flying to the United States from abroad the damage was already done and the discounts are a patch. In addition cabin availability grew as cruise lines dropped occupancy limits and returned entire fleets back to service flooding the market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5leHRob29wcy5jb20vbmNhYXcvZm9yZWlnbi10b3Vycy1hcmUtb2ZmaWNpYWxseS1iYWNrLWluLXdvbWVucy1jb2xsZWdlLWJhc2tldGJhbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Foreign tours are back in women's college basketball,"College teams can go on foreign tours once every four years but the COVID-19 pandemic shut down all tours in 2020 and effectively all tours in 2021. This summer amid some lingering concerns about the virus and the war in Ukraine the number of women’s basketball teams traveling hasn’t completely rebounded to 2021 levels: Two tour companies whose representatives spoke with The Next Basketball Travelers and Anthony Travel combined to average about 25 to 30 trips per year before the pandemic whereas this summer they are taking just seven teams abroad.

However teams are slowly starting to travel again because of the opportunities that foreign tours provide to play extra exhibition games against unfamiliar competition bond in the offseason and experience new cultures.

The Next reached out to 11 leading tour companies to gather information on the trips they have planned for Division I women’s basketball teams this summer. Ten companies responded and one did not answer multiple requests for information. Their responses indicate that at least 18 teams will travel internationally this summer:

Tour Company Number of Foreign Tours Basketball Travelers 6 World Sports Travel 4 Sport Tours International 2 Anthony Travel 1 Complete Sports Management 1 Global Sports and Events 1* Navigo Sports Tours 1 Showtime Basketball (Australia) 1 Temposs 1 Beyond Sports Tours 0 JD Sports (Canada) 0 Total 18 * Did not respond to requests for information; The Next learned about one tour from the team’s athletic communications staff. All companies are U.S.-based unless otherwise noted.

Basketball Travelers a well-known tour company that also runs the in-season Paradise Jam tournament is taking six teams overseas the most of any company surveyed. World Sports Travel (four) and Sport Tours International (two) are the only other companies with more than one team traveling this summer.

The majority of trips will be to Europe in August but teams chose a variety of destinations with nine countries and U.S. territories represented. “A lot of times either the destination will drive the budget or the budget will drive the destination” Darren Cohen the director of international team tours at Anthony Travel told The Next.

These trips are often years in the making. Some reach out to tour companies for exploratory conversations three or four years ahead of time and the more formal planning typically begins 11 to 18 months in advance. (Flights generally can’t be booked more than 11 months out noted Kelsey Harris the manager of international team tours at Anthony Travel and a former Elon basketball player.) Teams bring an average of about 30 people on their tours both Anthony Travel and Basketball Travelers said but some teams have much larger travel parties that include players’ families and/or donors.

One key to a successful foreign tour is listening to what staffs want and customizing each trip to their interests and needs. “We are always trying to make a trip as personal as possible” Cohen said. Industry veterans such as Cohen and Jennifer Ashby the director of international programs and events at Basketball Travelers know that no two teams are alike even if they end up touring the same destination.

“I think I’ve heard it all” Ashby told The Next. “… In any given year I’ve had a coach tell me ‘It’s super important that on our trip we stay in a hotel that’s on a beach’ and then have another coach say ‘We don’t want to stay on a beach because at home our kids can go to the beach.’ …

“It’s easier to do something cookie-cutter and do it the same way over and over again. And there is value in doing the same thing over and over again but there’s also a lot more value in being able to listen to somebody … and now put it all together.”

For example on a trip to Italy in 2017 UConn women’s basketball was able to attend the nearly 500-year-old horse race Palio di Siena and meet former champion Andrea Degortes. The following year then-Wake Forest head coach Jen Hoover decided to have her team stay in Bergamo Italy the hometown of then-rising senior Elisa Penna. In 2015 Miami head coach Katie Meier insisted that her team get to see the Eiffel Tower light up at midnight despite having a 9 a.m. game the next day. The smaller things matter too: Ashby noted that coaches are often superstitious and might ask her to ensure for example that the team has the same pregame dessert of ice cream with chocolate sauce as it does during the season.

There are always cultural components to the experience tour company representatives say. As Ashby put it “I’m not going to take a group all the way to Florence and not see the David [statue].” But she tries to focus on — and limit tour guides to — just the most important sights and details to keep everyone engaged.

The cultural aspects can also blend with academic and even life skills components. In summer 2019 Tennessee’s players took a class at the university related to what they would experience abroad a few weeks later. Several teams have also taken cooking classes during their foreign tours and learned to make authentic recipes.

Cohen shared a story about a cooking class during a team’s trip to Italy to demonstrate how a personalized itinerary can be meaningful for everyone involved. “[One] student-athlete wanted to make sure before they left they [got] pictures of the recipe so that she could make pasta for her mother” he said. “Her mother has always cooked for her for so long and all these things and [she wanted] to show a little bit of appreciation.”

Whatever teams are looking for out of their trips tour companies pride themselves on making it happen. “We like to say we’re the international director of operations so that the staffs can enjoy themselves” Harris said. “And so being able to handle it from our end so that the teams don’t feel any kind of stress is a really important piece of it.”

That task is especially challenging for tour companies in the era of COVID-19. International travel protocols are constantly changing — in fact on the day The Next spoke with Cohen and Harris the Biden administration announced that it would eliminate the requirement for people entering the United States by air to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Foreign tour companies also have to prepare for flight delays and cancellations which are “significant” right now at European airports due to staffing shortages worker strikes and high demand for travel.

There is also at least some concern about the war in Ukraine. Ashby said that none of the teams she is working with had “expressed skittishness” about traveling but teams Cohen is working with had. One team working with Cohen and Anthony Travel postponed its trip to 2023 because it wanted to visit Hungary which shares a border with Ukraine.

“There were teams that simply were just uneasy about heading abroad because of that” Cohen said.

Then there are the more evergreen concerns for tour companies. Scheduling the right level of competition is always challenging Ashby said and requires having strong local connections. For teams with international players there is also the difficulty of navigating the U.S. visa system and ensuring that those players will be able to travel and then reenter the United States.

As tour companies get back into the swing of summer travel there is optimism for the future of foreign tours. “We have heard from an extraordinary number of teams the highest I’ve ever seen for 2023” Cohen said. He pointed out that most teams will have the option to travel next summer because it will have been at least four years since their most recent trips.

Ashby likewise expects to see growth in 2023 compared to 2022 but she predicts that it will take at least five years to reach 2019 levels. That’s because schools’ budgets are still feeling the impacts of COVID-19. Colleges and universities lost an average of about 14% of their revenue in 2020 and 2021 and enrollment — a key revenue driver — remains below pre-pandemic levels.

But whenever teams get to travel abroad and whatever disruptions and challenges may arise during their trips it’s sure to be a memorable and valuable experience. Harris knows that firsthand: As a student-athlete at Elon she went on a foreign tour to France Belgium and the Netherlands in 2011.

“An experience like this stays with a student-athlete for the rest of their lives” she said. “These types of experiences and having exposure to different cultures … I think it helps prepare student-athletes for life.”

And for many of those travelers they’ll be trying to make the most out of their time away from home often booking extended stays and working remotely on top of taking personal time off.

There are a number of new terms around this trend sometimes referred to as “workcations” or “bleisure” (business and leisure) travel. Whatever you want to call it this is a trend that might become a permanent practice for some professionals and there’s a new luxury travel app tapping into the market right away.

Founded by two tech executives Origin is a new travel company that creates completely personalized trips with expert support—all in one app through on machine learning based on the user’s interests values and connections with other travelers.

Based on a rising demand from travelers Origin has created more itineraries that address adding work days to leisure trips. In response to the complexity of travel during the pandemic Origin launched a “Where Can I Go” feature on the app which helps users decide where to travel based on their interests and COVID restriction preferences.

Cofounder and CEO Eli Bressert recently shared more with Fortune about launching a new travel business as the world opens up again and trends to watch out for this summer.

The following interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

Could you share a bit about your professional background before launching Origin?

Most of my professional experience is in machine learning A.I. and product. At Apple I led the Siri platform science and insights team. Before that I was at Convoy where I helped transform the trucking industry with data science and its impact on automation economics human-in-the-loop optimization and scaling. I was also the data engineering and analytics manager at Netflix where I helped reinvent entertainment by leveraging data algorithms and engineering for Netflix Originals recommendations UI design optimization and messaging. At Stitch Fix I led the research and development division on algorithms that created a high-touch service and style of clothing that we made hyper-scalable by using machine learning and that’s what we’re doing at Origin.

The travel industry is certainly rebounding but between the ongoing pandemic (and constantly changing travel requirements) and inflation (and a possible recession looming) it might not seem intuitive to launch a travel company right now. What inspired Origin?

I couldn’t agree more! Travel is now more complex than ever with travelers spending about two to three days of planning and booking for each week of vacation with limited help and advice. It’s clear that for the last three decades technology has helped make travel more searchable but there has been a growing lack of planning and personalization—exactly what Origin is tackling.

My cofounder Tamar van de Paal and I created Origin because modern travel has become extremely complicated and we believe that transformational travel allows people to live out their dreams. The barrier of travel planning the time it consumes and insider knowledge on destinations are holding people back from maximizing their travel experiences. Origin removes all those obstacles and makes the end-to-end experience a breeze. It was also conceived during a time of endless lockdowns a desperate need for a change of scenery and a renewed craving for culture and exciting outdoor experiences.

We found that travel planning has always been a puzzle and a time trap. With locations open again Origin curators will make the most of trip planning they are available for constantly changing local travel regulation and COVID testing requirements as well as cancellations policies. Standard online travel agencies do not offer this level of agility and support. Origin also allows members to unlock self-service support all within the app helping members avoid the necessity of always doing phone calls and old fashioned self help tools.

Although ‘bleisure’ travel has been around for a considerable time now Origin says it is perfecting the art of designing these trips so that they remain in line with their core values: personalization connections and sustainability. Courtesy of Origin

Part of why Origin has gained attention is that it is touted for planning trips around “workcations” or mixing working remotely with vacation time. How would this look in practice? And what are the benefits of mixing work and vacation time?

With remote work becoming more and more the norm workcations are popular trips that Origin services on a regular basis now. Destinations and experiences vary as well as time spent. Origin has seen clients request a quick weekend getaway with the following week set for work in a remote lodge while others have sought out trips of 40 days+ to travel and work hand-in-hand.

As a remote-inclusive company Origin is uniquely positioned to propose the best workcations designed by curators who are encouraged to work from anywhere around the world.

Workcations consist of a trip that is seven days long or more with scattered morning and evening activities and plenty of time in the day to focus on work.

Many travel industry experts have been forecasting a busy summer ahead for the travel industry and anyone who has been to a major airport lately can already confirm. What do you think will be some of the top travel trends this summer?

We’re seeing a spike in island hopping and yacht rentals in the Mediterranean this summer. People are running into availability issues at hotels on land and don’t want to miss out on the summer fun in the Greek Islands or the Amalfi Coast so they take to the waters with private boats and yachts. It’s going to be a busy summer on land and at sea!

Destination weddings and multi-destination honeymoons are very popular this summer. This trend is a result of being on lockdown for so long not being able to travel and wanting to be with family and friends again in the same place. Travelers are requesting small wedding ceremonies to be arranged in stunning locations and then honeymoons with many stops. These adventure honeymoons are merging their celebration of love with their passion for culture and nature.

The drummer for the legendary group was putting on a killer performance for the highly-anticipated Motley Crue/Def Leppard tour which is currently underway. But many fans did not know that Tommy was in excruciating pain.

Tommy could not take the pain any longer and had to leave the show after a few songs. He announced to a crowd of hardcore fans at Truist Parkin Atlanta Georgia that he broke his ribs two weeks prior.

During a social media post he assured fans that he would be back and that they would also be in great hands. Additionally Tommy said he had waited forever for the tour and would rest up heal and be back in no time.

Tommy explained details about his injury in a social media post on Instagram. The post contained black text and a light blue screen as the rocker said in his own words what went wrong and what he planned to do about it.

The photo said “Man y’all ain’t gonna believe this s**t!… I broke 4 f**king ribs! But I’ve been resting and healing and even though the doctor tells me I shouldn’t play at all you know I’m stubborn and I’ll beast through the pain every show for as many songs as I can!”

Tommy announced that another Tommy– Black Sabbath’s Tommy Clufetos would fill in during his absence.

“And have no fear my boy Tommy Clufetos is here to help me out until I’m 100%… we’ve all been waiting for this moment and there’s no way I’m missing this. On with the show!”

Mötley Crüe Def Leppard and Poison tour 2022

Monsters and Critics reported in 2019 that a tour featuring Mötley Crüe Def Leppard and Poison was scheduled for the following year 2020.

Unfortunately due to the coronavirus pandemic the legendary show was pushed back for two years.

Fans were thrilled when The Stadium Tour also featuring Joan Jett began this year. Tommy Lee’s injury was a disappointment to many fans who eagerly awaited their chance to see Mötley Crüe in action.

Still the tour rages on with several dates in the next few months across North America. Fans are in good hands with Black Sabbath’s Tommy Clufetos and Tommy Lee will hopefully be on the mend as he follows his doctor’s orders and rests.

The next The Stadium Tour date is June 19 in Orlando Florida."

In the month of May the cost of food away from home jumped 7.4% compared to a year ago but according to a new report from Placer.ai Americans are eating out at fast food restaurants the same amount as 2021 and at some fast food giants Americans are dining out even more.

In the report which was generated by anonymous location data from a panel of 30 million mobile devices which Placer.ai then leverages with AI and machine learning to make estimates about overall visit locations Shira Petrack Placer.ai marketing content manager found that the quick-service restaurant sector seems to be ""maintaining relatively steady visitation patterns.""

Compared to May 2021 foot traffic in May 2022 is higher at McDonald's up 21.7% and at other fast food locations including Wendy's up 5% and Burger King up 4.1%.

This spike in foot traffic comes as Americans slow down their spending. In the month of May U.S. retail sales fell 0.3% but on the fast food front deals and bargain offerings may be luring Americans in.

According to Lydia Boussour Oxford Economics Lead US Economist consumers might be trading in up-scale dining for less expensive options as they ""reshuffle"" their spending priorities to allocate ""more of their budget toward services and pricier necessities"" like gas food and shelter.

Boussour emphasized however there is ""pent-up demand for services like dining out.""

""Some consumers are more likely to trade down from pricier dining experiences to less expensive fast food options in this high inflation environment"" she told Yahoo Finance.

Despite the option grab cheaper meals on the go consumers cannot ignore the historic cost increase.

Peter Saleh of BTIG who has been covering the restaurant sector since 2008 says the sector is raising prices on menus ""substantially more than they have historically.""

On average price increases have been around 2% but in 2022 increases have been 6-8% with ""some instances even higher than that"" due to the commodities and labor inflation.

Nick Setyan of Wedbush says Chipotle (CMG) in particular is a ""unique animal"" as digital sales soar for the chain. When everyone is ""feeling the crunch"" consumers are eager to save $5 to $10 on delivery fees plus tip and so they're ordering on the app to pick up in store or at the Chipotlane.

At Chipotle (CMG) foot traffic jumped as high as 51.5 percent in the month of February compared to 2021. Placer.ai's Petrack found that orders made at the store and online ""do not need to come at the expense of each other.""

The holiday celebrates when the news about the Emancipation Proclamation reached those that were enslaved in Texas in 1865.

Though Juneteenth is celebrated every June 19 it's being federally observed on Monday June 20 which is leading to some businesses and services normally open to be closed.

Here is what's open and what's closed on Monday June 20 to observe Juneteenth:

Mail services

All U.S. Postal Service offices will be closed on June 20 and there will be no mail delivery.

UPS is also observing Juneteenth and there will be no pickup or delivery services. You may want to check with your local UPS stores for possibly modified hours as well.

FedEx is not observing Juneteenth.

Banks

All federal banks will be closed on June 20.

Not all banks are required to observe federal holidays so be sure to check with your local bank specifically. Nonetheless Chase Bank Fifth Third Bank and U.S. Bank have all confirmed they will be closed.

Trash services

The City of Cincinnati trash pick-up will be delayed one day if your usual trash pick-up is on Monday. Rumpke will continue to pick-up trash as normal.

Grocery stores

Most major grocery store chains — including Kroger Walmart Meijer and more — will remain open under their normal hours.

Some small family-owned grocery stores and shops may be shut so always make sure to check your local stores hours before leaving your home.

Local governmental offices

The City of Cincinnati offices and services are closed Monday. Similarly all Hamilton County offices will be closed.

Covington administrative offices will be closed as well.

Federal buildings

All non-essential federal government buildings and offices will be closed Monday.

Stock Markets

Both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq will be closed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGFza2FuZHB1cnBvc2UuY29tL25ld3MvbWVldC10aGUtbGVnZW5kYXJ5LWZhdGhlci1vZi10aGUtZ3JlZW4tYmVyZXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Meet the legendary ""father"" of the Green Berets","More than seven decades ago Aaron Bank had an idea. He decided that after years killing Nazis almost leading a manhunt for Hitler and then working alongside Ho Chi Min to liberate Vietnam from imperial Japan the United States Army needed some special fighters. A force versed in irregular warfare who could mess up an enemy from behind their lines working with local resistance. A special forces if you will. Seventy years ago Aaron Bank got his wish.

June 19 is celebrated as Juneteenth now a federally recognized holiday. June 19 is also the 70th anniversary of the creation of the U.S. Army Special Forces better known as the Green Berets. And since Father’s Day also falls today it feels apt to honor Col. Aaron Bank who’s known as the “father of special forces.”

Col. Aaron Bank. (photo courtesy U.S. Army)

Bank was born in 1902 in New York City. He grew up working as a life guard where work took him from New York to France and the Bahamas. At 39 he joined the Army after Pearl Harbor with his level of fitness helping him overcome doubts about his age. He joined the CIA’s precursor the Office of Strategic Services immediately going into work on sabotage guerilla warfare and recruiting partisans to help fight the Nazis in Europe. His work peaked when he was a part of Operation Iron Cross a plan for the OSS and Bank to using a cadre of German Jews communists and defectors parachute into the German-Austrian border and capture or kill Adolf Hitler if he fled Berlin. Hitler hid in a bunker and never left the city leading to the cancellation of the operation and denying Bank of what surely would have been a movie-inspiring military action. After the war in Europe ended he found himself in southeast Asia and supported Ho Chi Minh as the head of a future coalition government. American policy went against Bank’s recommendations. Still in the service he pushed for a formal Army force dedicated to the kind of irregular warfare Bank had made his trade.

This month Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC) introduced a motion in the House of Representatives to honor both the Special Forces and Aaron Bank himself who retired as a colonel. Rep. Hudson’s resolution notes that the Green Berets “encouraged the incorporation of principles of force multiplication into the military doctrine of the United States and paved the way for the revitalization of special operations forces in the Navy Air Force and Marine Corps” and “helped revolutionize the conduct of modern warfare.” It’s hard not to see how.

Since the creation of the Army Special Forces in 1952 the force has been an instrumental tool in the Army. Originally just one group the 10th Special Forces Group it expanded into several units. They were deployed to South Vietnam as advisors for that country’s army and were a part of U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam an unconventional warfare group fighting against the forces of Bank’s former compatriot Ho Chi Minh. Missions also included covert actions in Laos and Cambodia. Other deployments included several conflicts in Latin America and the Persian Gulf War. Special Forces were part of the initial U.S. assault on the Taliban in fall 2001 in Afghanistan.

As the premiere special operations forces in the public for years the Green Berets got a lot of attention. In the world of fiction there was a less than stellar film about them starring John Wayne. Col. Kurtz and Capt. Willard both counted themselves among the ranks in Apocalypse Now.

In the 21st century they’ve been somewhat eclipsed in the public eye by various “tier one” special operations forces such as Delta Force and Navy SEALs but they remain a key part of the military deployed in Africa the Middle East and elsewhere doing the irregular warfare they have been doing for the last seven decades.

Rep Hudson’s resolution is as of press time in the hands of the House’s Armed Services Committee.

As for Bank himself he had another major contribution after leaving the Army in 1958. Relocating to California he became concerned with what he saw as poor security at nuclear power plants. Working with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists he shed light on the concerns and helped spur plants to overhaul how they protected nuclear installations. He died in 2004 at the age of 101. Not bad for a guy who was robbed of the chance to kill Hitler.

In 2020 when the pandemic brought all nonessential travel to a grinding halt Ami and Jason Richter had to think fast. They were running a flourishing business called Lug that sold fun travel bags and accessories and had a growing legion of fans which included Oprah.

But as travel bans went into effect households succumbed to lockdowns and work from home quickly become the norm buying backpacks and shoulder bags was the furthest thing from people’s minds.

It was in that moment that Ami leaned on a familiar approach to navigate the company through the uncertainty.

“I’ve always believed in keeping our eyes forward and continuously reinventing our products to meet new situations in our customers’ lives” she said.

Lug has sold over 15 million products to date. Courtesy Lug

When the husband-and-wife team cofounded Lug in 2005 their idea was to create a line of highly functional yet playful quilted bags and accessories to keep people organized on the go. They launched the company that year with just three products – luggage tags luggage straps and wallets adding more and more varied items as their company grew.

Lug’s colorful bags feature multiple pockets and compartments to store a variety of everyday essentials like phones laptops cosmetics water bottles wallets keys and clothes. By the beginning of 2020 their product portfolio had expanded to over 150 different items including gym bags laptop bags backpacks and suitcases.

But as travel plummeted amid the pandemic sales of luggage and all travel-related items were decimated. Ami had to find a way to keep Lug bags relevant to a completely changed marketplace. She did it by adapting bag designs to meet the new pandemic-era lifestyles of consumers.

“We basically looked at the rapidly changing environment and catered our products to it” said Jason.

For example Ami added wipeable pockets made of vinyl-like material to new designs so customers could easily sanitize the bags and find face coverings as well as extra pockets to hold hand sanitizers.

She said a majority of Lug bags now have clear wipeable pockets “where it makes sense in the design.” They also added pen holder pockets so people have their own pens at the ready.

Lug already had an advantage going into the pandemic with its primarily direct-to-consumer sales model. In 2015 the brand had joined QVC a move that expanded their market reach to over 500000 new customers said Jason.

In their very first QVC appearance on July 24 2015 Ami showcased a Lug bag called the “Puddle Jumper” a knapsack with multiple zippered pockets inside and out. It sold out in two minutes.

“While brick-and-mortar store and malls shut down being on QVC kept us going” said Jason. The business’ sales increased through the pandemic and they continue to grow 15% to 20% year-over-year he added.

“At some point road travel came back” said Ami. “Families were visiting their parents their grandparents and our bags were selling.”

Crafting a Lug lifestye

To date the company says it has sold more than five million products just through QVC and more than 15 million products overall since it was created. That’s a long way from its humble “kitchen table” beginnings.

Ami and Jason met in 2004 at a Las Vegas trade show. She had a small booth next to his where she displayed a collection of urban laptop bags and other products. He was showcasing a T-shirt line.

They fell in love and spent the next several months visiting each other in Toronto and Dallas. Their long drive between the two cities inspired the idea for Lug.

“We just really wanted to bring bright happy colors to the travel space because it felt really black and brown and boring” said Ami who identified Lug’s core customers as women 40 and above with active and busy lives who appreciate being organized.

They bootstrapped the company with $30000 they had saved and invested the profits back into the business. The Richters said they haven’t taken any outside funding to grow Lug since then.

“We drained our bank accounts and would max out credit cards for gas for our car trips” said Ami. “We were also our own salespeople and knocked on a lot of doors just pitching Lug.”

The turning point came in 2011 when the brand was picked up by a Canadian television home shopping channel. The QVC partnership followed two years later.

In October 2020 in the midst of the pandemic Ami and Jason launched a daily online live shopping show called Lug Live hosted by superfans of the brand. It has six hosts who each show a curated collection of Lug products and discuss how they fit into their everyday lives.

Ami’s next idea hints at her vision of Lug becoming a lifestyle brand beyond bags.

In October the company will introduce Lug sleepwear and loungewear – on QVC of course. “We’re about fun. Our customers already love to match our bags to what they’re wearing” she said. “Now they can dress head-to-toe in one of our prints.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9nb2xmL25ld3MvMjAyMi11cy1vcGVuLXB1cnNlLXByaXplLW1vbmV5LXBheW91dHMtZnJvbS1icm9va2xpbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 U.S. Open Purse Payouts Prize Money: Matt Fitzpatrick Banks Record $3.15 Million First Prize,"Matt Fitzpatrick broke the bank on Sunday at Brookline.

For the 122nd U.S. Open at The Country Club the USGA announced a record $17.5 million purse and $3.15 million will go to Fitzpatrick who won his first major and first PGA Tour event by fending off Will Zalatoris and Scottie Scheffeler on Sunday at Brookline. The purse is $5 million higher than last year when Jon Rahm won $2.25 million for his win.

The big-money trend in golf continues. The PGA put up an event-record $15 million purse last month with Justin Thomas winning $2.7 million. In April the Masters upped its purse $3 million from 2021 paying out $15 million. Scottie Scheffler won the green jacket plus $2.7 million. The Players Championship had a purse of $20 million then a record for pro golf with Cameron Smith taking a record winner's share of $3.6 million.

The biggest purses overall are now in the LIV Golf Invitational Series. Last week's event in London had a $25 million purse with $20 million for the individual event at $5 million for team play. Charl Schwartzel the overall winner and a member of the winning team took home $4.75 million. The money comes from the Public Investment Fund the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia.

A government attorney from the Philippines who was vacationing in Philadelphia with his mother was shot and killed while the two were inside an Uber in University City over the weekend.

John Albert Laylo 35 and his mother were inside an Uber on their way to Philadelphia International Airport early Saturday morning. As the Uber traveled along the 200 block of South 38th Street at 4:10 a.m. a black vehicle possibly a Cadillac pulled up behind them. The vehicle then pulled up along the driver's side and a gunman inside fired multiple shots striking the Uber. The vehicle then fled the scene.

Laylo was shot once in the back of the head. Responding Penn Police officers took him to the Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. He was later pronounced dead at 10:33 a.m. on Sunday.

No arrests have been made and police have not released information on any suspects. They also have not yet revealed whether Laylo was targeted or an innocent bystander. Law enforcement sources told NBC10 they are looking into several possible motives for the shooting including road rage and mistaken identity. They continue to investigate and are searching for surveillance video.

Laylo’s mother Leah Bustamante Laylo told NBC10 her son was a government attorney in the Philippines and the two were vacationing in Philadelphia at the time of his death. She also said she was struck by shrapnel during the shooting but was doing okay.

""I can’t explain the pain the heaviness I have in my heart"" she wrote. ""It took me hours to post this because still I can’t believe this happened!""

Uber said they have been in communication with the driver and that the ride-sharing company has a team of former law enforcement professionals including former FBI Secret Service etc. who are on call to work alongside police.

""The violent attack that took Mr. Laylo’s life is heartbreaking and our thoughts are with his family during their time of grief"" an Uber spokesperson said Monday. ""We hope the police are able to quickly arrest those responsible.”

Elmer Cato the Consul General of the Philippines New York told NBC10 a high ranking official in the Philippines informed him of Laylo's death.

""We are trying to reach authorities and hoping to sit down with the mayor and police commissioner so we can discuss this case"" Cato said.

A city spokesperson told NBC10 the Consul has ""been in close communication with staff from the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations and the City is doing everything possible to provide support through this traumatic experience.""

A gun violence tracker from the city controller’s office tallied 843 nonfatal and 209 fatal shooting victims as of Sunday June 19. Shootings have accounted for the most killings in Philadelphia this year.

As of Sunday night there were 230 homicides in the city in 2022 down only 11% from the same time last year which was ultimately the deadliest year in Philadelphia on record.

In response to the surging gun violence officials announced a joint initiative between Pennsylvania State Police and Philadelphia Police in which both departments would increase their presence in areas of the city hit hardest by crime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXJ0YW5nby5jb20vbmV3cy90aWt0b2tlci1zYXlzLXViZXItZHJpdmVyLXNob3dlZC11cC1oZXItaG91c2UtZGF5cy1hZnRlci1yaWRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikToker Says Uber Driver Showed Up To Her House Days After Ride,"A woman’s scary story of her experience with a creepy Uber driver is now being used to warn others after 1.1 million people viewed her TikTok.

The video by user @cvillainnn describes her Uber experience which begins with a seemingly innocent driver checking in on her with harmless intent — and ends with him requesting to be let into her apartment.

The TikToker says her Uber driver showed up at her house days after her ride.

The incident began with the woman needing an Uber to get her COVID vaccination back in the early day of the vaccine rollout.

Unfortunately the only location giving the vaccinations was far from her place. So she called an Uber.

When she finally got to her destination the Uber driver told her that only a few Ubers were available in the area so if she gave him her number he would wait and she could call him to drive her back home.

“I thought it made sense and I agreed” she adds in her video. “He didn’t give me any red flags because he was giving me like grandpa vibes because he was a really old man.”

It wasn’t long before she developed a bad feeling about her situation.

The Uber driver came to the door to check in on her as she was waiting for her 15-minute grace period for any potential side effects to end which made her a little uneasy.

Once back in the car she claims to have felt a “chill” down her spine while on their way back to her place when her driver saw she was getting sleepy and told her to take a nap in the back seat.

Uncomfortable she stayed awake until he dropped her off.

She believed “that was the end of it” when she got home. However a few days later her Uber driver started texting her first claiming to check in on her after her immunizations then constantly.

“He started to text me periodically like day after day…and I never responded” she explained.

She claims she received a call from her Uber driver two weeks later while visiting her parents.

“He’s like ‘Hey I’m downstairs at your lobby. What’s your unit number? Buzz me in’ and I was like ‘Why are you in my house?’”

The TikToker eventually reached out to the concierge of her building and told him not to let the Uber driver in or give any of her information. She later reveals that the man had to be removed by police.

“I submitted a report to Uber and I never heard from that driver again” she concludes.

While millions of individuals use ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft regularly without issue accidents and potentially life-threatening circumstances still occur. And with how dangerous the world can be we all must look out for each other.

Here are some tips to stay safe on your next Uber/Lyft ride.

1. Don’t use your exact address.

It’s a good idea to get picked up and dropped off from a secure location that isn’t precisely your house.

It’s not the best idea to give up your exact address to strangers so if the weather isn’t bad maybe it’s better to be dropped off about a block or two away from your destined location if you feel safe enough to walk a bit.

It’s also a good idea to be picked up and dropped off in a populated area that is safe and well-lit.

2. Check the car and license plate.

When you request an Uber/Lyft you receive the driver’s photo name make/model of the car and license plate number.

Making sure the driver and the license plate in the app match is one of the best methods to ensure you’re getting into the right car. It would be best if you never got into a vehicle that has a different driver a different car or a different license plate. If it doesn’t match don’t get in the car.

3. Make some conversation.

Though many riders prefer a quiet drive some small talk should always be shared before entering a stranger’s vehicle.

Before getting in the driver should know your name and destination. Ask the driver to repeat your information to you— if they don’t recognize you something is wrong.

I also recommend asking the driver’s name to ensure it matches the person on your app.

4. Watch where you sit.

If a driver asks you to sit in the front seat don’t. It’s also not a good idea to sit directly behind the driver because you won’t be able to see what they’re doing.

The best location for a rider to sit is in the back seat on the passenger side. That way everyone’s more comfortable and you can see the things happening around you.

5. Do not share personal information.

Your driver does not need to know anything about you. The company will give them everything they need to pick you up and drop you off. Do not give any driver your personal information.

If a driver is asking too many questions make things up.

6. Communication is key.

Once the Uber starts moving call a trusted friend or family member and inform them that you are on your way to whatever location and let them know how long it’ll take you to get there.

If you don’t have anyone to contact call yourself and leave a voicemail. This is done to alert the driver that you have others aware of your location.

Some rider-sharing apps will also allow you to share details about your ride with friends.

Whether it's domestic or international travel has underwent significant changes even some permanent ones. Covid may no longer be a huge concern at a majority of destinations worldwide but its impact is still being felt across different sectors of the industry where staff shortages are contributing to a summer of travel chaos.

Flight disruption is now becoming the rule rather than the exception and the huge influx of passengers is resulting in excessively long delays at some major international hubs. In a bid to ease the traffic into and out of airports and reduce wait times Uber will now allow travelers to pre-book their transfer up to 30 days in advance in several destinations.

If you're planning on traveling in the next few weeks this is your chance to secure a ride to the airport before most drivers are unavailable:

Airport Transfers Are About To Become A Lot Smoother

Uber is paving the way among same-category service providers in allowing customers to schedule a ride this far ahead and they have a very good reason for doing that. This year passenger traffic at U.S. airports has more than doubled compared to 2021 according to data provided by the Transport Security Association (TSA) and it could increase even further.

Now that the U.S. has finally lifted its much-criticized pre-departure testing regime more than half of Americans who had been patiently waiting for rules to be eased so they could travel will be taking to the skies in a heartbeat. While this is good news in terms of tourism recovery we have seen how the situation can turn anarchic when demand outpaces supply.

We all have had to stand in line for endless minutes until the next taxi or Uber was available sore-headed and all after a long flight journey and it's never a pleasant experience. Unfortunately wait times for airport transfers are set to increase once summer is in full swing – they're already long and the season is only starting.

Luckily with the new Uber Reserve option customers can now book trips up to a month in advance to and from several airports within the U.S. and globally. Though it was launched last year in select locations the update has now been extended to more than 55 hubs both domestic and international with the latest adds being the following:

Domestic*

Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS)

Harry Reid International Airport (LAS)

Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)

San Francisco International Airport (SFO)

International

Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport (BLQ) – Milan Italy

Milan Linate Airport (LIN) and Malpensa Airport (MXP) – Milan Italy

Giovan Battista Pastine International Airport (CIA) – Rome Italy

Fiumicino Leonardo da Vinci Airport (FCO) – Rome Italy

Nice Cote d’Azur Airport (NCE) – Nice France

Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) – Paris France

Cape Town International Airport (CPT) – Cape Town South Africa

O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB) – Johannesburg South Africa

Lanseria International Airport (HLA) – Johannesburg South Africa

There are in total 39 airports in the US where Uber Reserve is available. Customers are advised to check their Uber app to confirm whether the feature has been rolled out in the area

What Are Some Of The New Features?

Besides allowing early bookings Uber Reserve gives travelers total peace of mind as they have a guarantee their car will be waiting for them as soon as they leave the terminal. How so? The driver is required by Uber to wait up to 60 minutes – with no extra charge – just in case there are delays. Looking at the current state of things we really couldn't have asked for better.

There are other pretty cool features that might appeal even to those who are not huge Uber enthusiasts: when a flight is delayed for longer than 60 minutes the Uber's flight tracking integrated system will automatically adjust the expected arrival time based on flight information to ensure the driver is still there on time.

Whenever possible drivers will also be assigned before pickup as per customer request. On top of that passengers can select drivers out of their ‘Favorites' list on any Reserve ride. Lastly curbside pickup and pickup at restaurants in some airports is now permitted making it easier for passengers to find their car without having to walk to designated areas.

How Far In Advance Should I Request My Uber?

As air traffic increases and all travel lanes become heavily congested it may be wise to schedule your Uber in advance to ensure you will be at the airport in time for your flight. Most importantly pre-booking a transfer at your destination is key unless you're fine with waiting for the next available driver to come and pick you up… Along with every other person on your plane.

Airports like Cancun International can be incredibly busy during peak hours when hundreds of thousands of passengers are either transiting air-side or rushing straight to the airport's front doors to get the first taxi and it's sometimes impossible to find an ride in only a few minutes. Like we mentioned previously travel demand is only going up.

Scheduling a Uber ride or pre-booking a private transfer in Cancun's case can save you a lot of the hassle of trying to find a reliable driver when you're just desperate to get to your hotel as quickly as possible. Fortunately Uber Reserve is available in countless locations Stateside and you can read more about further enlargements clicking here.

But that’s only a fragment of individual imagination. 3D virtual spaces called the metaverse – after Zuckerberg’s Facebook rebranding to Meta – are now the virtual fashion in parts fuelled by the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens. NFTs permit the purchase of non-tangible items in the metaverse meant only for viewing not for use. Trimming that part for our little imagination studio Monde Singulier is pre-empting the launch of ultra-luxe furniture for the virtual and the real worlds. So you can then furnish the metaverse home and the physical living room with the same piece of collectibles furniture.

Playing with spatial design 3D artistry eye-catchy hues and materials Sebastien Baert co-founder Monde Singulier enhances the excitement by putting the furniture in the natural environment where detaching elements of chairs tables and beds awe-inspire the spectator. The pretentious character conceived instantly seeps the heart – knocking back and forth in dwindling narratives – instigating the mind to get one right away.

Get one? How much would you pay for furniture NFTs is a question best left unanswered at least until “Rêveries” – the collection of collectibles furniture – invades the metaverse. Rêveries comprises four luxury furniture collections oscillating between reality and imagination. Spanning over eight exquisite concepts; the Le Champ La Prairie Le Lagon and Le Desert collections are designed for both metaverse and the real world. If not all of them “a few furniture pieces” will be available in the real world while “every single piece will be auctioned in the metaverse” Monde Singulier substantiates through its webpage.

People still appear willing to shell out to travel go to the movies and have a drink or two even as surging prices and fears of a recession have them pulling back in other areas. How people spend their money is shifting as the economy slows and inflation pushes prices higher everywhere including gas stations grocery stores and luxury retail shops. The housing market for example is already feeling the pinch. Other industries have long been considered recession proof and may even be enjoying a bump as people start going out again after hunkering down during the pandemic. Still shoppers everywhere are feeling pressured. In May an inflation metric that tracks prices on a wide range of goods and services jumped 8.6% from a year ago the biggest jump since 1981. Consumers' optimism about their finances and the overall economy sentiment fell to 50.2% in June its lowest recorded level according to the University of Michigan's monthly index. As gas and food prices climb Brigette Engler an artist based in New York City said she's driving to her second home upstate less often and cutting back on eating out. ""Twenty dollars seems extravagant at this point for lunch"" she said. Here's a look at how different sectors are faring in the slowing economy.

Movies experiences holding up

Concerts movies travel and other experiences people missed during the height of the pandemic are among the industries enjoying strong demand. Live Nation Entertainment  which owns concert venues and Ticketmaster hasn't seen people's interest in attending concerts wane yet CEO Joe Berchtold said at the William Blair Growth Stock Conference earlier this month. In movie theaters blockbusters like ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" and ""Top Gun: Maverick"" have also pulled in strong box office sales. The movie industry long been considered ""recession proof"" since people who give up on pricier vacations or recurring Netflix subscriptions can often still afford movie tickets to escape for a few hours. Alcohol is another category that's generally protected from economic downturns and people are going out to bars again after drinking more at home during the early days of the pandemic. Even as brewers distillers and winemakers raise prices companies are betting that people are willing to pay more for better-quality alcohol. ""Consumers continue to trade up not down"" Molson Coors Beverage CEO Gavin Hattersley said on the company's earnings call in early May. It might seem counterintuitive but he said the trend is in line with recent economic downturns. Alcohol sales have also been shielded in part because prices haven't been rising as quickly as prices for other goods. In May alcohol prices were up roughly 4% from a year ago compared with the 8.6% jump for overall consumer price index. Big airlines like Delta  American and United are also forecasting a return to profitability thanks to a surge in travel demand. Consumers have largely digested higher fares helping airlines cover the soaring cost of fuel and other expenses although domestic bookings have dipped in the last two months. It isn't clear whether the race back to the skies will continue after the spring and summer travel rushes. Business travel usually picks up in the fall but airlines might not be able to count on that as some companies look for ways to curb expenses and even announce layoffs. People's desire to get out and socialize again is also boosting products like lipstick and high heels that were put away during the pandemic. That recently helped sales at retailers including Macy's and Ulta Beauty  which last month boosted their full-year profit forecasts. Luxury brands such as Chanel and Gucci are also proving to be more resilient with wealthier Americans not as affected by climbing prices in recent months. Their challenges have been more concentrated in China of late where pandemic restrictions persist. But the fear is that this dynamic could change quickly and these retailers' short-term gains could evaporate. More than eight in 10 U.S consumers are planning to make changes to pull back on their spending in the next three to six months according to a survey from NPD Group a consumer research firm. ""There is a tug-of-war between the consumer's desire to buy what they want and the need to make concessions based on the higher prices hitting their wallets"" said Marshal Cohen chief retail industry advisor for NPD.

Homes big-ticket items squeezed

The once red-hot housing market is among those clearly hurting from the slowdown. Rising interest rates have dampened mortgage demand which is now roughly half of what it was a year ago. Homebuilder sentiment has dropped to the lowest level in two years after falling for six consecutive months. Real estate firms Redfin and Compass both announced layoffs earlier this week. ""With May demand 17% below expectations we don't have enough work for our agents and support staff"" Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman wrote in an email to employees later posted on the company's website. For the retail sector more broadly data from the Commerce Department also showed a surprising 0.3% drop in overall in May from the previous month. That included declines at online retailers and miscellaneous store retailers such as florists and office suppliers. And while demand for new and used cars remains strong auto industry executives are starting to see signs of potential trouble. With the cost for new and used vehicles up by double digits over the last year car and other motor vehicle dealers saw sales decline 4% decline in May from the previous month according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Ford Motor CFO John Lawler said this week that delinquencies on car loans are starting to tick up too. Although the increase could signal tough times ahead he said said it's not yet a worry since delinquencies had been low. ""It seems like we're reverting back more towards the mean"" Lawler said at a Deutsche Bank conference. The restaurant industry is also seeing signs of potential trouble although how eateries are affected could vary. Fast-food chains have also traditionally fared better in economic downturns since they're more affordable and draw diners with promotional deals. Some restaurant companies are also betting people will keep dining out as long as grocery prices rise faster. The cost of food away from home rose 7.4% over the 12 months ended in May but prices for food at home climbed even faster shooting up 11.9% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Restaurant Brands International CEO Jose Cil and Wendy's CEO Todd Penegor are among the fast-food executives who have emphasized the gap as an advantage for the industry. But McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said in early May that low-income consumers have started ordering cheaper items or shrinking the size of their orders. As the largest U.S. restaurant chain by sales it's often seen as a bellwether for the industry. On top of that traffic across the broader restaurant industry slowed to its lowest point of the year in the first week of June according to market research firm Black Box Intelligence. That was after the number of visits also slowed in May though sales ticked up 0.7% on higher spending per visit. Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein also said in a research note on Friday that restaurants are accelerating discounting a sign that they're expecting same-store sales growth to slow. Among the chains that have introduced new deals to draw diners are Domino's Pizza  which is offering half-price pizzas and Wendy's  which brought back its $5 Biggie Bag meal. Among those scrambling to adjust to a shift in shopper behavior are mass-merchant retailers like Target and Walmart which issued cautious guidance for the year ahead. Target warned investors earlier this month that its fiscal second-quarter profits would take a hit as it discounts people bought up during the pandemic but no longer want such as small appliances and electronics. The big-box retailer is trying to make room on its shelves for the products in demand now: beauty products household essentials and back-to-school supplies. CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC that the company's stores and website are still seeing strong traffic and ""a very resilient customer"" overall despite the shift in their buying preferences. Rival Walmart has also been discounting less-desired items like apparel although the retail giant said it's been gaining share in grocery as shoppers look to save. — Leslie Josephs Lauren Thomas Michael Wayland John Rosevear Sarah Whitten and Melissa Repko contributed reporting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzM3NjhjOTE2LTAzNzAtNGQ3OS05ZjkxLWY4OTgwNTE4YjQ1M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Y2K personal style makes a comeback in jewellery,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Korean cosmetics companies shift focus to U.S. Japan

Korean cosmetic brands which have been heavily reliant on the Chinese market are shifting their focus to the United States and Japan to strengthen their global presence.The new strategy follows the rising popularity of Korean culture globally leading to rising demand for Korean beauty products in the United States and Japan. The importance of the Chinese market meanwhile has fallen steadily since the implementation of the U.S.-led Thaad anti-missile system in 2017 led to an informal boycott of Korean products with the recent lockdowns as part of Beijing's Zero-Covid policy further hitting sales.Amorepacific’s sales in the United States increased by 60 percent in the first quarter on-year according to the company on Thursday.With all Amorepacific brands showing growth in sales sales of Laneige andSulwhasooproducts helped raise earnings in the United States.In particular Sulwhasoo sales and profits were brought from both online and offline channels. The brand focused on expanding sales of its products at offline one-stop beauty shops such as Sephora while launching the brand on Amazon in April to expand its online presence.The Laneige brand strengthened its presence in the U.S. market by focusing on lip products.Lip products made up 50 percent of the brand’s total sales in the United States and have reached over 25 percent of sales growth on average for the past three years. The brand also showed a strong presence online with consistent sales growth of over 20 percent a month in the first quarter. It also made it to the top five list for the most searched brands in the skincare category.Industry insiders say now is the perfect time for cosmetics companies to target the U.S. market as Korea’s presence in the global market has been expanding with the recent success of BTS and “Squid Game.”“The [U.S.’s] view on Asia especially Korea has changed” said a spokesperson for Amorepacific.According to Euromonitor the United States has the largest cosmetics market at $91.8 billion followed by China and Japan.LG Household & Healthcare (LG H&H) a major local consumer goods company also announced plans to expand and strengthen its position in the U.S. beauty market last January. The company mentioned two other goals earlier in the year including expanding international businesses centered on the U.S. market and boosting digital marketing strategies.In January LG H&H unveiled its mini tattoo printer set to be launched in the fourth quarter of this year in the United States. The printer will allow users to create a temporary tattoo of any image they want and print it using a vegan ink cartridge developed by the company.LG H&H has also expanded its U.S. business by acquiring a 65 percent market share of The Crème Shop a Los Angeles-based beauty brand for $120 million in April.The Crème Shop is known for its whimsical and vibrant skin care make-up and beauty accessories that appeal to a diverse group of consumers said the company.The brand can be found at retail shops such as Ulta Beauty and has also successfully appealed to younger consumers by launching collaborative projects with Hello Kitty and Disney.Cosmetics manufacturers such as Kolmar Korea are also diversifying their strategies aimed at the U.S. market.Kolmar Korea acquired the global trademark rights to the Kolmar brand from the original company headquartered in the United States in May. The company is in the process of constructing an operations center in New Jersey.The center will serve as the business hub to effectively respond to changes in U.S. regulation and market trends and the company will work with Process Technologies & Packaging (PTP) a U.S.-based cosmetics manufacturer acquired by Kolmar Korea in 2016.Japan is another market that domestic cosmetics companies are targeting.Local cosmetics manufacturer Cosmax established an office in Japan in January and plans to construct a factory near Tokyo according to the company.The construction of the factory will begin in the first half of 2023 and it will be in operation starting in 2025.“There are many Korean cosmetics brands looking to enter the Japanese market as the demand for Korean beauty products surges due to the resurgence of Hallyu [the Korean Wave] in Japan” said the spokesperson for Cosmax.“We can help these brands to enter the Japanese market through our office in Japan and also help Japanese brands to sell their products in Korea in reverse.”In fact small and mid-sized local cosmetics companies are already showing good results in Japan. Beauty products such as eyelash serum mascara and lip tints from rom&nd a Korean beauty brand have topped the chart within the Lips app a popular online makeup review app in Japan. Lip tint products from Amuse a Korean vegan beauty brand are also top-selling items on Japanese e-commerce marketplaces such as q10 and Rakuten.Industry insiders say targeting other countries instead of China which has always been Korea’s largest export destination for cosmetics is necessary because of the instability of the Chinese market. According to the Korea Customs Service China was still the largest importer of Korean cosmetics last year at $4.1 billion 53 percent of the total $7.6 billion.“The Chinese market is still big for cosmetics but new strategies are definitely needed since many Chinese beauty products have been developed over the years and there is a tendency for Chinese consumers to purchase local brands” said Kim Joo-deok a professor at Sungshin Women’s University Graduate School.“The cosmetics industry is heavily influenced by the country’s local brands and culture so the Korean Wave in the United States and Japan will be a big opportunity for domestic cosmetics companies.”BY YOO JI-YOEN CHO JUNG-WOO [cho.jungwoo1@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXpvZXJlcG9ydC5jb20vYmVhdXR5L2RydWdzdG9yZS1tYXNjYXJhLXNob3J0LWFzaWFuLWxhc2hlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Drugstore Mascaras For Short Asian Lashes I Swear By,"There are four makeup items you’ll always find in my small touch-up pouch: a concealer a hydrating rosy lip tint a tube of mascara and an eyelash curler. The latter two products I need to have on me always as I was blessed with 8mm long lashes that are not only fine but point downwards making them appear nonexistent. (The Asian community will understand my struggle with short lashes.) Over the years after much trial and error I’ve learned which drugstore mascaras lift my short Asian lashes and even in the process lengthens them. (My budget-conscious soul refuses to spend more than $20 on a tube of product so Duane Reade it is!)

One of the first affordable mascaras I tried and absolutely loved was CoverGirl’s Lashblast Length— it came as a skinny yellow tube if you can recall — that was unfortunately discontinued a few years ago. From that experience however I’ve learned that the brush design plays an important factor in how the product spreads on my lashes. I prefer brushes that have many tight bunched up bristles so that the formula can catch and coat my fine lashes evenly in a single swipe. Additionally sometimes when the mascara delivers more of a lengthening look than volume I will first use a “voluminous” mascara then follow up with the lengthening option. (Layering your mascaras is a brilliant hack celebrity makeup artists swear by too!)

Currently I’m using Maybelline’s Lash Sensational Sky High Mascara — the same one that went viral on TikTok — and love how the first coat delivers a light non-clumping consistency on my lashes. I wait a few minutes for it to dry before topping with a second coat that makes my lashes look full lengthy and jet black. Once the second coat is completely dry I’ll curl my lashes again to make them stand up. (I use a Revlon eyelash curler if you’re wondering.) Throughout the day if I find that they’ve resettled into their point-straight-down position I’ll take out my curler to perk them right back up.

Although I’ll be repurchasing the pink Maybelline tube once I’m done with my current one — when I become obsessed with a beauty product I buy it until I get sick of it — there are several other drugstore mascaras that I’ve tried and loved in the past. Ahead see the ones I count on to lift lengthen and add volume to my fine short Asian lashes.

That won't change anytime soon,"New York CNN Business —

Americans gained a new federal holiday last year: Juneteenth. This year the holiday which commemorates of the end of slavery in the United States falls on Sunday but it will be observed in many places on Monday June 20.

Given that this long summer weekend also coincides with Father’s Day that means there will be a lot of travel going on.

The Friday before Juneteenth clocked in as the most popular air travel day of 2022 according to statistics from the Transportation Security Administration. Airports haven’t been that crowded since Thanksgiving 2021.

TSA officers said they screened about 2438784 people at airport security checkpoints nationwide on Friday the highest checkpoint volume since November 28 the Sunday after Thanksgiving. That also was about 100000 more travelers than the Friday before Memorial Day weekend.

“Welcome to the Juneteenth Holiday Weekend of travel!” wrote TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein on Twitter.

While Juneteenth became an official holiday last year this is the first year that the US stock market and banks will close in its honor.

The surge in numbers couldn’t have come at a worse time for US airlines. A combination of rough weather staff shortages and infrastructure challenges have left major carriers struggling to keep up with the surge in travel. Nearly 9000 flights were delayed within the US Friday and another 1500 flights were canceled according to the data group FlightAware.

In all more than 3200 flights were canceled between Friday and Sunday per FlightAware including more than 850 flights on Saturday and more than 900 Sunday.

Delta Air Lines alone canceled at least 248 flights on Sunday. United Airlines canceled 90 flights and American Airlines canceled 96 flights.

“A variety of factors continue to impact our operations including challenges with air traffic control weather and unscheduled absences in some work groups” Delta said in a statement to CNN. “Canceling a flight is always our last resort and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience to their travel plans.”

CNN has reached out to United and American for a comment on the flight cancellations.

The increase in delays and cancellations comes just one day after Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with airline CEOs to discuss ways to improve performance and operations ahead of another expected surge in travel over the 4th of July holiday.

About 2700 flights were canceled over Memorial Day weekend. Major airlines already are preemptively canceling more flights just as the busy summer season heats up. Southwest Airlines has cut nearly 20000 flights between June and Labor Day and is struggling to hire the 10000 new workers it says it needs to meet demand.

“I go through the Whataburger drive-thru and I pay and get my bag and stapled to the bag is a job application” Southwest CEO Robert Jordan joked to the Dallas Morning News last year about the difficulty in finding job applicants. “That’s what it’s come to.”

Delta said it will cancel 100 daily flights in the US and Latin America from July 1 to August 7. In an open letter to customers Delta pilots wrote that the labor shortage has put them on pace to fly more overtime hours this year than in all of 2018 and 2019 combined.

“The pilot shortage for the industry is real and most airlines are simply not going to be able to realize their capacity plans because there simply aren’t enough pilots at least not for the next five-plus years” United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said during the airline’s quarterly earnings call in April.

Unions representing pilots at Delta American and Southwest say that airlines got themselves into the current situation by refusing to replace pilots who retired and took leaves of absence during the height of the pandemic when air travel plummeted.

About 8000 new commercial pilots have received certificates in the last year according to pilot unions and they say there shouldn’t be a shortage. The current service cut narrative they claim is being used by companies to justify a cut to training and safety requirements that will boost profit margins.

Some US senators are taking note. “While some flight cancellations are unavoidable the sheer number of delays and cancellations this past weekend raises questions about airline decision-making” wrote Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey in a letter to Buttigieg earlier this month.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Juneteenth just became a federal holiday in 2021 but it has quickly become one that’s observed not only by state and local governments but by many private businesses as well (though some like Google and Amazon have not).

The newness of the holiday means there’s still confusion about what is and isn’t open especially on a year when Juneteenth falls on a Sunday. We’ve tracked down some answers for you.

What is Juneteenth?

On June 19 1865 the last Black slaves of the Confederacy were ordered free when Union troops arrived in Galveston Texas. The Civil War had ended two months prior officially but Galveston was a holdout and had to be secured. The day became known as Juneteenth and for a long time was only observed in Texas.

It began to spread over the years and truly came to prominence following the 2020 protests that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

When is Juneteenth?

Juneteenth is celebrated on June 19 each year. Because that falls on a Sunday this year it will be observed on June 20 by governments and businesses.

Are banks open on Juneteenth?

They’re not. Juneteenth is a federal holiday meaning banks will be closed on June 20 as well. You can of course still use ATM machines to get cash or put money into your account.

Will there be any mail delivery on Juneteenth?

There won’t be any from the U.S. Postal Service. Mail delivery is suspended both that day and on Monday when it is observed. UPS will not make any ground air or international deliveries on the 19th—and most UPS stores will be closed. The company will operate normally on Monday however. FedEx will conduct business as usual both Sunday and Monday.

Is the stock market open on Juneteenth?

After the past few weeks maybe a day off from trading is a good thing. The New York Stock Exchange Nasdaq and bond markets are all closed Monday. Their next scheduled holiday is July 4.

Are government offices open on Juneteenth?

It’s complicated.

Federal offices will be closed on June 20 but when it comes to state offices it’s a lot murkier.

Lawmakers in Alabama Mississippi South Carolina Tennessee and other states failed to advance proposals this year that would have closed state offices and given most of their public employees paid time off on Juneteenth.

This year nearly 20 states are expected to close state offices and give public employees time off including Connecticut Colorado Georgia Maryland South Dakota Utah and Washington. A bill introduced in California passed the Assembly and moved to the Senate this month and individual cities such as Los Angeles have already signed proclamations making Juneteenth official. And some cities in Arizona including Phoenix have declared Juneteenth an official holiday but the state has not.

Are any retail and grocery stores closed on Juneteenth?

In general no. While some small businesses could be closed due to staffing crises no major retailer shuts down for this holiday though many pay employees time-and-a-half for working.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwbm5ld3MuY29tL3VuaXRlZC13YXktbXVtYmFpLWFuZC1ydG8tbXVtYmFpLWNlbnRyYWwtbGF1bmNoLXRoZS10d28td2hlZWxlci1zaW11bGF0b3ItdHJhaW5pbmcv0gFraHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBubmV3cy5jb20vdW5pdGVkLXdheS1tdW1iYWktYW5kLXJ0by1tdW1iYWktY2VudHJhbC1sYXVuY2gtdGhlLXR3by13aGVlbGVyLXNpbXVsYXRvci10cmFpbmluZy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Way Mumbai and RTO Mumbai Central launch the two-wheeler simulator training,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apnnews.com/united-way-mumbai-and-rto-mumbai-central-launch-the-two-wheeler-simulator-training/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwbm5ld3MuY29tL3VuaXRlZC13YXktbXVtYmFpLWFuZC1ydG8tbXVtYmFpLWNlbnRyYWwtbGF1bmNoLXRoZS10d28td2hlZWxlci1zaW11bGF0b3ItdHJhaW5pbmcv0gFraHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBubmV3cy5jb20vdW5pdGVkLXdheS1tdW1iYWktYW5kLXJ0by1tdW1iYWktY2VudHJhbC1sYXVuY2gtdGhlLXR3by13aGVlbGVyLXNpbXVsYXRvci10cmFpbmluZy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Per the terms of the deal an affiliate of UnitedHealth's Optum business in the U.K. Bordeaux UK Holdings II Limited has offered 1925 pence per share in cash reflecting a 49% premium to EMIS’ closing price on Thursday.

Shares in the Leeds-based healthcare software maker closed 47% higher at 1901.95 pence on Friday in London giving a market capitalization of about 1.2 billion pounds.

Reuters reports that the EMIS directors intend to unanimously recommend the deal to shareholders.

EMIS provides healthcare software information technology and other services in the U.K. with a focus on primary care and pharmacy systems.

Optum's U.K. business has worked in the country for 20 years supporting the state-run National Health Service (NHS) according to an announcement. The company describes itself as a healthcare software services and consultancy business delivering population health management programs to more than 45 million people in the U.K. and medicines optimization services across the country.

Optum UK CEO Rob Sergeant said in a statement the deal to acquire EMIS will bring more advanced technology solutions and capabilities to the NHS and general practitioners to improve patient care.

The combination will strengthen EMIS’ capabilities as a leading U.K. healthcare technology company with an enhanced ability to deliver important benefits for patients clinicians and the NHS Optum UK executives said.

""We believe this combination will have the resources and expertise to enable us to better support the NHS and clinicians through technology innovations"" said Andy Thorburn CEO of EMIS in a statement.

""EMIS’s long-standing track record of delivering effective technology solutions and strong financial and operating performance combined with UnitedHealth Group’s resources and expertise will enable us to accelerate our development. We therefore consider that the combined group will be well-positioned to serve its customers and partners in the UK’s healthcare system whilst ensuring EMIS remains a strong organization supporting the NHS thereby fulfilling EMIS’ purpose of enabling better care through technology innovation"" Thorburn said.

The proposed transaction would be UnitedHealth’s largest disclosed acquisition in Europe since British executive Andrew Witty became CEO last year according to Bloomberg.

In the U.S. Optum has been on an acquisition hot streak reportedly scooping up Healthcare Associates of Texas earlier this month. In March UnitedHealth announced plans to buy home health provider LHC Group in a $5 billion deal and quietly purchased behavioral health company Refresh Mental Health.

In addition in April it was reported that the healthcare giant would pick up Houston-based Kelsey-Seybold Clinic.

UnitedHealth is also embroiled in a legal scuffle with the federal government over its planned acquisition of Change Healthcare which would join the Optum fold. The Department of Justice sued to block the deal on antitrust grounds and a trial is set for August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxoZWFsdGgubmV0LzIwMjIvMDYvdW5pdGVkaGVhbHRoLXRvLWJ1dC1lbWlzLWZvci0xLTItYmlsbGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UnitedHealth Group to buy GP IT provider EMIS for £1.2billion,"American health giant UnitedHealth Group has agreed to acquire EMIS Group in an all-cash deal which is worth around £1.24billion ($1.51billion).

The app industry continues to grow with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021 according to the latest year-end reports. Global spending across iOS Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5% reaching 230 billion in 2021 and mobile ad spend grew 23% year over year to reach $295 billion.

Today’s consumers now spend more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day for example but in 2021 they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil Indonesia and South Korea users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.

Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021 233 apps and games generated more than $100 million in consumer spend and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue. This was up 20% from 2020 when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend and just eight apps topped $1 billion.

Instagram to “nudge” teens away from some negative content

Social apps are taking a closer look at how they’re being used by teens and minors as regulatory pressure increases.

Last week TikTok improved its protections for minor users when adding a new feature that allows users to remind themselves to “take a break” after watching videos for a certain amount of time on the app. As a part of this the company also said it would notify younger teens on the app that the new tool was available if they had spent more than 100 minutes on TikTok the prior day.

This week Instagram said it’s rolling out its own set of improvements to the teen experience. It’s expanding access to its existing parental control features outside the U.S. to users in the U.K. Japan Australia Ireland Canada France and Germany starting this month and plans to make them globally available by year end.

In addition Instagram will now allow parents and guardians to send invitations to teens to initiate the setup of supervision tools. Once enabled they’ll be able to limit their teen’s usage of the app during specific times of day and days of the week. They’ll also be able to see more information when the teen reports an account or a post including who they reported and the type of report. For parents who were already using parental controls in the U.S. the feature will be updated to include these new features.

Notably Meta is also now taking a cue from last fall’s congressional line of inquiry into how Instagram’s algorithms could be leading teens to develop eating disorders as searches for healthy recipes push them down rabbit holes to content that encourages disordered eating over-exercise and other things that could trigger negative body image issues. Instagram says it will roll out “nudges” in the app that encourage teens to switch to a different topic if it sees them repeatedly looking at the same type of content on the Explore page. This feature aims to help direct them away to content they may be obsessing over to discover something new. It also won’t nudge users toward content that’s associated with “appearance comparison” the company said.

Of course by limiting nudges to the Explore page Instagram isn’t fully addressing the problem as users could still encounter this content while browsing their Feed Stories or Reels. But in that case the content is there because the user explicitly chose to follow someone — which is why parental monitoring of the time spent on the app remains important.

Sherlocks from Apple’s WWDC

Apple introduced a number of new features and services across its platforms at this month’s Worldwide Developers Conference but in doing so the company appears to have once again pulled inspiration from the wider developer community. TechCrunch’s Ivan Mehta took a look at which apps got “sherlocked” during WWDC as a result. (The term refers to Apple’s old finder app called Sherlock which the company updated with features offered by a competitor Watson. The move eventually put the latter out of business.)

This time around Apple introduced a number of concepts popularized by other apps — like Continuity Camera which seems to be inspired by companies like Camo which had allowed users to use their iPhone as a computer webcam. This situation recalls how the makers of Duet Display and Luna had to refocus on serving a broader ecosystem after Apple introduced Sidecar in 2019 to offer a similar ability to use the iPad as a secondary display. Camo too will need to shift some of its focus to Windows and Android as Apple moves in on its market.

Other services that may see increased competition include: BNPL apps like Klarna and Afterpay which will now go up against Apple Pay Later; apps for removing the background from photos which is now a native iOS 16 feature; medication tracking apps which will compete with a native Apple Health feature; Figjam and other collaboration tools which will have a new first-party rival in the form of Apple’s Freeform; and sleep tracking apps whose functionality has been added to Apple Health.

While this year was a particularly bad one for smaller startups that had seen an opportunity in the market not everything Apple copies is a fully developed product. For instance Camo saw the shift to online meetings in the wake of COVID was driving consumer demand for better webcams — and what better way to serve that market than to repurpose the excellent camera most people already carried as a smartphone? But as Florian Mueller explained on the FOSS Patents blog this week Camo was more of a feature than a product. And perhaps in those cases developers should focus on patenting whatever feature it is they’ve come up with rather than waiting for Apple to swoop in with an app or API that could significantly impact their business. At least then some of their work could be compensated.

FOSS also noted however that there continues to be concern that apps delivering their software to users through Apple’s own App Store are inadvertently giving Apple access to valuable data about their customers and traction. Alternative app stores could help somewhat to alleviate this concern.

In fact Apple’s “sherlocking” was a line of inquiry at last year’s antitrust hearing in the U.S. Senate when a rep from Apple was asked whether there was a “strict firewall” or other internal policies in place that prevented them from leveraging the data from third-party businesses operating on their app stores to inform the development of their own competitive products. Apple had only offered vague responses as to whether or not it leveraged such App Store data for product development ideas.

“We don’t copy. We don’t kill. What we do is offer up a new choice and a new innovation” Kyle Andeer Apple’s chief compliance officer had said at the time. He noted simply that Apple had “separate teams” and “controls in place” to avoid such issues.

TikTok relocates U.S. user data to Oracle

In a huge move TikTok said it would move its U.S. users’ data to Oracle servers located in the U.S. at the same time BuzzFeed published a remarkable report indicating that TikTok’s U.S. data was regularly being shared with ByteDance colleagues in China. Concern over China’s access to TikTok had previously led the Trump administration to ban the app in the U.S. The ban was initially held up by the courts and the appeals were then put on pause when Biden came into office. All the while TikTok had repeatedly said it would never hand over U.S. user data to anyone.

When the Trump ban was underway TikTok had engaged in discussions with several tech companies to acquire its U.S. business if it was forced to spin it off. Oracle had been among the suitors so it’s not surprising it was named in the new deal.

In recent days TikTok had come under fire in media reports about its toxic workplace culture where employees were quitting because of being overworked — spending some 12 hours a day at their job due to requirements to align themselves with China’s business hours. The company was said to also reward the overworked and punish those who set more reasonable boundaries as it seemed to enforce China’s 996 work schedule on non-Chinese employees. This dictates a schedule of working from 9 am to 9 pm 6 days per week. A WSJ report also noted some U.S. employees said they had worked 85 hours per week on average resulting in health concerns stress anxiety and emotional lows so severe they sought therapy.

A new startup called Grace launched an app to make it easier for parents to monitor and manage their kids’ screen time and app usage on iOS devices. Although Apple offers built-in parental controls many parents would prefer an app-based solution as opposed to having to dig around in the settings for Apple’s tools. In addition Grace offers more customization over kids’ screen time schedules. With Apple’s controls parents can only configure start and stop times for “Downtime” for instance as opposed to being able to set other times when app usage should be limited like school hours family dinner time homework time and more.

Grace is also notable for being one of the first to arrive that’s built with Apple’s Screen Time API introduced at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference last year. The new API allows developers to create an interface that works with Apple’s built-in tools in order to expand their functionality.

The delivery of quality health care including maternal and child welfare management of minor ailments and family planning services are absent in these communities and have worsened the plight of people.

Road and communication network to facilitate the movement of the people goods and services and

also connecting them to Techiman the regional capital and other areas have also become a night mare.

The absent of health facilities such as the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) Compounds and no road network have cut these communities off denying them of benefits of primary health care and enjoyment of universal health coverage.

Furthermore the bad road network has been a barrier for the residents of these communities to access health care or any other social services such as quality education among others.

This came to light when Nana Ali Kokroko II the chief of Aworopataa spoke an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) at his palace about the deprived state of their communities lamenting that they were completely cut off from the town centres especially during the rainy seasons.

Nana Kokroko II explained due to the absence of CHPS compounds people were not able to treat minor ailments and sometimes got complications and died of them as a result.

He noted that his community alone could count of about 600 people who are basically peasant farmers but could not access the market centres to sell their farm produce because both public and private transport did not ply the area.

In view of that he bemoaned that most of their farm produce were left to rot on the farms a situation he described as “very pathetic.”

Nana Kokroko II said the need for the Municipal Assembly to consider the socio-economic plight and welfare of the people was paramount.

“Sick people are mostly carried on motorbikes to nearby health facilities such as Bamiri Health Centre and the Holy Family Hospital in Techiman. Pregnant women sometimes delivered on the way with some losing their babies” Nana Kokroko said and described the situation as “very disturbing” because the community continued to lose members through the process.

He appealed to the Government through the Techiman Municipal Assembly philanthropists non-governmental and charitable organisations to come to the aid of the communities to change their situation for the better.

In a related interview Mr Dominic Atia an opinion leader at Aworopataa told the GNA that the provision of certain educational facilities such as the school feeding programme to drive enrolment sustain interest of pupils in school and improve on quality education “is missing in all the schools across the aforementioned communities.”

Mr Atia added that there was the need to improve sanitation in the communities as no one could boast of a public toilet saying that had encouraged mass open defecation in the communities.

He expressed the fear that the situation might cause the outbreak of contagious disease like cholera and even skin infections that could be of dire consequences on the people.",,,,,,

El 19 de junio hora local Billboard anunció oficialmente que el nuevo álbum de antología de BTS “Proof” había debutado en el número 1 en su famosa lista Top 200 Albums su clasificación semanal de los álbumes más populares en los Estados Unidos.

A pesar de que consiste principalmente en canciones lanzadas anteriormente “Proof” logró la mayor semana de ventas en Estados Unidos de cualquier álbum de un grupo hasta el momento en el 2022 y la segunda más grande en general luego de la semana de debut de “Harry House” de Harry Styles.

Según Luminate (anteriormente MRC Data) “Proof” obtuvo la impresionante cantidad de 314 000 unidades de álbumes equivalentes durante la semana que finalizó el 16 de junio. unidades de álbum equivalente (SEA) lo que se traduce en 5284 millones de transmisiones de audio a pedido en la primera semana del álbum.

Un poco más de 259.000 de las ventas de álbumes tradicionales logradas por “Proof” fueron ventas de CD marcando la “semana de ventas más grande para un álbum en CD en los Estados Unidos desde ’30’ de Adele” que vendió 378.000 CD en su primera semana el año pasado. A modo de comparación Billboard señaló: “La gran mayoría de las ventas de CD de ’30’ provinieron de las ediciones de $1198 y $1398” mientras que “hay dos variantes de CD disponibles en total [para ‘Proof’]: una versión de $24 y una versión de $70”.

Además como “Proof” es el sexto álbum de BTS en ingresar a la lista en el No. 1 el grupo es ahora el primer y hasta ahora único artista coreano en encabezar el Billboard 200 con seis álbumes diferentes. El primer álbum No. 1 de BTS fue “Love Yourself: Tear” en junio del 2018 seguido de “Love Yourself: Answer” “Map of the Soul: Persona” “Map of the Soul: 7” y “BE”.

Incluyendo “Proof” sólo 15 álbumes en idiomas distintos al inglés han encabezado el Billboard 200 en la historia de la lista lo que significa que de esos 15 álbumes No. 1 seis han sido de BTS.

¡Felicitaciones a BTS por su logro histórico!

Estimó que podrían desaparecer hasta 20% de las tiendas de abarrotes escenario que no se descarta si se prolongan la deficiente distribución de productos pues los tenderos vienen arrastrando las pérdidas de la pandemia y si a eso se le añade que cuando empieza la recuperación hay problemas para el abasto de bebidas y víveres “se pueden extinguir de un 10% a un 20% de las tiendas del estado de Aguascalientes es un tema triste y detonante para el comerciante”.

Finalmente el presidente de la Asociación de Abarroteros Unidos hizo un llamado a la población a no incurrir en compras de pánico pues ello podría hacer que empeore la situación al acabarse el respaldo que tienen los tenderos de reservas de algunos productos.

Este año debido a la celebración del Día del Padre la Cámara de Comercio Servicios y Turismo (Canaco) anticipó una derrama de hasta 2 mil 137 millones de pesos (mdp) en ventas lo que supone una recuperación de 11% en comparación con el año pasado.

Sin embargo José de Jesús Rodríguez Cárdenas quien preside la cámara indicó que existe la posibilidad de que la celebración de este año ocurra en el marco de la incertidumbre ante el repunte de nuevos positivos de Covid-19 y la alta inflación.

La Canaco sostuvo que pese a la recuperación en ventas contra las del año pasado la cifra está un 33.5% debajo de los resultados obtenidos en el 2019.

Por otro lado Rodríguez Cárdenas se dijo confiado en que los sectores de accesorios personales artículos de piel restaurantes y telefonía móvil tendrán un impacto positivo en las ventas.

Respecto al comercio electrónico sostuvo que la tasa de participación será de hasta el 30 por ciento.

José Fernando Molina joven novillero de Albacete debutó este domingo en Madrid tras haber enterrado hace pocas semanas a su madre víctima de una enfermedad letal. La peor cornada para un hombre y el mejor acicate para un torero. Qué cosas. Los que se visten de luces son el reflejo del dolor y de la angustia que es la vida cuando no viene todo dado. Llegó a una plaza de Las Ventas que no aforó ni un sexto de plaza. De no ser por los buses un drama. Se explayó con su lote fue cogido en dos ocasiones y se llevó un recuerdo en la frente en forma de pitonazo para toda la vida. No fue la puerta grande más rotunda en este coso y seguramente tampoco fue merecida. No por mérito sino porque Madrid exige mucho más pero se vio a un torero que viene a mandar y que tenía implícita en su debut la despedida. Lo siguiente era una alternativa de campanillas en su tierra y vivir del DNI y si eso una confirmación de medio pelo para justificar su profesión a medio camino entre poner toldos y poner billetes para jugarse la vida. Cuando uno da lo que tiene poco más se le puede pedir.

José Fernando Molina se fue a la puerta de chiqueros a hacer su presentación en Las Ventas y se llevó un porrazo tremendo. Salió gazapeando el de Los Chospes y no se arrancó hasta el último instante. Molina no pudo quitárselo de encima y se lo encontró de frente. Un milagro. Se desplazó en los capotes con alegría el astifino ejemplar de Fernando Moreno que eso sí manseó en exceso. Lo lidió Fernando Casanova con brillantez antes de que Molina brindase al cielo y al público de Madrid. Cayó la montera boca abajo y en los medios se quedó para cambiarle el viaje por la espalda. Se arrancó a soplar el viento y tuvo que rectificar en el primer envite para salvar la cogida. Estuvo hábil y se arrancó a torear con la diestra.

Y lo hizo perfecto corriendo la mano por abajo muy templado y acertando siempre en el toque muy ligero. Quiso lucir los pases de pecho pero el tranco del animal le dejaba siempre un palmo fuera de cacho. Al natural no terminó de acoplarse viento mediante y volvió al derecho para dejar la tanda de más enjundia del conjunto. Cerró por ajustadas manoletinas y otro pase de pecho de lujo. Se tiró a matar con todo en la suerte contraria y cobró primero una estocada tendida y desprendida y segundo un volteretón tremendo. Casanova le salvó la vida en un quite para enmarcar. Se echó el novillo y sacó pronto el pañuelo el presidente.

Audio El novillero albaceteño habla en exclusiva a COPE tras abrir la Puerta Grande de Las Ventas este domingo.

Al quinto un novillo que con 200 kilos más pasaría por toro de Madrid lo saludó con un ramillete de verónicas muy templadas y más allá del gusto inteligentes. Dándole sitio abriéndole los caminos y dejándole llegar. Como bien explican los maestros en la escuela taurina de Albacete que te toque los trastos de salida no es necesariamente malo porque ayuda a encelar al bicho. Y para cerrar un inicio a favor de obra dos puyazos soberbios de Daniel López especialmente el segundo. Citó al toro de largo toreó a caballo y colocó la vara en el sitio clave para ayudar a que las cosas vayan un poquito mejor.

Para empezar la faena se fue Molina a los medios. Sin probaturas. Dando distancia y toreando. Inteligente. Protestó mucho por el derecho el utrero con un tornillazo imposible de limpiar que deslució cada muletazo. Cambió de mano y dejó varios naturales de escándalo. Se llevó dos cabezazos del toro y en uno de ellos le cazó de lleno en la cara. Terminó la faena sangrando y toreando con la izquierda a las mil maravillas. Bien colocado y consciente de lo que tenía entre manos. La estocada fue perfecta. El presidente concedió una oreja generosa pero ahí quedó la obra.

Se protestó mucho de salida al terciado primero de Los Chospes con el que nada pudo hacer de capa Antonio Grande. Sí pudo lucirse José Fernando Molina en un vistoso quite entrelazando saltilleras y gaoneras. Brindó Grande a sus hombres de confianza en el burladero de apoderados e inició la faena con estilo sacándose al toro desde los bajos del 10 hasta el tercio del mismo tendido. Y hasta ahí lo suyo. El utrero se movió mucho pero no se entregó y fue protestando en cada cite. El salmantino lo pasó pero todo quedó en un tostón.

Brindó al público la faena al cuarto con el que no destacó en nada hasta la muleta. Toreó bien con la derecha pero el hándicap de su labor fue la falta de vigor del de Los Chospes que llegó a echarse en el ecuador del trasteo. Muy tranquilo bien colocado y con gusto pero sin oponente. Antonio Grande fue uno de los grandes perjudicados por la pandemia y le va a costar mucho volver a entrar en el carril pero tiene el toreo en la cabeza. Salvo que cambie algo será un víctima más de los renglones torcidos del toreo actual.

Regresaba Arturo Gilio a Las Ventas tras la grave cornada que recibió en San Isidro. En las novilladas de triunfadores también cabe el respeto por los toreros heridos. Bien por la empresa. Lo intentó todo con su primero pero faltó acople tanto el capote como en la muleta. Acelerado por momentos y dejándose llevar en otros. Lo mejor el espadazo.

Estuvo muy dispuesto con el sexto y dejó muletazos de buen trazo pero la faena no tomó forma en ningún momento especialmente condicionada por la beligerancia entre el tendido 7 y los autobuses de Albacete que flaco favor le hicieron a su torero. Lo mató bien y dejó muestras de ser un torero que puede seguir aportando cosas importantes a la profesión.

He was airlifted to a hospital in Denver and received a handful of surgeries procedures and medical tests. Last Wednesday Alex was strong enough to be transferred to inpatient care where he has been working on physical occupational and speech therapy. He is now home with Kelly and the girls and is embarking on a long and arduous journey through outpatient rehabilitation.

Alex’s stroke has been devastating to Jolie Rori (college-age daughters) and Kelly. This tight-knit clan have been in crisis management mode every single day since then taking turns driving to be with him working and tending to house matters and trying to navigate the complexities of health insurance.





The blessings are that Alex is physically very strong. He is in good spirits a lot of the time. He is eager to work with professionals to gain back strength fluidity and freedom in all areas. Speech is limited at this time so Kelly has created a list of a dozen topics and question starters to which Alex can point for communication.





If you live in the Louisville/Superior area you might see Kelly and Alex hand-in-hand walking the neighborhood at Lifetime Fitness heading to a Pilates class or the treadmill or at the grocery store naming fruits. The love this family has for one another is unshakeable but make no mistake people that know Alex agree this must be the most challenging situation for this Navy Veteran turned Director of Business Sales for Verizon who always puts his family first and works so hard to provide them financial security and an amazing life.





We know what a proud man Alex is and we are equally proud to be his friends. Now I ask you to help support the Martinez family as they work to get Alex back up and running at full speed. Even with excellent health insurance the co-pays for the extensive therapies will be astronomical. Additionally Alex is not able to work at this time which adds tremendously to the family’s financial hardship.





Alex and Kelly joined me on my first yoga retreat in Nicaragua. I was struck by the strength of the relationship between these two and the love and adoration they have for each other and their girls. I remember teaching yoga one evening but instead of joining class Alex was carrying pots of hot water to another yogi in their bungalow who was stung by a stingray earlier in the day. Alex has the strength and character to fight please consider lending financial support as you are able.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmkyNG5ld3MudHYvZW4vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2FtZXJpY2FzLzE2NTU1NTM1MjEtZGVhbC1yZWFjaGVkLW9uLXVzLTVnLWFudGVubmFzLW5lYXItYWlycG9ydHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deal Reached On US 5G Antennas Near Airports - I24NEWS,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gzMmNoaWNhZ28uY29tL25ld3MvY2hpY2Fnby1tYW4tb3V0LW9uLWJvbmQtZm9yLWFsbGVnZWQtYXJtZWQtcm9iYmVyeS1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLXJvYmJpbmctdmVyaXpvbi1zdG9yZS1pbi1oaW5zZGFsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicago man out on bond for alleged armed robbery accused of robbing Verizon store in Hinsdale,"A Chicago man who was out on bond for an armed robbery is accused of robbing a Verizon store in Hinsdale earlier this week.

Stephon Little also known as Isa Al Ahad 29 has been charged with two counts of armed robbery and one count of possession of a stolen motor vehicle.

At about 7:56 p.m. Thursday an employee at the Verizon Wireless store located at 34 East First Street was closing for the night when an offender later identified as Little entered the business from the rear public access door prosecutors said.

Little allegedly told the employee ""Come on"" multiple times — indicating that he wanted merchandise from the store.

Little then allegedly forced the employee at gunpoint to load 60 Apple products into a bag — including iPhones iPads and Apple watches.

Prosecutors said Little told the employee to go to a bathroom and wait five minutes before exiting.

While the employee was in the bathroom Little allegedly fled the scene in a car that was reported stolen out of Chicago.

The employee called police and with the help of an Illinois State Police airplane the Hindsale Police Department was able to track the suspect to a location in Ford Heights.

An airline industry trade group said federal regulators are taking a “rushed approach” to changing equipment on planes under pressure from the telecommunications companies.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday that the wireless companies agreed to delay some of their use of the C-Band section of the radio spectrum until July 2023.

“We believe we have identified a path that will continue to enable aviation and 5G C-band wireless to safely co-exist” said the FAA’s acting administrator Billy Nolen.

However aviation groups said the C-Band service could interfere with radio altimeters – devices used to measure a plane’s height above the ground. Pilots use altimeters for landing in bad weather when visibility is poor.

Nolen said planes most susceptible to interference – smaller so-called regional airline planes – must be retrofitted with filters or new altimeters by the end of this year. Components to retrofit larger planes used by major airlines should be available by July 2023 when the wireless companies expect to run 5G networks in urban areas “with minimal restrictions” he said.

Airlines for America a trade group for the largest US carriers said the FAA hasn’t approved necessary upgrades and manufacturers have not yet produced the parts.

“It is not at all clear that carriers can meet what appears to be an arbitrary deadline” trade group CEO Nicholas Calio said in a letter to Nolen.

He said safety is jeopardised “by the rushed approach to avionics modifications amid pressure from the telecommunications companies” and warned that if replacement parts aren’t ready in time airline service could be disrupted.

Verizon said the agreement will let the company lift voluntary limits on its 5G rollout around airports “in a staged approach over the coming months”. AT&T said it agreed to take “a more tailored approach” to controlling the strength of signals near runways so airlines have more time to retrofit equipment.

Yesterday’s developments were the latest in a long-running dispute between airlines and wireless companies and their respective regulators the FAA and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which determined that C-Band service posed no risk to planes.

Verizon and AT&T spent USD68 billion between them at an FCC auction of 5G spectrum last year. The companies began activating new 5G networks in January but agreed to delay powering up some towers for six months until July 5 because of concerns raised by the FAA and airlines."

This cystic fibrosis medication has been hailed a wonder drug – but some people say it’s making them suicidal

A life-changing cystic fibrosis medication is claimed to be causing anxiety depression and even suicidal thoughts in some patients.

Wonder-drug Kaftrio was made available to cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in the UK in June 2020 and has been hailed as the closest thing to a ‘cure’ we currently have for people with CF.

It is expected to prolong the lives of people with CF and has seen some patients’ lung functions improve by up to 40%.

Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening chronic illness caused by a defective gene affecting 10500 people in the UK.

It causes passageways in the lungs and digestive system to become blocked with sticky mucus eventually resulting in fatal lung damage and several other health problems.

After a four-year battle in November 2019 the UK gained access to Orkambi and sister drugs Symkevi and Kalydeco. It was a huge success for the CF community.

At the time access to these medications which carried the unaffordable price tag of £100000 per patient per year still didn’t seem very hopeful and the disheartening battle to get Vertex to lower its price saw many lose hope.

But just eight months later the NHS signed a commercial agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals to make Kaftrio an even more powerful drug available to those aged 12 and over with cystic fibrosis. This was extended to those aged six years and above in early 2022.

Unlike my other medications which treat the symptoms of CF Kaftrio treats the underlying causes for 90% of people with CF.

It directly targets the cause of CF by restoring the function of the CFTR protein towards normal for those with the most common CF gene abnormality (DF508).

Nicola Torch a full-time PhD student living in Scotland ‘started crying’ when she saw the announcement that Kaftrio was finally available on the NHS.

Nicola started taking Kaftrio in October 2020 and felt physical changes almost immediately (Picture: Supplied)

‘I looked at my mum and I just started sobbing’ the 26-year-old tells Metro.co.uk.

‘Throughout my life I had never dared to think about the future. I’d never thought about a long-term career getting married having kids or any of those exciting life goals younger people envision.

‘Kaftrio allowed me to start picturing those things and I was excited about my future for the very first time.’

Nicola started taking Kaftrio in October 2020 and felt physical changes almost immediately.

‘It was a momentous occasion.’ she says.

The day after taking Kaftrio Nicola woke up feeling ‘like a new person’.

‘Breathing was just so easy. It didn’t feel like something heavy was sitting on my chest for once.

‘My breathlessness also seemed to disappear. I did my lung function after a few days and was shocked to see numbers I hadn’t reached since my teens.

‘That weekend I went out walking. I reached a hill that before Kaftrio I would always struggle to climb. But this time I shot up and didn’t feel an ounce of breathlessness at the top.

‘It was overwhelming and I immediately got teary-eyed. It felt like confirmation that the medication was working as I hoped it would.’

For Nicola the impact that Kaftrio had on her mental health was not something she was initially aware of. It wasn’t until the start of 2022 that she noticed she was no longer feeling herself and was experiencing crippling anxiety.

During a long weekend away at the start of this year Nicola realised she had left her Kaftrio tablets home.

‘I was without it for four days and the difference I felt was too hard to ignore’ she says.

‘This medication was improving my physical health so much and it felt wrong to question whether it was also impacting me negatively.’

In early May Nicola made the difficult decision to come off Kaftrio and almost immediately noticed changes to her mental health.

‘I felt lighter clearer and more level-headed’ she says.

‘Coming off Kaftrio was definitely the best decision for my mental health.

‘I was so miserable that I didn’t care that my lungs were feeling better. This created a lot of guilt and inner conflict.’

‘A month off Kaftrio and I’m back to my old self. Admittedly my physical health has suffered as a result – my cough and breathlessness are back and my lung function has dropped to pre-Kaftrio levels.

‘But I’m trying not to see it as a backwards step just a sideways one.’

Nicola has noticed the backlash experienced by those who have spoken out about the mental health impacts of Kaftrio.

‘The CF community became very divided and people seemed to get very territorial about the drug’ she explains.

‘Kaftrio is still an incredible treatment that the CF community is lucky to have and I am in no way trying to downplay the life-changing potential it has.

‘However being transparent about the full spectrum of experiences is also important.’

Elaina Mowle a special projects administrator at a care company also experienced immense physical benefits – and severe mental health impacts – after starting Kaftrio.

‘I noticed the impact of the drug on my lungs so quickly’ she says. ‘Within a few hours I could feel lots of mucus coming up. It was wild.

‘In terms of wheeze tightness and lung pain Kaftrio definitely helps.’

But things soon took a turn for the worse for the 22-year-old from Eastbourne.

Elaina began feeling exhausted and disconnected. The increased weight gain a common side effect of the medication started to impact her mental health and despite the positive changes to her lungs ‘the weight gain poor body image and lack of any sleep made me feel awful’.

‘I was so miserable that I didn’t care that my lungs were feeling better’ Elaina says. ‘This created a lot of guilt & inner conflict.’

In November 2020 Elaina stopped taking Kaftrio altogether but in April 2022 she decided to have another go.

This she says was when things began to get worse.

‘I started to have low moods depressive episodes and even suicidal thoughts’ Elaine tells Metro.co.uk.

‘It was terrifying. So on the off chance it was the Kaftrio causing these feelings I stopped it.

‘And less than 24 hours later already started to feel miles better. It put into perspective how much of an impact the Kaftrio had had on me psychologically.’

Now Elaina takes Kaftrio twice a week in an attempt to balance the positive impact on her lungs with what she sees as detrimental mental side effects.

‘I am so happy that Kaftrio is working wonders for so many people’ she explains. ‘I just want people to be aware that side effects are a massive factor to consider when taking any drug.’

‘One person’s wonder drug may be another’s nightmare.’

It was terrifying

Dr Keith Brownlee Director of Medical Affairs at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust tells Metro.co.uk that Kaftrio is not a cure and it doesn’t work for everyone.

‘Mental health issues were not reported in the clinical trials that led to the market authorisation of Kaftrio’ he explains.

‘However there have been reports of individuals associating new or worsening mental health issues with starting Kaftrio.

‘In addition the life-changing effects of Kaftrio can themselves have mental health consequences.

‘These are complex issues which need to be investigated thoroughly. We strongly advise all people with CF who feel they may have mental health symptoms as a side effect of Kaftrio to report their concern using the yellow card system of the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) and speak to their CF team.’

The roll-out of Kaftrio took some time and Lucy Taylor didn’t start taking Kaftrio until March 2021.

The 29-year-old play centre assistant from South Wales was nervous to start taking the drug feeling apprehensive that it wouldn’t have the life-changing effects she had seen others experience.

Lucy’s lung function had shot up 7% in a matter of days (Picture: Supplied)

‘But thankfully it started doing its magic pretty much instantly’ she says.

‘I started feeling the effects and changes of Kaftrio no more than 15 minutes after I swallowed the first dose.

‘My lung function had shot up 7% in a matter of days. It was such an incredible feeling.

‘After a couple of months my lungs felt so good. I could take a deep breath in without coughing. I didn’t feel so tired all of the time. Exercising felt much easier and I could keep up with my family and friends.’

Seven months later in November 2021 Lucy started to notice changes in her mental health.

‘I was really low and started to shut myself off from the rest of the world’ she tells us.

‘I realised that Kaftrio was making my mental health worse after chatting to others with CF who were also taking the drug and experiencing the same impacts.’

Lucy kept up the pretence to family and friends but eventually broke down to her mum on Christmas Eve. She thought telling her loved ones about her experience would help but soon after things reached a point where Lucy no longer wanted to get up in the morning.

‘I started to shut myself off from the rest of the world

Rather than coming off Kaftrio Lucy has been speaking to a psychologist.

‘I wanted to continue to stay on Kaftrio’ she says.

‘I couldn’t let this bad spell on my mental health beat me. Kaftrio has had a hugely beneficial impact on my physical health.

‘I am still incredibly grateful that I am on Kaftrio. I know that it has negatively impacted my mental health and that was such a scary time. But every drug has side effects.

‘For me Kaftrio truly is a wonder drug and the positives certainly outweigh the benefits.’

Drug manufacturer Vertex told Metro.co.uk: ‘We review all reported adverse events from the use of our medicines. They are evaluated and submitted to the regulatory authorities in accordance with all applicable regulations.

‘A relationship between the use of our medicines and mental health-related adverse events has not been established in either clinical trial data or post-licensing reports.

‘The safety and efficacy profile of Kaftrio® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor has been demonstrated in more than 40000 patient-years of data globally.’

The drug watchdog told Metro.co.uk that ‘there is no confirmed evidence of an association with Kaftrio and mental health-related or psychiatric side effects.’

‘Patient safety is our first priority. Kaftrio is an effective medicine for people suffering from cystic fibrosis’ Dr Alison Cave MHRA Chief Safety Officer told Metro.co.uk.

‘As with all approved medicines we continually monitor the safety of Kaftrio. There is no confirmed evidence of an association with Kaftrio and mental health-related or psychiatric side effects. The balance of benefits and risks of Kaftrio remains favourable for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

‘It is important you continue to take your medication. If you have any questions speak to your Cystic Fibrosis Team or healthcare professional. Please report any suspected side effects to our Yellow Card scheme.’

The parade became an annual Father’s Day event in 1981 and is now a 'wet' parade.

According to Fire Chief Scott Fournier about 20 years ago a neighbor decided to have some fun with the firefighters spraying them with water and when they sprayed right back a new tradition was started.

""I've been doing this since I was 13. That's how long we've had this tradition"" he said of the event. ""People throw water balloons at us and you know we squirt them back and it's a family tradition.""

After not having an event in 2020 and making adjustments in 2021 he said he's glad to have it back in full swing just in time for the department's 75th birthday.



Now a father of three himself Fournier said he loves to celebrate the holiday.

FATHER'S DAY:

For many families it has become a fun way to spend time together on Father's Day.

And if you’re not paying attention you’d think you’ve gone back in time with the livery they’ve chosen.



LNER’s new livery for the Class 91 Locomotives – Image LNER

The design features LNER’s trademark colours of red oxblood grey and white along with its logo bringing a new look to the trains while also giving a nod to its proud past with the livery having more than a passing resemblance to Intercity “Swallow” livery that graced the fleet when they first entered service.

Locomotive 91227 is the first out of the fleet of 12 to get the treatment.

Work on the first locomotive and coaches to carry the new livery has been completed at Wabtec’s Doncaster works as part of a scheduled essential maintenance programme.

The fleet is comprised of Class 91 electric locomotives and Mark 4 coaching stock. LNER has 12 locos and eight sets of coaches on lease which operate services between London King’s Cross Leeds and York all of which will be branded in the new livery in the coming months.

They are leased from Eversholt Rail and will receive a full repaint and rebrand during the coming months as the rolling stock is brought in for maintenance.

In Quotes

John Doughty Director of Engineering at LNER said:

“The new livery is not only essential for the upkeep of the fleet but also brings it into the LNER family. It is the first time in many years that the fleet has been fully repainted. The livery was inspired in part by the popularity of the original InterCity 225 design and we’ve kept the sharp lines and red and white stripes famously associated with the trains which have a place in the hearts of many people.”

Back to the future

The InterCity 225 (Class 91 with Mark 4 rolling stock) first entered service in March 1989 and has spent most of its life working on the East Coast route carrying passengers between London and Scotland at 125 miles per hour. These have mostly been displaced since the arrival of LNER’s Azuma fleet with 12 locomotives with carriage sets remaining operating on the East Coast Main Line.

Some of the Class 91 fleet has been scrapped some stored whilst some of the coaching stock have found new homes elsewhere on the UK Rail network (notably in Wales).

For LNER’s Class 91 it will feel a little like they’ve been back to the future – but with the in-carriage upgrades they’ve had over the years it should provide a good experience between Leeds and London.

Pharmacists receive extensive training and assessments to ensure they can properly educate individuals about COVID-19 vaccines and administer them and are frequently updated on the latest CDC guidelines which Walgreens continues to follow closely throughout the pandemic.

It seems like the new ad format is intended to streamline the shopping experience so you don’t have to switch to your phone or computer if you see an ad for something you might actually want to buy.

Here’s how it works according to a press release:

Viewers simply press “OK” with the remote on a shoppable ad and proceed to checkout with their payment details easily pre-populated from Roku Pay Roku’s payments platform. From there tapping “OK” on the Walmart checkout page places the order. A Walmart purchase confirmation is then emailed with shipping return and support information.

While I personally have little interest in doing e-commerce on my television Roku has been vocal for years about its advertising ambitions so this new type of ad seems to fit right in with the company’s goals.

Grocery prices are rising as inflation continues to push up costs across the board.

Despite the more than 10% increase in the price of groceries since May 2021 savvy shoppers can still find ways to get a full cart for an affordable price.

Couponing is a tried-and-true money-saving tactic and one TikTok user showed off just how effective it can be at Walmart.

By using coupons and cashback apps @breethecouponqueen said she got $117 worth of groceries and household essentials from Walmart for just $4.16.

She stocked her cart with 26 items and ended up getting most of them for less than a dollar or free.

In some cases Bree even earned cash on certain items to bring her subtotal down further.

Maximizing your savings at Walmart

In addition to her TikTok clip Bree posted an article on her website breaking down how she was able to score such steep discounts.

For starters she did clip coupons from Walmart’s weekly ad to save on toothpaste lotion barbecue sauce and razors.

She also used the Coupons.com app and coupons from product manufacturers to shave a few additional dollars off her haul.

However most of her savings and rewards came after the purchase from uploading her receipt to a handful of cashback platforms.

Ibotta Shopkick Swagbucks and Fetch Rewards accounted for nearly $80 of Bree’s total $112 discount.

To claim that cashback all Bree needed to do was snap a photo of her receipt and add it to each of the apps on her phone.

She also picked up some savings from the BYBE app and got a bottle of Barefoot wine for free using a rebate website.

Where to find digital coupons

Walmart has coupons on its website that you can print and show at your local store.

In addition as Bree suggests Coupons.com is a great source for finding hundreds of dollars worth of savings at tons of popular stores.

The site has digital and printable coupons offering discounts on everything from food to cleaning supplies to personal care items.

You can also download the Coupons.com app for additional convenience.

Primarily a grocery couponing resource Lozo compiles coupons from 19 major stores including Kroger Target and Stop & Shop.

The site has a great feature that lets you build a grocery list and see what coupons are available for each item you’re planning to buy.

Many manufacturers also offer coupons on their products as well like Proctor & Gamble’s P&G Good Everyday initiative.

As hard as it is to imagine Disney felt that the Magic Kingdom was too close to real-life pirate haunts like Tampa Bay (home of the Buccaneers) for guests to want to experience make-believe pirates.

Instead a river ride through the Wild West was slated for the Florida park called Western River Expedition.

How Western River Expedition Came to NOT Be

The ride was envisioned as a boat ride much like Pirates of the Caribbean. It would drift past humorous show scenes dreamed up by Marc Davis and play a catchy tune throughout. There were scenes of drunkenness and some pretty bad caricatures of Mexicans and Native Americans. The ride would have had to be vastly revamped for today’s audiences (much as Pirates of the Caribbean has gone under the knife over recent years).

Part of the expansive model for the attraction was displayed at the 2013 D23 Expo. (Photos by Noe Valladolid):

Mary Blair’s influence is seen in the shapes and colors of the backgrounds which set off Marc Davis’ gags perfectly.

The ride was supposed to be multi-story with a runaway train ride designed by Tony Baxter on the top level. Baxter was working on the model under his mentor Claude Coats. But it just so happens that Coats was Marc Davis’ rival at Imagineering. When the top brass came in to look at the model Baxter told them he didn’t like it and pointed out how much it would cost compared to his train ride. Baxter had been frustrated because Marc didn’t seem to want to pay attention to his railroad.

Soooo… as budgets and thrills over story would have it…Western River was out and Big Thunder was in. They decided to build a quick and cheap(er) version of Pirates of the Caribbean instead as guests were lining up at City Hall demanding to know where the Pirate ride was.

Marc Davis never forgave Tony Baxter to his dying day. Western River was going to be Davis’ Magnum Opus before he retired. Instead he worked on Tokyo Disneyland where he was revered and quietly retired before the park opened.

There was some talk of adding Western River to Paris but when Michael Eisner then CEO of Disney saw the $150 million plus price tag he balked and the space for the ride remains empty to this day.

What Was Western River Expedition?

The ride itself was similar to Pirates. Boats would sail by vignettes of life in the Old West there was a lot of drunkenness shown and there was a big waterfall but at the end of the ride instead of at the beginning. Hoot Gibson an owl provided the safety spiel and some ride narration. For a time Hoot hosted a preview of the proposed ride at “The Walt Disney Story” attraction in Florida. Later previews of EPCOT Center took over the Western River spot. When walls were taken down during a refurbishment a few years back in the presentation area the model was found just as it was before it was boarded up lights on and everything!

Let’s imagine ourselves in an alternate universe where Western River Expedition had been built as originally planned. Guests would approach the Thunder Mesa ride building and find themselves in perpetual twilight where they would board their boats to take a trip inside outside and around the mountain.

Scenes included a drunken cowboy on a horse on the roof of the Saloon with the Saloonkeeper trying to shoot him down.

The images below really feel like the Marc Davis you know from Pirates and Haunted Mansion. There’s almost always some sort of humor or gag in Marc’s work.

The ride would culminate in a scene of Native Americans conjuring up a storm with a rain dance.

Today you can tell that they only spent $30 million dollars on Pirates of the Caribbean at the Magic Kingdom. A few scenes from Western River Expedition made it into EPCOT Center’s World of Motion attraction but those were removed for Test Track. The fabled Western River Expedition will exist only in the art and models that remain and the stories told about it.

Premiere Review: Walt Disney Animation's First Ever TV Show Is Cute Unimpressive [Annecy 2022],"Baymax! Premiere Review: Walt Disney Animation's First Ever TV Show Is Cute Unimpressive [Annecy 2022]

Walt Disney Animation Studios has revolutionized the industry and reinvented itself over and over again since the studio was founded almost 100 years ago. But while it has covered a wide arrange of stories and genres Disney Animation has never really entered the world of television instead leaving the task of producing spin-offs of its most popular movies to other studios. That changes this year with Disney+ providing an avenue for Walt Disney Animation Studios to make feature-quality TV shows.

Which makes it kind of baffling that the studio is debuting on the TV medium with a show based on ... ""Big Hero 6."" The sci-fi film very very loosely based on a Marvel comic book series of the same name follows a young kid called Hiro Hamada who happens to be a robotics genius. He finds his late brother's nursing robot Baymax and equips him with armor and weapons to help fight crime and solve the brother's murder.

""Big Hero 6"" was successful and it even won an Academy Award (despite going up against ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" ""Song of the Sea"" and ""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya""). Though we never got an official sequel the film did get a Disney XD spin-off series with most of the voice cast returning. What makes ""Baymax!"" different is that it is produced by most of the same crew who worked on the feature film. It follows the titular robot Baymax as he tries to fulfill his original programming: nursing. Each of the six episode shorts will follow Baymax trying to care for someone in need. During the Annecy International Animation Film Festival /Film got to see an episode of ""Baymax!"" ahead of its Disney+ debut alongside the first episode of ""Zootopia+."""

Calls It Quits With Ezra Miller's The Flash,"For the better part of a decade Warner Bros. has tried its hardest to bring The Flash to the big screen finally giving DC's Scarlet Speedster his first ever solo movie. Unfortunately after countless delays and personnel changes the movie now appears to be in more trouble than ever before thanks to lead star Ezra Miller's off-screen issues.

Miller has been at the center of one unfortunate controversy after another over the past few months which has all happened since filming for The Flash wrapped in October 2021. Most recently the film's leading star mysteriously deleted their Instagram page after sharing a barrage of memes in reaction to accusations of grooming and the situation grows more troublesome seemingly by the day.

For the time being The Flash's release has been delayed until June 23 2023 still leaving another full year until the highly-anticipated solo movie finally premieres for the DCEU faithful. Unfortunately once that blockbuster does make its way into the public eye it may be the end for the actor playing the leading role of Barry Allen.

Ezra Miller’s Days as The Flash Numbered

DC

According to Deadline Warner Bros has decided to call it quits with Ezra Miller's Flash in the DCEU following the release of The Flash next year.

An insider told the outlet that new Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav simply hopes the scandal surrounding Miller stays under the radar until The Flash premieres in theaters in June 2023. In his attempts to make the company's DC division as successful as competitors like Marvel Studios Miller may not be a part of future plans under any circumstances. According to the insider source:

“There is no winning in this for Warner Bros. This is an inherited problem for Zaslav. The hope is that the scandal will remain at a low level before the movie is released and hope for the best to turn out.”

It's unclear whether this means the company will replace Miller put any Flash-related projects on hold or restart the entire DCEU altogether.

So What's Next for Ezra Miller?

To put it in the simplest of terms the controversy surrounding Ezra Miller could reach a breaking point in the not-too-distant future.

The Flash's leading actor has been arrested twice within the last three months which comes on top of the accusations of him grooming a 12-year-old actress a few years ago. This led to rumors that Warner Bros. was looking at their options concerning Miller as Barry Allen although the company firmly denied that there was any substance to those reports that same week.

Fans will pay close attention to Warner Bros.' public statements over the next few weeks should the company decide to comment on the situation in any way whatsoever. Regardless of whether that happens there's no denying that both the studio and Miller are in some serious trouble particularly with such a significant movie on the table.

Seeing as The Flash is still such a long time from its theatrical debut the studio will need to have some serious talks about how to proceed with this particular movie and the Flash character as a whole.

Even though The Flash is Miller's first solo movie after supporting roles in three other films (not counting Zack Snyder's Justice League) the actor's off-camera actions may leave the company no choice about exploring other avenues. Although Miller has some support from coworkers in the industry there are some potentially dark days ahead with regard to the actor's future and that of Warner Bros.' DC division.

Currently The Flash is scheduled to release in theaters on June 23 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NieXRlc2FwcC5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3dhcm5lci1icm9zLWluLXRyb3VibGUtb3Zlci1lenJhLW1pbGxlci1zLWZsYXNoL3N0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros. under pressure over 'The Flash' star Ezra Miller?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.newsbytesapp.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Chittenden Solid Waste District plans to construct a $22 million recycling facility in Williston which it says will bring its trash management operations into the 21st century.

The district is also working to install a new water line to improve composting and add an administrative building for staff.

The district’s current recycling facility — the first in Vermont — was built 29 years ago. It is severely outdated and has exceeded its capacity according to Michele Morris the district’s director of communications.

“The new facility that we’re planning will be more efficient and effective and just allow Vermonters to recycle more types of packaging” she said.

The Williston site is where 53% of Vermont’s “blue bin recyclables” go to be sorted separated and baled before they can be sent off to be turned into new materials according to a memo presented to the Chittenden district’s board of commissioners in March.

The materials recovery facility or MRF as it is called by waste district was designed to manage 25000 tons a year but it processed 49000 tons in fiscal year 2021 the memo states.

The district’s expansion plan calls for a larger building and new technology that would automate the sorting of items currently separated by hand. These changes would allow the district to sort and recycle 70000 tons 40% more than its current capacity.

If all goes according to plan the project could break ground in 2023 and open in 2024.

On March 23 district commissioners approved a $22 million bond to pay for the expansion which will be presented to Chittenden County voters on the November ballot. District leaders made assurances however that taxpayers would not have to shoulder the costs.

“This project is not going to affect their taxes” Morris said.

Chittenden district officials are also looking for ways to reduce the bond amount and are considering grants federal funds and zero-interest municipal loans. Whatever the final total turns out to be they expect revenues will foot the bill.

In fiscal year 2021 the operating revenue for the facility was $7.2 million and $3.3 million was generated from the sale of materials. District officials expect the bond debt will be repaid with revenues from the sale of materials and the tipping fees for disposal which they can adjust as needed.

The tipping fee — what haulers pay the district when they “tip out” material at the sorting facility — is currently $80 per ton. It increased from $65 to $80 per ton in March 2020.

“Leaping forward 30 years is expensive and a little scary but we’ve done the due diligence and are confident that the time is right to invest in the future of recycling in Chittenden County” Sarah Reeves the district’s executive director wrote in the memo to the board.

The Chittenden district has contracted with Casella Waste Systems to operate and manage the Williston facility since 1999. Casella a private company gets a portion of the tipping fees. Its recycling contract set to expire June 30 has been extended through September. But the arrangement could change once the new facility is operational. Documents show the district is considering the possibility of taking over management of the new facility itself or contracting with another vendor.

The Chittenden Solid Waste District a municipal district created in 1987 to oversee and manage solid waste in Chittenden County is the only publicly owned option in Vermont for processing recycling.

The district owns 60 acres on Redmond Road in Williston and a new facility would be built on the undeveloped land on the same road between IBM Road and the VELCO access road intersections a couple of miles away from the existing building. It is expected to have a footprint of about 62000 to 64000 square feet nearly double the size of the existing one. And it will have ample storage and space to allow future growth.

The new sorting and packaging facility will include optical scanners ballistic separators and robotics according to the memo. That will allow it to expand what Vermonters can recycle — including plastic snap-off beer pack covers and black plastic containers such as takeout boxes plant pots and shampoo bottles which it currently cannot process Morris said.

Andrew Brown an Essex Junction trustee who viewed a Chittenden district presentation last week said he thinks the expansion is important. “We all know that in order to help prevent recyclable materials from entering our landfill we need to be able to recycle more” he said.

Observing that the recycling market has “changed drastically” Brown said “we need a new facility that can meet the current demand as well as our future recycling needs.”

Bryn Oakleaf a Winooski city councilor who is also a Chittenden Solid Waste District commissioner said the upgrade is critical for Vermont to stay competitive in the recycling market and for the district to meet its long-term waste management goals.

Williston has been a district member and the host town for the recycling facility for many years and the solid waste district has been a good neighbor Williston Town Manager Erik Wells said in an email. The “much needed facility” will help “to continue to reduce and manage waste in an environmentally conscious effective and innovative way”

The town’s Development Review Board has not yet received an application for a zoning permit but the facility is an allowed use in the industrial zone and town officials have been briefed on the project Wells said.

The district has separately received approval from Williston officials to build a 2500-foot waterline extension from IBM Road to its composting facility. That project is expected to break ground in a month or two.

The district currently trucks in the water needed to compost food scraps and yard debris a far more expensive option than having a water line according to Morris. The line will bring water to three of the Chittenden district’s facilities — the recycling facility the compost facility and a new administrative building in the works.

The administrative building would be in a vacant lot south of the compost center. The district has about 50 full-time workers 20 of whom are office staff and work out of an old house on the Redmond Road property.

“That’s not all that super exciting I think for the public but it’s very exciting for our staff (who have) been working out of an old repurposed split-level home for years” Morris said.

The proposed 10000-square-foot building and parking lot would provide a modern well-ventilated workspace. That project is currently in the design phase.

Both projects are in the Chittenden district’s capital budget and have been approved by the board and member towns.

Now an inferno has been raging for three weeks in the guts of Synagro Technologies Inc.’s 80-acre pit of waste — human feces grass clippings brewery muck and potentially far more trucked in from across Southern California — and shows little sign of slowing as mass complaints of new health problems animal deaths and noxious air persist for dozens of miles in the rural High Desert.

A nearly universal silence for the scale of the situation has continued among taxpayer-funded agencies tasked with regulating composters like Synagro on behalf of the people and environment.

The existence of the massive fire was first reported on May 31 by the Daily Press at least three days after it began with no public acknowledgment of the blaze having been made by any government agency or private entity to that point.

But according to a Daily Press analysis of CalRecycle disclosures public agencies for nearly two years have been documenting myriad problems unique to the site of Synagro a Maryland-based firm acquired in late 2020 by an investing arm of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

A propensity for letting its sludge piles smolder smoke and catch fire is one. The problems go far beyond that.

Unresolved findings by inspectors raise further questions as to what may be in the air for High Desert residents and in the compost Synagro sends to farms that feed America: “Unacceptable” forms of waste being trucked in processed and misreported; excessive levels of pathogens and contamination in ready-to-go loads including more than five times the legal limit of film-plastic contamination; multiple “continued violations” of California code dating back to 2020.

Rather than take enforcement action as the facility has repeated violations and missed deadlines though regulators have given Synagro a continuous stream of informal finger wags and deadline extensions leading up to the eruption of its waste-pit fire last month.

A nasty outlier

There are 12 actively-operating sites in California whose permits classify them as a “Composting Facility (Other)” according to CalRecycle data.

Synagro’s composting site in the High Desert is permitted to hold the second-largest capacity of solid waste in this group: up to 1 million cubic yards of waste at any one time.

It’s also the only one of these 12 facilities that’s been cited for a code violation in 2022 — and not just one blemish.

Inspectors have logged a total of 12 violations in five visits to Synagro’s Hinkley site this year with the latest publicly-disclosed report covering a routine monthly inspection on April 20.

Throughout 2021 all except for two of the 12 composting facilities in this group maintained a violation-free record.

One is El Corazon Compost Facility in Oceanside which got its only violation last year after a test sample came back to San Diego County inspectors showing excessive fecal-coliform levels in a sample of its compost.

Synagro’s High Desert facility is the other exception. It racked up 24 violations last year.

Every inspection at the Hinkley composting facility since mid-2013 has been handled solely by the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health’s environmental services division.

The county division hasn’t responded to requests for comment in recent weeks on the waste-pit fire and Synagro’s activities at the Hinkley facility. The California Environmental Protection Agency also hasn’t respond to requests from comment.

A spokesperson for CalRecycle a division of CalEPA asked the Daily Press if it has contacted the county-level agency when reached for comment. He didn’t respond when told in an email that it had and asked about the level of involvement the state has had in responding to the Synagro fire and facility activities.

The Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District issued a nuisance violation against the Synagro site for its fire earlier this month spokesman Martial Haprov previously told the Daily Press. The local air regulator says its ability to crack down on the facility is limited though because its jurisdiction is strictly air-related activities.

There’s a key ingredient that sets Synagro’s site in the sparse but storied town of Hinkley apart from most composters in California: Biosolids.

An industry term for what can also be called sewage sludge biosolids are a mix of organic material that wastewater treatment plants separate from liquids and non-organic solids like pharmaceuticals in raw sewage streams. Plants are supposed to treat the raw material to certain standards and smush it into brown mud-like mounds before composters like Synagro can process and report it as a biosolid rather than as a rawer form of sewage solids known as “mixed waste.”

Aside from Synagro only four compost facilities in California have a permit to process biosolids though these sites also take in a few other kinds of waste that Synagro isn’t permitted to use:

Liberty Composting Inc. in Lost Hills (capacity: 1.31 million cubic yards)

Tulare Lake Compost in Kettleman City (capacity: 912000 cubic yards)

South Kern Industrial Center Compost in Taft (capacity: 670000 cubic yards)

Griffith Park Composting Facility in Los Angeles operated by the City of LA (capacity: 200 cubic yards)

Aside from biosolids Synagro’s permit allows it to compost only one other kind of waste green materials which essentially covers things that grow in nature like yard clippings.

The existence of sites like Synagro’s in the High Desert is driven by a diverse — and to a degree experimental — nature of the modern composting industry.

One of the 12 “(Other)” composters the UC Davis Cooperation Extension Siskiyou in Tulelake is proof of this. It launched in 2020 with a permit for only one form of waste: “Dead Animals.”

“They’ve had a total of 5 animal carcasses go through the pile without any issues with wildlife in the area” its last inspection report reads. “In the 2nd year they are compiling notes on how long of a process it is to have the bones break down fully.”

The specific kinds of waste covered by a permit are central to the way composters design their facilities to meet standards. A site that only takes biosolids can spend less money than if it takes mixed waste for example because the latter requires more machinery and steps in the composting process before it can be shipped out to farmers.

‘Some smoldering can be seen’

The High Desert composting facility now run by Synagro kept a relatively clean on-paper record for its first eight years of operation.

Then came November 2020.

The so-called Nursery Products Hawes Composting Facility in Hinkley faced 101 official inspections from June 2012 to October 2020. It got only one violation in that more than eight-year period according to a Daily Press analysis of CalRecycle data.

But in every routine monthly inspection from that month to the current day — and in the facility’s first “focused” inspection in nearly nine years just a few months ago — regulators have cited at least one violation against the Synagro site.

The result: a total of 39 violations found in the last 18 visits at the Hinkley facility with the latest publicly disclosed inspection report covering an April 20 visit.

The violations have piled up at an accelerated rate with concerning implications for the ongoing waste-pit blaze that’s fueling reports of health problems and rancid air as far as 33 miles east of the Synagro site in Yermo and nearly 60 miles north of it at Fort Irwin.

On at least nine routine monthly visits since October 2020 inspectors have either witnessed smoke emanating from smoldering solid-waste piles at Synagro’s Nursery Products site or learned of smolder fires having recently occurred from internal facility records.

San Bernardino County inspector Brad Larson wrote that “smoke was observed rising from a pre-mix pile” on Oct. 28 2020 when he was joined on an inspection by Riverside County senior environmental health specialist Fritzy Devera. Synagro’s site manager Venny Vasquez told the inspectors “the smoldering is addressed with sand-like material being placed and observed on the affected area.”

A few months later on Jan. 19 2021 county inspector Rodney Tolosa noted that “some smoldering can be seen” from a private western access road to the Hinkley facility “with white smoke emanating at a section of the site.”

“Premix materials were smoldering…at the southwest section of the site” Tolosa wrote and an employee was “mixing biosolids with high moisture content into the smolder to help reduce the temperature.”

Tolosa marked two “areas of concern” just short of violations that day: Insufficient testing for contamination of finished compost and insufficient documentation of “special occurrences” such as “when smoldering occurs and how it was resolved.”

A probe of one zone of Synagro’s pit found its waste piles heating at temperatures between 142 and 175 degrees Fahrenheit.

A Cornell University publication by agriculture doctorate Tom Richard says compost temperatures of 160 degrees can “start the chemical process of spontaneous combustion which might lead to the outbreak of a fire.”

Tolosa separately noted in January 2021 that the Synagro site had cut back on windrow composting which means organizing waste in long rows and rotating them periodically to keep a properly high temperature without overheating the piles.

“Windrows used to be present throughout the site but currently this site accumulates large quantities of material into static piles” Tolosa wrote. “The operator stated that quantities have been prioritized due to the amount of material being received.”

Tolosa led the county’s next routine inspection in February 2021 and again noted that waste piles were burning.

“Burnt material can be smelled in the south and southwestern portion of the site” he wrote.

The inspector restated his area of concern about insufficient documentation and added a new area of concern.

“The smolder fires are not being recorded in any special occurrence log ... Currently there are little to no activities in the prevention of smolder fires indicated by the lack of temperature monitoring of static piles (premix) that are not undergoing controlled PFRP” Tolosa wrote using an acronym for Processes to Further Reduce Pathogens.

“This accumulation of large amounts of compost feedstock may be affecting (Nursery Products’) ability to conduct fire prevention measures” he continued.

Inspection reports in following months identified facility records of smolder fires when inspectors weren’t around.

On his monthly visit last November Larson pointed out “smoke from a small smolder” of pre-mixed waste to the site manager Vasquez who “made a note of the smolder.”

A month later driving on Helendale Road to conduct its next inspection on Dec. 17 Larson again saw “steam or white smoke” emanating at the Synagro facility from about two miles away.

When he arrived and asked about it according to Larson’s report Vasquez told him that he must have been seeing steam caused by “the calm cold weather conditions” rather than a smolder fire because “there was no smoke odor and no hint of blue color.”

Larson then identified a smoke odor and its source: “a compost pile near the scales” where “a front loader and a water truck ... were actively addressing the smolder.”

From there Larson “discussed the monitoring and recording of ‘pre-mix’ pile temperatures so as to prevent smolders” with Vasquez. The Dec. 17 inspection report separately cites the facility’s special occurrences log which hadn’t yet been filled out for the prior day as showing “incidents of equipment breakdown weather conditions and smolder fires” in the month since Larson’s last visit.

Early this year “the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District visited NP due to flare up on Jan 5 resulting in smoke visible from great distance” per Larson’s January inspection report. “Safety training recently completed covered the subject of fire hose safety.”

At the most recent publicly-disclosed inspection on April 20 inspector Rebecca Koo reported being joined by a larger group than usual: Three other county health department employees — Tolosa George Gonzales and Andrew Matei — and two site representatives — Vasquez and Lonnie Terrell who joined Synagro as regional safety manager of its West and Southwest facilities in February this year.

Upon arrival at the facility “a water truck was observed actively operating along the main access road near the scales and front office building” Koo wrote though she didn’t elaborate further.

The report separately cites facility records of “notable events including equipment breakdowns high wind events and smoldering of piles” that occurred since inspectors had last visited.

“The facility is maintaining a record of measures taken to address special occurrences such as equipment repair progress and noting when the water truck is used to suppress dust or hot spot smolders” Koo noted.

The April 20 inspection report made no further mention of smoldering.

Fuel to the fire

None of the smolders and fires observed by inspectors at the Hinkley facility have been marked as the cause of any actual violations on Synagro’s official record.

Other problems appear to have struck them as more urgent.

The Hinkley facility just a few months ago had its first “focused” inspection since 2013. All other visits have been standard monthly inspections.

The focus of this March 23 inspection was “to collect samples from piles of completed compost” and “observe a waste characterization” for specific pathogens and physical contaminants that operators are required to check for in their compost under the California Code of Regulations.

“This is the first characterization of this degree done for this site so there was a small learning curve and the process could be different next time if an easier way is discovered” the inspection report states.

The sample of Synagro’s compost failed on multiple fronts resulting in two violations for illegally high levels of both a pathogen — salmonella — and physical contaminants — both plastics in general and film plastic in specific.

The latter point is jarring: A seemingly first-of-its-kind test at the Hinkley facility found more than five times the maximum legal amount of film plastic in Synagro’s compost.

California law limits the amount of physical contaminants allowed in compost to no more than 0.5% of the compost’s dry weight. “Physical contaminants” in this case means all forms of plastics glass metal and sharps that are greater than 4 millimeters in length.

Within that a separate limit states that no more than 0.1% of the compost’s dry weight can be specifically made up of film plastic which is the thin sheet-like form of plastic that’s near omnipresent in today’s world via plastic bags labels inside shirts and pants shrink wraps that keep food fresh at home and much more.

The March 23 test showed 0.56% of the dry weight of Synagro’s compost being made up of plastics and 0.55% of it being specifically made up of film plastic.

That was the newest addition to a list of problems inspectors have been citing at the Hinkley cite. A few others have persisted far longer as “continued violation” mark-ups against Synagro.

On Feb. 19 2021 county inspector Tolosa noted the facility was accepting composting and shipping out “unacceptable feedstock” and recording it as green waste which the inspector “verified through the permitted transfer station that supplies NP the material.”

The specific feedstock in this case was mixed material which Tolosa noted as meaning sewage solids that include “non-organics processed industrial materials mixed demolition or mixed construction debris or plastics.”

“The facility made a significant change (accepting and composting mixed material) to the operation that is not authorized by the existing Solid Waste Facility Permit” the inspector wrote in the report.

Tolosa noted the material “had an odorous scent of municipal solid waste” “appears different than the other green material received” “had small physical contaminants” and “was finer material almost fluffy and dirt-like.”

He then said this violation had been occuring far longer than the day of the inspection. “The station began to send this material to NP on December 2019” Tolosa wrote.

“Immediately cease accepting mixed material” the inspector declared “and all mixed material shall be rejected beginning at the issuance of this inspection report.”

In the February 2021 inspection report and after subsequent monthly visits inspectors have repeatedly noted a few options for the facility to correct for on-site piles already contaminated by mixed waste:

Dispose of the piles at a permitted landfill

Transport the piles to a different facility that’s permitted to compost mixed waste

Apply for a permit change that would allow Synagro to legally compost mixed waste

Immediately begin testing every 5000 cubic yards of compost produced at the site and reprocess it instead of shipping it out if a sample doesn’t meet the terms of Synagro’s permit

Synagro chose the fourth option of testing according to the reports rather than shipping the contaminated piles elsewhere.

Subsequent inspector reports say the Synagro site stopped accepting new loads of this rawer form of solid waste a month after the violation was first discovered but that it has remained in “continued violation” because the contaminated material still hadn’t been removed from its waste pit more than a year later.

The facility’s latest inspection report says that on March 29 this year Synagro informed the county that “all of the mixed material has been composted and shipped off site.” It requested an end to further monitoring of the issue which the latest inspection report says was still under review as of April.

Separately on its March 2021 inspection Larson discovered Synagro has been accepting “brewery waste” — which “typically consists of spent barley or rice malt” and “is considered food material” a form of waste the Hinkley site isn’t permitted to take — from a 1.7 million square-foot Anheuser-Busch plant in Van Nuys just north of Los Angeles.

More than a year later Synagro “continues to accept brewery waste from AB-Van Nuys and labels this material as ‘other residuals’” according to its April inspection report.

Regulators have been pushing for “Nursery Products (to) demonstrate the brewery waste received meets sub-class B biosolids requirements” or the bare-minimum standard of waste Synagro is allowed to accept at the site.

“Synagro provided some information but it was deficient” the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board told the county in February according to the latest report. “Additional information is needed for Water Board staff to make a determination on whether brewery waste would be a permitted feedstock.”

The Hinkley facility has also been in “continued violation” for failing “to prevent offsite migration of litter” since November 2020.

Film plastic is the most prevalent form of litter blowing into natural habitats outside Synagro’s facility per the reports and the area in which Synagro has persistently failed to clean up litter is the desert northeast of its property. The heavy winds of the High Desert usually blow in this direction which also happens to be a direct trajectory toward the homes of Hinkley residents.

Synagro first told regulators that the litter surrounding its site “will be cleaned by the end of March 2021.”

Then it requested a two-month extension which the county and Lahontan water board granted “with a new expected date to be May 31 2021.”

Six days before that deadline on its May 2021 inspection Larson found “large pieces of new litter (paper or sheet plastic) and bottles (both plastic and glass) is evident on the main entry road.”

So the county gave Synagro an extension and a new goal of removing 95% of off-site litter. “NP requested and the (law enforcement agency) has granted an extension for litter removal to October 31 2021” its June inspection report said.

Larson did the monthly inspection on Oct. 20 2021 where he “walked the native habitat area Northeast of NP and found some remaining litter and three trash bags containing litter.”

He noted “significant improvements had been noticed in the outlying areas” so the county “offered another time extension for completion if needed.” Synagro took that offer and a new deadline was set for Jan. 31 this year.

At its January inspection Larson said the northeast and southeast areas outside Synagro’s property were still littered including plastics attached to vegetation in the northeast. He also noted “small amounts of recent litter ... along the tortoise fence on the south side of the entry road.”

So the county gave another extension with a new litter clean-up deadline of March 31.

Two days before that deadline Synagro requested another two-month extension. The county granted it. That set a new deadline for the facility of May 31 — just a few days before its ongoing waste-pit fire erupted.

‘Less than significant’

The lone pre-2020 violation on the Nursery Products facility’s record came in April 2018 due to “significant amounts of litter” blowing off site as “plastic film that still remains in the open desert area and within the desert plants on North East side of facility.”

Synagro operated the Hinkley facility when this violation occurred but it hadn’t been running things for very long up to that point. It bought the firm that previously ran things Nursery Products LLC in November 2016.

Steve Cole who was Synagro’s CEO from 2014 to 2017 noted at the time that California law gave the Nursery Products deal a unique appeal for his company’s profit potential.

“It positions Synagro as the leading solution provider in the burgeoning state-mandated diversion of organic waste from landfills” Cole said in a press release at the time.

Cole was speaking in reference to State Bill 1383: a sweeping policy introduced and implemented in 2016 that took effect this year mandating that all jurisdictions in California redirect all trash designated as “organic waste” — food wood paper green waste and the Synagro specialties of “biosolids digestate and sludges” — from the usual path of landfill dumping to recycling efforts like composting.

Synagro solidified its purchase of the Nursery Products facility in Hinkley about two months after former Gov. Jerry Brown signed the organic-waste mandate into law.

The 2016 bill gave jurisdictions a five-year grace period to prepare for the new waste-disposal complex which took effect this year.

The former Nursery Products LLC operators fought more than five years of courtroom setbacks and opposition from a coalition of High Desert residents and environmental groups before its plans for an open-air composting facility in Hinkley were greenlit.

One judge sent the former Nursery Products operators back to the drawing board in 2010 by spiking their initial argument that putting a roof on the facility would be “economically unfeasible” saying they’d deemed an open-air facility the only affordable option without enough evidence.

“The proposed project’s impact on air quality is substantial and the most detrimental aspect of the project” the ruling stated.

Nursery Products ultimately won the battle by dismissing the likelihood of unforeseen risks at the Hinkley facility — like a waste-pit fire affecting nearby residents.

“The propensity for the windrows to spontaneously ignite is minimal” its 2006 draft environmental report stated. If biosolids did catch fire it added the site “will limit the hazard to the subject property and reduce impacts to less than significant.”

Whether this will come as the result of an accident or through the slow accumulation of minor faults the choice you will face will be the same: either to throw the device away or go the extra mile and hand it over to your nearest e-waste specialist for recycling.

The amount of e-waste is set to surge to 74.7 million tons globally by 2030. (Photo by Zabed Hasnain Chowdhury/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

Most people and companies tend to choose the former. By 2030 the amount of global e-waste is projected to hit 74.7 million tonnes roughly equivalent to eight times the weight of China’s Three Gorges Dam. Most of it ends up buried in landfill or burned. Either fate contributes toward the slow degradation of the surrounding environment filling the air with carbon emissions and other harmful gasses or else seeing rare metal particulates leak into the soil and water supplies poisoning local ecosystems and communities.

The environmental benefits of keeping these materials flowing inside the economy instead of landfills are therefore clear. A study conducted by Shield’s a telco solutions provider found that there is a lower carbon impact of up to 89% for reused equipment compared to purchasing new hardware. Additionally there is a strong business case for telcos adopting circularity strategies within their daily operations with a recent report by Accenture finding that the value of recycled hardware to the telco industry will lie between $45-$80bn annually by 2030.

The consulting giant also claims that $20-$30bn can be generated through the resale of infrastructure and waste mitigation in infrastructure installation while $15 to $20bn is up for grabs through selling devices as a service and refurbished devices.

Perhaps unsurprisingly circular business models are beginning to gain traction among telcos. For some e-waste sustainability experts however the execution of these policies leaves something to be desired - leading to questions of whether certain approaches may actually be doing more harm than good.

How telcos are tackling e-waste

One telco embracing the circular economy is Vodafone. In 2020 the company launched an internal asset marketplace a business-to-business solution which allows the company’s vast network of operators across different markets to repurpose excess stock like fixed-line equipment or decommissioned hardware like masts and antennas. This initiative is part of the telecoms company’s goal to reuse resell or recycle 100% of its network waste by 2025.

According to Vodafone’s latest annual report published last month the company generated an estimated 8800 tonnes of waste so far this year and managed to recover and recycle 95% of it. Vodafone claimed that as a result of its internal asset marketplace the company reduced its CO2 emissions by 2500 tonnes and saved a total of €10.8m. Plans are currently underway to roll out similar solutions to partner markets and other operators according to the company’s chief corporate affairs officer Joakim Reiter.

“The next frontier of our planet strategy is now focused on building a more circular economy for consumers and industry and through own actions and in collaboration with partners developing innovative programmes that can tackle the growing challenge around electronic waste” says Reiter.

Other British telco giants like Virgin Media O2 also have ambitious plans to implement circular economy solutions. The company has set goals to help its consumers “carry out 10 million circular actions by the end of 2025” which might include recycling devices and donating old kit and unwanted smartphones. Earlier this year it launched the ‘Tech Lending Community Fund’ which provides grants of up to 120000 to councils and community groups in the UK to purchase refurbished devices to loan to refugees ex-convicts and domestic abuse survivors.

Meanwhile the Swedish telco operator Telia Company has made significant strides in its circularity strategy with the goal of “zero waste” in its operations by 2030. In 2021 more than 70% of network waste generated was either reused or recycled. Additionally almost 20% of Telia’s routers and TV set-up boxes sent to its customers were reused according to figures provided to Tech Monitor.

Sara Nordbrand head of sustainability at Telia told Tech Monitor that the industry needs “more concrete national and regional plans” like Nationally Determined Contributions with a clear road map to tackle e-waste. “This would speed up work incentivize further collaboration and clarify the division of work to progress further within this area” she says. “Shifting to green energy won’t be enough – the broader circular shift needs to happen.”

The ‘paradox of e-waste’

Even so some sustainability experts have lingering doubts about the effectiveness of e-waste collection methods and distribution processes. For example the bulk of how electronic waste is collected at the moment is through “low touch” processes where people take their products to their local rubbish tip explains Richard Peagam global digital director at the Anthesis Group a sustainability consultancy. In contrast there are “high touch” e-waste collection methods that involve a more formal process with professionals processing and cleaning out hardware.

But Peagam explains that even high-touch environments might sometimes be counterproductive. He cites past examples of working with technology companies to improve their take-back schemes and seeing how little consideration was often paid to whether repurposing donated hardware was worthwhile.

“Any money made on the purchase of refurbished laptops for example was offset by the costs involved in getting rid of excess material” he says. “That’s the paradox of e-waste and you have to always think of it from the perspective of reducing harm. How do we make sure that these materials don't end up on a beach in the developing world? Or are we more concerned about making money or adding value in the circular economy?”

While Peagam considers these circular strategies part of the solution to tackle climate change telcos also face inherent challenges in ensuring that the nuts and bolts of the hardware they sell remain valuable long after consumers purchase them.

“The problem in the telco industry is that they’ve got cell phones that are potentially worth a lot of money from a circularity perspective with [their] high reuse potential” says Peagam. “But they’re also pushing out set-top boxes and routers that aren’t particularly useful at the end-of-life stage. If you take apart these items there’s not a lot in there: it’s a big lump of plastic full of additives flame retardants and plasticizers.”

“It’s very difficult to do anything useful with that because it’s so specialised” he adds. “This is the problem we’re dealing with: companies ‘pushing tin’ when there might be a bit of value in the hardware. But also a lot of baggage comes with that value.”

“In reality there’s only a handful of factories out there making routers and they’re all based in China and Taiwan so you’re going to have to ship all this root material to the other side of the world to make that circularity happen” says Peagam. In the end “it’s far smarter to build robust equipment that just lasts longer”.

Check out our updated list for 25 of the most relevant statistics on the recycling industry.

Considering the EPA hasn’t released an updated report on the state of recycling and waste since 2018 it can be difficult to get an idea of how the recycling industry has changed in the past few years. Luckily we have compiled the most recent statistics on plastic paper aluminum glass electronic and food recycling for 2022.

Top Recycling Statistics of 2022

The widely circulated statistic that 9% of plastic waste is recycled in the U.S. has now been deemed an overestimate.1 Here are some stats that show how recycling has changed in recent years:

Of the 40 million tons of plastic waste generated in the U.S. in 2021 only 5% to 6% — or about two million tons — was recycled.1 Between 2019 and 2020 there was a 5.7% overall decrease in plastics recovered for recycling in the U.S. That is the equivalent of 290 million pounds.2 Approximately 36% of all plastic produced is used to create packaging 85% of which ends up in landfills.3 About 98% of single-use plastic products are made from fossil fuels.3 Globally we produce about 400 million tons of plastic waste yearly.3 Until recently the U.S. outsourced a significant portion of its plastic but import bans in countries like China and Turkey have fueled a decline in recycling.1

Plastic Recycling Facts and Statistics

Plastic recycling has long posed challenges. Unlike glass and metal plastic cannot be repeatedly recycled without quickly degrading in quality.

The total bottle recycling rate for 2020 was 27.2% down from 28.7% in 2019.2 Every hour 2.5 million plastic bottles are thrown away in the U.S.4 Between 75 and 199 million tons of plastic are currently in our oceans.3 Plastic bottles take upwards of 450 years to degrade.5

Paper Recycling Facts and Statistics

Paper is one of the most-often recycled materials accounting for half of the materials collected for recycling by weight.6

More than 50 million tons of paper were recovered for recycling in 2021 achieving a 68% recycling rate.7 In 2021 91.4% of corrugated cardboard was recycled.7 Almost half of the paper recycled in 2021 was used to make cardboard boxes.7

Aluminum Recycling Facts and Statistics

Due to high recycling rates aluminum only accounts for 1% of the waste stream in the U.S. Aluminum like glass can be endlessly recycled with far less energy needed versus creating a product out of raw materials.8

Consumption of aluminum in the U.S. was 4.3 million metric tons in 2021 up from 3.98 million metric tons in 2020.9 Global demand for aluminum is expected to grow by more than 80% by 205.10 Although aluminum can be infinitely recycled 7 million tons of aluminum are still not recycled each year.11

Glass Recycling Facts and Statistics

Glass is made of common materials like sand and limestone and it is one of the cheapest and most efficient materials to recycle.12

About 110 million glass bottles are thrown away every day in the U.S. of which only one-third get recycled.13 It is cheaper to make glass products out of recycled materials than virgin raw materials.13 Unlike plastic glass bottles and jars are fully recyclable and can be recycled endlessly without degradation of quality or purity.12

E-Waste Recycling Facts and Statistics

Electronic waste or e-waste is the fastest-growing source of waste globally. Most e-waste does not get disposed of properly and releases harmful pollutants into the environment.14

Globally e-waste volumes grew to 53.6 million metric tons in 2019 an increase of 21% since 2014.15 Only 17.4% of e-waste discarded in 2019 was recycled.15 Of the 6.92 million tons of e-waste discarded by Americans in 2019 only 15% was recycled.16

Food Waste Recycling Facts And Statistics

Chronic food misallocation and inefficiency have caused food waste to be the largest category of waste.17

Globally 40% of the food produced is wasted. The food lost on farms alone could feed every undernourished person in the world four times over.18 Food waste generates around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.18 Each year home composting could divert 330 pounds of food waste per household from landfills.19

Recycling: The Bottom Line

Accessing relevant up-to-date information about recycling can be difficult. Some materials like glass and aluminum have relatively high recycling rates and can be recycled endlessly. On the other hand many types of plastics are labeled as recyclable when they are not.

In many cases plastic recycling is more costly and energy-intensive than creating plastic from raw materials contributing to the low recycling rates. Misinformation is rampant and plastic is being recycled at an even lower rate than previously estimated. The recycling industry has a long way to go when it comes to plastic waste. However paper glass and aluminum recycling has proven that recycling programs can be successful.

Carnival Corporation SVP of global casino operations Marty Goldman also welcomed the new arrangement saying: “Our two leading global hospitality organizations will provide a wide array of immersive digital content as a complement to our exceptional shipboard casinos.”

Cruise ships embracing sports betting

Carnival Corporation is one of the biggest leisure travel companies in the world today owning nine of the most prominent cruise lines. In addition to North America it also has operations across Asia Europe and Australia. Gambling has long been a popular pursuit on cruise ships in international waters with slot machines and table games featured in the casino rooms on many of the bigger ships.

BetMGM currently has online and/or retail sportsbooks up and running in more than 20 states and online casinos and poker sites operational in certain states.

There has been a limited sports betting presence on Carnival’s ships to date. Last year Princess Cruises started offering sports betting through the Ocean Sportsbook brand. The plan now is for BetMGM to replace these existing offerings.",,,

SALT LAKE CITY — There was a brief window in South Temple Tower's history where it transformed the Salt Lake City skyline.

While other skyscrapers have since overshadowed it over the past 56 years the building is once again set to transform the city.

The global development company Hines announced Friday it has acquired the 24-story building with the intention of renovating the building and converting 217000 square feet of office space into a 255-unit ""luxury multifamily tower"" in the near future. The terms of the deal weren't disclosed but the agreement was made last week.

The project is expected to begin at the start of 2023. It's the first project of its kind in company history anywhere in the world according to Dusty Harris the senior managing director of Hines.

""The intent is to reuse much of this building as possible; for environmental and sustainable reasons we want to use as much of the building as possible"" said Dusty Harris the senior managing director of Hines adding that the project aims to help with downtown Salt Lake City's rapid growth and housing needs.

A shift in markets

The South Temple Tower located at 136 E. South Temple was completed in 1966 under the original name of the University Club Building. The 274-foot office building served as downtown's tallest skyscraper before The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Office Building was completed in the early 1970s.

It doesn't even register in the top 10 tallest buildings today especially with a slew of new buildings set to drastically alter the cityscape in the next few years to match the city's fastest-growing section.

While the South Temple Tower functioned just fine over the years the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench into companies' desire for its office space. Harris said that since the COVID-19 pandemic some of the office space market is on the decline while the residential housing market demand hasn't shown any signs of slowing down.

Harris said he wouldn't be surprised if Hines uses this office-to-residential building template in the future but it's something that will likely be handled on a case-by-case basis because office and residential buildings are designed so differently. Also new state-of-the-art office buildings are actually doing quite well but some of the older buildings aren't.

In this case South Temple Tower's smaller floor plates and fewer parking options made it difficult to attract businesses to want to work there. There are only a ""handful"" of tenants across different industries that use the building as office space today who are aware of the new plans according to Harris.

""There is not a one-size-fits-all for an office building to residential conversion"" he said. ""I think they're highly complicated. ... I do not expect every office building in Salt Lake to be converted to residential. In fact I'm quite optimistic about the future of the office but I think it will be the very best buildings that continue to thrive and do fine on the office front. Then there are buildings like the one we just bought that's struggled as an office building for a very long time.""

The floor-level retail and restaurant space is likely to stay though there may be some changes to what that looks like in the future.

Filling a need for more housing

Downtown Salt Lake City and Central City in District 4 grew by nearly 6500 people between 2010 and 2020 leading all city districts. The next wave of new structures is projected to double downtown's residential capacity and offer all sorts of new businesses in the next 24 to 30 months too.

One of these projects is the Main Street Tower overseen by Hines. The residential structure has been the focus of scrutiny because the company knocked down the century-old Utah Pantages Theater earlier this year to make way for the 31-story residential high-rise. A group that tried to save the building sued the company and the city over the plans; court records show the case was dismissed last month.

Other projects include the Astra Tower which stands to replace the Wells Fargo Center as Utah's tallest building when it's completed in the next few years. The next wave is projected to add 4000 new units.

By converting the South Temple Tower into housing the city stands to add 255 apartment units of differing floorplanning — studios and one-and-two-bedroom homes — without the need for new construction. Hines officials said they are confident that the tower offers ""a successful conversion process"" because of its downtown location natural lighting capability and its floor plan designs. The architecture firm Hickock Cole is set to help redesign the floors into housing units.

Harris said the company is also exploring the idea of renovating the exterior of the building which may include more windows.

""Light spaces are livable spaces"" he said. ""We're trying to do that but it's too early for me to definitely (say) what we're going to do there.""

Since the building was only acquired this month Hines doesn't have a clear timetable yet for the project to be completed. Harris said it ""seems reasonable"" that it will be completed by 2025 just because it will be a complex project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9yZWFsZXN0YXRlL2FydGljbGUvbW9ydGFnZS1iYXktYXJlYS0xNzI0NzU5Mi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As mortgage rates surge homeowners are avoiding refinancing and flocking to HELOCs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/realestate/article/mortage-bay-area-17247592.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9yZWFsZXN0YXRlL2FydGljbGUvbW9ydGFnZS1iYXktYXJlYS0xNzI0NzU5Mi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW5kaWVnb3VuaW9udHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL3JhbHBoLWFsbGVuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM1MjgyNjYx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ralph Allen Obituary (1938 - 2022) - San Diego CA - San Diego Union-Tribune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sandiegouniontribune/name/ralph-allen-obituary?id=35282661 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW5kaWVnb3VuaW9udHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL3JhbHBoLWFsbGVuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM1MjgyNjYx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA2LTE4Ly1iYW5raW5nLXdoaWxlLWJsYWNrLWlzLXRoZS1uZXh0LXRhcmdldC1mb3ItY2l2aWwtcmlnaHRzLWxhd3llctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Banking While Black' Is the Next Target for Civil Rights Lawyer,"Why did this happen?

For more than two decades those democracies slept peacefully while a small number of global corporations acquired a stranglehold on the most powerful communications technology since the invention of printing. The political earthquakes of 2016 provided a rough wake-up call as these slumbering giants suddenly realised that “the technological was political” that unaccountable power was loose in their world and that if they didn’t rein it in they may wind up as democracies in name only.

The years since that rough awakening have seen a frenzy of legislative and regulatory activity: antitrust suits draft bills in the US the EU and the UK (among others) congressional and parliamentary inquiries and so on. Whether any of this leads to effective curbs on tech power remains to be seen and this reviewer isn’t holding his breath. The question is not whether tech giants can be brought under control: we know that they can because Xi Jinping’s regime has been conducting masterclasses in how to do it. The question for us is: can liberal democracies do it?

All of which is by way of explaining why Jamie Susskind’s big book is a welcome arrival on the scene. Its focus is unaccountable tech power and how it might be tamed. But unlike the many other works which critique say machine learning technology on the grounds of racial or gender bias or its environmental impact Susskind raises the deeper question of why such powerful discriminatory technologies can be deployed at all. Why are democracies so cowed by digital technology that almost anything goes?

The reason why most current attempts to rein in tech power are doomed is because its critics implicitly accept its legitimacy rather than being outraged by its arrogant effrontery

He’s struck for example by how Joe Biden when he was running for president “started a petition asking Facebook to keep ‘paid misinformation’ from influencing the election” while over on Capitol Hill Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House of Representatives “plaintively asked advertisers to tell technology companies to reduce online misinformation”.

How did we get here – where public officials have to plead with corporations to protect the integrity of the democratic system? The answer is that for 50 years liberal democracies have been building a polity where the interests of corporations are systematically prioritised over those of citizens. The result is a world in which tech companies are allowed to wreak their “creative destruction” while government and civil society are expected to mop up the wreckage much like those Indian servants in the Raj who trudged after ceremonial elephants sweeping up their dung.

The name that Susskind gives to this slavish mindset is “market individualism” an ideology that sees society “as the product of a grand contractual bargain between each of its members a vehicle for the pursuit of individual advantage with no overarching pursuit of the common good”. It’s what I would call neoliberalism in the sense that Gary Gerstle uses it in his new book The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order and Susskind doubtless had reasons of his own for avoiding such an inflammatory term.

But that’s a minor quibble. The important thing is Susskind’s contention that a society governed by such an ideology will never be able to bring tech giants to heel. We need something better and he knows what it is – a republican mindset. Note the small r: this has nothing to do with the GOP or indeed the IRA but with a more venerable way of thinking about governance. To be a republican in that sense is Susskind argues to oppose all social structures that enable one social group to exercise unaccountable power (ie domination) over others. Republicans “reject the institution of absolute monarchy not just the flaws of particular kings. They fight for tenants’ rights not just for more beneficent landlords. They demand legal protections at work not just kinder bosses.” And they object to the very idea of someone with Mark Zuckerberg’s power not Zuckerberg himself.

Susskind’s book is essentially an exposition of how anyone who subscribes to these principles would approach the task of curbing the power of the tech companies now dominating our networked world. He kicks off with a succinct outline of how republicanism differs from market individualism and follows that with a diagnosis of how digital technologies control our behaviour frame our perception of the world and increase the intrusions of markets into every aspect of our lives. But he also makes the point that there is nothing God-given about the political and economic system that has allowed all this to come about. It can – and must – be changed.

The remainder of the book is about what we should do differently if we do not wish to live as slaves to tech power. It involves taking seriously republican principles about not tolerating unaccountable power after which it sets out a prospectus for a new system of republican governance of the industry. Accordingly a lot of the second half of the book is about governing data challenging the legitimacy of inscrutable machine-learning algorithms antitrust matters the difference between free speech and algorithmic amplification and related topics.

Put like that it may sound like a to-do list for policy wonks but Susskind’s gift for exposition means that the reader rarely loses the will to live as they head towards the (vast) bibliography. It also helps that he has a knack for the telling phrase: surveillance capitalists are the “Big Brotherhood” for example; TikTok has “subtly marginalised the unattractive and the poor”; we need “a Marketplace of Ideals”; and so on.

But really the most refreshing thing about this fine book is its ideological stance. The reason why most current attempts to rein in tech power are doomed is because its critics implicitly accept its legitimacy rather than being outraged by its arrogant effrontery. That’s because they’ve been drinking the neoliberal Kool-Aid for nearly half a century. Ideology after all is what determines how you think when you don’t know you’re thinking. It’s time for a change and The Digital Republic is a good place to start.

Next-gen game loading explained,"Although games certainly benefit from high-speed storage devices like SSDs diminishing returns kick in pretty quickly; It’s hard to tell the difference between an old SATA SSD and a cutting edge PCIe Gen 4 SSD in most games. In order to take advantage of increasingly faster SSDs like never before Microsoft launched DirectStorage for the Xbox Series X and now DirectStorage is making its way to PC.

While DirectStorage is certainly exciting for game developers what it means for gamers isn’t quite as exciting at least not at the moment.

What is DirectStorage?

DirectStorage is basically a new piece of software that enables games to take advantage of fast NVMe SSDs. This isn’t just to reduce loading times though. As games become increasingly complex better hardware is needed to run them and that’s not limited to CPUs and GPUs: Fast SSDs are becoming increasingly important for good gaming performance.

Get your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!

Modern game engines are developed from older technologies that were designed to load in a lot of data all at once which played to the strengths of hard drives. But nowadays game developers want to load many small pieces of data over a longer period of time. For example in many games far-away objects are not loaded in full detail in order to make the game run better. SSDs are really good at handling many requests for data also called IO requests and devs are beginning to optimize for SSDs.

The key weakness of DirectStorage’s predecessors is that there is a limit to how many times a game can make IO requests of the storage. Because HDDs were bad at handling lots of IO requests this limitation wasn’t important until devs wanted to harness the power of modern NVMe SSDs which are very good at handling thousands or even tens of thousands of IO requests per second. DirectStorage fixes this limitation at least for the foreseeable future.

How? A big part of DirectStorage is GPU file decompression. Most game files are compressed to reduce the install size and your CPU usually handles the decompression work. It turns out GPUs are really good at small file decompression and DirectStorage taps into that. It improves loading times while according to Microsoft massively reducing CPU overhead.

DirectStorage requirements

First and foremost to see the full benefits of DirectStorage you will need an NVMe SSD. You’ll probably want a PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 NVMe SSD though as games with DirectStorage are being developed with these kinds of SSDs in mind.

Secondly DirectStorage is an API-level technology tied to DirectX 12 which means it’s exclusive to DX12 games. Thankfully it is possible for older games to get DirectStorage through an update. For example The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is receiving an update later this year that introduces DX12 ray tracing  and DirectStorage.

Most CPUs and GPUs made within the past decade should be able to meet the minimum requirements for DirectStorage which is just DX12 compatibility. When it comes to graphics cards Nvidia GPUs since the 900 series and AMD GPUs since the 200 series all support DX12. Upcoming Intel GPUs will also support DX12.

All Intel CPUs since 3rd Gen and all AMD CPUs since Ryzen 1000 support PCIe 3.0 the minimum requirement for NVMe SSDs. Intel 11th Gen 12th Gen and Ryzen 3000 through 6000 (with some exceptions) support PCIe 4.0 which is the fastest speed for currently available SSDs. Finally upcoming PCIe 5.0 SSDs will be supported by Intel’s 12th Gen CPUs and AMD’s upcoming Ryzen 7000 CPUs.

Is DirectStorage any good?

It’s too early to say definitively how good DirectStorage is since no currently available games use the technology. However the developers for the upcoming game Forspoken recently demoed how DirectStorage improves loading times. On NVME SSDs DirectStorage reduced loading times by up to half a second while on SATA SSDs the loading times were reduced by just under a full second. Although the loading times were certainly low it’s very easy to get underwhelmed with how little improvement DirectStorage provided.

However it’s important to keep in mind that DirectStorage is brand new and Forspoken is going to be one of the first games ever to use it so there’s probably some room for optimization. More importantly DirectStorage is for more than just loading screens: It’s going to be used to make games look better without compromising on performance and will make faster storage more meaningful for gaming. Developers will be able to load in textures and objects more freely and creatively. This could mean higher resolution textures and more complex and detailed 3D things like people and scenery all without frequent loading screens or long hallways that disguise loading screens.

It usually takes a while to reap the rewards of new API-level technology. DX12 came out in 2015 and it wasn’t instantly important for all gamers but in the seven years since DX12 came out we can definitely say it was a crucial update because it enables stuff like raytracing. DX12 proves one thing pretty conclusively: Build it and they will come. If game developers can take advantage of new technology they will.

Community Columnist

George Hummer created one of Holland’s first mass-production factories.

Hummer was born in 1856 in New Jersey. His father’s name was Peter Snyder — but when he was six months old George Hummer and his family adopted him.

More History:Arend Visscher and James Huntley lived on a hill

When he was a young boy the Hummers moved to Grand Rapids Michigan. There George attended public school. He later graduated from the Northern Indiana Normal School in Valparaiso Indiana (later Valparaiso University).

In 1882 Hummer became Holland’s superintendent of schools a post he kept for seven years. In that time he increased enrollment in the high school and became known for his public relations teaching and disciplinary abilities.

In 1885 George married Marguerite Plugger daughter of Aldert Plugger. Plugger had a flour mill near the foot of Maple Avenue and Eighth Street as well as a shipping business. In 1856 in the parlor of his house on Eighth Street where the Warm Friend is today Plugger hosted Holland’s first banker Nathan Kenyon.

In 1885 George and Margaret married. They raised three children in their James Huntley-built home at 191 W. 12th St. — Hilda Marguerite and Kate..

In 1889 with Margaret’s inheritance Hummer formed West Michigan Furniture with partners Frank W. Hadden and Frederick Metz on the old Plugger Mill property. The company which initially made ""low to mid-end"" traditional bedroom and dining room furniture for customers on the East Coast was at once profitable.

At its first anniversary the company employed 100 people. Soon thereafter Hummer installed Edison lights bolstering the company’s efficiency on Holland’s dark winter days.

In 1892 Hummer — along with William Beach Cornelius DeRoo John C. Post Isaac Cappon Dr. Henry Kremers and others — formed the Holland and Chicago Transportation Company which ran steamers between Holland and Chicago. Like most of them Hummer was also an influential shareholder in First State Bank.

During the deep recession that followed the Wall Street Panic of 1893 300 of West Michigan Furniture’s employees went on strike when Hummer forced them to pay 1 percent of their wages for accident insurance. Hummer didn’t flinch — even though he was running for mayor as a Democrat.

He fired the alleged agitator and in an open letter to the Ottawa County Times criticized labor organizations. Still he managed to defeat Edward Harrington. While his action may have offended pro-labor voters it may have pacified pro-business and law-and-order voters — many of whom believed strikes were both illegal and anti-Christian.

In 1894 Hummer retained the mayor’s chair by defeating Isaac Cappon. In 1896 fire destroyed West Michigan Furniture. Hummer had it rebuilt.

In 1898 Hummer made substantial business transactions. The West Michigan Furniture Company bought the West Michigan Seating Company increasing its total employment to over 600 people.

Then Hummer divested his interest in the Holland and Chicago Transportation Company to invest in the Interurban. He also helped form the Holland Sugar Company.

In 1900 George and Maggie Hummer moved to Grand Rapids.

In 1904 the West Michigan Furniture Company bought a controlling interest in the Engel Lumber and Land Company in Louisiana. In 1905 Hummer became one of the founding investors in Peoples State Bank.

Between 1910 and 1920 Hummer successfully incorporated Henry Ford’s assembly-line methods into his factory. He also installed his son-in-law Charles Kirchen husband of his daughter Maggie as president.

Then in 1920 he again agitated workers when he decreased their wages by 10 cents an hour telling them that other companies in Holland would soon be doing the same. That same year Hummer died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident near his home in Grand Rapids.

After his death Kirchen who was also president of People’s State Bank became the sole owner of West Michigan Furniture. By that time the company was specializing in phonograph cabinets and mahogany beds for high-end hotels. During the World War II years it made bunk beds. In the 1950s to 1970s it made beds for colleges hospitals and motel chains.

In 1976 the Padnos Iron and Metal Company bought West Michigan Furniture. Four years later the Mueller Furniture Company bought the West Michigan Furniture business and Padnos retained the property.

Today West Michigan Furniture’s original office building still stands on Eighth Street near the foot of Maple Avenue.

During the virtual New York Comic-Con two years ago producer Nina Jacobson weighed in on what fans can expect from the dystopian flick.

""This is the 10th Hunger Games as opposed to Catching Fire's 75th. I think that the Hunger Games are considerably less glitzy than they ultimately become so I think there's a lot of fun in that in seeing what they used to be.

""I think that seeing a Capitol character with a point of view that takes you through a good part of the story is something we've never really done"" she teased.

The West Point Volunteer Fire Department was first dispatched to a call around 3 a.m. for a fire in the chip plant.

According to West Point Fire Chief Spencer Cheatham the crew responded and called for more equipment and personnel from both West Point and the New Kent County Fire Department.

Upon inspection early responders found small fires in a 250-foot-long tunnel that houses the conveyor system. The tunnel which stands 10 stories high was burning sawdust and chips and was filled with smoke Cheatham said.

Although more units arrived and attacked the fire from two locations the fire intensified and burned the conveyor belt until it broke. The belt was pulled down a floor below to a machinery room.

“The belt continued to burn in that room which intensified the situation and necessitated an aggressive attack in that room” Cheatham said.

When a second alarm sounded more units responded from New Kent as well as Lower King & Queen Volunteer Fire Department the Walkerton Community Fire Association and King William Fire & EMS.

The West Point Police Department controlled traffic as over 30 firefighters fought the blaze until getting it under control around 6:30 am.

All responders left the mill at 9:45 am after it was deemed safe. A damage estimate wasn’t available.

You have been named America’s Best for 2022.” Imagine waking to a video in your inbox from your company CEO that began with those words. That’s how the day started Wednesday for 29 individuals and 34 groups within the Ebby Halliday Companies.

These agents from EHC’s three real estate divisions — Ebby Halliday Realtors Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate and Williams Trew — were recognized in the 2022 Real Trends and Tom Ferry America’s Best Real Estate Professionals announced Wednesday. The annual report published by Real Trends is a state-by-state ranking of top agents in the country by volume sold and total transactions in 2021. These agents ranked among the top 1.5 percent of 1.6 million total real estate professionals in the United States

The CEO of Ebby Halliday Companies Chris Kelly offered his sincere congratulations and gratitude for a job well done.

“This isn’t a popularity contest” Kelly told recipients. “This is all about the agents who truly serve their clients and do more business than anyone else. And that is all of you. We are incredibly grateful to be your partner here at Ebby Halliday Realtors Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate and Williams Trew and that you choose to grow your real estate career right here alongside all of us.”

Malinda Howell Senior Vice President of Brokerage for the Ebby Halliday Companies emphasized the timing of the feat.

“It’s important to remember that this latest America’s Best ranking was based on 2021 sales figures — and 2021 was another unprecedented year in real estate” Howell says. “While this ranking is impressive in any market it’s even more impressive given all of the additional pivots required to successfully guide a client to the finish line last year. We could not be more proud of each and every one of these amazing agents.”

Carolyn Rosson Senior Vice President of Brokerage for the Ebby Halliday Companies added her admiration.

“Our legendary company has always been known for the high level of professionalism and service provided by our agents — and these agents are so admired within our organization” Rosson says. “They live our mission statement of ‘People First.

Rossann Williams who started with Starbucks as a regional vice president in 2004 will leave the company later this month.

Chief Operating Officer John Culver told employees in a Friday letter ""the decision was not taken lightly."" He said Williams was offered another job at the company but she declined.

Meanwhile Sara Trilling was promoted to executive vice president and president of Starbucks North America. Trilling is a 20-year veteran of Starbucks and most recently served as senior vice president and president of Starbucks Asia Pacific in Hong Kong.

STARBUCKS' HOWARD SCHULTZ TALKS ABOUT THE HUNT FOR HIS REPLACEMENT

Williams was a prominent figure in the company's push against worker unionization. Her departure comes amid a wave of other prominent companies seeing unionization efforts among their hourly workers.

In December a Starbucks store in Buffalo became the first to unionize at one of the coffee retailer's company-owned U.S. stores. At least 150 of Starbucks' 9000 company-run U.S. stores have voted to unionize since then according to the National Labor Relations Board. At least 10 stores have rejected the union.

Williams told employees in a letter last year that Starbucks never favored unionization and prefers to speak directly to employees but respects the legal process and wants to work with those in Buffalo who voted in favor of union representation.

Federal labor officials alleged in April that Starbucks had retaliated against workers in Phoenix after it learned of employees there seeking to unionize.

PointsBet will issue 38.75 million new shares to SIG Sports a unit of Susquehanna International Group or SIG at $1.68 ($2.43 AUS) per share the company said Sunday in a filing with the Australian Securities Exchange. That’s a roughly 13% increase over PointsBet’s closing share price on Friday.

In addition to the $65.2 million ($94.16 million AUS) investment PointsBet announced that Nellie Analytics which was founded by SIG has entered into an agreement to provide technology and data to the company.

The investment is a bet that despite early returns from the rapidly-expanding North American sports betting industry where aggressive marketing and pricey bonuses are the main way companies are acquiring customers bettors will eventually move to the sportsbook with the best pricing. And that’s where SIG’s expertise is most valuable according to co-founder and managing director Jeff Yass.

“When we combine [PointsBet’s] analytics with our analytics we think we can make the best price in the business” Yass said in an interview. “That’s our bet that the best price is going to win. If it’s a marketing contest then frankly Susquehanna doesn’t add much value.”

The money should help PointsBet continue to grow its North American business as new jurisdictions legalize wagering in both in the U.S. and Canada. While PointsBet is based in Melbourne it has prioritized North America for business growth and not necessarily in the same way that DraftKings and FanDuel have. While those companies are spending with the aim of eventually controlling huge chunks of the market PointsBet executives have preached a more conservative marketing approach with a stated goal of eventually having about 10% market share. (It’s currently around 4% according to estimates from Eilers & Krejcik).

Yass said that if his thesis about pricing is correct there’s no reason PointsBet couldn’t exceed that 10% target. “If it’s 10% that you don’t have to spend crazy amounts on advertising to get started I think that’s a reasonable goal” Yass said. “I’m hopeful that if we have the best prices in the long run we can have a lot more than 10%.”

There are no changes to the PointsBet board as a result of the SIG investment according to the filing.

The partnership with Nellie Analytics will be run through Banach Technology a company that PointsBet purchased last year for $43 million in cash and stock. Under an initial exploratory agreement Nellie will provide exclusive data services at no cost to PointsBet for a nine-month period according to the filing. The plan is to eventually ink a long-term partnership.

PointsBet is hoping that Nellie’s technology in areas such as live betting and micro markets will improve its offering. While most major sportsbooks outsource a lot of those services to other companies PointsBet has often discussed the advantages of owning its tech in-house. That has allowed the sportsbook according to executives to be more flexible in its offerings and to ensure that its product is sufficiently differentiated from its competitors. Working with an outside company albeit one owned by PointsBet’s largest shareholder is at least a partial deviation from that approach.

Overall it’s been a rough 12 months for publicly traded sports betting stocks particularly in the U.S. The broader market shift away from growth companies has highlighted the huge costs operators are incurring to retain customers and attract new ones. Onerous tax requirements in states like New York a critical market and other market contractions have further stressed the business.

PointsBet which is currently operating in 10 U.S. states hasn’t avoided those concerns. The company’s stock is down about 70% this year. It closed Friday with a market cap of market cap of $374 million (AUS $540.33 million).

Headquartered in Pennsylvania Susquehanna is one of the world’s largest closely held trading firms. It has additional business verticals that include an institutional brokerage private equity and venture capital structured capital and sports analytics. The firm has more than 2300 employees worldwide.

The new shares will be issued under PointsBet’s existing placement capacity according to the filing. They are expected to be quoted “on or around” June 17. The SIG shares include a voluntary lock-up period of 24 months which can be shortened if the long-term partnership with Nellie doesn’t materialize.

It wasn’t intended to inspire imitators and ultimately change the face of the Strip. It was built to obstruct the view of other casinos

The Mirage volcano wasn’t designed to be iconic.

It wasn’t intended to inspire imitators and ultimately change the face of the Strip.

It was built to obstruct the view of other casinos.

“Wherever there was a neon sign or something intrusive we blocked it” Steve Wynn told the Review-Journal in October 1989 less than a month before he opened the lush resort. “It would have been no good to design this environment then walk out and get hit in the face with the neon.”

The developer simply wasn’t a fan of the noble gas and the ubiquitous signage in which it was used. “I’m burned out on neon” Wynn said in the same interview. “I think it’s cheap.”

In a cruel twist of fate renderings of the guitar-shaped hotel that will replace the volcano at some point after Hard Rock International’s takeover of The Mirage is complete show it gleaming as though every last bit is dripping with the stuff.

When it debuted the volcano was the sort of attraction that stopped traffic. Literally. It was so unlike anything people had seen a sign warned drivers heading south on Las Vegas Boulevard: “Please drive carefully. And for your own safety try not to be distracted by the hotel on the right.”

Families. Hardened gamblers. Newlyweds. Grandparents. The volcano was for everyone and the public simply couldn’t get enough of it. With its mix of waterfalls fire and smoke the volcano was right there for anyone to see from the sidewalk for free.

“It definitely was something that changed the way people thought about what casinos were supposed to look like” says David G. Schwartz professor and gaming historian at UNLV.

Given the way crowds flocked to see it it’s little surprise that the Strip’s next three resorts — Excalibur Luxor and Treasure Island — each put their own spins on the volcano with free water-based spectacles front and center.

The early ’90s was a wild time to be a tourist in Las Vegas. If you were so inclined — and wearing comfortable shoes — you could start at Treasure Island where characters aboard a pirate vessel and a British warship waged explosive battles as many as seven times a day. After heading next door to see the volcano spit fire you could trek to Excalibur where a mechanical Merlin encountered an animatronic dragon in the hotel’s moat. If you still had the energy you could cap off your journey at Luxor with its 300000-gallon Karnak Lake and its more than 100 computer-controlled fountains.

All of that was available without venturing within a hundred feet of a casino door.

It was the era when Las Vegas began courting families with bigger and bolder ideas — and before the corporatization of the Strip which demanded ways to monetize every square inch of a property. Case in point: After an almost exactly 20-year run the last 10 of which were as the retooled “Sirens of TI” the pirate show was shuttered to make room for a CVS.

Schwartz describes the Strip before the arrival of The Mirage and its volcano as “workmanlike” and credits Wynn’s showmanship for the change.

“I think you have that idea that you can’t just give people slot machines and craps tables” he says of the years after The Mirage’s opening. “There needs to be something else. There has to be that romance that mystery that drama to lure them in.”

Wynn would expand on Luxor’s fountain show concept in 1998 with the opening of Bellagio bringing the shared influence full circle.

In a sign of just how much the Strip has changed nothing close to those attractions has opened in the quarter century since Bellagio.

The only thing that even resembles them is the Lake of Dreams with its massive animatronic singing frog and birds at Wynn Las Vegas. The hotel’s namesake made sure though that the show was tucked away inside the resort past high-end retailers including Dior Chanel and Van Cleef & Arpels.

It’s still free but viewing spots are largely limited to the upscale Overlook Lounge and Bar Parasol. You can also see it with a reservation from the patio at Lakeside with its “resort elegant attire” dress code and SW Steakhouse where Wagyu steaks sell for $75 an ounce.

Here’s a closer look at those attractions that soon will be joined by the volcano in the annals of Lost Vegas: Treasure Island

It made zero fiscal sense.

Two dozen cast members performed as many as seven times a day aboard two $12 million 90-foot ships in the $33 million village known as Buccaneer Bay.

The battle between the crews of the pirate ship Hispaniola and the British ship Britannia which sailed into view around the corner from Spring Mountain Road involved trading insults and cannon fire the latter of which was accentuated by 45-foot fireballs that generated several thousand degrees of heat.

The show was directed by David Sosna who’d been the first assistant director on movies including “The Blues Brothers” and “Coming to America” as well as the iconic video for Michael Jackson’s “Thriller.” The stunt work was overseen by Charlie Croughwell Michael J. Fox’s longtime stunt double who’d coordinated the stunt work on “Batman Returns.”

“In a movie you do stunts one at a time” Croughwell said back then. “But this is 23 separate people doing stunts all at the same time from different angles.”

Since this was a pirate-themed hotel the British lost every battle as their sailors fell or jumped overboard. They left the captain whose voice on the recorded soundtrack was provided by Treasure Island developer Steve Wynn to go down with the ship as it sank.

Despite hotel estimates that it was attracting 4.5 million visitors a year the show was retired on July 6 2003 three days before pirate fever began sweeping the world with the opening of “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.”

Whoops.

By then Treasure Island executives had seen enough families and wanted to chase the younger crowd that was flocking to the Palms and the Hard Rock Hotel. So they came up with a new show using the occasion of the hotel’s 10th anniversary on Oct. 26 2003 to debut “The Sirens of TI.” Gone was the British navy having been replaced by sexy sirens ladies whose singing voices famously lured sailors to their doom.

With artistic direction by Michael Cotten who designed Michael Jackson’s “History” and ill-fated “This Is It” tours and original songs produced by Emilio Estefan the show was directed by Kenny Ortega of “High School Musical” fame.

“It’s old Hollywood movies meet rock ’n’ roll videos” Ortega said at the time calling it “a contemporary rock pirate musical.”

The show’s overall aesthetic was a bit like the cast of Thunder From Down Under had sailed into the Spearmint Rhino.

A cabin boy named Eros was lured to The Song the rechristened pirate ship where he was held prisoner eventually leading the pirate crew of The Bull aka the former Britannia to attempt a rescue.

What followed was a gorgeous train wreck involving dance numbers explosions some light bondage and artery-clogging levels of cheese that put a whole new spin on the words “pirate booty.”

The show ended with the male and female leads going upstairs to a secluded part of the ship with “a little business to take care of.”

If that weren’t enough of a clue that the hotel had changed there was this lyric: “Are you looking for the arcade? Well it doesn’t exist anymore. You wanna know why? Because this is an adult candy store.”

Public reaction to the new show could charitably be described as “mixed.” Still it gyrated on four shows a night weather permitting until Oct. 21 2003. It never returned from a brief hiatus once it became clear that current Treasure Island owner Phil Ruffin was drastically shortening the renamed Sirens’ Cove to make room for a retail development.

The ships are still there a monument to bygone days.

The Bull though has been positioned in a way that makes it look as though it ran aground at Señor Frog’s and its crew just decided to stay.

Excalibur

It was billed as one of the largest animatronic dragons in the world. A 70-foot long three-story smoke-snorting fire-breathing monster that roamed the Excalibur moat every hour on the hour from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m.

“It took nine months to construct this beast” animation supervisor Scott Kessel said at the time. “We really wanted to make this dragon look lifelike.”

Excalibur opened June 19 1990 but the dragon — which we once described as having “hand-painted murky-green scales glowing yellow eyeballs and a blood-red smile” — didn’t arrive until 1993. It was created by AVG Technologies the company behind the “Wizard of Oz” display that opened the same year at the MGM Grand.

As for the show the dragon emerged from behind a gate and lumbered about in a manner best described as “deliberate” — somewhere between the characters at Chuck E. Cheese and those mechanical horses that used to reside in front of supermarkets. It breathed some fire and roared a bit before it began mildly bothering a robotic Merlin. Then the wizard shooed it away with some low-wattage fireworks.

Review-Journal readers voted the show “worst attraction” in the annual Best of Las Vegas polls for 2002 and 2003 then it quietly vanished leaving behind only memories — as well as Merlin’s cottage and the tracks on which the dragon maneuvered both of which are still visible in the moat.

Luxor

Resort officials clearly had some pretty lofty goals for Luxor’s fountain show.

Among the attractions that opened with the hotel and casino on Oct. 15 1993 was the River Nile boat ride that brought hotel guests to their elevators and took others on an 18-minute tour of the hotel floating by manufactured artifacts and passing through tunnels representing the Tomb of Queen Nefertari and the Temple of Isis.

Then there were the three movielike attractions collectively known as “Secrets of the Luxor Pyramid” that were overseen by Douglas Trumbull the special effects whiz who shared Oscar nominations for best visual effects for “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” “Blade Runner” and “Star Trek: The Motion Picture.”

The highest praise though was reserved for the fountains.

During the day they’d spout water out of the resort’s Karnak Lake as part of a seemingly endless array of patterns. At night lasers would shoot from the sphinx’s eyes setting in motion a process in which more lasers and Egyptian-themed imagery would be projected onto a 60-foot screen of water.

“Luxor officials ‘to a degree’ hope the light-and-water spectacle will displace The Mirage’s erupting volcano as the highest-profile attraction on the Strip” we wrote on the day of the opening attributing those hopes to Cliff Hay then Luxor’s director of rides and attractions.

The sheer variety of water shows that were possible gave the Luxor attraction an edge Hay said at the time. “(I)f you’ve seen the volcano once or twice you’ve seen it.”

Today anyone at the station to catch the tram that links Mandalay Bay and Excalibur can see the remains of Karnak Lake the fountains and any dreams of unseating the volcano.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhc3ZlZ2FzYWR2aXNvci5jb20vcXVlc3Rpb24vcGFyYWRpc2UtcGFyay1yZXZpc2l0ZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the Wynn's Paradise Park Project Dead?,"Several years ago Steve Wynn announced plans to replace the Wynn hotel’s golf course with an elaborate lake/beach development.

The ambitious (and frequently altered) Paradise Park project slated to replace the golf course behind the Wynn/Encore was abandoned for good in 2019.

The $1.6 billion ""park"" originally planned to include a 20-acre lagoon with water recreation a new hotel-casino complete with a carousel zipline and fireworks and a new convention center was scrapped in the wake of the departure of Steve Wynn from the company.

The golf course closed in December 2017 to make way for the park but was re-opened in October 2019 after Wynn left and the remaining management made the determination that they ""weren’t interested in building a large public swimming pool for the Las Vegas Strip."" They did however complete the 465000 square feet of new meeting space.

We can say with some confidence that the public swimming pool won't see the light of day again at least for the foreseeable future.

We've never come across any numbers for how much the Wynn invested in overhauling the golf course after the plans for Paradise Park were repudiated but we're sure that the eight completely new holes and 10 others that were revamped by original designer Tom Fazio and his son Logan didn't come cheap.

In addition with greens fees currently running in the $600s and demand for tee times at a premium the course is a major revenue producer that we're sure the Wynn doesn't want to mess with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBva2VybmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA2L3d5bm4tbXlzdGVyeS1ib3VudHktcG9rZXItY3JhenktcmVhY3Rpb24tNDE0MzguaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is This the Best Wynn Mystery Bounty Winner Reaction Ever?,"Is This the Best Wynn Mystery Bounty Winner Reaction Ever?

June 18 2022 Adam Lamers Live Reporter Yori Epskamp Senior Content Manager

In the span of two years Wynn Poker has made itself synonymous with the now incredibly popular Mystery Bounty format. Kicking off once in the money the bounty prize pool of a Mystery Bounty tournament is divided into an array of prizes adding an exciting component throughout the day as people are looking to reel in a big score by picking the right bounty envelope.

In last night's $2200 Mystery Bounty part of the Wynn Summer Classic a total of 2854 entries showed up divided over four starting flights. Just over 300 returned for Day 2 looking for their shot at some big money that included a top prize of nearly half a million dollars as well as two $250000 Mystery Bounties as the grand prize in the bounty portion of the event.

With fewer than 100 players remaining both top bounties were still in play. Those that had scored a bounty despite still playing in the event mostly lined up at the payout queue to take a spin before the big money would be gone. The Wynn Poker staff was once again in top form ensuring a smooth process throughout and working overtime to deliver a day full of exciting moments.

Within roughly thirty minutes both $250000 bounties got scooped up by first Milos Ivanovic and then Paul Chauderson. The latter arguably had the best reaction of any bounty winner. Check out the moment below where Ivanovic and Chauderson opened their respective envelopes.

Chauderson was ecstatic when he pulled the six-figure amount out of the envelope stating that he would give 5% to the Wynn staff. As expected the reaction in the room was a mixture of cheers and boos as they saw their shot at a quarter-million bonus prize evaporate.

There were also three $100000 bounties in the mix and they went to Jordan Westmorland and Aaron Thivyanathan. The last one was pulled in the wee hours of the night after Calvin Anderson was eliminated in third place.

Anderson had 14 bounties collected throughout the day and waited until his elimination to draw them all. Anderson picked up $176243 for his third-place finish and also took home $111000 in bounties.

Manuel Machado Wins $2200 Wynn Mystery Bounty for $410485 Plus Bounties

Manuel Machado

In what ultimately turned out to be an almost 17-hour day of poker Manuel Machado finally came out on top in the $2200 Wynn Mystery Bounty. Machado struck an ICM deal with heads-up opponent Elliott Kampen with Machado walking away as the biggest winner. Machado earned a payday of $410485 in the deal along with a total of $66000 in bounties.

This will undoubtedly go down as Machado's biggest live tournament score in his career and he was quite emotional afterwards. Machado only has $129000 in recorded tournament winnings and this win will more than quadruple that for him.

Machado who came to Las Vegas for the World Series of Poker this summer has found his breakout performance here at the Wynn. It was a rollercoaster of a day for the poker player from Portugal who almost found himself out of the tournament in eighth place. However when his pocket aces got out-flopped by the pocket kings of Dennis Wilke Machado managed to find an ace on the river to double up and hold a commanding chip lead. He never looked back as he held that chip lead en route to eliminating four players at the final table.

As for Kampen he will also be heading home with his largest career score of $362739. Kampen also scooped $91500 in bounties over the course of the day including a $50000 and a $25000 bounty. Kampen took a different route on the final table staying away from all of the action and watching players fall by the wayside all around him.

Both methods worked for the players who were both happy with the final outcome.

Day 2 Action

Cherish Andrews finished in 6th place ($72105) and picked up a slew of bounties along the way.

The field was littered with other notables who made deep runs including Kristen Foxen Kitty Kuo Jake Schwartz Anton Wigg Jesse Sylvia and Joao Simao. Every player that made it through to Day 2 was guaranteed at least a min-cash of $3325.

The field quickly dwindled to just 39 players at the dinner break over the course of nine levels. The final table was reached just moments after midnight and the tournament ended just after 4:30 a.m. local time. The final table had many twists and turns the biggest one leading Machado to be the massive chipleader.

Machado also found himself on the right side of a cooler when both he and Cherish Andrews flopped a set in a three-way pot. Machado flopped top set while Andrews flopped bottom set. They got all their chips in the middle on the flop and Andrews was ousted in sixth place.

Despite taking a tough beat early at the final table Wilke out-lasted all but three players as he was eventually eliminated in fourth place. Anderson was quick to hit the road next as his confrontation with Machado in the blinds ended poorly for him. Machado took a huge chip lead into the heads-up match but an early double-up from Kampen seemed to turn the tide. Kampen also got paid off on the river after turning the nut straight leading to the players discussing a deal.

Calvin Anderson finished in 3th place ($176243) and collected fourteen bounties along the way including a $100000 bounty.

That wraps up the coverage at the Wynn for this tournament. PokerNews will be back on the floor on June 24th as the $3500 Main Event kicks off. Follow all live updates of the 2022 Wynn Summer Classic right here.

Being an executive chef makes for an extremely busy career — even with just one busy restaurant under your watch. Simultaneously becoming top toque for a wildly popular second establishment? Double the workload. Be named a semifinalist for a James Beard Foundation Award like Gina Marinelli? Triple your duties.

But with an ever-present smile she’s taking all the excitement of being named in the highest echelon of American chefs in a calm cool and collected stride befitting a champion.

In recent years Marinelli has gained broad exposure as chef/partner at La Strega an elegant and adventurous Italian establishment in southern Summerlin — more braised rabbit with carrot polenta than spaghetti and meatballs. Then last winter she took on the same role at the impressive Harlo Steakhouse &Bar in Downtown Summerlin — here chilled seafood towers and 14-day dry-aged ribeyes command the handsome energetic room. (Both restaurants are owned by the same company.)

After the February announcement naming her as one of three Beard Foundation Award semifinalists in the Southwest Marinelli said both of her restaurants became more popular than ever — especially among Summerlin residents not yet familiar with the establishments. And she knows she and her teams are in an even brighter spotlight than before. “We have this thing that’s hovering over us — it’s an honor and we want to live up to it every day.”

Before plying her trade in the suburbs Marinelli graduated from Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Orlando Florida. From there she embarked on a successful career on the Strip including working in kitchens at Nobhill Tavern American Fish Sage and D.O.C.G Enoteca.

Marinelli said the whole team is reveling in the glow of the nomination from back to front of house — everyone contributes to making the culinary magic happen.

“I think personally I’m pushing myself a bit more” Marinelli said. “It’s exciting to get to this spot.”

With that in mind consumers might be scrutinizing their electricity bills. Yet they'll find some information that seems inscrutable. What follows is a guide for deciphering power bills — particularly for Xcel Energy customers.

With 1.3 million electricity customers in Minnesota Minneapolis-based Xcel is by far the state's largest power provider.

Be they big or small though electricity providers seek a balance on their bills.

""I have seen a lot of different bills from a lot of different utilities and some are way too detailed and some have just the minimum"" said Adam Heinen vice president of regulatory services at Dakota Electric and a former utility analyst at the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

Key terms in Xcel Energy's electric bill 1. Basic Service Charge Fixed. Gives you access to electricity. 2. Energy Charge Variable. Based on your monthly electricity consumption times the price of power. 3. Fuel Cost Charge Variable. Utility's fuel and power purchase costs passed down to you without markup. 4. Sales True Up Variable. Xcel's actual electric sales are ""trued-up"" to forecast sales; if actual is higher you get a credit; lower a surcharge. 5. Affordability Charge Fixed. Funds efforts to help low-income customers pay bills. 6. Resource Adjustment Variable. Includes charges for transmission; energy efficiency programs; and some renewable energy projects. 7. Interim Rate Adjustment Interim rate increase (on energy charge) granted by regulators before a rate case is settled. If final rate is below interim future bills are credited. If higher no charges are added. 8. City Fees Denotes ""franchise"" fees that cities charge utilities for use of rights-of-way. Can be a flat fee or based on percent of energy charge.

Source: Xcel Energy

First things first

The first line on most electricity bills is a fixed ""basic service"" charge that doesn't change with usage.

""For the consumer this is the cost of having electricity in your home"" said Carmen Carruthers outreach director for the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota a ratepayer advocacy group. ""But it varies significantly.""

Xcel Energy charges $8 per month to customers served by overhead power lines; $10 for those with underground lines. The state's other investor-owned utilities — Duluth-based Minnesota Power and Fergus Falls-based Otter Tail Power — have basic charges of $8 and $9.75 respectively.

Dakota Electric's basic charge is $10 low for a retail power cooperative. Dakota with about 110000 customers is the state's only electric co-op whose rates aren't set by its board. Instead it's regulated by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) which aims to keep a lid on basic service charges.

Farmington-based Dakota is the second largest of Minnesota's 50 power co-ops which together serve around 700000 households. Ramsey-based Connexus the largest with 141000 customers has a basic monthly service charge of $13.50.

Most retail power co-ops' service charges are considerably higher than investor-owned utilities' — as much as $30 to $40 per month for some Carruthers said.

That's because most co-ops are largely rural and have far fewer customers per power-line mile to cover fixed costs. On the other hand co-op customers usually get an annual bill credit for profit-sharing.

""Co-op bills generally look simpler"" Carruthers said.

Now the largest cost

An ""energy"" charge is another foundation of any electric bill — and a customer's largest single cost.

It is based on the amount of energy a customer uses multiplied by the price of power with both measured in kilowatt hours. Power providers usually spell out the equation on your bill; Xcel adds the term ""energy charge.""

Xcel's bill notes a ""summer"" energy charge — which lasts from June through September — and a ""winter"" charge. The summer rate is 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour — or 17 % — higher because that's when power demand peaks and wholesale prices rise.

Many co-ops have a higher summer rate as well as does Otter Tail Power.

Paying for power generation

Investor-owned utilities pass their fuel costs (for power generation) directly to consumers a charge based on electricity consumption. Under state law fuel costs are not marked up by a utility.

On Xcel's bill fuel cost charges are labeled as such while they are part of ""energy (or resource) adjustment"" charges on bills for Minnesota Power and Otter Tail (which respectively have about 145000 and 62000 Minnesota customers).

Co-ops have monthly bill adjustments based on fuel and other variable costs incurred by their power supplier. Minnesota retail co-ops rely on wholesale power co-ops particularly Maple Grove-based Great River Energy for electricity generation.

Xcel's fuel charge isn't broken out on its bill but the company provided details to the Star Tribune.

Costs for coal natural gas and nuclear fuel made up 35% of Xcel's charge in 2022. Another 43% came from net power purchases in wholesale electricity markets a cost common cost for utilities.

The remaining 22% of Xcel's fuel charge stems from Minnesota's legislatively mandated Community Solar Garden program which is aimed at people and organizations that want solar without setting up their own panels.

The solar gardens are developed and owned by independent energy companies. Xcel buys their power and administers the program but makes no profit. Under state law Xcel bills all residential customers — and most other customers — for the program's costs.

Xcel's bill also has a separate ""resource adjustment"" line which captures costs beyond fuel that are contained in PUC-approved ""riders"" — charges that aren't set out in rates. Xcel doesn't break out riders on its bills but provided details.

A transmission rider comprises 20% of Xcel's resource adjustment charge; another 20% comes from a Conservation Improvement Program (CIP) rider. By state law investor-owned utilities must have CIP programs which fund energy-efficiency initiatives.

About 55% of Xcel's resource adjustment charge is for Minnesota's Renewable Energy Standard which the Legislature created in 2007. It requires investor-owned utilities to get a portion of power from renewables; they can recover some of those costs through a rider.

Some mandated fees and taxes

Customers of some investor-owned utilities will also see an ""affordability"" surcharge on their bills. For Xcel it's a flat 98 cents per month. This charge funds state-mandated programs to help low-income customers defray electricity costs.

Rounding out your electric bill is list of government fees and taxes usually topped by the state's 6.875 % general sales tax. The state tax however doesn't apply from November through April for consumers whose main source of home heating is electricity.

Some utility bills will include small taxes from counties transit authorities and cities. Many municipalities also have ""franchisee fees"" which can be flat or based on a percentage of your bill before taxes.

In Minneapolis residents pay a half-cent sales tax and a 5% franchisee fee. Cities with flat monthly franchise fees usually charge $1.50 to $3.

Cities levy franchise fees on utilities for use of public rights of way but the charges are passed down to customers. Municipalities are increasingly using franchisee fees as a source of funding: They're usually easier to implement than tax increases.

Some customers will have bill disputes. The PUC's Consumer Affairs Office has received 1255 electricity billing complaints since 2017. It can be reached by e-mail at consumer.puc@state.mn.us or by phone at 651-296-0406 or 800-657-3782.

Colorado’s Eastern Plains — from Yuma County cornfields to Prowers County feedlots and the wheat and sorghum fields in Kiowa County — are set to undergo their biggest transformation in more than a century as clean electricity is added to the crops they produce.

There is already a flurry of activity as wind and solar developers — more than a dozen have turned up in Yuma and Kiowa counties — are locking up acreage for prospective projects in leases with ranchers and farmers.

“We’ve had windmills around here for a long time. These are just bigger” said Jan Kochis 73 whose family runs a farm and cattle operation in Elbert County and already has wind turbines on her land generating royalties.

“It’s our new cash crop. We don’t have to worry about the rain or hail as long as the wind blows” Kochis said.

Not everyone is sanguine about what is coming. “Once these big companies come in we are going to lose control” said William Harman 54 who runs a family cattle business and farm in Washington County. “Once you sign a lease you lose control.”

The spur for all this activity is Xcel Energy’s recently approved $1.7 billion Power Pathway transmission project — which will belt eastern Colorado with 560 miles of high-tension transmission lines — an electric highway to Front Range cities and suburbs for new wind and solar installations.

Colorado’s climate goals leads to creation of the Power Pathway

Power Pathway is in turn the product of Colorado’s push embedded in state law to reduce its emissions of climate-altering greenhouse gasses. The goal for the state is a 50% reduction over 2005 levels by 2030 and a steeper 80% reduction for the utility industry.

The pair of 350-kilovolt transmission lines — looping from Fort Saint Vrain in the north down to rural Kiowa County and then over to Pueblo and up to Aurora — is the backbone of Xcel Energy’s plan to develop clean electricity generation and meet state mandates.

“Over the next 10 years the electric grid in Colorado is going to be transitioning from thermal fossil fuel plants to largely wind and solar” Colorado Public Utilities Commissioner John Gavan said at a recent session on climate change. “We are going to be slathering the Eastern Plains with wind and solar.”

For the communities on the plains Power Pathway will spark one of the biggest changes since 1909 when the Enlarged Homestead Act doubled the permitted homestead to 320 acres in an effort to promote nonirrigated or dryland farming.

“We live out here we own this land and all of sudden these companies are coming in saying we are going to do this and we are going to do that without us having much say particularly on transmission” said Monte Willeke 69 who farms wheat hay and millet for livestock in Washington County. “The money is all right. It is the longevity that bothers me and having to look at those transmission lines and wind mills forever.”

But Tom Jackson who raises corn outside the town of Joes in Yuma County said “maybe 60% of the people are OK with it either way everybody realizes it’s coming.”

For Xcel Energy the state’s largest electricity provider the project is all about chickens and eggs and fields of dreams.

Since 2007 Xcel Energy has retired 900 megawatts of coal-fired power plants — the main source of its greenhouse gases — with another 1410 MW slated to be closed by the end of 2030.

To help fill the gap and provide for growth Xcel Energy wants to add 2300 MW of solar generation 1600 MW of new wind farms and 400 MW of storage — much of it through independent wind and solar developers selling electricity to the utility.

There is a catch. Usually generation projects are built first and then transmission is added to link the plant to the grid but Xcel Energy is seeking to develop so many new projects and at such a quick tempo in an effort to capture expiring federal tax credits that without assured transmission it won’t get done.

At stake is as much as $850 million in tax credits provided projects are up and running by the end of 2025. Whatever part of the cost isn’t covered by the credits may have to be paid by Xcel Energy customers.

Building the Power Pathway even before there are any solar fields or wind farms is Xcel Energy executives said in PUC testimony a way to avoid the “chicken-and-egg dilemma.”

“For clean energy resources and emission reductions in Colorado the Pathway Project through the Eastern Plains is the ‘Field of Dreams’” Alice Jackson then-CEO of Xcel’s Colorado subsidiary said in testimony last year.

Build it and they will come — and coming they are. Engie North America a subsidiary of a French multinational corporation is looking to build a wind farm in Yuma County and Enel Green Power an Italian energy company is working on a wind project in Elbert County.

“It’s a big land rush. Everyone is jockeying to get into position” said R.J. Jolly a Cheyenne County commissioner and farmer who has signed a wind lease agreement with Enel. “There is a lot of money on the table.”

Some of the best natural wind resources in the country

To be sure the plains are no stranger to renewable generation. They are already home to 237 MW of solar installations and more than 2200 wind turbines in 38 wind farms across 11 counties with 4800 MW of generating capacity according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The Eastern Plains have some of the best natural wind resources in the county according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and in 2020 wind turbines produced 23% of Colorado’s electricity.

But while those facilities were built over the last 18 years Power Pathway and Xcel’s $8 billion Clean Energy Plan envisions adding almost as much capacity in the next five or six years.

“The Power Pathway Project is virtually unprecedented in scope and cost in Colorado history” the PUC said in its decision approving the project.

When the Rush Creek Wind Project the state’s largest wind farm was built in 2018 — across 95000 acres in Lincoln Kit Carson Cheyenne and Elbert counties — a legion of construction workers trucks and heavy machinery flooded the region.

“We are a small rural county all of a sudden you have a thousand workers show-up” Jolly said. “There is no place to stay the hotels are full the RV parks are full some guys are commuting 70 miles from Colorado Springs. It really takes a toll on your emergency services the police and fire.”

In Limon a rented bedroom went for $1700 a month and local residents in Burlington for a fee were taking in workers’ wash because the laundromat was closed on Sunday a NREL impact study reported.

“It’s a big land rush. Everyone is jockeying to get into position. There is a lot of money on the table.” — R.J. Jolly a Cheyenne County commissioner and farmer who has signed a wind lease agreement with Enel

“It can be chaotic and feel messy but when you are done you have a new level of economic activity would wouldn’t have had without the boom” said Greg Brophy a former state senator Yuma County farmer and state director for The Western Way which bills itself as “conservative stewards of the Western environment.”

From 2000 to 2024 even without Power Pathway renewable energy industries will have spent an estimated $9.4 billion in construction and investment activity on the Eastern Plains and in 2024 — based on existing and approved facilities — wind farms will provide $15.2 million in lease payments to landowners and pay $23.1 million in property taxes according to a Western Way analysis.

What’s this mean for the 13 counties along the route?

Now to a lesser or greater degree the Rush Creek story may be repeated across the 13 counties Power Pathway will affect and county governments ranchers and farmers are bracing for change.

To understand the potential impacts — for plains residents and Xcel Energy customers as well — a journey along the Power Pathway’s route is revealing.

The project will be built in five segments. The precise route still isn’t set as Xcel Energy tries to trace the Power Pathway of least resistance among landowners and local governments.

Xcel Energy estimates it will have to negotiate with as many as 700 landowners and pay $123 million for land rights and related activities.

“We are working with landowners talking with counties … trying to find the route that is least impactful to the community” Hollie Velasquez Horvath Xcel’s regional vice president for state affairs and community relations.

The company does have “backstop authority” to take a right-of-way by eminent domain a power it has never used.

“Using a backstop isn’t creating a good partnership and creating a relationship for the future” Velasquez Horvath said. “We are going to be there for the long haul.”

The first leg of the line — Segment 1 — will run 75 miles from the Fort St. Vrain substation an existing link to the electric grid to the Pawnee substation in Morgan County. The county is already seeing solar power development as Denver-based Pivot Energy is building five solar arrays.

Morgan County has a moratorium set to expire in July on any new wind or solar projects while it updates ordinances. “We saw that our regulations were behind the times” said Jon Becker a Morgan County commissioner. “We didn’t deal with battery storage and we felt that was going to come with any renewable energy project.”

“We have some small-scale solar but we are expecting larger projects” he said “800 to 3000 acres wouldn’t be a surprise.”

Pivot Energy agrees. “Eastern Plains counties have ideal topography to support large-scale solar development” Jon Fitzpatrick Pivot senior vice president for project development said in an email. “The use of this land for solar is also economically favorable.”

A solar array in Brush run by Pivot and Xcel Energy became operational in early 2020. ( Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun via Report for America)

Solar is fine but Becker questions whether it will fill the bill. “It is a nice addition to the county but at the same time we have environmentalists running out the largest taxpayer in the county” he said. Xcel Energy’s plans call for closing part of the coal-fired Pawnee Generation Station and converting part to natural gas.

“Coal has been a great partner in this county” Becker said. “Solar and wind are nice but by no means do they pay the taxes or create the employment of a coal-fired power plant. Xcel says that operations may be similar but until we see it we are cautious.”

From the Pawnee substation Power Pathway swings east and south for 160 miles — in Segment 2 — through Washington Yuma Kit Carson and Cheyenne counties. Segment 2 is a key section for developing wind and solar projects and is slated to go into service in 2025.

In Washington County the line may run by the Harman Cattle Co. Harmans have lived on this land since 1904 and today five Harman families have farming and livestock operations on their 12000 acres.

“We are good farmers. We live off the land” Harman said. “People ought to pay attention to the land not royalties.”

The concern is that a forest of wind turbines — with their blinking red lights all night a warning for aircraft — will irrevocably alter a landscape of dappled prairie dotted with black cattle that sweeps to the horizon in every direction capped by a sky working the cool end of the color pallet in shades of baby blue to slate.

“Our open spaces do need to be preserved” Harman said. “The night sky is beautiful. That is something I’d miss.”

Harman’s wife Kim 53 tells the story of a night sky — thick with stars the Milky Way clear and vivid — that brought tears to the eyes of a Japanese 4-H exchange student.

In addition to the blinking lights and broken landscape there are concerns about noise from the turbine blades and “shadow flicker” that the turning blades can cast on nearby homes at certain times of the day.

Red flashing lights located atop each wind turbine are installed to alert pilots in the dark but can be seen as a nuisance contributing to light pollution. (Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun via Report for America)

Washington County imposed a moratorium on wind projects in 2020 while it worked on an ordinance which was adopted last fall. “We’ve the regulations in place to handle applications” Commissioner Kent Vance said. “We haven’t seen any projects yet … We’ve heard of leasing of land.”

Coal has been a great partner in this county. Solar and wind are nice but by no means do they pay the taxes or create the employment of a coal-fired power plant. — Jon Becker a Morgan County commissioner

Up the road from the Harmans Willeke is part of a group trying to organize farmers and other landowners to negotiate the Power Pathway right-of-way with Xcel Energy. This effort is based on a similar group negotiation three years ago when an oil pipeline project came through.

“The problem is they keep changing the route” Willeke said. He suspects the utility seeks the most compliant landowners.

“I am not against landowners putting a tower on their property or a transmission line I am more concerned about making sure the property owner is compensated” he said.

Race for credits

The haste to get everything done — the transmission lines the wind farms and solar arrays — is being fueled by the race to get the federal tax credits Willeke said. “The federal government created this.”

To get the credits — which are calculated based on the amount of electricity a wind farm or solar array generates — an installation has to be in operation by the end of 2025.

For 1000 MW of new wind resources the tax credit is worth $300 million and for 1000 MW of solar it comes to about $100 million according to an Xcel Energy PUC filing.

Xcel Energy is proposing 3900 MW of new wind and solar in its electric resource and clean energy plans now pending before the PUC. That adds up to a potential $850 million in federal credits.

And while the PUC has approved the Power Pathway project it still hasn’t ruled on Xcel Energy’s plans for new generation or its clean energy plan which aims to cut carbon emissions by 87% by 2030.

In its approval of Power Pathway the commission established a sliding scale of penalties and bonuses for cost overruns or coming in under budget as well as completing or not completing sections on time.

If Xcel Energy doesn’t complete Segments 2 and 3 — both key to a wind and solar built-out — by the end of 2025 it could face a $10 million penalty. The commission however rejected a proposal from the state Utility Consumer Advocate for a budget cap on the entire project.

Oil and gas landmen now are scouting wind solar

Meanwhile Power Pathway moves forward and the land rush is on for projects.

Yuma County cheek and jowl with Nebraska has been Colorado’s top corn producer but it also has been far off the wind and solar development radar. Not anymore.

“There are close to a half dozen companies obtaining leases that we are aware of” Andrea Calhoon the county administrator said in an email. “We are anticipating a fair amount of conversation over the next couple of years in response to the Power Pathway project.”

For Greg Hill 49 the lease offer by Engie first came in a packet in the mail. Then there was a follow-up with a company representative Dan Timmer who used to be a landman acquiring mineral rights for oil and gas operators.

The Hill family came to the region in the late 1800s and they own 15 eastern Yuma County quarter sections in conservation easements pasture dryland farming and irrigated farming. (The invention of center-pivot irrigation in Strasburg in 1948 was the last big innovation on the plains though it impacts only a fraction of land in Colorado.)

Hill leased every acre he could for wind turbines. “If global warming is real and it is we need to address it” he said. “I am a little nervous about having a giant company come in and do this but I will be excited to see those turbines go up.”

There is more than altruism at work. Engie estimated that each turbine would generate up to $14700 in annual royalties during the first 20 years of operation according to Hill’s leasing documents.

Engie confirmed that it is developing a project in Yuma County but declined further comment.

If global warming is real and it is we need to address it. I am a little nervous about having a giant company come in and do this but I will be excited to see those turbines go up. — Greg Hill 49

In Phillips County Yuma’s neighbor to the north National Renewable Solutions has put up meteorological towers as a prelude to a wind project that will also straddle Logan and Sedgewick counties according to Laura Schroetlin the Phillips County administrator-planner.

Minnetonka Minn.-based National Renewable Solutions part of the multinational investment corporation BlackRock Inc. did not reply to repeated telephone requests by the Sun for comment.

Both Phillips County and neighboring Logan County have moratoriums on wind and solar development while they work on new ordinances but Schroetlin said that the coming of renewable energy still seems far off. “We get more stirred up by confined feedlots” she said.

From Yuma County Power Pathway plunges south — through rolling prairie furrowed with arroyos and fringed with clusters of cottonwood trees gathered at dry gullies waiting for a drink — to Kit Carson County already home to five wind farms.

Segment 2 will end at a new Goose Creek substation in Cheyenne County where the next leg — Segment 3 — will run 65 miles south through Cheyenne and Kiowa counties.

Unlike the counties up north Kit Carson and Cheyenne have had years of experience with wind farms. Cheyenne is home to Xcel Energy’s 500-MW Cheyenne Ridge Wind Project and parts of Rush Creek. The county has had land use ordinances regulating wind farms for more than a decade and they have periodically been updated Jolly said.

“Some people are interested in having them [turbines] some aren’t” Jolly said. “We have a wind lease on our place and I have mixed emotions about it. It has a much bigger impact on the land than oil and gas.”

“But it is what it is you can’t lock the gate” Jolly said. “We’ll have to learn to live with it.”

Some Cheyenne and Kiowa county farmers have banded together and hired a lawyer to negotiate wind leases for them.

A group of about a dozen Cheyenne County farmers representing some 36000 acres got a uniform wind lease. “The feeling was if we got a big enough block together we could get these companies to pay a fairer rate” said Matt Campbell 42 who grew on his family farm in the county.

And as in Yuma County the group found itself dealing with former oil and gas landmen. “We call them lease hounds” Campbell said. A similar group of landowners has banded together negotiate leases in Kiowa County.

Kiowa County like Yuma has not yet seen any wind or solar development but at least half a dozen prospective developers have already stopped by the county building according to Tina Adamson the county administrator.

Perhaps the biggest dispute yet for Power Pathways came along Segment 3 in Kiowa County as the Sand Creek Memorial Foundation and the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes objected to one potential route they said would compromise the view at the memorial commemorating the 1864 massacre of 230 Cheyenne and Arapaho by Colorado volunteer soldiers.

They said the high-tension line would violate the spirit of legislation that called for preserving the original landscape.

Xcel Energy agreed to move the line 10 miles from the memorial but the idea of preserving a 10-mile viewshed buffer raised the dander of local farmers and landowners who felt they hadn’t gotten a say and were concerned that such a large buffer around the memorial would stifle development and take some landowners out of the wind farm game.

“It’s the way they went about it. Xcel wasn’t very transparent” said Burl Scherler 71 who raises winter wheat and sorghum and in good years corn and sunflowers on 20000 acres in Kiowa County — though due to the challenges of dryland farming rarely is all the acreage in cultivation.

“The governor wants renewable energy it has value to the country but the state has to realize we are out here and to treat us fairly” said Scherler who has farmed his land for 50 years. “We want to have a fair shake.”

Scherler said that it now looks that the Power Pathway will cut across 2 miles of his land. He has signed an agreement with Xcel Energy allowing it to do surveys and geological archaeological and biological studies. “We’ve got people sitting on the side of the road counting birds.”

One bird in particular — the lesser prairie-chicken — could end up being an even bigger challenge for Xcel Energy than the Sand Creek Memorial as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering listing the bird as an endangered species.

That designation would impact Segments 3 and 4. “Habitat conservation costs could be as high as $3.5 million per line mile and could increase total costs for these segments by up to $180 million” according to a PUC filing.

Sheridan Lake — home to 89 people a gas station and the Hawk’s Nest Convenience Store — is the lone town in the area and its Plainview Elementary School has 30 pupils. “Out here the key is to maintain critical mass” Scherler said. “If you don’t the next thing you know your kids have to go 50 miles to school or to Kansas.”

The coming of Power Pathway and all it promises could help maintain critical mass. “Thirty new jobs may not sound like much but to us it is huge” Scherler said.

Just west of Sheridan Lake Xcel Energy will build its new May Valley substation. The PUC also gave the utility conditional approval for an additional $250 million 90-mile spur running from May Valley to the Twin Butte’s area in Baca County home to some of the best wind and solar resources in the state — and the lesser prairie-chicken.

From May Valley the Power Pathway will head due west 140 miles in Segment 4 through Kiowa Lincoln Crowley and Pueblo counties.

Math on lease agreements pencils out. The map is a different matter.

No county has felt the impact of wind development more than Lincoln County. The first wind farm Cedar Point went up in 2011 followed by three more plus a section of the Rush Creek project.

The county is now home to 525 wind turbines and in 2021 the five wind farms paid $2.4 million in taxes to the county and area school districts according to county assessor records.

“Ag and cattle account for more than $25 million in sales so agriculture remains king” said Troy McCue executive director of the Lincoln County Economic Development Corp. “Still this has been a good way to diversify our economy.”

“It has not been difficult to integrate wind economically” McCue said. “The wind blows so hard on the Eastern Plains it is good now that someone is getting some use out of that.”

Segment 4 ends at the Xcel Energy’s Tundra substation just northeast of Pueblo. Power Pathway turns north here for the last leg of its journey — Segment 5 — 120 miles through Pueblo El Paso Elbert and Arapahoe counties ending at the Harvest Mile substation outside of Aurora.

One route that was in play ran right next to the Book family’s calving barn — the heart of the cow and calf operation the family runs. The Books were not happy.

“It would have been a tremendous disturbance and the line was only going to be a quarter of a mile from the house” Penny Book 73 said.

Jesse Book a grandfather of her husband Lansing purchased the land near the El Paso County crossroads community of Rush for taxes in the early 1930s. The operation now covers 5000 acres.

The homestead house — renovated — is now home to the Books’ son Robert 46 and his wife and two children the fifth generation on the land.

Book Land & Cattle is now owned by Robert who splits his time between a job as a financial adviser in Colorado Springs and running with his parents’ help the family cow-calf operation.

In its ongoing jockeying to find the right route Xcel Energy has moved the proposed line about 3 miles from the Book ranch. Still Penny Book worries about “what comes next — the wind farms.”

“People think there is a lot of nothing out here but that’s what I love” she said.

Some 28 miles north of the Books Andrew Kochis a Czech immigrant had taken advantage of the 1909 Enlarge Homestead Act and in 1916 moved to a 320-acre plot near Matheson.

Today Kochis Farms covers 10000 acres and is home to corn and wheat fields 200 head of beef cattle and 30 Rush Creek wind turbines as well as an Xcel Energy substation and Jan Kochis is fine with it all.

“There is no problem farming around the turbines” Kochis said. “The cows like to go right up the base for the shade.”

“In some of our fields we have some pretty nice roads now” she said “When they built the roads they compensated us for taking land out of production same for land taken out of production during construction.”

And then there are the royalties from their lawyer-negotiated lease agreement. The Kochis family gets an annual payment on their fraction of the overall Rush Creek Project that comes to $6000 to $8000 for each turbine.

“You’ve got no expenses and the money is really nice when you’ve had a dry year” she said.

What about the blinking red lights at night? “I don’t look” Kochis said. And the noise of the blades? “You walk out on a quiet morning and hear this calming swish swish swish.”

Moving north the Power Pathway begins to meet exurban development pushing east from Colorado Springs Castle Rock and Parker. “Due to its proximity to growing municipal areas in the state … Segment 5 presents routing challenges not common in other segments” the utility said in a PUC filing.

One of those challenges is the Elbert County Environmental Alliance a recently formed homeowners’ group seeking to simultaneously protect the environment and property values — especially in the Bijoux Basin.

“The lines would run right through the basin which is pristine and rich in wildfire life” said Robert Poletiek an alliance board member and 26-year resident of the area.

Elbert County residents look at maps of Xcel Energy’s proposed transmission line routes for Segment 5 of Colorado’s Power Pathway on May 5 during an expo in Simla. (Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun via Report for America)

The depression in the plains offered shelter not only to nesting eagles but to Comanche tribes Poletiek said. “Keep your eyes down and you still find imprints of tipi circles and arrowheads.”

This is where the Eastern Plains sprawling ranches begin to break-up. First into 60-acre parcels like the one upon which Poletiek lives and then moving closer to Interstate 25 into suburban subdivisions.

“It isn’t only the line it’s the knock-on effect of all the development the wind and solar” Poletiek said. Enel Green Power is already developing the Bijou Hills Wind Project on 20000 acres east of the basin.

Alliance members have shown-up at Xcel Energy’s open houses placards in hand and spoken at every Elbert County Commission meeting.

“We’ve gotten a good reception at the commission and from Xcel” Poletiek said. Xcel representatives he said have indicated that they may consider a path to the east of the basin.

“Segment 5 was always going to be the hardest” Poletiek said but without it the complete circuit — which enables electricity to be sent in either direction and helps ensure reliability —cannot be closed.

“We realize Segment 5 has to be built somewhere” Poletiek said.

Colorado isn’t alone in pressing for building more transmission and renewable generation. Among the projects under development in the West are SunZia Southwest Transmission covering 520 miles between Arizona and New Mexico Greenlink West running 423 miles through Nevada and the Cross-Tie Transmission project a 214-mile line between Nevada and Utah.

Building transmission is often controversial. A proposed 145-mile line to bring hydropower to Massachusetts from Quebec was blocked by voters in Maine and the Missouri legislature in response to the Grain Belt Express — a 800-mile line designed to bring Kansas wind power to Illinois and Indiana — passed a bill giving counties and landowners a stronger hand dealing with the developer.

“Building transmission is extremely difficult” Gavan the PUC commissioner said. “You only have to look across the country at other failed projects that have inhibited other jurisdictions from hitting their targets to see how risky it is.”

One key advantage Colorado has is “being able to go it alone” said Charles Teplin a manager in the electricity practice at consultant RMI.

“We have wonderful resources of wind and solar” Teplin said. “The folks on the Eastern Plains can benefit from the economics of exporting what they have and the urban core benefits with clean energy. We don’t have to go through another state we don’t have to deal with another jurisdiction.”

William Huber the girls’ father filed the lawsuit claiming staff at Ski Granby Ranch knew the lift was unsafe before the Dec. 29 2016 accident that killed Kelly Huber 40 of San Antonio and severely injured her daughters then 9 and 12.

The lift malfunctioned and the chair the Hubers were riding in hit a support tower at the resort about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Denver causing the family to fall about 30 feet (9 meters) onto hard-packed snow.

The family declined to comment on the settlement but offered a statement through their attorney that said they are “pleased with the outcome and anxious to move on with their lives” The Colorado Sun reported Friday. A resort spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a text and an email seeking comment Friday.

The amount of the settlement has not been disclosed.

A state investigation found problems with the drive system that powered the chairlift which resulted in rapid speed changes. Changes to the lift’s power system by the resort and an electrical contractor caused the lift to suddenly speed up which flung the chairlift into the tower.

The lawsuit was filed against the ski resort and the contractor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMTkvYWlyLWNvbmRpdGlvbmluZy1kZW52ZXIv0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVudmVycG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8xOS9haXItY29uZGl0aW9uaW5nLWRlbnZlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Denver now “so darn hot” is air conditioning going from nice perk to absolute necessity?,With Denver now “so darn hot” is air conditioning going from nice perk to absolute necessity?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdG9yaW5sZWFmLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzE5L3Rvcm9udG8tbWFwbGUtbGVhZnMtZHJhZnQtYnVzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 5 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL Entry Draft Busts of All-Time,

In case you weren't already aware fast food is simply not the greatest for your overall health especially if you eat it often. And yet many Americans do—because it's fast cheap easy and delicious. But the truth is fast food today is far worse for customers than it was back in the 1980s thanks to the fact that portion sizes are way bigger. And that's just the start of it…

Here are the biggest facts about fast food that will really give you something to chew on before heading to the drive-thru again. Once you've learned the fast-food industry's secrets there's a good chance you'll never look at a to-go bag of burgers and fries the same way again. And next don't miss the 8 Fast-Food Burgers to Stay Away From Right Now.

It can affect your mood.

Strange but true: Even if you generally eat a healthy diet consuming fast food can increase your risk for depression according to a Public Health Nutrition study of nearly 9000 participants. In fact those who eat greasy burgers hot dogs and fries are 51% more likely to develop depression that those who don't indulge.

Thankfully for those who only hit up the drive-thru once in awhile the researchers observed a dose-response relationship between the blues and the burgers. ""The more fast food you consume the greater the risk of depression"" explains Almudena Sánchez-Villegas lead author of the study. The takeaway here: Try to limit your fast food habit to once or twice per month at the very most.

Most of us have no idea how caloric it is.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School asked 1877 adults 330 school-age children and 1178 adolescents dining at Burger King Subway Wendy's KFC Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's how caloric they thought their meals were. Compared with the actual figures participants underestimated their meal's calorie content by 175 calories 259 calories and 175 calories respectively.

If the calorie information is printed on the menu give it a peek and look for something with 500 calories or less.

Just living near it can make you heavier.

Having a fast food restaurant within 0.10 miles of a school increases the probability of obesity among students by 5.2% according to a joint study conducted by Columbia University and the University of California Berkeley.

For pregnant women having a restaurant within 0.50 miles increases the probability of gaining over 44 pounds during pregnancy by 2.5%. (Experts typically recommend that women with a healthy BMI gain no more than 25 to 35 pounds after becoming pregnant.)

To combat this keep healthy grab-and-go snacks in your car or bag. If you're prepared with your own healthy fare you'll be less apt to give in to temptation when your tummy starts to rumble. These 25 Eat This!-Approved Snacks are all solid options.

It wasn't a thing until the 1920s.

Until the early 1920's burgers were typically thought of as fare reserved for fairs circuses and lunch carts; a low-quality meal made from slaughterhouse scraps and nearly spoiled meat. But Walter Anderson and Billy Ingram the creators of White Castle set out to change the public's perception when they opened their first location in Wichita Kansas. They set up the restaurant so that customers could see the food being prepared and painted the building white to evoke the perception of cleanliness.

Speaking of clean eating be sure to keep some of these 15 New Healthy Frozen Foods that Make Clean Eating a Breeze on hand so you're always prepared with healthy eats—even when you're short on time.

The healthy-sounding stuff isn't any better.

While there are some exceptions to the rule more often than not in fast-food land the healthy-sounding stuff is worse for you than the items that seem like they'd do the most damage. If you see oatmeal on the menu know it's likely packed with more sugar than you get in a bag of M&Ms. And speaking of the sweet stuff find out what it's doing to your body in our exclusive report What Happens to Your Body When You Eat Sugar.

Kentucky eats the most of it.

Kentucky may be called The Bluegrass State but maybe they should change their nickname to The Fast Food State. With more than four establishments per 10000 residents they have more greasy spoon joints than anywhere else in America! (Considering they are home to Papa John's International Inc. and Yum! Brands Incorporated the company that owns fast-food giants Taco Bell Pizza Hut and KFC we can't say we're totally shocked.)

Consequently Kentucky also has the twelfth highest adult obesity rate in the nation according to the non-profit organization Trust for America's Health. A few possible reasons why there's a connection: Not only is it harder to resist temptation when there's fast food all around it also drives down the cost making it even more accessible and attractive say researchers.

8 Sandwich Chains That Use the Highest Quality Ingredients

Some of it has Silly Putty in it.

What do Ronald's McNuggets and Filet-O-Fish have in common with Chick-fil-A's Spicy Chicken Sandwich Deluxe? They are made with dimethylpolysiloxane a type of silicone used in cosmetics aquarium sealant and you guessed it Silly Putty. Uh yum? It doesn't pose any major health risks but it's a bit unsettling nonetheless.

It's not cheap.

Contrary to conventional thought eating dinner at a fast food chain isn't cheap. In fact it costs about $30 for a family of four to have dinner at their local McDonald's! On the flip side for just $12 you could easily buy a pound of millet ($1.99) a pound of ground turkey ($5.99) and a bag or two of frozen veggies ($2.00-$4.00) and cook up a big bowl of yum and nutrition.

Chicken nuggets may not be the part of the chicken you expect.

In 2013 researchers published a study in The American Journal of Medicine looking at the age-old question are chicken nuggets really chicken? The short answer is yes but they found that nuggets contain very little meat and are mostly the birds' bones fat and tendons.

McDonald's Is Being Sued in the Ongoing Soft Serve Drama

The flame-grilled flavor is fake.

Have you ever wondered how your favorite burgers and chicken sandwiches get that fresh-off-the-fire taste even though they're frozen and cooked indoors? We have. And as it turns out that smokey flavor isn't legit. (Are you really shocked though?) When a fast food item contains something called ""natural smoke flavor"" it likely was created by Red Arrow Products Company a commercial flavor firm. To create the flavor the company burns wood captures the flavor of the smoke in water bottles it and sells it to places like Burger King and Wendy's. We bet that burger seems a little less appetizing now right?

They serve nutritionist-approved meals.

""Not only do I eat guilt-free at McDonald's I think they get a bad rap all too often"" says Christine M. Palumbo a Chicago-area registered dietitian and nutrition communications consultant. Other diet experts concur. We've sat down with countless experts and asked them when they order at places like Burger King Mickey D's Panera Wendy's and Starbucks and they never come up short. It's all about navigating the menus with some knowledge on your side.

They decorate to make you crave.

Have you noticed that a lot of fast food chains use the same colors on their logos and inside their restaurants? That's no coincidence. Pizza Hut In-N-Out Burger Wendy's McDonald's and Burger King—just to name a few—all use yellow and red in their logos. These hues have been proven to grab consumers' attention stimulate appetite increase the speed in which we eat and make us crave all things convenience—including fast food say University of Rochester scholars.

To keep your appetite in check order from the drive-thru window and enjoy your food at home. Nowhere near your house? If the weather is nice eat outside the restaurant at a picnic table or take your meal to a nearby park.

They use words against you.

Have you ever gotten into a fast food line with every intention of ordering a salad but then find yourself asking for a greasy combo meal instead? You are not alone. Food marketers design the menu with descriptive terms like ""hot n' juicy"" to get you to crave those for addictive menu items and it works.

Customers are 27% more likely to order an item if it's described with yummy-sounding adjectives say Cornell University researchers.

The Worst Fast Food Sauces

It can melt.

Chicken McNuggets are constantly under fire in the media whether it's because of pink slime claims having more than 40 ingredients or because they uh melt? Former McDonald's employee and Reddit user DFunkatron explained ""I accidentally left a whole bag of about 100 chicken nuggets out on a counter for way too long. They melted. Into a pool of liquid.""

Wondering why? It could be because the finely-ground chicken meat is combined with a water-based marinade of sodium phosphates food starches dextrose citric acid autolyzed yeast extract (i.e. appetite-increasing MSG) and natural flavoring just to keep it bound together. No wonder pre-fry defrosted nuggets melt—other than chicken they're mostly made up of additive water.

The kids' meals are weight-loss friendly.

The Happy Meal isn't just for kids anymore. According to a research team of scientists from the Universities of Arizona and of Southern California when a small incentive is offered with a meal as is the case with just about every fast food kids meal people are motivated to limit their portion size. As it turns out the combination of a half-sized portion and a non-food gift stimulates the same part of the brain—the area responsible for reward desire and motivation—as the full-sized portion alone.

The study also discovered that regardless of hunger most people will choose a half-sized portion of food if it's paired with a toy or monetary prize rather than a full-sized portion at the same price. Even though they ate less people who chose the incentive option tended not to compensate for the reduced portion by eating more calories later in the day. So if you're looking to shed some pounds opt for the Happy Meal—and hey you get to have a new toy!

McDonald's Is Making This Big Change to Happy Meals

Even the salads have chemicals.

These days many fast-food chains offer salads. And if solely look at things like calories fat and sodium they're usually a step in the right direction. But when it comes to the quality of the ingredients in the salad they're not much better than the stuff that's infused with silly putty. Many chains dust their salads with propylene glycol a chemical that helps keep lettuce leaves crisp. It's considered safe for consumption—but it's also be found in antifreeze and sexual lubricants. In our eyes that's the opposite of appetizing and wholesome.

""Medium"" is actually a large.

Duke University researchers discovered that chains often encourage customers to buy larger sodas by increasing the number of ounces in all their sodas. That's because people subconsciously pick the middle option so the larger the ""medium"" the more they can charge for it—those sneaky devils! Consider this just one more reason to stick to water and avoid the chemical-spiked sugar water altogether.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The fountain drinks are dirtier than a toilet.

Ice machines are notoriously difficult to clean making them veritable petri dishes. In an award-winning science project 12-year-old Floridian Jasmine Roberts compared the bacterial content in ice water and toilet water from fast-food restaurants.

It was found that 70 percent of the time ice from fast-food restaurants was dirtier than the toilet water. In several cases the ice tested positive for E. coli bacteria which comes from human waste. Appetite ruined.

12 Controversial Secrets of Restaurant Chains

The coffee may make you depressed.

Styrofoam cups the kind many food places use to serve up your morning latte can leach styrene. If that sounds scary that's because it is. The neurotoxin can cause depression and a loss of concentration. Highly acidic or hot beverages—in other words coffee—draw the plastic compound out more effectively than say cold water would.

It doesn't go bad…

In 2010 New York photographer Sally Davies put a McDonald's hamburger and fries in a jar. Five months later the food still looked edible while KFC fries bought and stored on the same day were white and furry with mold.

Marion Nestle chair of NYU's food studies program told Salon that McDonald's would have to use ""a lot of sodium propionate to prevent bacterial or mold growth."" Davies continues to take photos of the same meal and post them on her website; as of July 2015 it has not noticeably disintegrated.

Even as Sri Lanka struggles with its worst financial crisis ever and faces acute shortage of several key products including fuel Sapphire Foods a franchisee of Yum! Brands which operates KFC and Pizza Hut stores in the country is confident of revival.

“We spoke to a lot of young markets who have gone through similar situations at a country level. All of them come back and say double down on the business. It is a great opportunity to actually build a very strong competitive position. Our execution advantages are playing out in this market” Sanjay Purohit Group CEO Sapphire Foods said in a conversation with Anuradha Sengupta in an episode on the ‘Life After Listing’ show.

“I was speaking to the Sri Lankan team yesterday. And they are hopeful of things stabilising over the next four six months” he added.

Meanwhile Purohit said given that the country has a large expat population in the Gulf countries the crisis has led to huge remittances from these nations.

According to Purohit this has led to a lot of money in consumers’ hands and there is also willingness to spend. “People cannot cook at home as there is no gas no fuel. So they eat out” he added.

Although the company has reduced its hours of operations it still has to make a lot of efforts to keep the stores open. For instance one of its employees is always at the fuel pump to get diesel to run its stores in the wake of power cuts.

“Unless there is a curfew we are operating our stores” Purohit added.

The company will also continue to expand its stores in the country. Currently it operates 95 outlets in the island nation and plans to launch 95 more stores in the next three-four years.

InkFreeNews

WARSAW — Rock and roll made a triumphant return to Central Park Warsaw to the delight of thousands of fans who attended the annual Rockin’ For Riley concert Friday night June 17.

Jefferson Starship whose roots date back to the 1960s psychedelic age of the rock era had been scheduled to perform in Warsaw two years ago but waited for COVID-19 to pass before taking the stage with a newly released album.

While the band gave the crowd a sampling of the new stuff they relied heavily on classic tunes from four decades including “Count On Me” “Jane” “Sara” and “We Built This City On Rock and Roll.”

Starship began in the 1960s as Jefferson Airplane and saw numerous changes over the years. While three key figures – Paul Kantner Grace Slick and Martin Balin – are no longer with the group the band includes two members (singer David Freiberg and drummer Donny Baldwin) whose roles date back several decades. Cathy Richardson who handles much of the singing has been with the band for about 15 years.

Roanoke a band from Tennessee was the opening act.

Sponsors for the show include Zimmer Biomet WRSW 107.3 and Medtronic.

The show was organized by Warsaw’s Parks and Recreation Department.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(WIBW) - Animals at Sunset Zoo in Manhattan are starting to get up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines thanks to the help of K-State Veterinary students.

In the spring of 2022 Kansas State University says its zoo veterinarians and staff from the Sunset Zoo partnered to vaccinate many of the zoo’s animals against COVID-19.

Sara Gardhouse assistant professor of exotic pet wildlife and zoological medicine said the COVID-19 vaccine for zoo animals is different than the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for humans.

“The vaccine we are using is produced by Zoetis” said Gardhouse who is also a clinician in the Veterinary Health Center at K-State. “Zoetis has donated over 15000 doses of this USDA authorized experimental vaccine to ensure protection of the animals in our zoos conservation centers academic centers and government organizations.”

Gardhouse also said that while the vaccine differs in some ways - it still has a lot of similarities to the human vaccine.

“The antigen or virus in the vaccine is the same as in the human vaccines but the adjuvant or the ingredient used to promote a better immune response is different” Gardhouse said. “This allows the vaccine to be safe for use in animal species. The Zoetis vaccine requires an initial dose followed by a booster in three weeks.”

K-State noted that all Sunset Zoo animals which require protection have received at least their first dose of the vaccine.

“We are in the process of administering all of their boosters now” Gardhouse said. “The Sunset Zoo has focused on vaccinating animals known to be susceptible to the virus and in which species-positive cases have been reported. This includes a large number of the mammals and primates that the zoo has.”

The University said Sunset Zoo is home to more than 150 animals - including hyenas cheetahs flamingos and an array of primates.

Gardhouse indicated that there have been outbreaks in primates mustelids - members of the weasel family like otters and ferrets - and many felidae - cats - species in other zoos and facilities.

“The administration of vaccines to zoo animals is slightly different than administration of vaccines to humans” Gardhouse said. “For many of the animals at the Sunset Zoo the keepers have worked hard to have them trained to receive injections.”

As of June 17 K-State said Sunset Zoo has not seen any side effects of the vaccine in the animals.

“We are all thrilled that our animals are going to be protected just like the humans that work with them” Gardhouse said.

“Sunset Zoo is grateful for the dedicated staff and leadership of the Veterinarian Health Center at Kansas State University that help give our animals excellent care including these very important vaccines for the wellbeing of our animals” said Scott Shoemaker zoo director.
