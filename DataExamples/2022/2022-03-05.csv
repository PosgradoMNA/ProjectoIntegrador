According to the publication Michaela's first accounts for her company Falkna Ltd show she paid £766593 to creditors last year.

But that left her with net assets of over £2.6million according to records filed last week at Companies House seen by the newspaper.

She said afterwards of the streaming giant's reaction: 'There was just silence on the phone.

'It's not how we do things here. Nobody does that it's not a big deal'. I said 'If it's not a big deal then I'd really like to have 5% of my rights'.'

Michaela rose to stardom after growing up on a council estate in London with her sister and mother.

The star won the award for Outstanding Writing for I May Destroy You at the Emmys last September.

Michaela who both created the series and plays the lead character Arabella delivered a poignant acceptance speech on stage while dedicating the award to sexual assault survivors.

She is a sexual assault survivor herself with her experiences serving as the basis of her show I May Destroy You.

'Write the tale that scares you that makes you feel uncertain that isn’t comfortable. I dare you' she began.

'In a world that entices us to browse through the lives of others to help us better determine how we feel about ourselves and to in turn feel the need to be constantly visible for visibility these days seems to somehow equate to success — do not be afraid to disappear from it from us for a while and see what comes to you in the silence' she added.

Lady Gabriella Windsor looked stunning on her wedding day to Thomas Kingston back in 2019. Gabriella who is the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent married Thomas Kingston today at Windsor Castle. The bride looked stunning as she arrived for the ceremony wearing a gown by Luisa Beccaria with an elaborate veil.

As Gabriella stepped out at the chapel fans got the very first glimpse at her royal wedding tiara. Gabriella chose a Russian fringe style diamond tiara often called the Kent City of London Fringe tiara to complete her wedding day look. This tiara has a special connection for Gabriella. But what was it? Gabriella’s wedding tiara was also worn by her mother Princess Michael of Kent and her grandmother Princess Marina Duchess of Kent on their wedding days.

Princess Michael's wedding was held on June 30 1978 and the Princess who is also known as Marie Christine wore the tiara to a ball that was held after her wedding ceremony rather than to the entire affair. The Kent City of London Fringe tiara was originally given to Marie Christine's mother-in-law Princess Marina Duchess of Kent by the city of London on her wedding day in 1934. Eventually Marina's son Prince Michael inherited the tiara when she died in 1968. Gabriella also could have worn the Kent Pearl Festoon Tiara another favourite design of her mother's.

Jesse Lingard victim of £100k burglary forcing him to put £3m mansion up for sale

Jesse Lingard is in the process of leaving his £3million mansion after becoming the latest Manchester United star to fall victim to an “away day” burglary.

The Sun report that the England international was targeted during United’s 2-2 draw with Aston Villa on January 15.

Lingard was a late sub for the Red Devils coming on for the final two minutes of the rollercoaster clash in the west Midlands.

However while the match was ongoing it is claimed that thieves entered his home and stole more than £100000 worth of clothes and jewellery from his home in Greater Manchester.

It is claimed that the gang escaped with the goods before security was alerted.

Lingard is believed to have placed his property on the market in the aftermath of the incident and has already accepted an offer to sell.

During lockdown in 2020 Lingard offered fans a glimpse into his home as part of the MTV show Cribs showing his swimming pool home cinema and England caps proudly on display.

A source told the Sun that he was “really upset to have been targeted” and while the items stolen are replaceable “it’s very invasive to have someone break into his home especially as he is a father” to a young daughter.

United are understood to be reviewing players’ current security arrangements and offering additional support following a worrying trend of break-ins.

Back in January Lingard’s team-mate Victor Lindelof was victim to a similar crime with his wife and two children forced to lock themselves away in a terrifying ordeal.

This incident occurred during United’s win over Brentford with his wife Maja and their two children Ted Louie and Francis in the home at the time.

Thankfully all were unharmed but Maja has since opened up on the distressing moment intruders made their way into the house.

""I do not remember how but I ran up and got all three of us into a room"" she explained to Elle.

""Physically I do not know how I managed to lift a heavy sleeping Ted Louie while I carried a fragile Francis in my arms but it worked.

""I got both the children and myself into a room I locked the door and held up the handle. I remember the feeling of being hunted.

""After what felt like an eternity we were given the go-ahead to leave the room and we were met by so many police officers guards and the team from United.

""When I stepped out with the children on my hips and saw the three policemen standing outside the room I just totally broke down. I was shaking all over and I could not control my emotions at all.”

Under the terms of the agreement AbbVie will pay Syndesi shareholders a $130m upfront payment with the potential for shareholders to receive additional contingent payments of up to $870m based on the achievement of certain predetermined milestones.

Syndesi will help to expand AbbVie’s neuroscience portfolio. This acquisition gives AbbVie access to Syndesi’s portfolio of novel modulators of the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) including its lead molecule SDI-118. The mechanism is currently being evaluated for the potential treatment of cognitive impairment and other symptoms associated with a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive disorder.

The lead molecule SDI-118 is a small molecule currently in Phase 1b studies which is being evaluated to target nerve terminals to enhance synaptic efficiency. Synaptic dysfunction is believed to underlie the cognitive impairment seen in multiple neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

Founded in December 2017 and led by Jonathan Savidge chief executive officer Syndesi Therapeutics was created through a partnership between UCB Biopharma SRL and a syndicate of Belgian and international investors to further develop novel SV2A modulators that had been originally discovered by UCB. Syndesi’s Series A financing was co-led by Novo Holdings together with Fountain Healthcare Partners with participation from Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JJDC Inc. SRIW (Société Régionale d’Investissement de Wallonie) V-Bio Ventures and Vives Fund along with UCB Ventures. The company has also benefited from support from the Walloon Region.

The lead molecule SDI-118 was discovered by UCB before being out-licensed to Syndesi as of 2018.

WPP the world’s largest advertising holding company will be discontinuing all business activities in Russia as will consultancy Accenture writes LBB’s Addison Capper.

In a note sent to all WPP employees CEO Mark Read said that the company had over the last week been carefully considering the future of its agencies in Russia and what its actions would mean for its nearly 1400 people there. “We have concluded that to continue operating in Russia would be inconsistent with our values as a company” he says. “This means that over the next few weeks and months we will discontinue our activities in the country.

“Our Russian colleagues have been dedicated and valued members of the WPP family for a long time and I deeply regret the impact this decision will have on them.”

The note continues to say that WPP will work with its people clients and partners to “consider all options” including transfer of ownership and divestment and that it will provide additional and enhanced financial support to anyone who loses their employment as a result of this decision. Local agency leaders are said to be discussing next steps with their teams directly.

“The world has watched the invasion of Ukraine with growing horror and disbelief” he says. “WPP stands with Ukraine and the international community in condemning this unjustifiable aggression which has created a humanitarian crisis in the heart of Europe.”

A press release from WPP added that WPP’s 200 people in Ukraine “have shown extraordinary resilience and bravery in the face of the horrific attack on their country and we have been inspired by their example and the outpouring of support from their colleagues in the region and worldwide”. WPP is in constant contact with our leaders in Ukraine to provide financial and other forms of practical assistance for our employees.

The note from Mark Read ends with a thank you to the “thousands” who have already donated to a UNHCR appeal set up by WPP agency Blue State to help people forced to flee the fighting in Ukraine. WPP has been matching all donations from WPP employees and will continue to do so. The appeal remains open here: wpp.com/UNHCR-ukraine-WPP.

Meanwhile Accenture put out a release on Friday afternoon revealing that it too would be discontinuing its business in Russia. Accenture’s presence in Russia includes 2300 employees. While Accenture does not have a presence in Ukraine it does have Ukrainian employees around its network and has pledged to support them. The release says:

“Accenture stands with the people of Ukraine and the governments companies and individuals around the world calling for the immediate end to the unlawful and horrific attack on the people of Ukraine and their freedom. Therefore Accenture is discontinuing our business in Russia. We thank our nearly 2300 colleagues in Russia for their dedication and service to Accenture over the years. We will be providing support to our Russian colleagues. While Accenture does not have a business in Ukraine we will continue our efforts to help our Ukrainian colleagues working around the globe at Accenture and their extended families; we are providing telehealth for those in Ukraine and helping resettle family members who leave Ukraine.

“We are donating $5 million to nonprofit relief organizations working to help people in Ukraine and those who are being displaced into Poland Romania Slovakia Hungary and the Czech Republic. We are also matching 100% of the donations from our people.”

The writer is founder of Noon a platform for women in mid-life.

International Women’s Day falls this week bringing with it a deluge of events and initiatives. But in the furore over gender-balanced boards more female chief executives and talent pipelines many companies are ignoring a crucial piece of the diversity jigsaw — mid-life women.

The pandemic has hit the female talent leadership pipeline hard. Data from LinkedIn included in the Global Gender Pay Gap 2021 report from the World Economic Forum showed “a marked decline of women’s hiring into leadership roles” which it says dented progress across many industries by one or two years.

Likewise a report published last month by the FTSE Women Leaders Review highlighted the challenges of getting female professionals into leadership roles. “Two-thirds of below-board jobs so-called leadership roles are still going to men” says Denise Wilson chief executive of the review. “The appointment rate for women remains below a third which is disappointing and needs to improve if we are to see real change at the top.”

The problem is that if companies lose high-flying women in their forties and early fifties it shatters the talent pipeline for future female leaders — the average age of female board members in the UK is about 57 years old and this rises to 61 for women chairs according to a recent report by Deloitte. But some companies including NatWest Accenture and Greggs are waking up to the challenge and implementing the support and culture change needed to plug the gap.

“Diversity of thought and lived experiences are crucial to unlocking value and improving productivity” says Jennifer Romano a managing director at global consultancy Accenture. “The challenge is also to improve gender parity in leadership positions and support women through the pinch points of mid-life” she adds.

Those “pinch points” are many and varied — from bereavement divorce and illness to abusive relationships redundancy financial crises and many more. In fact a study of women aged 45-60 in the UK carried out by Noon found that more than half of women have experienced five or more adverse life events. And these can hit women particularly hard as they also tend to bear the brunt of caring responsibilities (for children and elderly relatives) and are affected by the menopause.

The study also reveals much broader factors at play around how mid-life women view success in their careers. For example only 5 per cent of respondents said they valued the “kudos” that came with their jobs. Some 81 per cent of respondents on the other hand cited work-life balance as an indicator of success in their working lives. More than half of women (55 per cent) said that “making a positive contribution to the company I work for” was important and 52 per cent noted how valued their company made them feel as an essential factor.

Other factors can also affect the numbers of talented female professionals who are falling out of corporations. I have spoken to many women who feel that gendered ageism puts them at the top of the list for redundancy while others want a more “plural” career taking on roles such as non-executive directors (NEDs). Some also fancy running their own company — one survey showed that half of small businesses in the US are owned by people over the age of 55.

“The key to retention of mid-life women is support coaching intervention and making sure they are supported by managers who understand their issues” says Liz Burton director of diversity equity and inclusion at NatWest the bank. “We are right there with our more senior women; we agree that mid-life is not the end of the road. This is where [a] huge opportunity lies to pull through more female chief executives and we know that we need to support women at that stage and to help them to succeed so they pull through — as our CEO Alison Rose did — to board level.”

Since Rose was appointed to lead NatWest in 2019 she has ensured that high-potential female professionals get visibility across the executive committee and main board says Burton. NatWest’s board is 30 per cent female with women in the chief finance marketing people and governance roles she adds. Women are also made “board ready” by serving on boards in different areas of the group. For instance Wendy Redshaw chief digital information officer for retail banking at NatWest was recently appointed as a NED in part of Royal Bank of Scotland.

“We have seen a recent trend of senior female directors ‘going plural’ and taking on NED roles earlier in their early forties in some cases” says Sarah North head of talent at NatWest. “Clearly this reduces the pool of top females to take on the top executive roles — female risk directors for instance are particularly in demand as NEDs.”

It’s not a case of teaching women to be successful in a male environment. A a company must shift its culture to ensure everyone of all backgrounds can thrive

Experience is key to evaluating risk and mid-life women have plenty of hard-won wisdom. Many joined the workforce in the 1990s recession and have lived through 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis. They also bring deep wells of personal insight about diversity: many were the only woman in the room and have struggled with work-life balance — and can bring all that to play when mentoring teams and juniors.

It is not just in banking and consultancy that companies are realising the importance of keeping senior women in the pipeline. “We are proud that 50 per cent of management positions at Greggs are occupied by women and are working hard to replicate this split across the most senior levels” says Emma Walton the UK bakery chain’s chief people officer.

“Promoting flexible working and wellbeing has been particularly important to run alongside our women in leadership development programmes . . . We also introduced our menopause policy in 2021 to ensure women are supported to achieve their full potential.”

Such ideas are also taking root globally. Sannam S4 which provides professional services is 67 per cent female overall but its management is predominantly male according to chief executive Adrian Mutton. “We have instigated a programme of positive female leadership encouraging the women to challenge be more confident and progress into management positions” he says.

At Accenture tailoring support for mid-life women comes alongside a wider culture shift. “It’s about ensuring everyone feels seen and heard rather than defaulting to the loudest voice in the room; it’s not a case of teaching women to be successful in a male environment. A company must shift its culture to ensure everyone of all backgrounds can thrive” says Romano.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoaW5lLmNuL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uLzIyMDMwNjI3NzEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forbes reveals China's top 100 businesswomen - SHINE News,"Forbes China has unveiled its latest list of China's top 100 businesswomen with Cao Xiaochun top.

In late January several artists painted the Dana Adobe and it will be showcased along with the other artists' work from Santa Barbara San Luis Obispo and Monterey counties.

The Dana Adobe was one of the earliest adobe dwellings built in San Luis Obispo and its mission is to engage visitors with the stories of California's Rancho Era History by connecting them with the peoples land and resources to develop cultural understanding.

“It’s very important that we keep these buildings alive they hold so much history for these places they really were instrumental for developing families and partnerships and friendships to make everything boom on the Central Coast“ Dana Adobe and Cultural Center Executive Director Lexi Carreno said.

Regular Photoshop users will know how tough it can be to change a longstanding workflow and also how rewarding it can be to make effective use of newer features to save valuable time when editing.

In this video Jesús Ramirez at Photoshop Training Channel gives a great example of how to make effective use of the object selection and quick masks in Photoshop with clear guides on keyboard shortcuts and getting great results without requiring too many layers or unnecessary steps. The video is only 4:22 long and aimed at beginners to Photoshop but it covers a lot of useful information that you can apply to any other projects you may be working on.

Many creatives who spend a lot of time in Photoshop might consider this to be a fairly straightforward effect to create and there are plenty of different workflows you could use to create this same effect within Photoshop. As someone who has been using Photoshop since the late 90s and as a person who is quite resistant to change in general I often find myself doing things in a particular way simply because that's the way I've always done things. It would be an understatement to say that Photoshop has come a long way since version 6.0 and amazing new features are coming every year. Watching quick simple tutorials like this one helps to give me ideas on changes I might make to my workflow to make use of the advances in technology better than simply watching Adobe keynotes every year. I often think that some of the new AI features are gimmicky at present but the future of AI in image manipulation looks to be exciting.

Do you take advantage of Adobe Sensei artificial intelligence? Do features like sky replacement and hair selection work for you? Or do you find the technology isn't quite mature enough yet to be effective for your needs?

(@RailersHC/Twitter)

A game in the ECHL on Friday night featured a moment we haven’t seen in a professional hockey game in quite some time.

Early in the first period of a contest between the Reading Royals and the Worcester Railers goaltender Jimmy Poreda of the Railers made a decision to go out and attempt to play the puck on what would have been a breakaway for Anthony Gagnon. The play didn’t go how Poreda was expecting however as he was forced to dive to make contact with the puck and sent Gagnon flying as a result.

We may be down 3-0 after the first period but how about this save from Jimmy Poreda 😂😂😂#RailersHC pic.twitter.com/dClcQ7xvM7 — Worcester Railers HC (@RailersHC) March 5 2022

The play was eerily similar to an incident we saw back in 2007 when Detroit Red Wings goaltender Dominik Hasek came well out of his crease and sent forward Marian Gaborik flipping through the air. The only difference between the two plays was that Hasek was given a two-minute minor for tripping while Poreda wasn’t assessed a penalty.

Unfortunately for Poreda that was the only highlight of his night as he proceeded to give up five goals on just 24 shots as he and the Railers fell to the Royals by a score of 5-3. The end result of the game wasn't what he hoped for but at least this clip will live forever.

Yet its dividend growth rate is showing no signs of slowing down.

Despite numerous market corrections during my investing career I have been able to go about my life and not panic at the market's volatility. That's because my portfolio is made up of stocks that tend to hold up better than the broader market in periods of elevated stress.

A core holding in my portfolio that has made this possible is the supplemental insurer Aflac (AFL 1.83%). For example while the S&P 500 index has fallen 9% year to date on news of increasing inflation and economic turmoil related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine Aflac's stock has actually risen 5% so far in 2022. Despite Aflac's recent strong price performance the stock is still a buy for investors seeking stability in a market currently fraught with uncertainty.

Here are four reasons why Aflac is a good buy right now.

1. Aflac consistently outperforms analysts' expectations

When Aflac reported its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 2 for the period ending Dec. 31 the company exceeded the average analyst forecast for both revenue and non-GAAP (adjusted) diluted earnings per share (EPS).

Aflac recorded $5.43 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter which was an 8.1% year-over-year decline in revenue. But that total still managed to beat analysts' prediction of $5.24 billion in sales for the quarter. How did Aflac surpass the analyst revenue consensus for the seventh quarter out of the past 10?

Two key factors led to a year-over-year decline in revenue for Aflac in the fourth quarter.

First the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected revenue in both the U.S. and Japan (where it mainly operates). Total U.S. revenue still edged 0.1% higher to $1.6 billion during the quarter. A 1.3% decline in U.S. net earned premiums due to fewer face-to-face sales was more than offset by an 8.2% increase in adjusted net investment income for the quarter. In Aflac's Japan segment a 16.8% increase in adjusted net investment income wasn't enough to offset the 4.3% decline in net earned premiums (also due to limited face-to-face sales) recorded in Japanese yen in the fourth quarter. Total Japan revenue fell 8.5% year over year to $3.6 billion for the fourth quarter.

Second Aflac's revenue was negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency translations. That's because Aflac earns a significant portion of its revenue in Japanese yen and then converts those yen into U.S. dollars. And the average exchange rate worsened 8% in the fourth quarter to 113.70 yen-to-the-dollar from the year-ago period average exchange rate of 104.57.

While revenue was pressured in the fourth quarter Aflac's profitability held strong due to fewer claims resulting from the effects of the pandemic. As a result the company's adjusted diluted EPS surged 19.6% higher year over year to $1.28 for the fourth quarter. This narrowly topped the analyst consensus of $1.26 which marked the 20th consecutive quarter that Aflac was able to do so.

2. Interest rate hikes will provide a lift for the business

Aflac delivered a solid fourth quarter to its shareholders. And with the Federal Reserve set to raise interest rates this year Aflac will be a beneficiary since part of its $143 billion investment portfolio is invested in U.S. bonds. This will allow the company to purchase higher-yielding bonds and provide a lift to its investment income going forward.

3. Dividend growth has accelerated in recent years

Aflac has raised its dividend paid to shareholders annually for 39 consecutive years which makes the stock a well-established Dividend Aristocrat. For a stock with such a lengthy track record of upping its dividend a reasonable investor would expect dividend growth to be slowing down.

But Aflac's most recent 21.9% increase in its quarterly dividend per share to $0.40 per share per quarter was the largest percentage increase since its 20% dividend hike in 2008. Why was the board of directors confident enough to hand out a massive dividend bump to its shareholders? And can Aflac's inflation-beating dividend growth continue?

For one Aflac's dividend payout ratio in 2021 was only 22.2%. This gives the company room to work with in terms of dividend increases. Second analysts anticipate that Aflac's earnings will grow in the mid-single-digits annually over the next five years. Those two factors should allow healthy dividend growth to persist for the foreseeable future. Best of all that growth will come on top of a market-topping 2.6% dividend yield.

4. Aflac is trading at an appealing valuation

The final reason to consider buying Aflac is its valuation. Aflac's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10.9 is moderately lower than the insurance industry average of 12.4. Given its quality I believe Aflac deserves to trade at a slight premium to its peers.

Aflac also appears to be cheap based on the fact that its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.2 is below its 13-year median P/B ratio of 1.4. Since Aflac's fundamentals look to be robust it looks like a good buy for long-term investors.",,,,,,,,,,,,

by Ankur SrivastavaOils and fats are an important part of our diet because they contain essential nutrients. They are derived from plants animals and marine sources among others. Oils and fats play an important role in the preservation of food quality texture odor and taste. India's demand for edible oil has always outstripped domestic supply necessitating imports. Over the last five years India's oilseed production has increased by more than 44 percent from 25.3 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 36.6 million tonnes in 2020-21. Nonetheless this only covers half of India's edible oil demand. The Indian edible oil market is expected to reach $35.2 billion by 2025.Today adulteration in oils is a rising concern and potentially poses a grave risk to our wellbeing. Edible oil fraud usually involves misleading the purchaser as to the true nature substance or quality of the oil demanded. Due to cheaper costs and shortage in the Indian market there is an increase in the supply of adulterated mustard oil using adulterants such as rice bran oil and argemone oil. The principal ingredient of mustard oil is allyl isothiocyanate and is obtained from mustard seeds. Adulteration of natural mustard oil is also very cost-effective by the addition of artificial allyl isothiocyanate.The addition of refined palm olein a high-fat liquid component of palm oil groundnut oil coconut oil and sunflower oil is often reported. High-priced sesame and groundnut oils are often adulterated with palm oil. The adulterated oil could contain up to 70 % palm oil content. Fraudsters add super olein which costs ₹70 per litre and sell the adulterated groundnut oil for a price ranging from ₹240 to ₹280 per litre.Cooking oil is also adulterated with prohibited carcinogenic food colourants like metanil yellow which is a non-permitted food colour used extensively in India. According to the National Library of Medicine metanil yellow is not fit for human consumption.As per an animal study conducted in January 1993 by the journal Food Chemistry and Toxicology  there is a link between long-term consumption of metanil yellow and the levels of serotonin dopamine and noradrenaline that reduces the brain's ability to learn and grasp things.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India FSSAI ) recently conducted a nationwide survey on edible oils to assess oil safety quality and misbranding. The FSSAI reported that 2.42 percent of 4461 samples tested were non-compliant due to safety parameters such as aflatoxins pesticide residues and heavy metals above the regulatory levels (FSSR). The samples tested positive for hydrocyanic acid and failed to meet refractive index butyro Refractometer (BR) purity fatty acid profile iodine value and other standards.Following are a few of the regulations that have been imposed by various regulatory bodies in India for enhancing the quality and curbing adulteration of edible oils:Since the adulteration in oils is quite prevalent and highly concerning necessary steps must be taken to combat these growing challenges by monitoring the production process and validating the specification parameters of the finished product to ensure safety and compliance by using modern technology and practices. Advanced instruments and testing methods are now available to provide fast accurate and sensitive quality testing that can be used on a wide range of technology platforms.For the purpose of ease one can work with analytical vendors that provide a comprehensive portfolio and complete workflow solutions for testing fatty acids and oils analysis. The most common analytical methods rely on gas chromatographic analysis of free fatty acids or fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Direct analysis of triglycerides—as well as mono- and diglycerides—also provides insights into fat and oil characterization and can be paired with the analysis of cholesterol and other lipids. Further to test the oil samples for nutritional and fortification part various liquid and gas chromatographic based solutions are available for testing vitamins antioxidants mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids etc.Apart from government vigilance the rising consumption of branded oils has led to food companies in India looking for solutions for quality testing to eliminate adulteration and ensure the prescribed nutritional value in oils. With product choices increasing not just in stores but also digitally on online marketplaces it is imperative that all available resources are leveraged to monitor food adulteration and ensure the health and safety of the consumer.Ankur Srivastava- Country Marketing Manager- Agilent Technologies India",,,,,,,,,,,,

What inspired me was a bottle of Supernatural Wood + Floors cleaner. “Your floors are the root chakra of your home” says Suzy Batiz the inventor of Supernatural. Batiz’s chakra cleaner is pumped with some of the same essential oils used in aromatherapy (lavender basil rosemary fir) so I inhaled deeply and pretended I was at a spa. I was not just buffing away smudges and who knows what; I was according to Batiz “cleansing the foundational stability of your home and sanctuary.”

It’s the Little Things …

With enough style and intention everyday tedium can become a self-care ritual and even a mental-health hack. That’s what psychologists life coaches and Adam Grant have been preaching lately as an antidote to malaise. They advise us to focus on the little things that set up the day for success: make your bed clean your kitchen do your laundry they nudge sounding remarkably like our mothers.

I may not be flourishing but my floors certainly are.

In that spirit home-cleaning products are getting a glow-up taking inspiration from the land of makeup skin care and fine fragrance. Courteney Cox—with Nick Axelrod-Welk co-founder of Nécessaire the handsome body-care line and Sarah Jahnke who toiled in L’Oréal’s luxury-fragrance division—just introduced a collection of dish soaps counter cleaners and hand washes called Homecourt. (A room spray will be released in April.) Cox describes them as “beauty products for the home.”

The bottles are deep-green post-consumer recycled plastic; the formulas are tested by a dermatologist; and each product comes in one of four scents concocted by perfumers from Givaudan (known for Tom Ford Black Orchid) and Robertet (creators of various Bond No. 9 fragrances).

With enough style and intention everyday tedium can become a self-care ritual and even a mental-health hack.

I’ve never been tempted to spritz Lysol Basin Tub & Tile onto my pulse points but I’m having a hard time resisting the urge to bathe in Homecourt’s Neroli Leaf dish soap. (Confession: I couldn’t resist. This morning I used Homecourt’s dish soap as a shower gel and I now smell like a garden in Morocco.) “I wouldn’t use the surface spray as a face wash” says Cox. “But it won’t wreck your skin.” My skin survived the dish-soap shower remarkably unwrecked.

The founder of Murchison-Hume Max Kater was early to this movement when 15 years ago she started mixing her own plant-based cleaning products and decanting them into amber-colored apothecary bottles. “Cleaning products needed a makeover” says Kater echoing the words of cosmetics salespeople and the luminaries of HGTV.

These heroic new products elevate the cleaning experience beyond mere smudge removal.

“Once I realized that the lemon scent in products is fake I thought Why not make it smell like something you want to put on yourself?” says Kater. “The American market loves a big bloom and a big scent but the last thing I wanted was for someone to walk into a room and be hit over the head with fragrance. I wanted the products to have a lingering trail of scent.” It almost sounds poetic.

The Murchison-Hume cleaners—for bathrooms glass dishes and laundry—come in various bucolic fragrances including fig quince cedarwood mandarin and lemon myrtle. The designer Jenni Kayne collaborated on a dish soap that smells according to Kater like Ojai. Kayne sells it alongside her chunky sweaters and suede mules.

There’s a sense of cool to these products and a notable absence of the drudgery suggested by scrubbing bubbles “10x Cleaning Actions” or Windex blue.

Cleanliness and Godliness

The territory is ripe for entrepreneurs. Batiz whose success with Poo-Pourri an odor-masking toilet spray landed her on Forbes’s list of America’s richest self-made women in 2019 spent two years and close to $2 million exploring natural alternatives to traditional cleaning solutions for Supernatural. To illustrate the challenge Batiz relays the story of a fragrance supplier who proposed cherry and bubblegum scents for Poo-Pourri “the horrible pink gas-station-bathroom stuff” she says. “If you don’t push them to think differently then they won’t.”

Perhaps it goes without saying that Kris Jenner jumped into the game last year with a line of home-cleaning products in cheerful green plastic bottles called Safely. (And yes I’m proud that it’s taken me more than half the length of this story to include this fact.) Safely is sold at Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond yet in an interview with Adweek she called the products “luxurious.” “It’s the smell” she said. “It just feels like a very elegant product.”

The transformative power of fragrance propels these new products into the wellness category something that’s supported by actual science. In one study led by a Brigham Young University professor researchers found that the smell of a citrus-scented cleaner can actually increase virtuous behavior. In other words as the university summed up in a headline: “Cleanliness IS next to godliness.”

To explain the higher purpose of their dish soaps some of these founders turn to concepts from Buddhism mindfulness and self-help. “If you have to do it why not make cleaning more of an experience?” asks Cox. Batiz believes “If you invest in this cleaner the rewards are different than just having a clean house.”

Batiz Jenner and Cox all refer to housecleaning as “the new self-care” which may sound farcical but I get it. Over the past two-plus years of work (and everything else) from home our living rooms kitchens and bedrooms have become an extension of the self. Every Zoom meeting provided a view into our private sanctuaries. And between meetings we popped in our AirPods and scrubbed. “I’ve never spent more time cleaning a counter in my whole life” says Cox.



We have Martha Stewart our most glamorous home-ec teacher to thank for the fetishization and more importantly the monetization of housework. “I was serving a desire—not only mine but every homemaker’s desire to elevate that job of homemaker” she once said explaining her early motivation. “We all wanted … to pay somebody else to do everything that we didn’t think was really worthy of our attention. And all of a sudden I realized: it was terribly worthy of our attention.” And with that she turned glamorous home ec into a multi-million-dollar empire.

That’s the hope of these new home-cleaning entrepreneurs. Take a dreary business; remove the bad (toxins plastic harsh scents screamy labels tacky colors); add dermatologist-tested ingredients aromatherapy oils and sophisticated fragrances; pour them into sleek bottles with quirky fonts; and … voilà! Desire romance goodness serenity. As Batiz explains “When I walk through my house and smell that wood-floor cleaner everything in my being shifts.”

The plant oils smell like a lush forest and deliver the benefits of aromatherapy. Supernatural $25 Glass + Mirrors Cleaning Set With rosemary lime orange and lemon-peel essential oils this is “consciously crafted to elevate the reflection and clarity of our loving portals.” Comes with a lovingly reusable glass spray bottle.

They don’t plan to check in,"CNN —

Volodymyr Bondarenko spends most of his day holed up in his apartment in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

Between listening for air-raid sirens and frantically messaging family for updates he trades messages with a flurry of Airbnb guests booking his one-bedroom rental in the heart of Ukraine’s capital.

Sometimes he sends a crying emoji. Other times the praying hands emoji. It’s his way of thanking those who are booking his apartment – even though they have no intention of ever showing up at his door.

Airbnb hosts in Ukraine are being flooded with bookings from people all over the world who have no plans to visit. It’s part of a creative social media campaign to funnel money to besieged Ukrainians who need financial assistance as Russian forces bombard their country and cut off services.

The idea has picked up momentum. On March 2 and March 3 guests from around the world booked more than 61000 nights in Ukraine according to an Airbnb spokesperson. More than half of those nights were booked by Americans the spokesperson said.

CNN spoke to people in the United States the United Kingdom and Australia who’ve booked Ukrainian rentals on Airbnb in recent days.

“More than 10 bookings came in today. This was surprising it’s very supportive at the moment” Bondarenko 36 told CNN early Friday. “I told many of my relatives and friends that I plan to use this money to help our people who need it at this time.”

People are leaving messages of support for their Ukrainian hosts

The call for guests to book Airbnbs in Ukraine started online where supporters urged people to book rooms as close to a check-in date as possible to ensure hosts receive fees quickly. Airbnb typically issues a payout about 24 hours after a guest checks in.

Organizers of the campaign also are urging people to make sure the rentals are operated by individuals and not companies.

New York City resident Anne Margaret Daniel saw the Airbnb posts on social media and sprung into action.

The literature lecturer at the New School booked a two-night stay at an apartment in Old Kyiv a charming and historic neighborhood known for Orthodox churches and quirky animal sculptures. Photos on the Airbnb listing show immaculate wooden floors an overstuffed gray couch and a sloped skylight. The two-bedroom apartment is nearly fully booked for the next few months.

In her booking Daniel included a message for the host:

“I hope that you and your lovely apartment are safe and that this horrible war is over … and Ukraine is safe” it said. “I will come and see you one day please count on it and will stay with you when we visit. God bless you and God be with you your city your country.”

Her host Olga Zviryanskaya soon responded.

“We will be glad to see you in the peaceful city of Kyiv and hug” she said.

Zviryanskaya and her three children lived in the capital for years. After Russian forces invaded and threw the city into turmoil she packed her children and a few belongings in a car and fled to the region near Cherkasy a city in central Ukraine. The 100-mile trip took nine hours.

Now Zviryanskaya is allowing people who have no way out of Kyiv to stay in her apartment. Messages from strangers have provided comfort as she adjusts to the new reality.

“We are alive but we want to live as before” she said. “It’s very scary in Kyiv. Every word of support is valuable not necessarily money.”

Someday when the conflict is over Daniel hopes to book Zviryanskaya’s apartment again. This time she intends to visit.

‘You are my heroes’ one Ukrainian host says

Andre Osypchuk is a retired seaman and an Airbnb host in Kyiv.

He was surprised to see Brooklyn-based Valerie Zimmer – who was born in Kyiv and stayed at his rental three years ago while visiting family – recently booked his place for a week’s stay.

Osypchuk remains in the city with his wife and two kids. He has since set up an automated message to handle the influx of Airbnb requests.

“Thank you very much for your help which is so much needed now” it says. “I have been standing in line for food since the morning which I can now buy with the money you sent.”

Zimmer reached out to him directly to see how he was and offer help. She’s urged her friends to seek out similar Airbnb rentals across Ukraine.

“The money will get directly to the people and quickly” she said.

New York City resident Careyann Deyo 45 booked an Airbnb rental attached to someone’s home in Ukraine to make sure her payment reached a resident.

“I donated to larger organizations as well but felt this had a more immediate impact” Deyo says.

Deyo’s host sent her a message after finding out she was sending a payment even though she did not plan to check in.

“I’m crying. You are my heroes” it said.

Airbnb is waiving guest and host fees

Airbnb has said it is offering temporary housing in neighboring countries to up to 100000 Ukrainians who are fleeing their country because of the Russian invasion. It’s also waiving guest and host fees in the country.

“We are so humbled by the inspiring generosity of our community during this moment of crisis” said Haven Thorn a company spokesperson. He asked those willing to help by hosting Ukrainians or donating to their efforts to visit Airbnb’s website for more information.

Some people are warning that scammers could set up fake Airbnb accounts in Ukraine to capitalize on the world’s generosity. Those booking rentals are encouraged to examine the listing carefully and read reviews to make sure the host is legitimate and has been operating for some time.

One of the social media influencers behind the Airbnb effort also has encouraged his followers to patronize Ukrainian merchants on Etsy but ask sellers not to ship any goods. Etsy has announced it’s canceling the current balances and fees owed by all sellers in Ukraine.

Bondarenko the Airbnb host in Kyiv said while banks are closed in some cities and Airbnb payments may not reach hosts as fast as usual the financial assistance is comforting in a world filled with terror and uncertainty.

Equally important he and other hosts said are the words of support they hear from strangers a world away.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaHVzdGxlLmNvL21lZXQtdGhlLXdvbWFuLXdoby1idWlsZHMtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1tb3N0LXVuaXF1ZS1haXJibmJz0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVodXN0bGUuY28vbWVldC10aGUtd29tYW4td2hvLWJ1aWxkcy10aGUtd29ybGRzLW1vc3QtdW5pcXVlLWFpcmJuYnM_aHNfYW1wPXRydWU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the woman who builds the world’s most unique Airbnbs,"You may not know the name Kristie Wolfe. But if you’ve used Airbnb you’ve likely seen her properties.

Over the past decade Wolfe has built some of the most popular and unique vacation rentals on the platform including:

A jungle treehouse in Hawaii

A real-life hobbit hole in Washington

A converted fire lookout in the middle of a forest

A potato-shaped tiny home in Idaho

In Airbnb circles Wolfe is a legend — not just for her creative builds but for her ability to figure everything out herself often on an impossibly small budget. She constructs most of her properties from the ground up in off-grid locations with the helping hand of her 70-year-old mom.

Less than a decade ago Wolfe was making $13/hr working odd jobs. Today her properties gross hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.

How did a potato factory worker from Idaho become one of the most influential Airbnb proprietors in the world?

From factory work to tiny home living

Born and raised in the potato country of southeast Idaho Wolfe learned to be resourceful at a young age.

Her dad a high school teacher worked hard to support 5 children. But the family’s living quarters were tight — and her mom pulled out all the stops to maximize the little space they had.

“She was always trying to make these crummy little houses we could afford fit our big family” Wolfe tells The Hustle. “It was really interesting to watch how she’d figure things out. She didn’t have internet. There was no Home Depot in our town. She just tried things and learned on her own.”

Wolfe would sometimes come home from school to find fresh cement poured in the driveway or a wall completely knocked down.

As a kid she was often roped into remodeling projects: finishing a basement painting walls designing rooms.

Wolfe dropped out of high school and worked a variety of odd jobs from running a small clothing boutique to sorting plastics at a recycling plant before eventually landing her “dream job” at a potato factory.

She was given the “worst job at the facility” — unloading sacks of dirt-laden potatoes — but found the grueling 14-hour days to be meditative.

And she soon found joy in living a simple no-frills lifestyle.

Around 2010 Wolfe then 27 read about the burgeoning tiny house movement a community of hyper-minimalists who live in <400-sq.-ft. abodes many of them self-built.

She was instantly enamored.

With savings from her $13/hr factory gig she bought a used trailer ($300) and ¾ of an acre of land ($5k) on Craigslist — a “miserable little piece of dirt” on the outskirts of Boise.

Over the course of a month she built her own 97-sq.-ft. off-grid tiny home from scratch at a cost of $3k using her mom’s minivan to transport lumber.

“The house was basically a shed on wheels” she says. “But living without stuff just felt great to me.”

Wolfe didn’t have much money to her name but living off-grid and mortgage-free reduced her bills to almost nothing.

And the experience of building a house from the ground up gave her the confidence that she could do it again — this time as a source of income.

The Big Island Treehouse

In 2013 while scouring Craigslist for cheap land Wolfe came across a listing for a ½-acre lot on the rainy side of the Big Island in Hawaii.

Wolfe had never been to Hawaii but she knew it was a tourist hot spot. And though the plot was off the beaten path she saw potential.

The seller was a guy in Indiana who was offloading all his assets. His asking price was $8k and Wolfe short on cash worked out a deal with him: $1k down $200/mo with 0% interest.

She packed a small bag of tools and boarded a plane to Hawaii with her mom not knowing what to expect.

When she arrived the road to the lot was overgrown flooded and strewn with rusty abandoned cars. Wolfe hired a guy to clear out the route then bought a chainsaw and spent several days cleaning up the lot.

She didn’t have a blueprint or an architect. But she did have napkins and graph paper. And she also had a vision: She wanted a treehouse.

While researching the build Wolfe was told there were stone-set ways things had to be done. “People always think certain things are impossible” she says. “But when you’re pushed into a corner you just figure it out.”

Due to her financial limitations Wolfe had to get creative:

She affixed bamboo mats over plywood for exterior walls

She rigged up a bed frame out of two-by-fours and cardboard tubes

She used planter boxes to frame circular windows

She built an outdoor hanging bed out of a repurposed trampoline

With just her mom some tools and a couple $27 strap winches Wolfe built the entire 230-sq.-ft. structure in 2 months.

Her total cost: $11k — nearly every penny she had.

Wolfe’s biggest expenses were in setting up the shelter with an off-grid system: solar inverters a rainwater catchment system and a battery-powered propane water heater. She also had to buy an $800 “piece of junk” truck for hardware store trips which she re-sold at cost when she left the island.

The build was unpermitted — a common situation in Hawaii — which made it impossible to get insurance. But the investment she says was so minimal that it wasn’t a concern.

Wolfe’s hard work quickly paid off.

She listed the property on Airbnb in 2014 for $250/night. The novelty factor and some fortuitous press from tiny home influencer Kirsten Dirksen almost immediately resulted in a booked-out calendar.

In just the first 100 days of being operational Wolfe recouped her entire investment.

“I could’ve stopped right then and there and chilled with the income” she says. “But I have no chill.”

It wasn’t long before she set her sights on another build.

The Hobbit Inn

In the wake of building her Hawaii house Wolfe learned something that changed her investment philosophy.

She realized that chasing hot tourist destinations wasn’t a good strategy. Land in those places was far pricier and competition was more intense; instead she decided to focus on rural traditionally undesirable sites.

“I decided to build properties so cool that people would come to me” she says. “The house itself — not the location — would be the destination.”

In early 2015 Wolfe scouted a 5-acre plot of discount land in Orondo Washington for $18k that only required 20% down with a 3-year payoff. It was a rural area surrounded by rolling green hills that looked like something out of a Tolkien book.

So Wolfe decided to build a hobbit house.

Before starting Wolfe studied up on hobbits rereading The Lord of the Rings and fact-checking things on hobbit enthusiast forums.

She created a character in her mind — a woodworking hobbit — and built the house as accurately as possible as if he inhabited it. In lieu of kitschy Frodo action figures Wolfe built a woodworking bench with whittling tools a giant circular door made out of a cable spool and deep-set “hobbit windows.”

Staying true to the integrity of hobbit living meant building the home largely underground which posed serious challenges.

“There wasn’t anything online about building underground within my budget” she says. “So I just kind of winged it.”

Wolfe hired an excavator to carve out the side of a hill then constructed the home using 2’x6’ treated lumber sheeted with ¾” plywood. She affixed the 288-sq.-ft. structure with a tin roof and installed moisture-wicking insulation to protect it from water damage.

Once again she had to get crafty to stay on budget:

She used reclaimed wood and materials

She built light fixtures out of willow branches

She built her own pull-chain toilet (typically $800) using a lamp chain a pipe and an wall-mounted tank

She bought used windows for $10

Similar to her Hawaii project everything was built off-grid with a 3k-watt solar inverter and a 2k-gallon water tank.

“Going off-grid opens up your options for cheap land” she says. “But you don’t get city utilities there’s often no infrastructure and you can’t just call a random electrician when your generator goes out.”

This often leads to stressful situations.

Last year during a nasty cold spell Wolfe had to cancel a week’s worth of guests and drain a frozen water line in single-digit temperatures. When the septic line froze she had to drive 8 hours from Boise to Washington with a truck full of lumber and build an outhouse from scratch.

“Most of the time no matter what goes wrong if you can be really transparent about the situation and try to make it right guests will be understanding” she says.

On Airbnb the property has exceeded her wildest expectations.

While the Hawaii treehouse attracted mainly honeymooners the Washington property has become a go-to destination for hobbit enthusiasts from around the world.

Today the home (~$400/night) is booked so far in advance that the average guest has to wait 430 days to stay there.

Though Wolfe was hesitant to share exact numbers the hobbit hole’s extraordinarily high occupancy rate (90%+) likely grosses in excess of $100k/yr before accounting for Airbnb’s cut (3%) and other overhead costs (property management repairs land taxes etc.).

Crystal Peak Lookout

Shortly after finishing her hobbit hole Wolfe came across a listing for an old fire lookout tower in Fernwood Idaho (pop. 684).

At $67k for the structure and land it was more than 3x pricier than anything else she’d purchased.

But it wasn’t generating any interest and she was able to work out a deal with the realtor financed through her other properties’ income: $1.1k/month for 5 years with 6% interest.

Built to survey forest fires lookouts once numbered in the thousands but have since dwindled to a few hundred.

Most are built on federal land and impossible to own — but this one was special. The owner had bought it from an elderly couple in 1983 for $1 and transported it to a private plot which he paid for by logging the land.

When Wolfe first journeyed to the property it was overrun with rats and in a state of disrepair. She lived there for 2 months mostly in complete solitude taking care to restore the lookout and maintain its original charm.

She hauled up a wood-burning stove vintage cast-iron pans an antique coffee grinder and the lookout’s original log book.

A dilapidated shed was converted into a working sauna with a bucket shower and an outhouse was installed nearby.

The main lookout is tiny (14’x14’) but it sits on a 25-foot-tall perch and boasts 360-degree views of forestland.

At $200/night the lookout is miles from the nearest town and requires driving down a rough dirt road and hiking up a steep driveway. There’s no cell service and water and power are limited.

Wolfe says guests who book stays there know what they’re in for: a rugged peaceful retreat — not a cushy glamping experience.

Guests may have to use a butane-powered camping stove to cook dinner and chop their own wood using a kindling cracker but they’re rewarded with frequent visits from moose and a symphonic overture of bird calls.

With 3 successful properties in 3 different states Wolfe decided to turn back to her roots — by building a house out of a giant potato.

Big Idaho Potato Hotel

Years earlier in the odd-job phase of life Wolfe had landed a gig with the Idaho Potato Commission touring the US in a giant concrete potato affixed to a truck.

While building her fire lookout she learned that the commission was upgrading its potato to a fiberglass model.

“I sent them a message like ‘Hey what’s the plan with that old potato?’” says Wolfe. “They had no idea what to do with it and they actually ended up gifting it to me.”

In a viral PR play the commission used a crane to offload the 12k-pound 28-foot-long concrete potato on Wolfe’s land outside of Boise and announced it was beginning a second life as a vacation rental.

The move generated more than $1m in free press for the commission and drummed up international demand for the listing before it was even built.

Wolfe hollowed out the inside of the potato used spray foam for the walls and added ventilation plumbing and electrical systems.

To keep things economical she made her own lighting out of fishing traps and antlers built shelving units with old railroad spikes from the nearby tracks and used a $60 pet fence dome in lieu of a $1k+ skylight. The bathroom which includes a fireplace and brick-inlaid tub was built out of a converted grain silo.

And in case guests get lonely a Jersey cow named Dolly (after Dolly Parton) lives on the property year-round.

Like Wolfe’s other properties the 200-sq.-ft. potato is often booked out months in advance at $200/night.

“It’s in the middle of nowhere. It’s just 400 acres of farmland in every direction” says Wolfe. “But people come from all over the world to stay here. Everyone loves potatoes.”

Always on the move

Wolfe’s strategy of creating unique experiences rather than going after tourist markets has been endorsed by Airbnb.

Searches for “unique” properties were up 94% on the platform last year and an Airbnb spokesperson tells The Hustle that hosts of unique abodes made $300m globally in 2020.

The 39-year-old minimalist declined to share the total revenue her properties bring in but says it’s enough to not have to worry anymore about financing most new builds.

Wolfe invests nearly all of her proceeds into other properties and already has several other one-of-a-kind projects in the works:

She bought a lakeside property in Salmon Idaho for $120k and is converting it to look like a shipwreck house  complete with a treasure hunt for kids.

 complete with a treasure hunt for kids. She snapped up 40 more acres near the hobbit house and is expanding it into a hobbit village.

When I called Wolfe last month she was somewhere in remote Oregon waiting for a prefab structure to get shipped from Estonia. She says it’ll be used to create a property that can only be accessed by boat.

Budgeting has become a bit more of a challenge during the pandemic.

During a remodel of a deck at the shipwreck house for instance the price of plywood fluctuated from $45 to $105 per sheet due to lumber shortages.

But she now has a more rigid system in place for new properties which helps alleviate some of the management pain points:

She hires someone on Upwork to write a press release

She gives away a few free stays to get user feedback and high-quality photos

She outsources her property management to the automated platform Guesty

She finds a local caretaker in every new location to clean and add special touches to the property (fresh flowers local coffee etc.)

“The most common question I get is how I find people to take care of my properties in such rural locations” she says. “My trick was to change the ad from ‘housekeeper’ to ‘caretaker.’ It sounds much more appealing and the difference in the quality of applicants is night and day.”

Building properties around the country is a gritty lifestyle.

Wolfe typically camps out in unfinished shelters for months on end until they’re finished often without electricity plumbing or running water. On occasion she’s joined by her mom who reminds her to eat something.

“I really live for that state of flow where you forget to eat and don’t really need anything” she says. “You’re just consumed by the creative process and the problem-solving. It’s like meditation.”

Though Wolfe has a home base — a 147-sq.-ft. tiny house — in Boise she prefers to spend nearly every week on the road.

She proudly calls herself a “full-time builder” and wouldn’t have it any other way.

“If you can build” she says “you’ll always be OK.’”

Stephanie Hays her husband Peter Woolcock and their 2-year-old son Hays pose on a roof in Bangkok Thailand. The family is on a worldwide trip as part of a promotion called ""Live Anywhere on Airbnb.""



In this space in August we told readers about a lucky Chattanooga family who won a year of free travel accommodations in the ""Live Anywhere on Airbnb"" contest.

Now Stephanie Hays her husband Peter Woolcock and her 2-year-old son Hays are at the mid-point in their around-the-world journey.

They are among 12 travel parties worldwide chosen from 314000 applicants to participate in the Airbnb promotion. Hays is a former brand manager for Chattanooga Tourism Co. and Woolcock formerly ran an after-school soccer program here.

We caught up with Shephanie Hays recently as the family settled into a stay in Cape Town South Africa after spending several months in Europe. Below is a Q&A conducted by e-mail describing their travels so far.

Q: When did you leave Chattanooga and what has your itinerary been so far?

Hays: We left on Sept. 1. We spent four weeks in Rome and then four weeks in Athens. Then we visited friends in Istanbul for a few days before making our way to Marrakech [Morocco] where we [stayed] for three weeks. For Thanksgiving we already had plans to visit Pete's family in Cornwall [U.K.] so we'll be there for two weeks before heading to Bangkok Thailand for one month. [We spent] the month of January in Sri Lanka. We're trying to stay flexible due to ever-changing COVID situations and restrictions. Staying safe and keeping [son] Hays safe is our #1 priority of course.

Q: Did you get to pick the accommodations in each stop and have they been nice?

Hays: Yes Airbnb's ""Live Anywhere"" program (we are participants along with 11 others plus their companions) is all about gaining insight into what it means to live in Airbnbs long-term. We're given a budget and are allowed to book homes in any location so long as we spend at least four weeks in each listing.

Since we choose them they're as nice as we pick. Before this program Pete and I had stayed at 40-plus Airbnbs in 19 countries so we know what we like. And so far we haven't encountered anything unexpected.

In Rome and Athens we prioritized location first and foremost (and saving some budget for a few side trips) so our apartments were quite modest In Rome we were right across the street from an amazing playground. We knew that when we booked but didn't realize just how perfect that would be to allow Hays to burn off some energy and interact with other children every day.

We stayed in our own riad (a riad is a type of family home centered around a courtyard) in Marrakech's medina (old city.) It was absolutely incredible.

The place we're in currently in Cape Town is from 1905 and is the first Airbnb we've stayed in where the host had actually lived (and stays between bookings I think) so it really feels like a home. We've been surprised at how much that's impacted our stay. I think we were perhaps a little homesick but having somewhere homey albeit it not ""our"" home has totally scratched that itch.

We've been amazed at how well Hays has adapted too. He calls each place ""new home"" for our first week or so but other than that seems unfazed.

Q: Have your parents (Ken and Ellen Hays of Chattanooga joined you for any portion of the trip so far?

Hays: Yes. My parents are trying to meet up with us as much as possible. We call them our ""bonus companions"" since Airbnb refers to me as the participant and Pete and Hays as my ""companions"" (each participant is allowed up to three). They joined us for a few days in Rome (they were already traveling in France) and in Bangkok and Sri Lanka. My dad also met up with us in Athens and we visited some Greek Islands.

Q: Have you run into any unexpected challenges?

Hays: Keeping up with COVID restrictions is tricky but expected. While in Marrakech and traveling to the U.K. to visit Pete's family immediately after Morocco banned U.K. visitors so our British Airways flight from Marrakech to London was canceled but as soon as we heard the news we had already rebooked with a layover in Lisbon.

Honestly we're amazed COVID hasn't derailed us even more (knock wood!) It's certainly forced us to change plans but we wouldn't be in Cape Town most likely in that case so we can always see the bright side.

In the minor challenge category of course we always appreciate EPB when we experience the internet speeds the majority of the world have to put up with.

Q. Without getting too personal have the economics of the trip worked so far?

Hays: Peter and I were saving to take a year off and travel but weren't planning to go until early 2023 (at the earliest). So when we saw the Airbnb program we figured it was worth it to apply and speed up our plans.

Quitting our jobs is scary - although Pete likes the unknown more than me! - but this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Airbnb is covering our accommodation and we're staying in much nicer places than we would have been able to our own and they also provided a transportation allowance.

We have a massive Google spreadsheet where we track each and every expense so that we have an understanding of where our money is going and can budget accordingly. And we're trying to balance visiting places in Western Europe (that are more expensive) with less expensive destinations like Southeast Asia. Traveling slowly like we're doing also means we have many evenings where we cook at home and can spread out museums and attractions over the course of the month. We're not pressed to do everything in a short period of time.

Also we listed our own [Chattanooga] home on Airbnb and it's been doing really well. So that has been really nice – to have some income to offset our traveling. We've been Airbnb hosts since 2012 (always a room in our home not the whole house like now) and we really enjoy it (outside of the financial benefits.) It's so nice knowing that while we're going others get to enjoy our home in the Southside.

Q: What's it been like traveling with a young child?

Hays: Surprisingly traveling with Hays has been easier than we imagined. He's SO adaptable and any of the challenges of traveling with a toddler are far outweighed by getting to see him experience so many different things.

We had originally planned to travel when he was 3 or 4 because we thought 2 years old might be too young. But this is such a fun age.

I don't think that traveling with a toddler is necessarily for everyone but we've been pleased to realize that we enjoy travel with Hays as much as we enjoyed it without him. That wasn't necessarily a given and you don't really know until you try it so we're happy it's worked out that way.

Q: Have you been journaling on your blog or posting on social media?

Hays: I'm posting daily on Instagram (@awaywithhays) and we have started a YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/c/StephandPete (or just search ""Away with Hays""). We're trying to keep up with both things regularly so that Hays has photos and videos to look back on since obviously he won't remember what a wild year he had as a 2-year-old! That keeps me motivated.

Q: How would you rate the experience so far? Has it met or exceeded your expectations?

Hays: How would we rate it?! It's absolutely a dream. It still doesn't seem real. I wake up every morning and go to bed every night (and everything in between) just so insanely grateful for this experience and this time with Pete and Hays. It is 100% a dream come true in every way assuming I'm able to get employed again at the end of the year.

My favorite thing in the world is to travel and more specifically to plan travel; and now I spend every waking moment doing just that. But there's literally nothing else I love to do more. When we were selected I was humbled by how many friends said ""oh yeah that makes sense""- but it's because they know I'm obsessed with traveling. We are so so lucky.

In fact the European Union’s 28 member countries are united in their disgust over Russia’s violent and devastating invasion of Ukraine in a way few thought was possible. And the biggest country in the world headed by Vladimir Putin is being slapped with debilitating sanctions that will hopefully give the Ukrainians who fled the ability to head home soon. Until then the world is helping in a rather unexpected way: They’re booking Airbnb properties in Ukraine.

Of course Ukraine isn’t exactly a destination for jet-setters at the moment but the point of booking on Airbnb wasn’t to take a relaxing vacation in a charming Eastern European dwelling. International users of the vacation booking app quickly snatched up as many Airbnb properties in Ukraine as possible. And when they couldn’t they urged others to do so on Twitter. The selfless funneling of cash into Ukranians’ hands caught on pretty fast. Even Airbnb decided to waive the guest and host fees so that the rental money is sent directly to the homeowners and hosts.

And to top it off: Airbnb’s chief executive Brian Chesky recently tweeted that the company at least for the time being will suspend its business in Russia and Belarus. It’s just one of the hundreds of sanctions Russia has been hit with following the invasion of Ukraine. Whether or not the sanctions will be powerful enough to actually stop Russia in its tracks remains to be seen but at least they’re making quite a forceful statement. What’s more Airbnb isn’t stopping at waiving fees and initiating sanctions: They’re also donating up to 100000 homes for Ukrainian refugees who left their lives behind and fled."

The Crusaders eyed a long postseason run a return to state for the first time since 2016 and a spot in the state title game even pondering a final matchup with Hudson.

“After that first game we went into the locker room and we were like ‘You know what? We’re going to play these guys the last game of the year’’’ Edgewood senior defenseman Parker Murn said Saturday. “So we took the whole year preparing. We left it all out there. I’m so proud of everyone.”

Edgewood and Hudson did indeed cross paths in the WIAA Division 1 boys hockey state championship Saturday at the Dane County Coliseum.

The third-seeded Crusaders again wound up disappointed with the result — a 6-2 loss to top-seeded and top-ranked Hudson — but they were buoyed by their journey to the season’s final game.

“I’m really proud of the guys” Edgewood coach Pete Rothering said. “It’s hard to get here. I thought we played our best hockey in the first half of the game today. And to do that that’s where you want to be right? The guys accomplished a lot the seniors accomplished a lot. … But it certainly hurts right now. They are disappointed but they should be proud of themselves.”

Hudson (26-3-0) broke a 2-2 second-period tie with two late goals in the period — winning its second consecutive title and sixth championship in 13 state appearances. The Raiders defeated Verona 4-0 in the final last year in Wisconsin Rapids.

Edgewood (25-4-0) ranked third in Division 1 in the WisconsinPrepHockey.net poll had its 18-game winning streak snapped and finished as runner-up for the second time (the other was in 2008) in six state trips.

“It’s incredible” Edgewood senior forward Cody Menzel said about the state tournament experience. “I’ve never been here before so it’s just a different feeling. But to accomplish something like this with my team it’s just unforgettable and it’s something that will last me a lifetime.”

Hudson which finished the season on a 17-game winning streak provided a bookend of sorts to Edgewood’s schedule as the Big Rivers Conference champion Raiders topped the Badger West champion Crusaders 7-2 in that season opener Nov. 26 in Verona.

A tight defensive battle Saturday transformed into a bonanza of offense in the second period including a span of three goals within 26 seconds amid five goals overall that left Hudson with a 4-2 lead.

Murn tied the game 1-1 blasting in an unassisted goal through traffic in front of the net with 7 minutes 15 seconds left in the second period.

But Hudson junior forward Carson Strapon answered with a goal 19 seconds later.

The Raiders’ lead lasted only seven seconds. Off a pass from the faceoff Menzel broke in on the left wing and backhanded a shot past Hudson sophomore goaltender Aiden Tepper-Engh with 6:49 left in the second period.

“It shows we are a relentless bunch” Murn said. “We never want to lose. I’m so proud of these guys battling until the end.”

Hudson then broke the 2-2 tie with goals by senior forward Mathew Mauer with 3:36 left and senior forward Carter Mears with 1:55 remaining in the second period.

The Raiders coached by former University of Wisconsin and NHL player Davis Drewiske pulled away with third-period goals by senior defenseman Max Giblin and senior forward Reese Richardson.

The Crusaders had the better of the play and opportunities in the first period but the Raiders scored on senior forward Zach Kochendorfer’s goal with 20 seconds left in the opening 17 minutes.

“Looking back on it now not capitalizing on it was a big part of what happened tonight” Rothering said. “It’s a team you don’t want to be chasing from behind. If we could have gotten a lead at some point it might have given us a different chance at things. I think our first period was our best period of the year other than not scoring.”

Mauer skated in to the right of the net and dropped a pass back to the onrushing Kochendorfer who converted from in front of Edgewood sophomore goalie Rowan White. It was only the third shot on goal by Hudson in the first period.

Tepper-Engh who had eight first-period saves came up big against the Crusaders’ aggressive early offensive effort. Edgewood had six shots on goal in the first 6 minutes including solid scoring bids by senior forward J.J. Wiebusch with 14:19 left and Menzel with 13:46 remaining.

“I’m unbelievably proud of us” Wiebusch said. “We put in the work. … When it was tied 2-2 I thought we would come back but Hudson kind of pulled away there. I’m extremely proud of my boys. They are my brothers for life.”

Edgewood advanced to the final with a 3-1 victory over second-seeded Green Bay Notre Dame in a semifinal Friday while Hudson had moved on with a 6-0 shutout of fourth-seeded University School of Milwaukee.

In the Division 2 boys championship game top-seeded Rice Lake (18-7-0) edged second-seeded Fond du Lac St. Mary’s Springs (22-6-0) by a 4-3 result.

The second-seeded Schofield D.C. Everest co-op (24-1-0) earned a 5-0 victory over the fourth-seeded Onalaska co-op (24-5-0) in the girls championship game. Senior forward Samantha Federici had a hat trick and freshman Gabi Heuser added two goals for the team known as the Central Wisconsin Storm.

In Friday afternoon’s WIAA Division 1 semifinals Aidan Lenz assisted both of his linemates in the first period to give the Crusaders a two-goal lead on the way to a 3-1 victory against Green Bay Notre Dame at the Dane County Coliseum.

Though the speed and offensive skill of senior forwards JJ Wiebusch Cody Menzel and Lenz garnered the most attention all season for the Crusaders it was their commitment to using that speed defensively in the third period that delivered the dagger canceling each and every one of the Tritons’ opportunities as they desperately tried to come from behind.

“In between periods we were definitely talking about simplifying the game defense first and just getting the puck in deep if we needed” Lenz said. “There’s no need to force incredible passes to score a goal — we’re already up and don’t need anymore goals. So we were just taking care of the puck and playing good defense.”

Good defense and 27 saves by sophomore goaltender Rowan White helped the Crusaders preserve the lead built in the first period as they earned their first win in the state tournament since 2008. Edgewood (25-3) will square off with top-ranked Hudson (25-3) on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. for the title.

“We tried to keep (the puck) to the perimeter pretty good and clear pucks” Edgewood coach Pete Rothering said. “We did a pretty good job of that and when they did get a chance Rowan was there and he’s really good. … He’s a rock back there. I wouldn’t trade Rowan for any other goalie in the state. He’s a sophomore so I think he hasn’t gotten quite the recognition as some of the other kids around the state as a goaltender but he’s a stud.”

Edgewood will take an 18-game winning streak into the championship game and will be playing for a state title because of the offensive output from their top line which scored 14 of the team’s 17 goals in four playoff games — including all three goals Friday.

The first was set up when Lenz forced a turnover gained possession and passed the puck to Menzel who slid it across the slot to Wiebusch for his first of two goals within four minutes of each other.

On a power play four minutes later Wiebusch stickhandled loudly at the top of the face-off circle — about 12 feet from where he released his first goal — before firing another shot past Notre Dame sophomore Lleyton Jaschke to take a 2-0 lead with 6 minutes 59 seconds to play in the period.

“On my first goal it was an unbelievable play by Aidan to get that to Cody and Cody to me” said Wiebusch who scored three goals in the first period of a 5-1 victory against Waunakee to qualify for state. “(Jaschke) challenged me out and had a high glove so I just shot low glove. My second goal was a great pass by Parker Murn and I saw (Jaschke) creeping too far right so I shot it left.”

Lenz’s second assist came when a stretch pass to Menzel was redirected between Notre Dame defenders and retrieved by Menzel behind those defenders. With a full head of steam Menzel raced into the zone and flipped the puck over Jaschke’s left shoulder for his 49th goal of the season 100th point and a 3-1 lead with 3:00 to play in the opening period.

From there the Crusaders took care of the puck for the remaining 37 minutes of the game against a Notre Dame team that beat Edgewood 5-3 on Dec. 30.

After avenging their loss to Notre Dame the Crusaders will have the opportunity to avenge another loss in the championship game as they were defeated by Hudson 7-2 in the first game of the season.

Hudson allowed one shot on goal during a 6-0 victory against University School of Milwaukee on Friday.

“Honestly defensively we weren’t very good that night (against Hudson) so they had a lot of easy (opportunities)” Rothering said. “Against a good team if you give up easy ones they’re going to score and they did. We talked a lot about it that day and we’ve talked about it since then — we’re now defending really well and Rowan is a big part of that but it’ll be big tomorrow. We have to defend first.”

But a voluntary experiment has begun as organisations navigate the new landscape of hybrid work combining the best elements of remote work with time in the office.

Yes there is some push for a “return to normal” and getting workers back into offices. But ideas such as food vouchers and parking discounts are mostly being proposed by city councils and CBD businesses keen to get their old customers back.

A wide range of surveys over the past 18 months show most employees and increasingly employers have no desire to return to commuting five days a week.

The seismic shift in employer attitudes is signalled by Google long a fierce opponent of working from home.

Last week the company told employees they must return to the office from early April – but only for three days a week.

That’s still way more than tech companies such as Australia’s Atlassian which expects workers to come into the office just four days a year but it is a far cry from its pre-pandemic resistance to remote work.

Hybrid work is here to stay. Employers will either embrace the change or find themselves being left behind.

Gains in productivity

Google began – under pressure – to soften its opposition to remote work in 2020. In December of that year chief executive Sundar Pichai told employees:

We are testing a hypothesis that a flexible work model will lead to greater productivity collaboration and well-being.

Its chief concern has been protecting the social capital that springs from physical proximity – and also perhaps with keeping employers under surveillance.

But longstanding (and widespread) management concerns that employees working from home would lower productivity have proven unfounded.

Even before the pandemic there was good research showing no productivity penalty from remote working – the opposite in fact.

For example a 2014 randomised trial involving about 250 Shanghai call centre workers found working from home associated with 13% more productivity. This comprised a 9% gain from working more minutes per shift – due perhaps to fewer interruptions – and a 4% gain from making more calls per minute – attributed to a quieter more comfortable working environment.

Research in the past two years supports these findings.

Harvard Business School professor Raj Choudury and colleagues published research in October 2020 that found allowing employees to work wherever they like led to a 4.4% increase in output.

In April 2021 Stanford University economist Nick Bloom and colleagues calculated a the shift to remote working resulted in a 5% productivity boost. Though their working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research was not peer reviewed it was based on surveying 30000 American workers which is a decent sample size.

Our relationship with work has changed

There are good reasons most of us don’t want to go back to the old normal. It just wasn’t that great.

While working from home can bring challenges of other kinds not least the ability to switch off and stop working when work is done working in an office can increase stress lower mood and reduce productivity.

My own research has measured the effects of typical open-plan office noises finding a 25% increase in negative mood even after a short exposure time.

Then there’s the time spent commuting. Not having to go into the office every day frees up hours of time to do other things. Particularly in winter it’s nice to not have to leave and arrive home in the dark.

Preferred number of days working at home by occupation

Changed expectations of work

The importance of these things should not be underestimated.

In a June 2021 study by McKinsey of 245 employees who had returned to the office one-third said they felt their mental health had been harmed.

The experience of the pandemic has lowered our tolerance for this old world of work.

Nothing exemplifies this better than the growth of the “lie-flat” trend which began in China and is now a global phenomenon. Increasing numbers of people are rejecting the idea of pursuing a career at all costs.

They don’t want to spend their life being a cog in the wheel of capitalism and are choosing to work less – even not at all.

No one size fits all

Rather than a bastion of meaning and fulfilment the structures around how we have conducted work has for many people meant an existence of quiet desperation. The pandemic has brought an unforeseen opportunity to change this narrative and rethink both the way we work and the role of work in our lives

For some no job is better than a bad job. The rest of us will settle for the flexibility we’ve had over the past two years.

No one size fits all. The downsides of working from home include missing coworkers and losing the benefits of serendipitous conversations. The nuances of how much time we need to spend together in the office for outcomes like creativity belonging learning and relationship building varies between individuals teams and job types.

But what is certain is we don’t need to be together five days a week to make these things happen. With a shrinking workforce and an increasing war for talent employers who don’t provide flexibility will be the losers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjIvMDMvMjU5ODI1OTEvMTAtd2VpcmRlc3QtbXJiZWFzdC12aWRlb3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Weirdest MrBeast Videos - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/03/25982591/10-weirdest-mrbeast-videos on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjIvMDMvMjU5ODI1OTEvMTAtd2VpcmRlc3QtbXJiZWFzdC12aWRlb3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zcGlyaXQtYXdhcmRzLWxlZS1qdW5nLWphZS0wMDQxMDM0MzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spirit Awards: Lee Jung-jae Thuso Mbedu Become First-Time Winners for Best Male Female Leads in TV Series,"Lee Jung-jae and Thuso Mbedu were given the best male and female lead honors for TV series during the 2022 Independent Spirit Awards on Sunday.

Before revealing the winners presenters Sebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar-Jones explained shows are “considered indie” when they are new.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

Squid Game star Lee wasn’t able to attend the show due to a scheduling conflict though he accepted the award in a pre-recorded video.

After thanking fans for “loving” the Netflix show the actor took the opportunity to answer a popular question.

“I know there are lots of Squid Game fans in the world and what you’re all curious about the most is when Season 2 will come out” he said. “It’s on the way! Stay tuned.”

Lee added that he has “so many people to thank” before he gave a shout out to the entire Squid Game team and Netflix while he also thanked the show’s viewers.

Lee was up against Olly Alexander (It’s a Sin) Michael Greyeyes (Rutherford Falls) Murray Bartlett (The White Lotus) and Ashley Thomas (THEM: Covenant).

Meanwhile The Underground Railroad actress Thuso Mbedu beat out Anjana Vasan (We Are Lady Parts) Jana Schmieding (Rutherford Falls) Jasmine Cephas Jones (Blindspotting) and Deborah Ayorinde (THEM: Covenant) for the female lead honor.

Mbedu was visibly shocked by the win as she made her way to the stage to accept the award.

“They told me a number of times to prepare something and I really didn’t” the first-time nominee and winner began. “First and foremost thank you to Film Independent for this recognition.”

After thanking creator and director Barry Jenkins for “absolutely everything” Mbedu showed her appreciation for casting director Francine Maisler’s “guidance.”

“Thank you to Amazon to all the executive producers to my team Beth April Laurie everyone” she continued.

The actress then thanked her sister in South Africa joking that “she would kill me if I don’t say anything about her.”

She showed her appreciation for “every single person who was involved in The Underground Railroad.” Mbedu said “There was no person who was too small in making the project what it was and I really really hope that you guys will take the time to watch it because it’s an absolute masterpiece.”

The actress continued to rave about Jenkins backstage. “Barry is a very collaborative director and it was more about what I found for the character more than anything and him supporting that” she told reporters. “It was evident with like moments on set where if we made an offer he would then go and change the script to accommodate that which we had offered which was amazing.”

Mbedu said it was a “great challenge to tell the story because it is a very important story” adding that she “wanted it to go to whoever could tell it as authentically and as respectfully as possible.”

“I’m grateful that I did get that opportunity too and I did a lot of research going into it guided by Barry and I do hope that people will get the chance to receive it for what it is without me feel like I imposed my emotions onto it anyway” she added.

Mbedu added that winning the award was “surreal” and admitted she didn’t think she would be the honor’s recipient.

It was two years ago this past week that Alphabet Inc. Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. campuses on the West Coast began emptying out as the coronavirus started spreading across the U.S. a move that was quickly mirrored by the vast majority of offices nationwide. Today many skilled knowledge workers have no interest in going back to the way things used to be. In their constant quest for new talent tech firms' and old-guard companies that need to find more tech-savvy employees' will do what it takes to hire and retain people who feel empowered to demand the schedule and location of their choice.

Even when the pandemic is over many tech leaders believe work flexibility will be a staple hiring will be more geographically dispersed and people will spend their time differently than they did before with designated hours they're available to collaborate with colleagues and other periods where individual work is the priority.

“Our sense of place has been permanently disrupted"" says Annie Dean who was head of remote work for Facebook earlier in the pandemic and is now at software developer Atlassian Corp. where her title is vice president of team anywhere. She predicts that bosses who force staffers back to offices in rigid ways will lose credibility with their workforces. “That's just not going to be the way that we go forward.""

Alphabet's Google this past week outlined its return-to-work plans: Employees will be returning to the office a few days a week starting in early April. But Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told The Wall Street Journal last month that the future of work is flexible and that he sees it as a new canvas on which we can develop newer ways which make people's work life more fulfilling and their personal lives more fulfilling.

Apple Inc. on Friday told employees they would begin returning to the office one day a week starting on April 11th and would build up to three days per week by late May.

And Twitter Inc. which was among the first to announce it would allow its employees to work from anywhere permanently announced Thursday that it plans to start reopening its offices March 15. But in making the announcement CEO Parag Agrawal stressed that the company's ultimate return-to-work philosophy is employee choice.

“Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that includes working from home full-time forever. Office every day? That works too. Some days in office some days from home? Of course"" Mr. Agrawal told employees.

Perhaps one of the most lasting ways Covid has altered the workscape is hiring as evidenced by a recent Twitter thread where several high-profile executives chimed in.

“The place to be was Silicon Valley. It feels like now the place to be is the internet"" tweeted Brian Chesky chief executive of Airbnb Inc.

The head of Coinbase Global Inc. Brian Armstrong said Silicon Valley had already relocated from California to the cloud. Eighty-nine percent of new hires at the cryptocurrency exchange were somewhere other than the West Coast in the most recent quarter he tweeted up from 30% before the pandemic.

Alyssa Henry the head of the Square business within the newly renamed Block Inc. tweeted that 40% of managers on her team don't have any direct reports living in the same location. “Distributed and asynchronous work is the now and the future"" she said.

The tech industry isn't the only one undertaking far-flung recruiting efforts these days. General Motors Co. said this year it plans to hire 8000 high-tech employees many of them based far from its Detroit headquarters' some in offices in places like Austin Texas and some working from home.

“It's just not limiting us to our backyard"" says Kyle Lagunas GM's head of talent. He took the job at the auto maker last year helping to oversee hiring in part because it allowed him to continue living in Massachusetts. “I am never moving to Detroit"" he said.

New ways to work

Where people work directly impacts how people work. Once teams scattered in the Covid era and started performing their roles from all over the country tech companies explored ways for them to balance collaboration time with colleagues with focused time for individual work.

Enter ‘asynchronous’ work where employees get to set their hours in part by what schedule best suits their lives. Slack Technologies Inc. has ‘core hours’ where team members are supposed to be available to jump on a call or huddle with their teams. Slack parent Salesforce Inc. encourages employees to set their Slack status to ‘focus time’ when they're handling individual work or ‘connecting’ to signal their availability to collaborate.

Salesforce recently tried its first ‘Async Week’ where 20000 of its nearly 70000 employees canceled routine meetings to make more time for solo work a spokeswoman said. Of those who participated in the experiment 72% said it made them more productive and 70% reported it made them less stressed. Two more async weeks are planned for this year.

Twitter is adopting a similar approach where teams come up with common hours that work for them to collaborate. It also recently experimented with a companywide ‘focus’ week where the majority of meetings were canceled and people could catch up on things like backlogged assignments.

“We had a very meeting-heavy culture"" said Megan Gleeson Twitter's vice president of career experience. “We started to see the number of meetings tick up throughout the pandemic so that people could find connection.""

Now Twitter encourages workers to think about ‘meeting hygiene’ which could involve setting a tight agenda for efficiency recording the meeting so people who can't join can still listen at a later time and considering whether the meeting really needs to happen at all Ms. Gleeson said.

There's still a lot for companies to iron out to make asynchronous models run smoothly Ms. Dean the former head of remote work at Facebook said. The biggest challenge to sort: ""This huge collaboration tax"" she added.

Workers can't string together enough hours in a row to focus so they sometimes work well beyond the traditional 9-to-5 schedule with pings and dings signaling requests coming to them from all over the internet. Going forward Ms. Dean predicts savvy employers will help people shrink their online time.

The company also expanded its office space during the pandemic in New York City Boston Chicago and Bellevue Wash. where there are deep pools of tech talent.

But today's tech offices look different. Dropbox doesn't call its spaces ‘offices’ anymore. Instead it calls them ‘studios’; there are fewer desks and more meeting rooms and lounges for less formal team gatherings.

Google is running a series of pilot programs in the Bay Area New York City Dublin London and Singapore to reconfigure some office layouts to boost productivity and connectedness. The company said it plans to see how those experiments go before scaling them.

More companies are holding off-site meetings at hotels coffee shops or executives' backyards instead of pulling them into traditional offices. Salesforce has said its existing offices will be used for more collaboration and less individual work but it's going a step further with an off-site project that combines work and wellness.

But a voluntary experiment has begun as organisations navigate the new landscape of hybrid work combining the best elements of remote work with time in the office.

Yes there is some push for a “return to normal” and getting workers back into offices. But ideas such as food vouchers and parking discounts are mostly being proposed by city councils and CBD businesses keen to get their old customers back.

A wide range of surveys over the past 18 months show most employees and increasingly employers have no desire to return to commuting five days a week.

The seismic shift in employer attitudes is signalled by Google long a fierce opponent of working from home.

Last week the company told employees they must return to the office from early April – but only for three days a week.

That’s still way more than tech companies such as Australia’s Atlassian which expects workers to come into the office just four days a year but it is a far cry from its pre-pandemic resistance to remote work.

Hybrid work is here to stay. Employers will either embrace the change or find themselves being left behind.

Gains in productivity

Google began – under pressure – to soften its opposition to remote work in 2020. In December of that year chief executive Sundar Pichai told employees:

We are testing a hypothesis that a flexible work model will lead to greater productivity collaboration and well-being.

Its chief concern has been protecting the social capital that springs from physical proximity – and also perhaps with keeping employers under surveillance.

But longstanding (and widespread) management concerns that employees working from home would lower productivity have proven unfounded.

Even before the pandemic there was good research showing no productivity penalty from remote working – the opposite in fact.

For example a 2014 randomised trial involving about 250 Shanghai call centre workers found working from home associated with 13% more productivity. This comprised a 9% gain from working more minutes per shift – due perhaps to fewer interruptions – and a 4% gain from making more calls per minute – attributed to a quieter more comfortable working environment.

Research in the past two years supports these findings.

Harvard Business School professor Raj Choudury and colleagues published research in October 2020 that found allowing employees to work wherever they like led to a 4.4% increase in output.

In April 2021 Stanford University economist Nick Bloom and colleagues calculated a the shift to remote working resulted in a 5% productivity boost. Though their working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research was not peer reviewed it was based on surveying 30000 American workers which is a decent sample size.

Our relationship with work has changed

There are good reasons most of us don’t want to go back to the old normal. It just wasn’t that great.

While working from home can bring challenges of other kinds not least the ability to switch off and stop working when work is done working in an office can increase stress lower mood and reduce productivity.

My own research has measured the effects of typical open-plan office noises finding a 25% increase in negative mood even after a short exposure time.

Then there’s the time spent commuting. Not having to go into the office every day frees up hours of time to do other things. Particularly in winter it’s nice to not have to leave and arrive home in the dark.

Preferred number of days working at home by occupation

Changed expectations of work

The importance of these things should not be underestimated.

In a June 2021 study by McKinsey of 245 employees who had returned to the office one-third said they felt their mental health had been harmed.

The experience of the pandemic has lowered our tolerance for this old world of work.

Nothing exemplifies this better than the growth of the “lie-flat” trend which began in China and is now a global phenomenon. Increasing numbers of people are rejecting the idea of pursuing a career at all costs.

They don’t want to spend their life being a cog in the wheel of capitalism and are choosing to work less – even not at all.

No one size fits all

Rather than a bastion of meaning and fulfilment the structures around how we have conducted work has for many people meant an existence of quiet desperation. The pandemic has brought an unforeseen opportunity to change this narrative and rethink both the way we work and the role of work in our lives

For some no job is better than a bad job. The rest of us will settle for the flexibility we’ve had over the past two years.

Read more: How many days a week in the office are enough? You shouldn't need to ask

No one size fits all. The downsides of working from home include missing coworkers and losing the benefits of serendipitous conversations. The nuances of how much time we need to spend together in the office for outcomes like creativity belonging learning and relationship building varies between individuals teams and job types.

But what is certain is we don’t need to be together five days a week to make these things happen. With a shrinking workforce and an increasing war for talent employers who don’t provide flexibility will be the losers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjIvMDMvMjU5ODI1OTEvMTAtd2VpcmRlc3QtbXJiZWFzdC12aWRlb3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Weirdest MrBeast Videos - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/03/25982591/10-weirdest-mrbeast-videos on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjIvMDMvMjU5ODI1OTEvMTAtd2VpcmRlc3QtbXJiZWFzdC12aWRlb3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zcGlyaXQtYXdhcmRzLWxlZS1qdW5nLWphZS0wMDQxMDM0MzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spirit Awards: Lee Jung-jae Thuso Mbedu Become First-Time Winners for Best Male Female Leads in TV Series,"Lee Jung-jae and Thuso Mbedu were given the best male and female lead honors for TV series during the 2022 Independent Spirit Awards on Sunday.

Before revealing the winners presenters Sebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar-Jones explained shows are “considered indie” when they are new.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

Squid Game star Lee wasn’t able to attend the show due to a scheduling conflict though he accepted the award in a pre-recorded video.

After thanking fans for “loving” the Netflix show the actor took the opportunity to answer a popular question.

“I know there are lots of Squid Game fans in the world and what you’re all curious about the most is when Season 2 will come out” he said. “It’s on the way! Stay tuned.”

Lee added that he has “so many people to thank” before he gave a shout out to the entire Squid Game team and Netflix while he also thanked the show’s viewers.

Lee was up against Olly Alexander (It’s a Sin) Michael Greyeyes (Rutherford Falls) Murray Bartlett (The White Lotus) and Ashley Thomas (THEM: Covenant).

Meanwhile The Underground Railroad actress Thuso Mbedu beat out Anjana Vasan (We Are Lady Parts) Jana Schmieding (Rutherford Falls) Jasmine Cephas Jones (Blindspotting) and Deborah Ayorinde (THEM: Covenant) for the female lead honor.

Mbedu was visibly shocked by the win as she made her way to the stage to accept the award.

“They told me a number of times to prepare something and I really didn’t” the first-time nominee and winner began. “First and foremost thank you to Film Independent for this recognition.”

After thanking creator and director Barry Jenkins for “absolutely everything” Mbedu showed her appreciation for casting director Francine Maisler’s “guidance.”

“Thank you to Amazon to all the executive producers to my team Beth April Laurie everyone” she continued.

The actress then thanked her sister in South Africa joking that “she would kill me if I don’t say anything about her.”

She showed her appreciation for “every single person who was involved in The Underground Railroad.” Mbedu said “There was no person who was too small in making the project what it was and I really really hope that you guys will take the time to watch it because it’s an absolute masterpiece.”

The actress continued to rave about Jenkins backstage. “Barry is a very collaborative director and it was more about what I found for the character more than anything and him supporting that” she told reporters. “It was evident with like moments on set where if we made an offer he would then go and change the script to accommodate that which we had offered which was amazing.”

Mbedu said it was a “great challenge to tell the story because it is a very important story” adding that she “wanted it to go to whoever could tell it as authentically and as respectfully as possible.”

“I’m grateful that I did get that opportunity too and I did a lot of research going into it guided by Barry and I do hope that people will get the chance to receive it for what it is without me feel like I imposed my emotions onto it anyway” she added.

Mbedu added that winning the award was “surreal” and admitted she didn’t think she would be the honor’s recipient.

Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally hosted the 2022 Independent Spirit Awards which were available to watch on IFC and AMC+.

It was two years ago this past week that Alphabet Inc. Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. campuses on the West Coast began emptying out as the coronavirus started spreading across the U.S. a move that was quickly mirrored by the vast majority of offices nationwide. Today many skilled knowledge workers have no interest in going back to the way things used to be. In their constant quest for new talent tech firms' and old-guard companies that need to find more tech-savvy employees' will do what it takes to hire and retain people who feel empowered to demand the schedule and location of their choice.

Even when the pandemic is over many tech leaders believe work flexibility will be a staple hiring will be more geographically dispersed and people will spend their time differently than they did before with designated hours they're available to collaborate with colleagues and other periods where individual work is the priority.

“Our sense of place has been permanently disrupted"" says Annie Dean who was head of remote work for Facebook earlier in the pandemic and is now at software developer Atlassian Corp. where her title is vice president of team anywhere. She predicts that bosses who force staffers back to offices in rigid ways will lose credibility with their workforces. “That's just not going to be the way that we go forward.""

Alphabet's Google this past week outlined its return-to-work plans: Employees will be returning to the office a few days a week starting in early April. But Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told The Wall Street Journal last month that the future of work is flexible and that he sees it as a new canvas on which we can develop newer ways which make people's work life more fulfilling and their personal lives more fulfilling.

Apple Inc. on Friday told employees they would begin returning to the office one day a week starting on April 11th and would build up to three days per week by late May.

And Twitter Inc. which was among the first to announce it would allow its employees to work from anywhere permanently announced Thursday that it plans to start reopening its offices March 15. But in making the announcement CEO Parag Agrawal stressed that the company's ultimate return-to-work philosophy is employee choice.

“Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that includes working from home full-time forever. Office every day? That works too. Some days in office some days from home? Of course"" Mr. Agrawal told employees.

Perhaps one of the most lasting ways Covid has altered the workscape is hiring as evidenced by a recent Twitter thread where several high-profile executives chimed in.

“The place to be was Silicon Valley. It feels like now the place to be is the internet"" tweeted Brian Chesky chief executive of Airbnb Inc.

The head of Coinbase Global Inc. Brian Armstrong said Silicon Valley had already relocated from California to the cloud. Eighty-nine percent of new hires at the cryptocurrency exchange were somewhere other than the West Coast in the most recent quarter he tweeted up from 30% before the pandemic.

Alyssa Henry the head of the Square business within the newly renamed Block Inc. tweeted that 40% of managers on her team don't have any direct reports living in the same location. “Distributed and asynchronous work is the now and the future"" she said.

The tech industry isn't the only one undertaking far-flung recruiting efforts these days. General Motors Co. said this year it plans to hire 8000 high-tech employees many of them based far from its Detroit headquarters' some in offices in places like Austin Texas and some working from home.

“It's just not limiting us to our backyard"" says Kyle Lagunas GM's head of talent. He took the job at the auto maker last year helping to oversee hiring in part because it allowed him to continue living in Massachusetts. “I am never moving to Detroit"" he said.

New ways to work

Where people work directly impacts how people work. Once teams scattered in the Covid era and started performing their roles from all over the country tech companies explored ways for them to balance collaboration time with colleagues with focused time for individual work.

Enter ‘asynchronous’ work where employees get to set their hours in part by what schedule best suits their lives. Slack Technologies Inc. has ‘core hours’ where team members are supposed to be available to jump on a call or huddle with their teams. Slack parent Salesforce Inc. encourages employees to set their Slack status to ‘focus time’ when they're handling individual work or ‘connecting’ to signal their availability to collaborate.

Salesforce recently tried its first ‘Async Week’ where 20000 of its nearly 70000 employees canceled routine meetings to make more time for solo work a spokeswoman said. Of those who participated in the experiment 72% said it made them more productive and 70% reported it made them less stressed. Two more async weeks are planned for this year.

Twitter is adopting a similar approach where teams come up with common hours that work for them to collaborate. It also recently experimented with a companywide ‘focus’ week where the majority of meetings were canceled and people could catch up on things like backlogged assignments.

“We had a very meeting-heavy culture"" said Megan Gleeson Twitter's vice president of career experience. “We started to see the number of meetings tick up throughout the pandemic so that people could find connection.""

Now Twitter encourages workers to think about ‘meeting hygiene’ which could involve setting a tight agenda for efficiency recording the meeting so people who can't join can still listen at a later time and considering whether the meeting really needs to happen at all Ms. Gleeson said.

There's still a lot for companies to iron out to make asynchronous models run smoothly Ms. Dean the former head of remote work at Facebook said. The biggest challenge to sort: ""This huge collaboration tax"" she added.

Workers can't string together enough hours in a row to focus so they sometimes work well beyond the traditional 9-to-5 schedule with pings and dings signaling requests coming to them from all over the internet. Going forward Ms. Dean predicts savvy employers will help people shrink their online time.

“There won't be the expectation that you need to be online 10 for hours a day available to other people"" she said.

Instead teams will do more front-end planning for projects and then send team members off with tasks and deadlines. For some hybrid models can work where people come in on set days of the week while other teams might need to work from an office for five days two weeks in a row to pound out a plan for a project; then they could work from home for several weeks as they deliver that project with online check-ins in the meantime.

This is how Amazon washes its hands of the climate impact of most of the things it sells: It simply decides to play by different rules than its peers.

But when shoppers click “Buy Now” on those same products on Amazon the nation’s largest online retailer doesn’t count those carbon emissions. Amazon takes responsibility for the full climate impact only of products with an Amazon brand label which make up about 1 percent of its online sales.

Amazon had been shamed with an F grade for failing to disclose until this past year when it submitted to CDP’s questionnaire for the first time. But unlike the majority of companies pressured by investors to disclose Amazon asked that its report not be shared publicly.

The report also highlights the pitfalls of relying on self-disclosures and voluntary commitments from companies that have a vested interest in underestimating their own accountability. Amazon has positioned itself as a climate change leader promoting a “Climate Pledge” to zero out emissions by 2040. But by not counting all of its emissions it isn’t on the hook for cutting them.

Amazon’s Biggest Climate Gap

Just take all the greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere from manufacturing the things a retailer sells. For everything with a plug add in the electricity they eat up when they’re on. Then tack on the emissions from eventually throwing them away.

For that lifecycle of consumer products Target’s report which it makes public showed triple the amount of carbon emissions that Amazon’s did. That represents 37.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide more than Amazon the equivalent of just over 8 million cars driven for a year.

And that’s for a year Amazon racked up well over $100 billion more in sales than Target. How is that possible? Well Amazon counts only products labeled with its private brands – the Echo Dots Kindles and AmazonBasics staples for example. Those the company has told Congress total 1 percent of its online sales.

There’s another 39 percent of sales that Amazon should be counting if it were using the same accounting as its peers. These are the products that Amazon buys from manufacturers and sells directly to the customer. They’re made by other companies – think Levi’s Nintendo Frigidaire – but their product listings say “ships from” and “sold by” Amazon.com. Target and Walmart stock these same brands. But unlike Target and Walmart Amazon doesn’t count the emissions that go into making these products – or those that come out of them.

So these products might even be labeled “Climate Pledge Friendly” on Amazon – like a box of Kleenex tissues. But the company doesn’t actually count them toward its Climate Pledge.

A product listing for Kleenex tissues at Amazon.com bears a “Climate Pledge Friendly” label even though Amazon does not count emissions related to products it sells with non-Amazon brands. Amazon.com screen shot

But the protocol doesn’t allow companies to count only their own private brand products. Under the protocol retail companies should be counting all the products they sell directly to consumers said Alberto Carrillo Pineda managing director of the Science Based Targets Initiative.

“Everything you purchased should be included and everything that you sell should be included” he said.

(Carrillo Pineda said his organization will have to get a third party to evaluate Amazon because it received $18 million from Amazon’s founder through the Bezos Earth Fund.)

It’s true that these indirect emissions from a company’s supply chain called Scope 3 emissions are notoriously difficult to tally and many companies use guesstimates. But they often represent the majority of a company’s impact on the environment and counting them forces companies to put pressure on suppliers to clean up their act too.

With triple the number of employees of Target in 2020 Amazon counted 29 percent fewer emissions from their commutes.

That’s because while Target Walmart and The Home Depot estimate the gas their workers burn while driving to and from work Amazon counts emissions only from its own corporate shuttles. Asked about the discrepancy Amazon’s Davila said: “Employees can use public transportation to get to the office and if they live nearby they can walk or bike.”

What It All Adds Up To

So with quadruple the revenue of Target in 2020 and a sprawling global empire that Target doesn’t have Amazon actually reported fewer overall emissions than Target that year: the equivalent of about 61 million metric tons of carbon dioxide for Amazon vs. 67 million metric tons for Target.

And that can have real-world consequences.

Both Amazon and Target have committed to going “net zero” by 2040 slashing carbon emissions and compensating for what’s left with carbon offsets. So because of what Amazon fails to count it’s on the hook for eventually canceling out fewer emissions than Target despite its far bigger impact on global temperatures.

Davila didn’t directly address why the company doesn’t account for the climate impact of most of the products it sells but reiterated its commitment to cutting emissions including ordering a fleet of electric delivery vans and buying renewable energy for its electricity needs.

“Amazon is also finding investing in and building new solutions to meet the urgency of the climate crisis” Davila said in a statement.

Amazon Trumpets Itself as a Climate Leader

Amazon is certainly not the worst carbon lowballer. Costco for example doesn’t count lifecycle emissions for any of the things it sells. The company whose internal slogan is “do the right thing” is facing blowback as shareholders voted to make it own up to all of its emissions and set concrete targets to cut them. Costco which allows its CDP report to be public is scheduled to disclose an action plan by the end of the year.

But Amazon has heralded itself as a leader of the pack on climate change a company others must follow to save the planet. “​​We want to use our scale and our scope to lead the way” founder Jeff Bezos said in announcing The Climate Pledge in 2019 positioning his company as “a role model for this.” The pledge now has more than 200 signatories and Amazon boasts a $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund and a Seattle sports stadium named the Climate Pledge Arena.

There’s a backstory to the company’s climate marketing. It’s faced intense pressure from a group of inside agitators Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. Bezos’ announcement came on the eve of an employee walkout protesting the company’s lack of action. Less than a year later two of the group’s organizers were fired in what the National Labor Relations Board determined was illegal retaliation leading to a settlement last year.

A group spokesperson Eliza Pan is actually a former employee. She speaks for the group because current employees are worried Amazon would exact vengeance if they spoke out.

When Reveal spoke to Pan about the report she expressed “frustration and anger that Amazon has hidden so much behind PR.”

“It seems like Amazon is misleading employees and the public” she said “or even being straight-up deceptive about how well it’s doing against its climate goals.”

Amazon’s Headed in the Wrong Direction Anyway

Faced with that inconvenient data point Amazon argues publicly that its “carbon intensity” – the amount of carbon it emits per dollar it makes – improved 16 percent in 2020.

“This year-over-year carbon intensity comparison reflects our early progress to decarbonize our operations as we also continue to grow as a company” Amazon’s public sustainability report states.

But privately Amazon’s CDP report shows a less impressive figure. CDP asks companies to measure carbon intensity based on their most direct impact and the hardest area to fudge: emissions from their own energy consumption and operations.

Looked at that way Amazon’s improvement was 3.9 percent in 2020 and didn’t stack up well against competitors. Amazon calculated a rate of about 39 metric tons of carbon emissions per $1 million of revenue compared with 29 for Walmart and 20 for Target. Asked about the comparison Davila said “We can’t speak for other companies.”

To avoid increasingly catastrophic ravages of climate disaster scientists warn that the Earth needs to reach “net zero” by midcentury. Humans are not on track and many environmentalists worry that corporate promises to save the world risk lulling the public into dangerous complacency.

A report from the NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch two European environmental organizations gave low marks to most of the large companies it looked at including Amazon and Walmart. ​“The change that we require from corporates in the situation that we’re in right now will not come from consumers or shareholders” said Eduardo Posada an institute analyst. “We need watchdog initiatives and regulators to hold them to account.”

Amazon though stays positive. “We are relentlessly optimistic about the future” Kara Hurst Amazon’s vice president of worldwide sustainability wrote in last year’s public sustainability report.

But the end of the report includes a boilerplate disclaimer: “No assurance can be given that any plan initiative projection goal commitment expectation or prospect set forth in this report can or will be achieved.”

In other words don’t hold us to it.

Financial access to higher education is a luxury — a luxury that Amazon employees will be afforded given the company’s latest Career Choice partnerships with national and local universities.

Amazon employees in Texas will have free educational access to nine colleges and universities and national online education providers including Southern New Hampshire University Colorado State University–Global Western Governors University and National University.

The partner schools in Texas include:

Alamo College

Austin Community College

Dallas College

Houston Community College

Lonestar College

Tarrant County Community College

Texas State University

University of Texas at Dallas

University of North Texas

“We’re excited to have been selected as a partner university for the Amazon Career Choice program” said Adam Fein vice president for Digital Strategy and Innovation at UNT. “In our discussions together we knew immediately we would be a good match. They were looking for a highly ranked diverse mature university with a strong presence in the area and we were thrilled to offer our in-person and online undergraduate programs to tens of thousands of Amazon employees in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and all across Texas.”

Career Choice is an upskilling program dedicated to the career advancement of its employees. The program is forever working to expand upon its opportunities to assist workers with the resources needed for success.

“I’m so proud of Amazon’s commitment to invest in the future of our employees by providing easier access to higher education” said Evan Luscher director of operations at Amazon in Texas. “Amazon’s dedication to upskill our employees and empower their future regardless of whether or not it benefits the company is truly remarkable. Initiatives like Career Choice can be lifechanging for some people and I look forward to seeing how the program evolves.”

Amazon’s rule of thumb for full tuition aid now “allows employees to participate every year they work at Amazon and gives them eligibility after only 90 days of employment” according to its newswire.

Amazon made an upskilling pledge for 2025 with the expansion of Career Choice in mind.

(Published 2022),"At the end of the last ice age South America was home to strange animals that have since vanished into extinction: giant ground sloths elephant-like herbivores and an ancient lineage of horses. A new study suggests that we can see these lost creatures in enchanting ocher paintings made by ice age humans on a rocky outcrop in the Colombian Amazon.

These dazzling rock art displays at Serranía de la Lindosa a site on the remote banks of the Guayabero River were long known to the area’s Indigenous people but were virtually off limits to researchers because of the Colombian Civil War. Recent expeditions led by José Iriarte an archaeologist at the University of Exeter in England have sparked renewed interest and heated debate over the interpretation of the animals in the paintings.

“The whole biodiversity of the Amazon is painted there” Dr. Iriarte said both aquatic and land creatures and plants as well as “animals that are very intriguing and appear to be ice age large mammals.”

Dr. Iriarte and his colleagues who are part of a project studying human arrival in South America defend the case that the rock art depicts ice age megafauna in a study that was published on Monday in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. But as the study itself acknowledges the identification of extinct animals in rock art is extremely controversial — and the site at La Lindosa is no exception.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vaWxvdmV0aGV1cHBlcndlc3RzaWRlLmNvbS9hbWF6b24tYm9va3MtdG8tY2xvc2UtYWxsLWxvY2F0aW9ucy1jb2x1bWJ1cy1jaXJjbGUtaW5jbHVkZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Books to Close All Locations (Columbus Circle Included) - iLovetheUpperWestSide.com,"About The Author

How could this average Midwestern dude keep up with two titans of the industry guys who earn 500000 Membership Rewards for buying a car and use miles to hang out with Richard Branson on his private island without breaking a sweat?

I’m already a One World Emerald and do almost all of my domestic travel via Alaska so I wasn’t terribly interested in the status in and of itself. I fully expected this first reveal to be a post of shame to be the token “well he gave it a shot” guy on the FM totem pole.

AA Loyalty Posts & Tools

If you’re interested in earning American Airlines elite status without flying (or wondering why others are interested) these posts will help:

Tim’s Progress

As of today March 6th 2022 I’ve earned 39405 Loyalty Points and have another 5800 points pending. I’m 31.5% of the way towards my goal of earning 125000 AA Loyalty Points with another 4.6% of the goal pending. I’m fairly thrilled at the progress so far as I’ve made it over 1/2 of the way to Platinum and 1/3 of the way to Platinum Pro in two months. This gives me a full year to get the other 85000 points I need to get to Platinum Pro or just over 7000 pts/month. This seems very doable.

I’m also feeling very good about my Cost Per Point (CPP). When figuring out my “excess cost” on a deal my basic formula is:

Actual Cost – What I would have paid for the deal without miles – Amex/Citi/Chase offer + 2.2% Cashback (because of the Nearside debit card) = Excess Cost

I try to be pretty ruthless with the “what I would have paid for the deal” metric: $3 per bottle of wine including shipping $4 per meal for meal kits. It’s what would be such a good deal that it would be a no-brainer to try it. The one exception is giftcards.com where I just factored in the 2.2% cashback missed activation/liquidation of Visa Gift cards and shipping as excess cost.

Using this formula (which some will disagree with) my current average cost per point/mile is .38 cents. The Byte deal helped this out a ton as it was profitable before even considering miles gained. I’d be a buyer of AA miles at .38 CPP without even considering Loyalty Points so getting the combination is the extra gravy on the potatoes.

Here are Greg and Nick’s progress reports.

What Deals Worked?

I consider myself extremely lucky as all of deals that I signed-up for tracked appropriately and earned both Loyalty Points and redeemable miles (*rubs rabbit’s foot*). Here’s a full list:

What’s next?

It might be beginner’s luck or maybe I’m a little too fond of wine deals. Regardless it’s on like Donkey Kong and the competition’s only going to get more intense moving forward. Greg won’t be workcationing in California every month (I think?) and Nick is stockpiling old cell phones and SIM cards so that he’s fresh and ready for the next round of Verizon deals.

My goal is to average about 10000 points a month to account for foibles along the way and give me some extra time. That’s not a heavy lift and I feel confident that Platinum Pro is in my future. But I can feel the AA-shaped target on my back…can I continue to keep pace with Nick and Greg?

We called him Mega Man a reference to a Nintendo character with a canon for an arm both because of the cast and because of his incredible tenacity and speed. My coach liked to front-load our relay teams with our fastest runners going in the first couple of slots whereas most teams had their fastest runners on the anchor leg. The strategy for us was to jump out to a big enough lead to demoralize the more-talented and surely capable-of-beating-us Mega Man. It worked — we went to the state championships that year leaving Mega Man huffing and puffing at the finish line despite the fact that he was much faster than our anchor man.

Fast forward to today: Greg is my new Mega Man and I’m doing what I can to sprint out ahead and get some distance on him in the first leg of the race. He recently published an update on his American Airlines Loyalty Point progress showing that he is on a slow and steady pace toward reaching high-level American Airlines elite status without flying. While his slow and steady pace may prove to win the race I have come out of the gate a bit stronger yet: I sit at just over 38000 Loyalty Points — more than enough for American Airlines AAdvantage Gold status and more than halfway to Platinum status in month one.

AA Loyalty Posts & Tools

As a reminder if you’re interested in earning American Airlines elite status without flying (or wondering why others are interested) these posts will help:

Half-Reversed Claw-backs were good to me. Verizon was my big score.

Greg wrote about half-reversed claw backs and in my case that worked out even better than it did for Greg.

That’s because I opened a total of 5 Verizon prepaid lines through American Airlines eShopping. Four of those lines were opened when the payout was 6200 miles and one was opened when the payout was only 3700 miles. That’s a total of 28500 miles from Verizon prepaid activations.

Unfortunately the redeemable miles from those orders were clawed back. Fortunately I still got the Loyalty Points for those orders.

While losing the redeemable miles was an annoyance I was able to make some saves. First of all the lines wouldn’t cost me much if I just kept them for a month and cancelled. I opened two of the lines using a $75 back on $75 offer from Amex so they cost me about $3 net (I placed a single order for two lines and the total came to just over $78). I had also opened a single line that was $44.40 and I had a Chase Offer for $30 back (which has since paid out) dropping the net cost to about $15. The other two lines cost me $40 each (actually $39 but let’s keep the math easier).

If I had simply canceled the lines after month one I would have paid out a grand total of less than a hundred bucks for 28500 Loyalty Points — just over a third of a cent per Loyalty Point.

However in reality I’ll do quite a bit better. Had it not been for the chance to earn AA Loyalty Points I never would have thought to look at opening Verizon lines for the miles. However since I suddenly had Verizon phone numbers I thought that maybe I could do something profitable with them. Wireless phone providers often offer incentives to switch carriers.

In perfect timing Visible Mobile came out with a deal to sign up and switch and bring your own device and get a $200 virtual Mastercard Gift Card. Getting the Mastercard requires maintaining service for 3 months.

I’ve done a similar deal with Visible once before so I am familiar enough with them to feel confident that the deal will be honored (and the promotion shows up in my account details at Visible).

I therefore ported all 5 lines to Visible. I will pay:

Line 1 = $25 per month x 3 = $75

Line 2 = $25 per month x 3 = $75

Line 3 = $11 per month for the first 2 months + $25 for month #3 = $47

Line 4 = $11 per month for the first 2 months + $25 for month #3 = $47

Line 5 = $11 per month for the first 2 months + $25 for month #3 = $47

I opened the first two lines because while there was a promo to pay $22 for the first two months I didn’t think it would stack with the $200 rebate offer. However when I found out that it did I ported the rest of the lines on that deal.

I went through the American Airlines AAdvantage shopping portal for the first of my Visible lines for 2000 miles (not yet posted). The portal had terms indicating that you were only eligible for the miles for Visible service one time per AAdvantage loyalty account. Therefore I used other shopping portals for my other four lines. I assumed that each portal could be used once so I opened each of my five lines through a separate portal / account:

Line 1 = 2000 American Airlines miles

Line 2 = 3000 Membership Rewards points through Player 1’s Rakuten account

Line 3 = 3000 Membership Rewards points through Player 2’s Rakuten account

Line 4 = $30 cash back from Capital One Shopping

Line 5 = $30 cash back from TopCashBack

My total cash outlay looks like this:

Verizon: $100 (amount paid for 5 lines after initial Amex / Chase offers)

Visible: $291 (total for 3 months of service on all 5 lines)

Total spent = $391

And here’s what I expect to earn:

Five $200 Mastercard Gift Cards ($1000 total)

$60 cash back from cash back portals

6000 total Membership Rewards points

2000 more American Airlines miles / Loyalty Points

28500 Loyalty Points (already earned)

In other words if we value the Mastercard Gift Cards at about face value I’ll have earned more than six hundred dollars on this deal and come out with more than 30000 Loyalty Points (as well as some other miles / points) by the time this is all said and done (that’s 28500 so far from the Verizon lines and the 2000 for my first Visible order that I’m still waiting to see). I should note that none of the Visible Mobile portal rewards have shown up yet but all of the orders tracked with an order number in the respective portals so I suspect the delay is just in how Visible processes these.

It isn’t right that the AAdvantage portal clawed back the miles on the Verizon orders. Prepaid was listed as an option and they clawed back the miles before I had even ported out the lines so it isn’t like they had some secret minimum timeframe to maintain service. However I haven’t bothered to follow up on that since I am satisfied enough that this deal worked out very well for me. Indeed my AAdvantage Gold status is mostly thanks to this.

What else has worked?

I have almost 10000 Loyalty Points that did not come from Verizon lines. Those include:

Sunbaskets: 3700 Loyalty Points from American Airlines eShopping.

Babylist: 1000 Loyalty Points from American Airlines eShopping (miles were clawed back)

The House: 630 Loyalty Points from American Airlines eShopping (a family member had ordered a Christmas present for my family that was backordered and ultimately canceled so they asked me to go ahead and order it myself and they would pay me back)

Lowe’s: 1980 Loyalty Points. This was an order for a family member who reimbursed me for the purchase.

Lowe’s: 2289 Loyalty Points. This was an order for a family member who reimbursed me for the purchase.

Those last two Lowe’s orders were kind of an oddity. A family member was looking to buy a snow plow and the local dealer had one for six or seven thousand dollars. I suggested checking around online and we ultimately found one at Lowe’s that surely isn’t as good but was a lot cheaper. We placed the first order and then minutes later he decided he wanted a different plow so we ordered a different plow from Lowe’s. Without getting into the details I got the Loyalty Points from both orders and I don’t expect either to get clawed back (you’ll just have to take my word for it on that). He reimbursed me for the plow without complaint as it saved him a few thousand bucks and he didn’t have a use for the miles.

Together with the 28500 points from Verizon orders that’s my 38099 Loyalty Points.

What’s next?

I haven’t yet done a number of the deals in our Cheat Sheet. Specifically I’ve been checking MarketWatch Barron’s and The Wall Street Journal daily waiting to see payouts on those increase beyond 1000 miles each (right now it is a $21 total investment for 3K miles/Loyalty Points but I’m hoping to see the payouts go up to 1500 miles each). This month I expect to earn the 2000 Loyalty Points that I’m due from Visible Mobile I’ll do the free Blooom offer for 1200 Loyalty Points and I’ll hope to see a chance for 4500 points from the financial newsletter subscriptions. That’ll be another 7700 miles for a total additional outlay of $21. At one time in my life I’d have said that you couldn’t pay me enough to chase after American Airlines elite status — but another profitable deal or two and I may prove myself wrong.

For now I have Mega Man in my rear view mirror and I’m hoping to keep it that way. Now here’s hoping that while I’m peering in the rear view mirror I’m not about to get blindsided by Tim."

SAF-HOLLAND at the Technology and Maintenance Council's 2022 Annual Meeting & Transportation Technology Exhibition in Orlando Sunday announced it has begun market and product development phase of its trailer electric axles on real-world transportation applications for North America.

Since first presented at the 2018 IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hanover Germany electric axles from SAF-HOLLAND have gone through further development steps and the SAF TRAKr (or recuperative axle) is currently undergoing testing around the world. The SAF TRAKr uses a high-voltage generator module for electric power regeneration to lower the emissions and fuel consumption of the overall vehicle. SAF-HOLLAND e- axles have been undergoing rigorous testing in real-world operation in Europe and South Africa.

That the recuperative axle recharges the battery as it drives it comes with more flexibility and range than a shore power model and allows the system to use a smaller battery pack said Bill Hicks product manager Axle/Suspension Systems–Americas

TRAKr e-axle targets refrigerated fleets and allows trailer refrigeration units (TRU) to run fully electric and allows the trailer’s TRU to operate when uncoupled without the use of diesel fuel.

The modular trailer e-axle system allows for easy installation by trailer manufacturers and uses standard assembly line procedures. The TRAKr e-axle will be available in the future on both SAF mechanical and air suspension tandem axle slider systems for reefer trailer applications. The e-axle is is connected to a battery pack and its operation is controlled by a control system.

The electrical generator drive unit does not have to be removed when servicing the wheel ends. Wheel-end componentry with the exclusion of the proprietary hub assemblies remains unchanged for easy serviceability. Wear parts such as brake pads calipers and brake disc rotors are standard SAF-HOLLAND components to ensure and simplify spare parts supply and servicing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm93ZW5zYm9yb3RpbWVzLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzEwMzg0Ni1kYXZpZC1nLWNsaW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David G.

“Human-induced climate change and the war on Ukraine have the same roots fossil fuels and our dependence on them” said Svitlana Krakovska of the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute as the IPCC unveiled its report on climate impacts.

Certainly fossil fuels are not the direct cause of a war clearly driven by the singular will of President Vladimir Putin. The world has struggled to comprehend his motives which analysts have suggested include expansionism grievance toward the neighboring Soviet state and a desire to reassemble what he has described as “historical Russia.”

But on a deeper level Krakovska is right say those who have studied fossil fuel-dependent states and aggression: Whatever is driving Putin his war machine is fueled by oil and gas.

“Putin is able to use the oil money to get rid of any domestic political constraints and to build a military and a war chest to allow these kinds of foreign policy adventures” said Jeff Colgan director of the Climate Solutions Lab at Brown University. “In that way Putin’s Russia falls into a category of states that would include Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and Muammar Qaddafi’s Libya.”

In his book “Petro-Aggression” Colgan lays out his research showing that “petrostates” countries with economies and federal budgets reliant on oil and gas exports are about 50 percent more conflict-prone than non-petrostates.

The oil and gas industry makes up as much as one-fifth of Russia’s Gross Domestic Product which is relatively small less than half the size of the GDP of the United Kingdom even though it has more than double the population. Oil and gas accounts for 60 percent of the nation’s exports and 30 percent of federal budget revenue giving Putin a large pot of money for which he is not accountable to citizen taxpayers.

“Russia is a gas station masquerading as a country” the late U.S. Sen. John McCain once said.

It’s not surprising that Russia the world’s third-largest historic contributor to greenhouse gas pollution behind the United States and China has resisted global action on climate change.

But Putin has undermined the foundations of his petrostate with his violence in Ukraine. European Union energy policy makers last week announced a 10-part plan to end the continent’s deep dependence on Russian natural gas and accelerate its transition away from fossil fuels.

Even though the United States and its NATO allies carefully designed their first rounds of economic sanctions against Russia to avoid its oil and gas sector the private sector is retreating en masse from doing business with Putin’s regime. Oil majors BP Shell and ExxonMobil withdrew from ventures in Russia commodities traders stopped buying Russian barrels and in the United States there were bipartisan calls to cut off Russian oil imports.

“Nothing is off the table” President Joe Biden said when asked if he would go along with such a move. Economists said Putin will still be able to sell oil in Asia but at deeply discounted prices.

No one knows how instability in the Russian petrostate will play out but it surely will have implications for climate change. U.S. oil and gas producers have seized the moment as an opportunity to push for the expansion of their export infrastructure as an investment in energy security. If they succeed in pushing through these multi-billion dollar projects it will lock in future business—and carbon emissions—for years to come. At the same time environmental activists see an opportunity to rally support for redoubling efforts on clean energy.

“This feels like it may be one of the last real choice points we get on this journey” Bill McKibben the climate activist and 350.org founder said in an interview last week on MSNBC. “If we can’t bring ourselves to do this while we’re watching the pictures of people demonstrating just incredible courage in Ukraine then I don’t know if we’re ever going to.”

Invasions and High Oil Prices

One of the constants in the last few decades of Russia’s history of foreign aggression has been its connection with oil wealth in the view of Cullen Hendrix a professor at the University of Denver and co-author of several books on fossil fuels and conflict.

The Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan occurred in 1979 a year when world oil prices were skyrocketing due to the conflict in the Middle East that devolved into the Iran-Iraq war. In 2008 soon after global oil prices reached what would be their all-time peak Putin’s Russia invaded Georgia presaging the Ukraine attack as an attempt to regain control in a former Soviet state. In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea at a time when oil prices were volatile but high due to their rebound from the global recession.

“It’s really difficult not to view Russia’s history of expansionary foreign policy dating back to the Soviet Union through this lens of the way in which its strategic calculations are shaped by its status as a petrostate” said Hendrix who is also a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Just weeks before Putin’s Feb. 20 invasion of Ukraine Russia’s finance ministry announced the budgetary windfall it had enjoyed in 2021 as a result of unexpectedly high oil and gas prices. The Russian government’s oil and gas revenues exceeded initial estimates by more than 51 percent. In October as Europe struggled with high natural gas prices caused in part by a slowdown in Russian supplies Russia was taking in almost $500 million per day in fossil fuel revenue.

“There’s this sense in which oil prices in petrostates affect the risk-reward calculations” Hendrix said. “If oil prices were to crash into the $20 a barrel range it would be very difficult for Putin to do what he’s doing because he would be facing a variety of crises on the domestic front. On the other hand when the central coffers are flush and Putin knows that at least in the short term an invasion is actually going to send prices even higher that might imbue that leader with a temporary sort of irrational exuberance.”

The behavior of petrostates is shaped not just by the sheer quantity of money that oil and gas brings them but the way that the cash pours in from outside national borders Colgan said.

When a federal budget is funded by the nation’s own taxpayers they feel empowered to decry misuse of funds forcing accountability on leaders Colgan argues. So in the United States a nation born out of a revolution sparked in part by outrage over taxation without representation power over federal spending belongs not to the President but to Congress in a process that is—if not smooth—replete with checks and balances.

“People have a sense when they’re paying taxes that they own the government” Colgan said. “But when you rely on oil export revenue that relationship flips where the government starts to feel that it owns the people or can push around the people. And that creates a political problem.”

Colgan’s research shows that not all petrostates are aggressive states but they tend to become so if petro-power becomes personalized or concentrated in the hands of a single leader.

“Every Russian can’t help but worry” over the power that oil gives Putin says Mikhail Khordokovsky the former Russian oil oligarch exiled in London.

Khordokovsky knows much about the flow of oil money in Russia; as CEO of the now-defunct Yukos oil company he was once believed to be the richest man in Russia. But after he became a Kremlin critic Putin jailed him for a decade. After his release in 2013 Khordokovsky left the country and founded the pro-democracy group Open Russia.

In one of the “Explaining Russia” videos he has posted to his website Khordokovsky said Russia oil and gas revenue funds the lavish lifestyles of Putin and his allies and supports the apparatus that cracks down on dissent.

“Take away the oil revenues” he said “and the number of special services and police personnel will be reduced to a normal European level. It will be impossible for voters to be spat on where we see how everyday voters are met by force.”

As Putin’s troops gained ground against fierce resistance in Ukraine last week and thousands of anti-war protesters were arrested across Russia Khordokovsky predicted the “decomposition” of Putin’s regime in an interview with French television.

Putin “cannot win in Ukraine even by taking Kyiv and Kharkiv” Khordokovsky said. He predicted that Putin will not be able to contain the internal dissent once Russian soldiers return in coffins and the population begins to suffer the effects of economic sanctions and international isolation.

De Facto Oil Sanctions

After Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine the United States and other NATO allies avoided striking directly at the oil and gas sector even though they knew that it was the way to do the most damage to Putin. They sought to avoid collateral damage to European countries that were dependent on Russian gas imports. And they feared shocking the global economy with an abrupt cutoff of one of its biggest oil suppliers.

Even while lauding the bravery of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky as he rallied his citizens from undisclosed locations in the besieged capital of Kyiv Western leaders declined to heed his call to cut Russia off entirely from international financial transactions. The trans-Atlantic coalition allowed continued purchases of natural gas by Germany Italy and other nations connected to Russia’s pipelines.

But BP quickly announced it would abandon its 20 percent stake in Russia’s giant oil company Rosneft taking as much as a $25 billion write-down and withdrawing finance and expertise from a giant Arctic project that was to be the nation’s largest oil investment since the fall of the Soviet Union. Shell announced it would exit its longstanding partnership with the Russian gas giant Gazprom with CEO Ben van Beurden calling the Ukraine invasion a “senseless act of aggression.” ExxonMobil soon followed announcing it would leave behind $4 billion in oil and gas investments in Russia.

The departures were likely driven not only by concerns about the risks of holding investments in the country but also about the reputational damage that would have come from maintaining them. The blow was most significant for BP—its stake in Rosneft accounted for about half of its oil and gas reserves and one-third of its production. Exxon said it would “carefully manage” its exit and declined to say how long that would take but its Russian project was not a core part of the company’s future plans. For Russia’s oil and gas production the impacts are not clear but analysts with Raymond James said in a note that any effects would be felt over the course of years.

Meanwhile in the commodities markets where oil and gas futures are sold traders backed away from purchases of oil and petroleum products from Russia. “The enablers of oil exports—the banks insurance companies tanker companies and even multinational oil companies—have enacted what amounts to a de facto ban” Tom Kloza global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service told The New York Times. Perhaps driven more by fear of running afoul of sanctions than by moral outrage the are moves likely to ripple through the commodities markets for weeks.

Crude oil which was selling for less than $80 per barrel at the end of 2021 jumped to more than $115 per barrel on the world market last week. JPMorgan estimated the price could be $185 per barrel by the end of the year.

Such soaring prices ironically would be a boon to Russia and would help offset the losses it suffers on the global market where analysts predict it will only be able to sell its barrels at deeply discounted prices—likely in Asia.

But the impact of the war is complex and still evolving; in the end the upheaval in the markets may not work to Russia’s benefit. The consultancy Rystad Energy last week said a prolonged war could cut demand for oil by as much as 1 million barrels per day in the Ukraine and Russia as economic sanctions and violence constrain economic activity and damage infrastructure.

Meanwhile European Union officials developed a 10-point plan for cutting Russian natural gas imports by a third within the coming year and eventually phasing them out altogether. “For decades and decades the European gas supply has been dominated by Russia” said Fatih Birol executive director of the International Energy Agency the organization that Western nations established after the oil shocks of the 1970s to enhance energy security. “What we are experiencing today is Russia using its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon and this is clear to everyone in the world.”

Pundits predicted there would be division in Europe on how to respond to Russia since some countries—notably Germany and Italy—are more dependent on Putin for their natural gas supplies than others. But Germany immediately announced that it would withdraw approvals for the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline turning the conduit that was to expand Russian imports into Europe into a literal $11 billion sunk cost at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

In the short term the EU plan calls for no renewal of the natural gas contracts that are set to expire with Russia in the coming months. All EU nations would increase natural gas imports from other countries and fill their strategic reserves of natural gas before next winter. But in the longer term the IEA and EU leaders announced a proposed series of steps to accelerate clean energy: fast-tracking permitting for wind and solar projects revisiting decisions to phase out nuclear energy doubling the rate of conversions from natural gas boilers to electric heat pumps in buildings—moves designed to permanently cut European natural gas demand.

“More than ever ending our dependency on Russian fossil fuels and fossil fuels in general is essential” said Barbara Pompili France’s minister for the ecological transition who helped develop the proposal. “What is at stake is both the need to accelerate our fight against climate change and the energy security and independence of the European continent.”

Increased U.S. Energy Exports Won’t Be Good for the Climate

In the United States politicians of both parties called for a ban on U.S. imports of Russian oil and oil products which have been growing in the past decade and made up about 9 percent of U.S. imports last year. But the oil industry may be ahead of Washington in acting. Kelly Russell a Chevron spokeswoman said the company had halted imports of Russian oil and had no plans to resume them “in the foreseeable future.”

But in the United States much of the political push to lock Putin out of the energy markets is coupled with a call to ease the pathway for U.S. producers to pick up Russia’s customers particularly the lucrative European market. Fracking has helped the United States surpass Russia as the world’s largest natural gas producer but to export more the industry needs more pipelines and more of the expensive facilities that turn gas into super-cooled liquefied natural gas (LNG) so it can be shipped overseas.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) chairman of the Senate Energy Committee and the key Democrat who has been blocking Biden’s big climate spending package last week announced his proposal for getting the package back on track while addressing Russian aggression.

Manchin wants a revamped “Build Back Better” bill to ban U.S. oil imports from Russia as well as ramp up all oil gas and coal production as well as provide support for clean energy. He also chaired a hearing designed to air concerns he has raised over a new federal policy that might constrain new gas pipelines because of their impact on climate change. His remarks dovetailed with those of the American Petroleum Institute which last week pushed for an easing up of regulatory restraints as an energy security imperative.

In a call with reporters on Thursday Frank Macchiarola the institute’s senior vice president of policy economics and regulatory affairs said the invasion had brought into focus “many of the points we’ve been making for years” namely that the federal government should remove barriers to producing and exporting domestic oil and gas as part of an effort to improve security. “The only long-term solution is growing America’s energy leadership” he said.

Environmental activists raised concerns that a new push by U.S. producers would take the world further off course from achieving the decarbonization necessary to stabilize the climate. “The fossil fuel industry is using this moment to advance their own special interests and push for more oil and gas drilling” tweeted the environmental group NRDC.

Putin has long criticized the United States for hypocrisy on climate even while he has stood in the way of strong global action. At last year’s global climate summit organized by Biden Putin chided the United States for its temporary withdrawal from the 2015 Paris accord under President Donald Trump. Russia treats its international commitments with “the utmost responsibility” Putin said.

But Putin’s pledge under the Paris accord is so weak that it actually allows for Russia to increase its emissions through 2030 since he uses as his baseline 1990 the year of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the high point for Russia’s emissions. On the eve of the Glasgow summit last year Putin released a new “low-carbon” strategy calling for carbon neutrality by 2060 but it contained no details on how he proposed to cut emissions.

Climate activists argue the only way to stop both the emissions and the aggression of petrostates like Russia is by choking off demand. McKibben called for the United States to consider investments in energy efficiency and clean energy as security and defense investments. For example he said the Defense Production Act could be used to build and send electric heat pumps to Europe permanently cutting natural gas demand and shrinking Russia’s power.

“Think of all the other autocrats that depend on oil and gas revenues to do what they do” he said. “Why do we pay attention to the King of Saudi Arabia? Because he’s got too much oil. Why do the Koch brothers get to buy a political party and use it to deform our democracy? Because they’re our biggest oil and gas barons. If we get off this stuff the possibilities for the world are truly remarkable.”

Colgan said it’s not yet clear whether the Russia-Ukraine conflict will accelerate the move to clean energy or put the brakes on.

“One narrative out there is ‘Oh God climate is going to have to go on the back burner because this crisis is just too important and we have to focus on that'” Colgan said. “On the other hand this crisis drives home the reality that fossil fuel dependence has some very serious negative consequences and we should be moving harder we should be doubling down on our efforts to bring about a clean energy transition.”

He said he sees a strong sense of the latter view in the European Union’s proposal to get off of Russian gas while staying true to the European Green Deal.

“There should be a sense in Europe that they have paid for this war” he said. “I’m not saying the moral culpability is as simple as that but there needs to be an awareness that an enabling condition for Vladimir Putin was the oil money and the gas money.”

American Express (AXP) is the latest credit card company to announce it is ending its operations in Russia as its invasion into Ukraine escalates.

On Sunday the company said in a statement that globally issued American Express cards will no longer work in Russia and cards issued in Russia won’t work outside the country.

American Express also said it is ending its business operations in Belarus.

“This is in addition to the previous steps we have taken which include halting our relationships with banks in Russia impacted by the US and international government sanctions” American Express said in a statement Sunday.

In a memo from chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri American Express said it does not employ anyone directly in Ukraine but it does have “dozens of colleagues” in Russia.

Other credit card companies have taken similar steps this weekend.

Mastercard (MA) said Saturday it was suspending its network services in Russia. Cards supported by Russian banks will not work in Mastercard (MA)’s network and any cards issued outside of Russia will not work within the country.

“Our colleagues our customers and our partners have been affected in ways that most of us could not imagine” Mastercard said in a statement Saturday. “This decision flows from our recent action to block multiple financial institutions from the Mastercard payment network as required by regulators globally.”

The company which has operated in Russia for more than 25 years had previously announced that it had “blocked multiple financial institutions” from its network as a result of sanctions on Russia and would “continue to work with regulators in the days ahead.”

Visa (V) said Saturday it is suspending all of its operations in Russia.

American Express followed suit on Sunday and said they would be suspending operations in Russia.

American Express said their cards will no longer work at merchants or ATMs in Russia. Additionally American Express said they will be terminating all business operations in Belarus.

""One of our company values is to 'Do What is Right'"" American Express said in a statement. ""This principle has guided us throughout this difficult crisis and will continue to do so as we stand by our colleagues customers and the international community in hoping for a peaceful resolution to this crisis.""

Mastercard said cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by its network and any Mastercard issued outside the country will not work at Russian stores or ATMs.

""We don't take this decision lightly"" Mastercard said in a statement adding that it made the move after discussions with customers partners and governments.

Visa said it's working with clients and partners in Russia to cease all Visa transactions over the coming days.

""We are compelled to act following Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed"" Visa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly said in a statement.

The twin suspensions were announced within 16 minutes of each other and they followed a private video call earlier in the day between President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and U.S. lawmakers. During that conversation Zelensky ""asked us to turn off MasterCard and Visa for Russia"" Representative Brad Sherman a Democrat from California tweeted. ""I agree"" he added before Mastercard and Visa made their announcements.

Earlier in the week Visa and Mastercard had announced more limited moves to block financial institutions from the networks that serve as arteries for the payments system. Russian people have already been hit hard by heavy sanctions and financial penalties imposed by the U.S. government and others.

Since the invasion of Ukraine the value of the Russian currency the ruble has plunged by more than a third to a record low. That's pushing up inflation for Russian households and all the fear has helped cause long lines at ATMs.

Many other companies around the world have also made moves to increase the financial pressure on Russia and its people because of its attack on Ukraine. Some are selling their stakes in Russian companies such as energy giant BP while others like Harley-Davidson halted product shipments to the country.

""This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values"" Visa's Kelly said.

The moves by Mastercard and Visa could make real differences to their bottom lines. Russia accounted for 4% of all of Visa's net revenue in its last fiscal year including money made from domestic and cross-border activities. Ukraine accounted for about 1% Visa said in a filing with U.S. securities regulators this week.

Mastercard said in its own filing that about 4% of its net revenues during 2021 came from business conducted within into and out of Russia. Another roughly 2% was related to Ukraine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzA4MTE5Yjk1LWVlMjYtNGY2NC1iZTQzLTQ5YzU3Yzc1YjAzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visa Mastercard and American Express suspend operations in Russia,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

The trip is the highest-level visit by Washington officials to Caracas Venezuela’s capital in years. The United States broke off diplomatic relations with Mr. Maduro and closed its embassy in Caracas in 2019 after accusing the authoritarian leader of electoral fraud. The Trump administration then tried to topple Mr. Maduro’s government by sanctioning Venezuelan oil exports and the country’s senior officials and by recognizing the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s lawful president.

Mr. Maduro responded to the sanctions by seeking economic and diplomatic help from Russia as well as from Iran and China. Russian energy companies and banks have been instrumental in allowing Venezuela to continue exporting oil the country’s biggest source of foreign currency despite the sanctions according to U.S. officials Venezuelan officials and businessmen.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted the United States to pay closer attention to President Vladimir V. Putin’s allies in Latin America which Washington believes could become security threats if the standoff with Russia deepens according to current and former U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive policy matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy9zdG9saS12b2RrYS1yZWJyYW5kLXJ1c3NpYS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMy8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy9zdG9saS12b2RrYS1yZWJyYW5kLXJ1c3NpYQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stoli vodka announces rebrand,"New York CNN —

The maker of Stolichnaya vodka announced a major rebrand Friday in direct response to its founder’s “vehement position” against the Putin regime and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The vodka famously marketed as Russian will now be sold and marketed simply as Stoli the company said in a statement.

Stoli Group’s founder Russian-born billionaire Yuri Shefler was exiled from that nation in 2000 because of his opposition to Putin. The liquor has long been marketed as Russian vodka but its production facilities have been in Latvia since that year. Stoli Group is a unit of Luxembourg-based SPI Group.

The company also cited its employees’ desire to take action and to accurately represent the vodka’s Latvian roots.

Earlier this week Stoli Group announced it would only use Slovakian sources to make sure that none of its ingredients are sourced from Russia.

Officials in states from Ohio to New Hampshire have called on liquor stores to remove Russian-made or Russian-branded products from their shelves – which in most cases means vodka. Some bar owners have even dumped out Stoli vodka in protest.

These boycotts and protests are unlikely to have much impact however. Russian-made vodka accounts for a very small percentage of the roughly $7 billion in annual vodka sales according to the Distilled Spirits Council (DISCUS) a national trade organization that represents spirits makers.

In the United States less than 1% of vodka consumed is produced in Russia. More than half of all vodka consumed domestically is actually made in the US according to data from IWSR Drinks Market Analysis a global firm that tracks alcohol sales.

What does it take for a product to survive and thrive generation after generation? For some companies it is adhering to the ideas of a visionary founder; for others it’s adapting to the market. Some products that we’ve known forever have become part of conglomerates and while they maintain their brand identity to a greater or lesser degree have become just one of many products under a giant umbrella – but at least they’ve managed to last.

To determine the oldest products on the market in America 24/7 Tempo derived information from History and other historical websites company websites state and city history sources and various media outlets. Some material was updated from previous 24/7 lists.

Boldface names like Heinz Kraft and Campbell’s made the list. So did uniquely American soft drinks including Coca-Cola Pepsi and Hires Root Beer – as well as one historic beer brand. (These are America’s 30 oldest beers.)

There are also some candy companies whose output has defied Father Time – and a number of firms making candy and other products still owned or run by their founding families. (These are the largest Fortune 500 companies still run by their founders.)

Some of the items that have stood the test of time are household cleaning products such as 20 Mule Team Borax Libman corn brooms and Murphy’s Soap. And in the kitchen you might use cutlery and cookware made by American companies that are more than 100 years old.

Brands like Brooks Brothers which has made ready-to-wear suits since the California Gold Rush of 1849 and luxury goods provider Tiffany remain the gold standards in their respective industries by not compromising on quality even as tastes and their competitors have changed.

> Birth year: 1837 Tiffany & Co. originally founded as a “stationery and fancy goods emporium” has been a leader in the industry for over 150 years. The company’s importance can be seen in the impact it has had on the silverware and jewelry business. Tiffany & Co. has used the same 925/1000 standard for silver purity since 1837 – a standard later adopted by the United States government for sterling silver. At the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle Tiffany was the first American company to win an award for its silverware. In 1871 the company introduced a flatware pattern called Audobon which to-date remains the company’s best-selling flatware. Today Tiffany sells silver bracelets necklaces piggy banks and silverware among many other other items.

Originally three stories tall and three blocks long it runs north to south along West Street in lower Manhattan. Built in 1934 by the New York Central Railroad it was designed to hold two hundred and twenty-seven fully laden freight cars which arrived and departed thirty feet above the ground at the end point of the elevated tracks that would eventually become known as the High Line. Last fall Google announced its intention to purchase the terminal from the developer Oxford Properties for $2.1 billion—the biggest single-building commercial-real-estate deal in the city since the pandemic began.

The tech company’s executives said that they had important plans for the building. At the time like every other large employer of a white-collar workforce Google was asking itself medical economic and philosophical questions about the future of the workplace. Most Google employees were working remotely and would continue to do so for some time. “As Google moves toward a more flexible hybrid approach to work coming together in person to collaborate and build community will remain an important part of our future” Google’s chief financial officer Ruth Porat wrote in a blog post. “It is why we continue investing in our offices around the world.”

A few weeks ago I took a tour of the place with the architect Rick Cook a founding partner of COOKFOX Architects and Dean Shapiro a senior executive at Oxford Properties. Oxford the real-estate arm of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System acquired the building in 2017 and brought in COOKFOX to rehab it soon after. “We’re into the future of the workplace” Cook said a few moments after shaking my hand. Cook is tall and trim with pale-blue eyes and a practiced confident bearing. He looked up at the not-quite-finished building: above the three tan brick stories of its original facade nine gleaming floors of glass and steel rose like the second tier of a wedding cake. Cook has been thinking about the future of the workplace long enough to see more than one future come and go. Fifteen years ago his firm designed the Bank of America Tower which officially opened in 2010 after the financial crash. Back then the future was among other things vertical. “Skyscraper mode” he said with a little shake of his head. “Another generation.”

Today’s future is different. Cook mentioned lofty core values he believes will define it: “health and wellness” “flexibility and resiliency” and “authenticity.” Also today’s future is more horizontal. St. John’s Terminal when completed will be twelve stories tall but contain 1.3 million square feet of usable space. The Bank of America Tower by comparison is fifty-five stories tall and contains 2.1 million square feet of space. The term Cook and others have begun using for a building of the terminal’s proportions is “groundscraper” a word that can be traced back at least to the nineteen-twenties and the Russian artist and designer El Lissitzky who argued that moving horizontally is more natural for humans than moving vertically.

Shapiro who is shorter than Cook and more laid back told me “A lot of developers normally would say ‘Go as high as possible because altitude equals value.’ We fundamentally disagree with that.” Google whose current New York City headquarters in Chelsea could also be classified as a groundscraper did too. It agreed to lease the building with an option to buy not long after COOKFOX’s plans were drawn up.

Cook Shapiro and a few associates led by a genial construction superintendent named Giusseppe Nunez put on yellow vests and white hard hats and entered the building. “Never put your foot any place you haven’t looked” Cook advised. “We’re pretty far along but there’s still stuff to trip on.” We rode an elevator up to the twelfth floor and emerged into a cavernous raw space with wires and pipes running along the ceiling and sheet metal stacked on the floor. The floor-to-ceiling windows on the west side of the space looked out over the Hudson and beyond—a Steinbergian view. “This is the penthouse for Googlers in the Northeast” Cook said taking in the horizon. “We say that this is the widest sunset in New York.”

Cook is an evangelist for “biophilic” design a set of building principles that takes environmental impact and human biology into account. Access to outdoor space is one of the principles and the building’s enormous wraparound terraces on the twelfth eleventh and fourth floors will be planted with indigenous flora intended to offer respite and nourishment to both local fauna and Googlers. COOKFOX’s offices in midtown in the former Fisk Tire building have terrace gardens too—bees that live in COOKFOX’s hives pollinate plants in Central Park a few blocks away. “Biophilic design is about so much more than plants in the workplace” Cook said. “It’s about a different theory of how to make people feel healthy lower cortisol levels and feel connected to a larger system of life. It’s a much deeper theory of thought.”

Google had asked the landscape ecologist Eric Sanderson the founder of the Mannahatta Project and an old friend of Cook’s to consult on the plans for the gardens at St. John’s Terminal. “There’s a thing called Green Area Ratio which is how much green can you get on a site” Cook said. “Can you duplicate the amount of habitat that the site had in 1609? Is there any way to get that much productivity back and build up a million square feet of office space?”

The original sandy shore of Manhattan was situated about a third of the way into the site of the building. Was it really possible to bring nature whatever that meant back to a place that hadn’t been nature in four centuries? Cook grinned. “I think the answer for sustainability for carbon footprint is going to be denser and denser cities” he said. “Yet we as people need a connection to nature.” I asked whether these two ideas were in tension with each other. Cook sanded the tension down. “There’s this relationship between the two” he said.

We went down a floor and looked at some renderings that had been taped to a window. There were images of Googlers sitting cross-legged on grass in the terrace gardens and standing at counters in kitchen spaces. “From Day One Google said that flow of food in and out was extremely important to them” Cook said. “Feeding these pantries and micro-kitchens and the flow of food out into the floors was a primary planning criteria.” Google’s obsession with food flow had contributed to a change in the plans for the loading docks on the ground floor of the building.

Shapiro said something about the “basket of amenities” that companies were now looking for in office buildings and that developers were trying to deliver. For example since the pandemic began Cook said more and more clients wanted good filtered air provided in their offices. “What you’re seeing in the investment community is there’s so much reliance on E.S.G. now” Shapiro said meaning environmental social and governance criteria as opposed to strictly financial concerns. “Buildings that are not E.S.G.-conscious are of fundamentally lesser value than those that you know comply.” Sometimes financial and other priorities overlapped: keeping the base of the original St. John’s Terminal instead of knocking it down and constructing an entirely new building preserved part of the site’s historic character. It also Cook said saved money and a significant amount of carbon output.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZmxvcmlkYS1saXR0bGUtbW9zY293LXN1bm55LWlzbGVzLW1pYW1pLXJ1c3NpYW4tbW9uZXktcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtMjAyMi0z0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9mbG9yaWRhLWxpdHRsZS1tb3Njb3ctc3VubnktaXNsZXMtbWlhbWktcnVzc2lhbi1tb25leS1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS0yMDIyLTM_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Florida's 'Little Moscow' where Russian money flows,"Among these developments are several Trump Towers a brand that has held a huge appeal among Russian investors looking to move their money in the post-Soviet economy.

Trump doesn't actually own the buildings but licensed the use of his name there The Washington Post reported. Real-estate agents told the Post in 2016 that Trump's name carries weight among the European South American and Asian elite but especially among Russian oligarchs.

""When Russians get here the first thing they ask is 'Where is the Trump building?'"" Ilya Masarsky real-estate developer who has worked with Russian investors in the US told The Post.

Jose Lima a salesperson for the company that developed the region's Trump towers said at the time that Russian speakers bought about one-third of the 500 units he sold.

A 2017 Reuters investigation found that at least 63 members of Russia's elite spent nearly $100 million buying property in Trump buildings in the region including the nearby city of Hollywood. Reuters called some of the buyers ""politically connected businessmen"" adding that none seemed to be part of Putin's inner circle.

""Russian patriots are happy here; Sunny Isles is a happy place"" Bell the real-estate agent told The Daily Beast in 2019. ""Russian men make money at home they visit their Miami property just for a few months in winter.

‘Undercover Boss’ will see CEO of US cellular Laurent Therivel donning a disguise and learn more about the organization he is leading. While undercover Therivel will be assisting a network engineer and changing the filter in what appears to be a large computer in the cell tower.



Now the engineer doesn’t know that he is actually talking to the CEO of the company and tells him that it’s his job to change the filter from now on. The entire filter is filled with dead and alive flies and as soon as he opens the vent a whole bunch of flies comes flying out of there. That’s just one of the things he would be experiencing during the show and it might really be problematic for him. Therivel will experience what College HUNKS Hauling Junks and Moving founders Omar Soliman and Nick Friedman and Sharon M Leite CEO of The Vitamin Shoppe went through as well.

Other than low-cost his list of requirements was as follows:

Dual sine wave output synchronized

Frequency Amplitude and Phase control

Low harmonics under 1 MHz

Scriptable via Python

The heart of the project is the Analog Devices AD9833 a complete Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) waveform generator system on a chip. If you’ve ever rolled your own DDS using discrete ICs or in an FPGA you can appreciate the benefit of squeezing the phase accumulator sine lookup table DAC and control logic all into a single ten-pin package. [Debraj] uses AD9833 modules from the usual online vendors for a few dollars each. He synchronizes the generators by disconnecting the reference crystal on the second module and driving it from the first one. The remaining specifications are met by the inherent characteristics of the DDS system and the scriptable interface is accomplished with an Arduino controlling the AD9833 chips and two programmable gain amplifiers (MCP6S31). We like the confidence that [Debraj] displays by sketching the initial circuit diagram with a ball-point pen — check out the sketch and the final pictorial schematic in the video below the break.

This is a good example of combining off-the-shelf modules to quickly build a project. This approach is great for one-off builds or as a proof-of-concept test bed that can later be spun onto a custom PCB. Another reason to use modules these days is that the modules are often in-stock but the chips are unobtainable. Though it appears [Debraj]’s only needs one of these generators it would be an easy board to layout and build — if you can buy the parts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXJtb25rZXkuY29tL2Jsb2cvdG9wLTEwLXN0b2Nrcy10by1idXktYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLWludmVzdG9yLWNocmlzLXJva29zLTEwMzA5NzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Investor Chris Rokos,"In this article we present the list of top 10 stocks to buy according to billionaire investor Chris Rokos.

The esteemed money manager raised over $1 billion from investors early this year despite a bruising 2021 that saw his hedge fund Rokos Capital Management lose 26% of its value the fund’s worst annual performance to date. Surging inflation and rising interest rates lead to a rough year for the short-bond market which contributed heavily to Rokos’ losses last year.

It was a sharp reversal of fortunes for Rokos and his fund which thrived during 2020 to the tune of 44% gains the best annual showing for the London-based fund since it was launched in 2015. Prior to launching his own fund Rokos co-founded Brevan Howard alongside Alan Howard and was instrumental in some of that fund’s most successful years single-handedly generating close to one-third of the fund’s substantial profits in both 2007 and 2011.

Rokos left Brevan Howard in 2012 over a financial dispute and was forced to sit on the money managing sidelines for three years due to his contractual obligations with Brevan Howard. Those issues were resolved in 2015 allowing him to launch his own fund.

With his fund’s coffers somewhat restored thanks to outside investors Rokos who manages about $13 billion in assets will look for a big rebound in 2022. Rokos Capital sold off a significant number of positions during Q4 according to the fund’s 13F filing for the December 31 reporting period 80 in total while adding less than half as many new holdings. The value of its 13F portfolio stood at $1.66 billion down from $4.68 billion a quarter earlier.

In this article we’ll look at the ten stocks that Chris Rokos had the most conviction in heading into 2022 several of which were added to his portfolio during Q4.

Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Investor Chris Rokos

10. Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)

Value of Rokos Capital’s 13F Position: $20.64 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 112

Chris Rokos’ Rokos Capital Management opened a new position in Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) during Q4 buying 108300 shares of the digital payments provider. Hedge fund ownership of Paypal has fallen by 29% since Q3 2020.

Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares have been battered since the middle of 2021 losing 61% of their value amid the investor selloff of tech and growth stocks. Investors were also alarmed by the company’s 48.9 million net new active accounts in 2021 which came in well below the previous guidance of 55 million despite being bolstered by the acquisition of Paidy which contributed over 3 million of those NNAs in Q4.

While his Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stake is dwarfed by his call option positions on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and Pinterest Inc. (NYSE:PINS) Rokos’ conviction in Paypal is certainly noteworthy given that he was selling far more stocks than buying ones in Q4.

9. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)

Value of Rokos Capital’s 13F Position: $20.98 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 146

Just one quarter after taking a large stake in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) Rokos unloaded 72% of the position during Q4 leaving his fund with 57971 shares. That was good enough to rank the stock as his ninth-largest long equity position on December 31. Billionaires Warren Buffett Stephen Mandel and Ken Fisher are among the other wealthy investors with large Mastercard holdings.

Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) shares are down by 3% in 2022 despite the credit card payments processor releasing very strong Q4 results in January. Mastercard grew net revenue by 27% year-over-year to $5.2 billion while its non-GAAP net income shot up by 41% to $2.3 billion. Mastercard expects cross-border travel to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022 which would further boost the company’s top and bottom lines.

Weitz Investment Management Inc. downplayed the risk to Mastercard Incorporated that could be posed by new fintech companies having this to say about the matter in its Q4 2021 investor letter:

“Reports to investors usually focus on the winners that prove the worthiness of the managers. It’s possible that we’ve been guilty of that on occasion despite our best efforts to accurately convey what has worked and what hasn’t. This time though we are going to celebrate the great businesses we own that “went nowhere” in 2021. In a generally expensive market facing potentially strong headwinds in 2022 we find it very encouraging to own a number of proven winners whose stocks have been “resting” for the last year or so. They will not necessarily save us from markdowns during broad-based corrections but they are companies that we believe can survive and grow business value through almost anything. They are the kinds of businesses that allow us to sleep well at night and not be tempted to sell at the wrong time. Here are some examples: Established payments companies have been out of favor recently. Cross-border payments have been depressed with COVID disrupting international travel. These types of payments are particularly lucrative for Mastercard and their absence has impacted earnings. Further we believe investors have overestimated the negative competitive impact of new fintech companies that have emerged over the past few years. Many of these “disrupters” depend on the Mastercard “rails” over which electronic payments travel and these wily incumbents have a way of acquiring copying or otherwise competing with upstarts.”

8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Value of Rokos Capital’s 13F Position: $25.08 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 95

Chris Rokos’ hedge fund initiated a new position in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) during Q4 buying 44200 shares of the productivity and creativity software developer. Hedge fund ownership of Adobe fell by 14% in 2021.

One of the 5 Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy in Q1 2022 Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares have been battered by the selloff of tech and growth stocks like so many others in recent months sliding by 31% since the end of November. CNBC’s Cramer called Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) “one of the greatest stock performers of our era” in September and called shares’ modest pullback at the time “a buying opportunity that we don’t deserve.”

Adobe shouldn’t be overly affected by rising interest rates which could hurt less established growth stocks that have a greater reliance on debt to fuel their growth than Adobe which generates plenty of free cash flow. While Adobe’s revenue growth isn’t as impressive as other growth stocks it’s no slouch either coming in at an annual average of 41% over the past three years.

7. Analog Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)

Value of Rokos Capital’s 13F Position: $25.29 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 74

Rokos also opened a new stake in integrated circuits manufacturer Analog Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) during Q4 snapping up 144366 shares. He’s one of several money managers that added ADI to their portfolios in 2021 as hedge fund ownership of the stock jumped by 37%.

Analog Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) delivered record revenue for the fourth straight quarter in its fiscal 2022 first quarter pulling in $2.68 billion. That rising revenue didn’t come at the cost of operational excellence either as the company also hit record highs in EPS at $1.94 adjusted gross margin and operating margin.

With Analog Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)’s profit reaching new highs the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.76 in the middle of February which helped lift ADI shares’ dividend yield to 1.90% as of March 1.

6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Value of Rokos Capital’s 13F Position: $26.38 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 111

Closing out the first half of the list is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) which Rokos Capital Management bought 89285 shares of during the fourth quarter taking a new position in the graphics processing unit manufacturer. Rokos wasn’t the only fund snatching up Nvidia shares as hedge fund ownership jumped by 26% during Q4 to a record high.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) grew its revenue by 61% year-over-year during its fiscal 2022 ended January 31 with the company’s gaming unit enjoying an identical 61% revenue spike to $12.5 billion. Nvidia’s data center segment has also been a strong growth driver with revenue rising by 58% year-over-year to $10.6 billion in fiscal 2022. That company-wide growth was in spite of supply chain issues that has left Nvidia with a huge backlog of outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations which ballooned to $9 billion at the end of its fiscal 2022 compared to just $2.5 billion a year earlier.

Rokos’ NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) holding may not be nearly as large as his call option positions on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and Pinterest Inc. (NYSE:PINS) but it’s a stock he was buying in Q4 when he was otherwise selling off so many others. Check out the other stocks Chris Rokos was buying in Q4 in the second half of this article.

Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Investor Chris Rokos is originally published at Insider Monkey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIGh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,05 | March | 2022,"Often used to make rugs tufting is a process wherein a hollow needle is used to cram thread or yarn into fabric in some kind of pattern. This can be done by hand with a gun or with big machines. Some machines are set up to punch the same pattern quickly over and over again and these are difficult to retool for a new pattern. Others are made to poke arbitrary patterns and change easily but these machines move more slowly.

This robotic tufting system by [Owen Trueblood] is of the slow and arbitrary type. It will consist of a modified tufting gun strapped to a robot arm for CNC textile art. Tufting guns are manufactured with simple controls — a power switch a knob to set the speed and a trigger button to do the tufting. Once it’s affixed to the robot arm [Owen] wants to remote control the thing.

The gun’s motor driver is nothing fancy just a 555 using PWM to control a half H-bridge based on input from the speed control potentiometer. [Owen] replaced the motor controller with an Arduino and added an I/O port. The latter is a 3.5 mm stereo audio jack wired to GND and two of the Arduino’s pins. One is a digital input to power the gun and the other is used as an analog speed controller based on input voltage. [Owen] is just getting started and we’re excited to keep tabs on this project as the gun goes robotic.

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen robots do textiles — here’s a 6-axis robot arm that weaves carbon fiber."

The Trafford Training Centre more commonly known as Carrington has been United's home since 2000 when they moved from their iconic Cliff training ground.

Since moving to the new site seven miles away from Old Trafford and west of Manchester the building has seen several upgrades including a medical centre and sports science department built in 2013.

Manchester United have scrapped plans to move training base after the fee to do was too high

The club's training base is Carrington which is located seven miles away from Old Trafford

Despite this additions United were reported to be looking into sites elsewhere as they believed they had outgrown their current site.

The Sun reports United higher ups had touted the Tatton Estate which is the largest private landowner in East Cheshire responsible for 5000 acres as a potential new base of operations but have performed a U-turn after discovering how much it would cost.

The estimated cost of building a state-of-the-art facility on the estate was reportedly £200million but it was the cost of the land that caused United bosses to change their mind.

They moved there from iconic training ground The Cliff in 2000 and have made additions

Instead the club will once again aim to redevelop Carrington and have reportedly already appointed Mags Mernagh as programme director for the project.

Mernagh previously worked at Leicester City and was instrumental in delivering their £130m training ground.

It's reported that staff were informed by email last week that she will be 'responsible for delivering the vision and plan for a world-class training ground redevelopment.'

A medical centre was built in 2013 but the club is reported to believe the site is now too small

United are instead likely to focus on buying more land around Carrington as an alternative

A United insider revealed to the Sun: 'The club had looked at moving to Tatton but received word that it would cost tens of millions of pounds before a spade was even in the ground.

'Carrington needs to deliver for the men's women's and Academy teams at all levels and the bosses know it will take big money to do it right.'

United are likely to focus on buying more land around Carrington as an alternative.

The club have previously struggled to find sponsorship for their Carrington ground after their contract with AON expired at the end of last season. They had raked in £120m across the eight-year deal.

However they later announced a training kit sponsorship with blockchain platform Tezos in a deal worth £20m per season.",,,,,,

Apple is prompting users to make a donation to UNICEF with banners and notices on its website and in some apps urging customers to aid Ukraine.

The ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia has caught the attention of most of the world with the unfolding crisis moving some to try and donate to worthy causes. To make it easier Apple is encouraging users to do so via their Macs and iPhones.

From Friday Apple has started to promote direct donations to UNICEF across its platforms. On the Apple website a banner asks customers to ""Donate to support families affected by the crisis in Ukraine.""

A similar banner is visible in Apple News stating Apple ""has partnered with UNICEF"" and to donate. Other prompts are also visible in the App Store the Browse section of Apple Music and the Apple TV app.

Tapping the banner while on an iPhone or iPad will open up the iTunes Store while clicking on a Mac will launch Apple Music. The app then displays a prompt to donate with several suggested amounts in the user's local currency.

The message instructs users to select an amount then to select Donate to confirm the transaction. Apple states that 100% of the user's contribution will go to UNICEF.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vY2hhbmdlLW1hYy1tYWNib29rLW5hbWUtYXBwbGUtaG93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Change The Name Of Your Mac & MacBook,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vY2hhbmdlLW1hYy1tYWNib29rLW5hbWUtYXBwbGUtaG93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2FwcGxlLXRvLWF5eWEtcnVzc2lhbnMtaGF2ZS1hLXJlcGxhY2VtZW50LXJlYWR5LWZvci1pcGhvbmUtMTIyMDMwNTAwMzg4XzEuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9hcHBsZS10by1heXlhLXJ1c3NpYW5zLWhhdmUtYS1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC1yZWFkeS1mb3ItaXBob25lLTEyMjAzMDUwMDM4OF8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple to AYYA - Russians have a replacement ready for iPhone,"Russia is urging its citizens to switch to domestic smartphone AYYA T1 after American multinational technology giant Apple Inc announced earlier this week its decision of pausing all product sales in the country in response to Moscow's military operation in Ukraine.

Refusing to use the iPhone Russian State Duma deputies Maria Butina and Denis Maidanov are now urging their fellow parliamentarians to use AYYA T1 smartphones developed by local company Smartecosystem a subsidiary of the Scale Research Institute part of the Rostec state corporation.

In a video which has now gone viral on Russian social media Butina who was jailed in the United States in 2018 and labelled as a foreign agent before being deported to Moscow called on her fellow parliamentarians to abandon the iPhone and switch to AYYA T1.

'You know what good gentlemen from Apple but go through the woods! And you my dears become an eyewitness of the first contact of the deputy with the domestic smartphone AYYA T1' Butina said in an Instagram post.

The main feature of the mobile phone reported CNews - one of the largest high-tech publication in Russia and the CIS countries - last year is a separate hardware button to turn off the cameras and microphone to avoid surveillance.

'So baby Aya [AYYA] is the most reliable phone from prying eyes and ears! Let's break through comrades. Don't even worry. And it wasn't like that' Butina wrote.

Butina added that the phone which costs between 15 to 19 thousand rubles will soon switch to the Russian-made Aurora from the mobile Android OS.

Established in 2007 by Russian President Vladimir Putin Rostec developed innovative products including military technologies to become one of Russia's most affluent brands over the course of next 10 years.

AMAT,Applied Materials,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzA2LzMtZGl2aWRlbmQtc3RvY2tzLXRoYXQtanVzdC13ZW50LW9uLXNhbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Dividend Stocks That Just Went on Sale,"The broad market sell-off has even impacted some stable dividend-paying stocks.

The recent turmoil in the stock market may have started among growth stocks which slumped in value as investors looked ahead to the interest rate hikes the Federal Reserve will begin implementing this year but the bearish sentiment has spilled over into other parts of the market too. Even some stable companies that generate consistent profits and pay reliable dividends have sold off in this market correction.

It's uncomfortable but volatility like this is completely normal. Investors should treat these temporary setbacks as opportunities to load up on quality businesses at discounted prices. We asked three Fool.com contributors to pick out stocks they view as fitting that description that are currently on sale and they pointed to Domino's Pizza (DPZ 1.57%) Applied Materials (AMAT 2.34%) and Albemarle (ALB 2.09%).

Market-beating returns a long streak of dividend boosts and pizza. Where do I sign up?

Anders Bylund (Domino's Pizza): This household name may not be the first stock you think of in the context of generous dividend payers. Its effective yield stands at just 1.1% after all. But that metric doesn't tell the whole story.

Domino's Pizza has increased its payouts every year since 2013 boosting its annual dividend checks more than fivefold in the process. The yield may not be terribly impressive but that's because Domino's share price skyrocketed by 750% over the same period. It's just hard for a payout to keep pace with stock gains like these.

Domino's success in recent years was built on one of my favorite qualities in a long-term investment: a willingness to change with the times. Faced with terrible customer reviews (its pizza tied for last place with Chuck E Cheese in one infamous example) and flagging sales in 2009 Domino's set about changing everything about its business. With a new marketing message revamped recipes for dough sauce and topping combinations and a self-deprecating image Domino's management righted the sinking ship. Rivals such as Yum! Brands' (YUM 1.37%) Pizza Hut and Papa John's (PZZA -1.14%) can't hold a candle to Domino's when it comes to long-term sales growth.

And that's not the end of the story. More recently Domino's has been leaning into the market changes engendered by the COVID-19 crisis. Online sales accounted for $6.6 billion in domestic sales last year up 36% from 2019. Domino's loyalty program boasts 70 million members and the company is rolling out a new point-of-sale system that helps store managers collect track and analyze data about specific orders and market trends. Online orders also tend to be larger than those placed over the phone so boosting customer engagement with the digital ordering experience is a top priority for the chain nowadays.

So Domino's gives its shareholders a modest yield but a steadily growing dividend payout market-beating stock returns and an open-minded management team with their eye fixed on the long-term horizon. All of this is available to new investors at fire-sale prices after a mildly disappointing and quite forgivable fourth-quarter report. Domino's stock is down 29% year to date and trades at a reasonable 26 times forward earnings. What's not to love?

Semiconductor equipment stocks are selling off despite a red-hot chip market

Billy Duberstein (Applied Materials): At just 0.75% Applied Materials' dividend yield won't raise too many eyebrows but there is much more to dividend investing than just yields. Share buybacks growth prospects and a low valuation foundation are also key. That's why investors may wish to look at semiconductor equipment stocks which are getting crushed amid the tech sell-off despite possessing all of these attractive characteristics -- and despite the fact that the world is experiencing a semiconductor shortage.

This all bodes well for semiconductor equipment manufacturers like Applied the largest and most diversified of them by revenue.

Due to marketwide factors Applied is down 25% from its recent high and trades at just 17.5 times earnings. That's compared with 31 times earnings for the Nasdaq 100. Yet consider this quote from Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson on its most recent conference call:

... our semiconductor systems revenues from the second quarter of 2021 to the end of Q1 2022 and compare to the prior 12-month period they were up 43% year on year. We think this is a good approximation for industry growth in calendar 2021 which would put WFE [wafer fab equipment] in the mid-$80 billion range. Demand is very strong and continues to grow. We believe wafer fab equipment spending could reach $100 billion in 2022. And since we are already close to being sold out for the year we also have a positive growth outlook for 2023.

If Dickerson is right and Applied Materials grows along with a wafer front-end market that reaches $100 billion Applied's revenue stands to grow about 18% this year and continue growing next year. Due to the operating leverage in its business model and stock buybacks earnings per share are likely to grow even faster than revenue. So its low P/E ratio doesn't make much sense.

Yes the industry has traditionally been cyclical. However with so many foundries announcing ambitious long-term production plans and considering that Applied has said it's already sold out for the year that cyclicality doesn't appear to be as much of a risk today. Additionally management mentioned on the call that its services business was up 14% with about three-quarters of that revenue coming from recurring subscriptions. Those dollars aren't going to go away if systems revenue falls because services revenue should grow along with the installed base.

Moreover management said it didn't see any signs of double-ordering which it was asked about on the call. It appears the only things that may hold back Applied this year are supply constraints and not being able to meet demand. But those are high-class problems to have.

While the market is skittish right now it's bidding down solid well-valued tech businesses along with the marginal ones. Long-term investors should take advantage.

A quality materials producer powering the EV megatrend

Nicholas Rossolillo (Albemarle): Given that it has an annual dividend yield of just 0.9% at current share prices investors shouldn't get too amped about Albemarle as an income play. But what they can get fired up about is that this is a rare Dividend Aristocrat that produces specialty chemicals -- especially lithium a key ingredient for electric vehicle batteries.

Lots of new electric vehicle manufacturers have popped up in the last couple of years thanks in no small part to the incredible success of Tesla (TSLA 1.97%) and legacy automakers are scrambling to electrify their lineups too. Though there are other battery technologies out there and new ones under development most EVs today make use of lithium-ion batteries. That tees up Albemarle's leading lithium production operation for significant growth in the years to supply that rapidly expanding market.

In fact Albemarle is working on getting a couple of new lithium extraction projects up and running in Chile and Australia. Management thinks that in 2022 revenue and adjusted EBITDA will notch year-over-year increases of 31% and 41% respectively at the midpoint of its guidance ranges. Based on this estimate (and after a 36% decline from all-time highs) the stock currently trades for 20 times enterprise value to forward adjusted EBITDA or 30 times forward adjusted earnings per share.

Some forecasts suggest that 40% of all new auto sales will be EVs by the end of this decade. If that's even close to accurate Albemarle will have no shortage of demand for its lithium. Of course as is the case for many companies that supply basic materials this will be a cyclical stock. Its fortunes will ebb and flow as supply and demand dynamics change. But Albemarle is no new kid on the block. It has maintained its streak of annual dividend hikes since 1994 and has consistently generated operating income profit margins in the low-to-mid-teens percentages for years even as it steadily invests in new chemical production operations.

Basically if you're looking for a way to bet on the future of automotive technology consider adding Albemarle to your list of companies to invest in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluY2VwdGl2ZW1pbmQuY29tL3N1cnJleS1lbmVyZ3ktaGFydmVzdGluZy13ZWFyYWJsZS1kZXZpY2UtbWFkZS1yZWN5Y2xlZC13YXN0ZS8yMzU1Ni_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New energy-harvesting wearable device made from recycled waste,"E-waste or electronic waste produced by plastic toxic and semiconducting components of existing electronic devices is dramatically increasing environmental pollution. When it is dumped into landfills toxic materials can seep into the soil and groundwater affecting not only our health but also land and sea animals.

To overcome these issues the use of eco-friendly materials for designing such devices is attaining much attention. Researchers at the University of Surrey have unveiled a new wrist device made of discarded paper wipes and plastic cups that runs on energy harvested by the wearer’s movements. The team is now focusing on plans to use the technology in smartwatches.

“It won’t be long until we have to ask ourselves which of the items we own are not connected to the internet. However the current internet-of-things (IoT) revolution highlights the simple fact that our planet doesn’t have the raw resources to continue to make these devices which are in such high demand” said Dr. Bhaskar Dudem project lead and Research Fellow at the University of Surrey’s Advanced Technology Institute (ATI).

The wearable device is ‘self-powered’ thanks to materials that become electrically charged after they come into contact with one another. These materials also known as Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs) use static charge to harvest energy from movement through a process called electrostatic induction. The TENG is constructed from plastic waste and carbon-coated paper wipes collected from a waste bin.

The team initially concentrated on proving the functionality of the recycled TENG itself showing it could generate enough energy to power low-power electronic devices. Later the device was used to generate a Morse code from a wearable for autonomous communication. With further redesigning a 9-segment keyboard is developed using nine-TENGs connected to an Arduino controller to display the 9-segment actuation on a computer screen.

The device is expected to have an impact on future self-powered sensors and internet of things systems. The developers believe their energy-harvesting wearable device could be a future game-changer for the consumer medical and security sectors.

“The core mission of the Advanced Technology Institute is to help build a world where clean energy is available to all. Our energy-harvesting technology embodies this key mission and we stand ready to work with industry to ensure this technology reaches its full potential” said Professor Ravi Silva Director of ATI at the University of Surrey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvbWF0ZXJpYWxzL2VsZWN0cm9uaWMtbWF0ZXJpYWxzL25leHQtVFYtY29udGFpbi11bmNvbW1vbi1pc290b3Blcy8xMDAvaTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your next TV could contain uncommon isotopes,"Credit: LG Display

In December just before the CES 2022 consumer electronics show in Las Vegas LG Display unveiled next-generation technology called OLED.EX for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) televisions.

At first glance the advance looked typically prosaic for a trade show rollout of new TV display technology. The company said the technology boosts the “display’s overall picture quality by enhancing brightness up to 30 percent compared to conventional OLED displays.”

But what helped LG achieve that 30% gain is actually something of a chemistry breakthrough. LG for the first time acknowledged using a deuterated compound supplied by DuPont in the televisions which will go into mass production in South Korea and China later this year. It’s an advance not only for displays but for the use of deuteration as a way to improve molecules of all kinds.

A deuterated compound is one in which at least one hydrogen has been replaced with its heavier isotope deuterium. One might not think an extra neutron would significantly change the chemistry of a molecule. But the so-called kinetic isotope effect makes the bonds forged between carbon and deuterium tougher to break than those that bind carbon and mere hydrogen.

For decades chemists have been trying to exploit the kinetic isotope effect in practical applications. For example they have been exploring deuterated pharmaceuticals with the aim of slowing metabolic reactions that degrade compounds while leaving efficacy against their targets intact. The result could be lower dosages and fewer side effects.

In 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first deuterated drug Teva Pharmaceutical Industries’ Austedo (deutetrabenazine) a treatment for chorea associated with Huntington’s disease.

DuPont researchers wanted to take the idea further. “The extension of the idea that was applied in pharmaceuticals is exactly what we are doing here” says Norman Herron a DuPont technical fellow. “We’re keeping the material around longer by changing C-H to C-D.”

Lifetime Herron explains is a top consideration for OLED materials. Every pixel in an OLED display is made up of about eight materials stacked in emissive and charge-transport layers. The deterioration of just one of these materials can cause image-sticking problems ruining the entire display. “What we ultimately do is make sure that we address the weakest material or the slowest dog on the team and make sure that it comes up to speed” Herron says.

The extension of the idea that was applied in pharmaceuticals is exactly what we are doing here. We’re keeping the material around longer by changing C-H to C-D. Norman Herron technical fellow DuPont

For LG’s OLED.EX technology DuPont deuterated an existing molecule used to carry electrons in the blue-emissive substack. DuPont won’t say what the molecule is other than to classify it as a polyfused aromatic compound. A big synthetic challenge for the DuPont team which has been working on deuterated OLED compounds for 15 years was replacing hydrogen with deuterium while maintaining high purity.

“There are multiple carbon-hydrogen bonds in that molecule and we are substituting some of them but not all of them” Herron says. “And the net effect is we apparently increased the lifetime. So we must be addressing some of the weaker carbon-hydrogen bonds that were leading to the degradation behavior.”

LG is advertising brighter displays not televisions that last a long time. That’s because with OLEDs longevity and brightness have an inverse relationship.

“What you’re doing when you make something run brighter is you’re stressing it harder. You’re running more current through” Herron says noting that OLED displays could operate indefinitely if they’re dim enough. By using a more robust material LG can produce displays that are brighter than the previous generation while lasting just as long.

The OLED.EX technology isn’t the first use of deuteration in LG televisions Herron says. The electronics maker has dabbled in it before but OLED.EX is LG’s biggest use of deuterated compounds thus far and it is the first time the firm has disclosed the compounds’ application.

The use of deuterated compounds isn’t yet widespread in the display industry. “Currently LG is the only one” says Jimmy Kim a senior principal analyst for OLED materials at the technology consulting firm Omdia. Kim notes that DuPont and LG have filed most of the patents for deuterated OLED compounds.

Other groups however have investigated deuterium for OLEDs. For example in 2014 scientists from the University of Tokyo deuterated benzylic methyl groups in a green phosphorescent material. The scientists noted a fivefold increase in material lifetime while all other properties remained unchanged. The group was also able to achieve higher luminescence from the deuterated compound because it degraded more slowly.

Display firms are pursuing other strategies for maximizing device lifetime Kim says. For instance they use tandem structures in which OLED stacks are placed on top of one another minimizing current density while achieving high light output and long lifetime. Manufacturers have also rolled out materials based on longer-lasting boron dopants he says.

A bottleneck in the broader use of deuterated compounds in OLEDs is their cost Kim says. “Due to limited supply chain its selling price is very high now” he notes.

Hjalti Skulason technical manager of the emerging applications group at DuPont Industrial Solutions acknowledges the issue which he attributes largely to the additional synthesis steps that are necessary. “Because it is an extra step it is more expensive than the nondeuterated analogs” he says.

On top of that the heavy water (D 2 O) from which deuterium is derived is quite rare. Deuterium is present in natural water but at a ratio of 1 deuterium atom for every 6400 hydrogens. The main commercial application for heavy water is slowing down neutrons in Canada deuterium uranium nuclear reactors. Most heavy water production facilities—which concentrate the water with energy-intensive routes like the Girdler sulfide process—were shut down long ago. Supplies are drawn largely from government stockpiles.

“The deuterium source is certainly going to be a problem we have to solve if it grows really large but even at full scale—LG TVs being produced with this—it is still not an enormous amount of actual material” Skulason says. DuPont’s shipments of the deuterated compound now fall in the range of tens to hundreds of kilograms.

Deuterium has the potential to expand the OLED market by making the displays more competitive in the high-performance TV sector according to Omdia’s Kim. OLED displays have only a 3% share of the television sector he says compared with a 30–40% share of the smartphone market. In both cases liquid crystal displays dominate.

Skulason says the technology could also help OLEDs penetrate into display markets that have thus far been elusive. “I think it’s going to expand into other kinds of more demanding display applications where there’s more of a static image and displays that are on for a longer period of time.” Examples include computer monitors and signs. Deuteration he notes could also help in automotive displays which currently have short life spans because of hot summer conditions.",,,,,,

After LeBron James’ disastrous maiden voyage with the Lakers in the 2018-19 season executive Rob Pelinka made some wholesale changes trading for superstar big man Anthony Davis and using the team’s limited cap space to assemble a solid supporting cast.

Although many expected a slow start L.A. blasted off to a 24-3 start and it did so with its defense and transition game.

Still after the All-Star break some weren’t quite convinced that the Lakers were championship material. One weekend in early March gave them the perfect opportunity to prove that they were indeed championship material.

It started on March 6 with a matchup against Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks.

The Bucks were on their way to amassing the NBA’s best record while Antetokounmpo was headed towards the Defensive Player of the Year award and his second straight regular season MVP.

In cliched NBA speak this was a statement game.

It wasn’t the best-played game but James came out with something to prove. After the Lakers fell behind early he put his imprint on the game and with his help L.A. tied the score at halftime.

From there the Purple and Gold dominated the first several minutes of the third quarter. Antetokounmpo and crew couldn’t respond and the Lakers glided to a 113-103 win that started to turn people around the league into serious believers.

With 37 points eight assists eight rebounds and three steals James showed the basketball world that he was still king.

The win would propel his team to its 17th NBA championship and validate his decision to take his talents to Southern California.

On March 4 Tomei revealed to the Rolling Stone that she actually never got paid for playing Davidson’s mom in the hit film King of Staten Island. She said “I actually just was talking to Pete today because I was like ‘I never got paid for that. Did you?’” She added “In this age of transparency can we talk?”

But she continued saying that despite not getting paid she had an amazing time on set. “But despite that I had a rollicking good time. [With director] Judd [Apatow’s] approach to improv — which is extensive — I was ­intimidated. I’m with all these stand-up [comics]. It was so freeing. Really changed how I approach each character going forward.”

She also added that she finds Davidson “so real” and “he’s unfiltered but very sensitive.”

Now we have a lot of questions about whether she’s going to get paid wondering if anyone else had paycheck issues and more. But we’re happy she had such a good time on set and made some strong friendships.

King of Staten Island is a 2020 film starring Davidson Tomei Bill Burr and even Steve Buscemi to name a few. Directed by Judd Apatow the story follows a young man trying to get his life together after the death of his father recent turns in his life and mental illness.

Tomei played Margie Carlin Davidson’s on-screen mother and an ER nurse who’s putting her foot down.

We’re also the same size in denim so that too.”

In a 2019 snippet from Yahoo Entertainment Vergara gave her thoughts on equality for women. “I don’t believe that women should be given anything just because they’re women. We’re supposed to be equal and have the same capacities so if we’re good we deserve as much as everyone to get all of those opportunities.”

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats. AJG's forward-looking strategies including leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success.

Samedi 5 mars 2022 ((rezonodwes.com))–« Nous étudions les moyens de réduire les importations de pétrole russe tout en nous assurant de maintenir les besoins mondiaux en approvisionnement«  a déclaré la porte-parole de la Maison blanche Jen Psaki lors d’un point de presse vendredi.

En ce sens le gouvernement américain réfléchit à une réduction des importations de pétrole russe par les Etats-Unis alors qu’une proposition de loi interdisant tout achat de produit énergétique russe par Washington circule au Capitole.

La Maison Blanche pourrait s’appuyer sur cette loi pour bannir les importations russes tout en partageant avec le Congrès la responsabilité d’une éventuelle hausse du prix des carburants.

Si une très forte majorité d’Américains soutiennent le principe d’une suspension des achats de pétrole russe selon un sondage Reuters/Ipsos diffusé vendredi – 80% des personnes interrogées avec de solides majorités côté démocrate aussi bien que républicain - la Maison blanche avance prudemment sur ce dossier redoutant l’effet d’une flambée des prix de l’essence sur un taux d’inflation déjà très élevé.

Cela fait des années que le Comité de direction de l’éducation des Premières Nations milite pour ce type de changement dans le cursus scolaire de la province souligne le président du comité Tyrone McNeil dans un communiqué.

Ce changement dans le programme représente un pas important vers la réconciliation en s’assurant que tous les élèves de la province ont le temps nécessaire et l’occasion de développer des connaissances approfondies sur l'expérience les cultures l'histoire et les savoirs des Autochtones du Canada  écrit le comité.

Cela nous aidera à mieux comprendre la vérité de notre histoire commune tout en développant des connaissances pour que tous nos élèves aient un sentiment de responsabilité face à notre futur collectif  indique de son côté la ministre de l’Éducation Jennifer Whiteside.

Selon le modèle qui est présenté par la province les élèves pourront remplir ce nouvel impératif à travers plusieurs classes déjà existantes ou grâce à de nouvelles options de cours et cette exigence s’appliquera à l’ensemble des élèves de la province.

Then the suspect’s relative is found dead in the gunman’s home,"CNN —

An armed man gave no warning as he walked toward the front of Jesus’ Dwelling Place Church in Pennsylvania on Sunday raised a gun toward the pastor’s face and pulled the trigger.

What happened next may have been divine intervention Pastor Glenn Germany said.

“I’m thankful to God that I’m still here because he definitely pulled the trigger” Germany told CNN affiliate WTAE.

The gunman “attempted to shoot but the firearm failed to discharge” Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement.

The incident in North Braddock was captured on the church’s livestreamed video. Immediately after the gunman pulled the trigger a church member tackled the suspect to the ground.

State police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite.

It’s not clear why the suspect tried to shoot the pastor. Germany said he had never seen the gunman before Sunday WTAE reported.

“All of a sudden I just seen a gun pointing right at me” the pastor told the affiliate. “And at that point all I could do was run for cover.”

As Germany ran and hid behind a lectern the church’s cameraman rushed the gunman and tackled him to the ground according to WTAE. The pastor quickly emerged from behind the lectern and helped subdue the suspect.

Polite faces charges of attempted criminal homicide aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person court records show.

He was arraigned early Monday morning and was denied bail. He is being held at Allegheny County Jail and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 13.

It was not immediately clear if Polite has an attorney.

After the attempted shooting at the church police found the body of a man who was shot in Polite’s home Allegheny County police told CNN. The homicide victim was identified as 56-year-old Derek Polite a relative of the suspect from the church incident.

“County Police can confirm Bernard Polite a suspect in a previous incident Sunday morning at a North Braddock church is known to live at the residence where the shooting occurred and is a relative of the shooting victim” police spokesperson Jim Madalinsky told CNN in an email.

His attacker is now suing the venue but not the comic. (Evan Agostini / Invision / Associated Press)

The man who tackled comedian Dave Chappelle onstage two years ago has sued the Hollywood Bowl and its security team alleging negligent security and battery.

Isaiah Lee who pleaded no contest to charges relating to the 2022 incident and was sentenced to jail because of it alleged in a civil lawsuit that security guards employed at the venue for the ""Dave Chappelle and Friends"" event pulled Lee off of Chappelle and began beating him ruthlessly spitting on him and dislocating his arm intentionally.

In a complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday — exactly two years after the incident — the 25-year-old who identifies as bisexual and has experienced homelessness said he tackled Chappelle after ""The Dreamer"" star ""unleashed a barrage of homophobic and transphobic jokes"" and joked about homelessness during the inaugural Netflix Is a Joke comedy festival. The complaint obtained Monday by The Times said Lee ""became upset by the discriminatory nature of the comedian's jokes and rushed the stage in protest as the show ended.""

""Instead of intervening to protect Lee [the defendants] allowed members of the comedian's entourage encouraged by the comedian to beat Lee"" the lawsuit said. The complaint also said that a knife fell out of Lee's pocket well after the altercation was underway and that its presence ""did not justify the force"" used against him.

Jonathan D. Evans Lee's attorney argued that the Hollywood Bowl and the unidentified ""Doe"" security companies were aware of Chappelle's history of making offensive jokes that target the LGBTQ+ community as well as his ""propensity for making discriminatory remarks"" but ""took no measures to prevent or mitigate the potential harm caused by such offensive material."" The firebrand comic who is not listed as a defendant in Lee's lawsuit made headlines for months ahead of the incident because of jokes he made in his 2021 Netflix special ""The Closer"" which resulted in an employee walkout for the streaming giant and broad criticism of Chappelle's work.

""We cannot comment on ongoing legal matters"" a spokesperson for the Hollywood Bowl said Monday in a statement to The Times. ""However the safety and security of our audience and artists are of the utmost importance to the Hollywood Bowl. Security procedures are updated regularly to provide the safest possible environment for those who attend and perform at the Bowl.”

A spokesperson for Chappelle did not immediately respond Monday to The Times' request for comment.

Any company the Bowl might contract with for security could not be contacted for comment due to lack of identification.

Lee's attack occurred only months after Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock on live television at the 94th Academy Awards and violence reaching onstage was one of many issues concerning live performers at the time.

According to previous reporting Lee emerged from the Bowl audience on May 3 2022 and appeared to lower his head and charge Chappelle knocking the Emmy-winning actor backward. Lee then fled to the back of the stage where he was apprehended by security and sustained minor injuries. Chappelle who was not hurt later made quips about Lee and the incident and how the events played out.

Lee pleaded no contest to one charge of misdemeanor battery and one charge of entering a restricted area during a live event and was sentenced in December 2022 to nearly nine months in county jail. He completed his sentence and is currently in a transitional living facility his attorney confirmed Monday to The Times.

In the lawsuit Evans argued that the security company employed by the Bowl ""had a duty to exercise due care"" in the performance of its security services and failed to reasonably perform them resulting in the injuries suffered by Lee.

Instead of detaining or arresting Lee using a reasonable amount of force or intervening to protect him from the beating the security company ""allowed members of the comedian's entourage encouraged by the comedian to beat Lee senselessly"" the complaint said. Employees of the security company ""joined in the beating"" and ""took no action to prevent it the assault"" the document said.

""As a direct and proximate result of the above-mentioned conduct of and omissions by Defendants ... [Lee] was placed in great fear for his physical well being and has suffered and continues to suffer extreme mental and physical pain suffering anguish fright nervousness anxiety grief shock humiliation indignity embarrassment and apprehension all to his damage in a sum to be determined at trial"" the complaint said.

The filing also said that Lee ""was placed in great fear for his physical well being suffered and continues to suffer extreme mental and physical pain anxiety humiliation and apprehension among other issues. He has since experienced a significant loss of enjoyment of life and his injuries required immediate surgery it said and he cannot fully use his shoulder or engage in certain physical activities that he regularly did before the incident.

Lee is seeking a judgment against the defendants in a jury trial as well an unspecified amount in damages coverage of his medical and related expenses legal fees and further relief the suit said.

""He’s not after a set dollar amount. He just wants the security company or whoever else was beating him twisting his arm out of socket and spitting on him to answer for going overboard"" Evans said Monday in an email to The Times. ""He should have been detained and taken into custody. That’s it. What the security guards did to him and allowed others to do him goes beyond the scope of what’s acceptable.""

Although the Mount Tabor drill site has stood on 3020 Village Creek Road for more than a decade TEP Barnett – the Fort Worth branch of French energy giant TotalEnergies – began drilling again in January this time creating four new gas wells.

Loud booms filled east Fort Worth’s Stop Six neighborhood at all hours of the night according to James and other homeowners and the machines extracting gas from the ground never seemed to turn off.

“When they first came in that’s all you were going to hear” said Dereck Collins whose home is just a few hundred feet from the TEP Barnett property. “Boom! We used to hear this all night. Boom! You can feel it.”

The noise was one thing. Black exhaust was another.



On that sunny Monday morning James said she could taste the fumes in her mouth causing her to vomit and later call an ambulance to check on her condition. But first James pulled out her phone and began to record.

“I don’t know who I’m supposed to tell this to I don’t know who’s supposed to listen and who can make a difference” James told viewers on Facebook Live pointing her camera toward the steady stream of exhaust entering the air. “But I’m letting you know as a mother as a homeowner as someone who stays in the community this is not healthy for our neighborhood.”

Within hours James called Fort Worth’s code compliance department and eventually filed a complaint with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality which dispatched investigators to the site that day. Victoria Cann a commission spokesperson would not provide details on what was discovered at the site but said the investigation is ongoing.

In a statement TEP Barnett said a contractor’s pump at the Mount Tabor drilling pad began to fail and blew dark smoke on Feb. 28 though neighbors said they noticed some smoke as early as Feb. 25.

TEP Barnett said the pump was shut down and replaced within an hour. James recorded black exhaust coming from the facility just before 9 a.m. and again just before 1 p.m.

“Our neighbors were not harmed by the mechanical issue” the statement reads. “We investigate any incident and draw on recommendations to continually improve our processes and procedures. TotalEnergies remains committed to operate this and all our sites in a safe and environmentally responsible way.”

The company also said officials conduct daily monitoring of noise and were in full compliance with allowable levels in the residential neighborhood. TEP Barnett logs “all inquiries” about drill sites and found that no inquiries were received from neighbors about drilling activities at Mount Tabor.

“For our recent drilling activities we used an electric rig which operates on electricity and thus there were no emissions during the referenced action” the TEP Barnett statement said. “We did not receive any citations for violating the Fort Worth gas drilling ordinance.”

Multiple neighbors said they tried to contact TEP Barnett through a phone number posted on the fence near the entrance of the drill site. They said they weren’t able to get through to anyone at the company despite repeated attempts.

Fort Worth has 600-plus drill sites two inspectors

Brendan Skaggs a gas well inspector for the city of Fort Worth told the Report that he visited Mount Tabor the day after the incident was reported to the commission for a regular inspection he conducts on active fracking sites.

There are more than 600 drilling sites and 1900 gas wells across the city and two people are tasked with conducting annual inspections of each of them along with urban forestry inspections Skaggs said.

“I try to go to every site at least three or four times a year and if there’s activity such as drilling I’ll go out there once every two to three weeks” he said. “It’s required to do every site at least once a year but again that’s not sufficient … It still needs to be done it doesn’t matter if it’s two people or eight people that it takes to do it.”

How to contact Fort Worth with an air quality complaint Contact the code compliance department’s air compliance investigations team by calling 817-392-1234 or emailing Air@fortworthtexas.gov.

He didn’t see any emissions issues while on site but said he would not necessarily go to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality which regulates the state’s air quality and industrial pollution if he did spot a problem. Depending on the situation Skaggs said he would likely reach out to the person who filed a complaint or the gas well operator first.

City gas well inspectors are not allowed to do air quality emissions inspections because they are required to stick to Fort Worth’s gas well ordinance which focuses on groundwater contamination inspections.

Code compliance officers in the environmental quality department do investigate air quality complaints in Fort Worth following investigation protocols set by the state environmental commission.

“They’re fracking out there so there is probably a lot of dust and accumulation in the air” Skaggs said. “But we don’t even have the equipment to do any kind of (air) monitoring and we’re really not allowed to do that.”

A house directly across from the drilling site has served as Willie Miller’s home for 61 years. The 96-year-old said he often has to head inside and close all of his windows to keep from breathing in dust kicked up from 18-wheelers driving up and down Village Creek Road as part of the drilling operations.

“It has gotten worse since they started (drilling). They don’t give a damn about the human beings who live here and have to inhale all this stuff” Miller said.

How to contact TCEQ The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has a 24-hour hotline for environmental complaints. Call (888) 777-3186 or email complaint@tceq.texas.gov. For local support call the regional Dallas-Fort Worth office at 817-588-5800.

Calling a council member is often the best way to “get the ball rolling” on sending an inspector to a gas well site Skaggs said.

Fort Worth has a record of James calling the city’s hotline to complain about the thick black smoke being released into her neighborhood said city spokesperson Michelle Gutt. A code compliance officer responded on Feb. 28 and visited James’ house to investigate on March 3 James said.

But James wasn’t able to reach her council member Gyna Bivens or other elected officials including the mayor’s office. Bivens who represents District 5 said she did not receive a call from James but did hear from a Buddhist temple near the site that was concerned about the smoke.

“I got calls that they were drilling again and that’s all I know” Bivens told the Report. “The city has gas wells all over and from time to time companies see if they can get something out of them. I don’t see it as a really big issue.”

Stop Six not only neighborhood struggling with TEP Barnett

Stop Six neighbors are not the first group of Tarrant County residents to complain about fumes and health issues stemming from TEP Barnett’s drilling operations.

Last December employees of Mother’s Heart Learning Center in east Arlington filed two complaints with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality after workers felt nauseated while spending time on a playground near the AC360 drill site on 2000 S. Watson Road.

Just a few weeks later Arlington council members denied a permit that would have allowed TEP Barnett to drill three more wells near the daycare center and homes.

As the leader of environmental advocacy group Liveable Arlington Ranjana Bhandari advocated for the permit denial alongside Mother’s Heart founder Wanda Vincent. After hearing about the recent incident in east Fort Worth Bhandari said there is a pattern of residents not having a defined pathway for getting their concerns heard by either the gas operator or the government.

“We’re often told there are no complaints but people don’t know how to complain” Bhandari said. “This is a complaint-driven system of cleaning the air. (Investigators) come out after the fact. By then the evidence of the problem has blown away.”

Texas would benefit greatly from expanded air monitoring especially around industrial facilities known to generate large amounts of pollution Bhandari said. The state should also require gas well sites to post an emergency phone number for residents to call if they need immediate help or seek to file a complaint regarding the site she added.

TotalEnergies is currently expanding its footprint in Tarrant County. In January Liveable Arlington tracked 14 new permit applications from TEP Barnett to drill in Arlington alongside one in Fort Worth and two in White Settlement. While natural gas prices have surged in the past several months Bhandari said Total has pursued more wells in the region for more than two years.

“It predates this spike in gas prices that people are noticing” she said. “If people are looking at their utility bills from Atmos Energy that’s completely unrelated to this. They’re drilling here and exporting it to world markets and that’s even before the Russian aggression.”

As drilling expands Fort Worth signs agreement to receive royalties

Bhandari remains concerned that residents are too often kept in the dark about the arrival of industrial facilities particularly gas drilling sites in their neighborhoods.

In the case of Mount Tabor in Stop Six the original drill site was approved in the late 2000s and amended in 2010 to allow the operator at the time Chesapeake Energy to drill less than 600 feet from protected buildings including homes according to City Council minutes.

TEP Barnett which obtained rights to drill at Mount Tabor was allowed to drill four new wells without a public hearing since the permit request was approved through an internal administrative process.

A 2009 council action also allows Fort Worth to lease the mineral rights for city-owned properties that are five acres or smaller to gas companies without going through a council hearing process. The process was meant to “to allow staff to negotiate and expedite processing of small leases” during the Barnett Shale drilling boom of the late 2000s according to a council document.

Last October Fort Worth officials quietly approved a leasing agreement with TEP Barnett to receive royalties if new gas resources are discovered on city-owned property at the Mount Tabor site in the next two years.

Marilyn Schoening a gas lease analyst in Fort Worth’s mineral management department said the agreement was typical for the city though leasing agreements have become less frequent since gas prices fell in the early 2010s.

“All we’re thinking about is how do we protect the interest of the city the property that the city owns” Schoening told the Report. “And then of course the revenue that we would get that goes toward projects for taxpayers. It doesn’t pay a salary.”

Fort Worth’s oil and gas revenue fund often supports infrastructure improvements and initiatives like the Open Space Conservation Program Schoening said. But James said she hasn’t seen the benefits of that revenue head to Stop Six.

“The community is suffering for your personal gain but what did you do for the community with this money?” James said.

Still facing challenges neighbors getting ‘good sleep’ now

Change is already afoot at the Mount Tabor site. Starting on Feb. 28 loud machines stopped buzzing during late night hours said neighbor Dereck Collins allowing residents to get their first restful nights of sleep in weeks.

On March 4 James filmed members of a cleanup crew who she said was paid by TEP Barnett to clean trash on the property.

“It’s been years and we couldn’t get them to come clean this up” James told followers on Facebook Live. “Now all of a sudden I make a video call the state and y’all are out here cleaning.”

Not all is resolved in Stop Six. James fears retaliation from code compliance officers who she said often ask her family about unrelated issues on their property when she calls for help.

Miller the 96-year-old resident said industrial trucks are tearing up what’s left of the roads. Collins has already spent more than $9000 on repairs to his floors walls and foundation which he blames on cracks caused by the gas drilling and fracking near the neighborhood.

And even though James smelled fumes in the air the day after the smoke stopped her fellow residents made sure she knew that she made a difference.

“I’ve had neighbors knocking on my door saying ‘I got good sleep last night. I don’t got bags under my eyes. We were able to watch TV without turning it all the way up’” she said. “So when I get ready to go to City Council are you going to be there? They said: ‘Let us know when. Let us know when.’”

Global temperatures aren’t the only thing heating up around the world; so are climate discussions and for good reason. Even if we completely halted emission today according to scientists climate change wouldn’t still halt for decades or centuries.

“That’s because it takes a while for the planet (for example the oceans) to respond and because carbon dioxide – the predominant heat-trapping gas – lingers in the atmosphere for hundreds of years” NASA explains. “There is a time lag between what we do and when we feel it.”

As such the building industry needs to implement rapid improvements to make meaningful change and reduce environmental impact in addition to building resilient and adaptable structures. Building and construction represent about 30% of all global energy consumption. This percentage represents not only a considerable slice of the emissions pie but also a massive opportunity to cut energy expenditures and make a real difference to the environment.

For many organizations this is more than just an optimistic goal; it’s a mandate.

“The buildings sector must decarbonize by decreasing energy intensity by at least 80% by 2030 and be climate neutral by 2050 if we are to meet the Paris Agreement Goal of keeping global warming to 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels” T&D World says. “This will require a doubling of the rate of energy efficiency improvement in the sector to 2% per year and a six-fold increase from the current rate of construction of net zero energy buildings and renovations by 2030.”

That’s a big responsibility and a significant change to make. But most importantly how do we get there? While this is a loaded question starting to build the ideal structures of tomorrow’s world is an important place to start. In this blog we’ll dive into ideal models of a sustainable construction facility: zero energy buildings.

What Exactly Are Net Zero Buildings?

First you may be wondering what’s the deal with net zero buildings? According to the World Green Building Council the definition is “A highly energy-efficient building with all remaining operational energy use from renewable energy preferably on-site but also off-site production to achieve net zero carbon emissions annually in operation.”

The organization recently proposed a bold plan with two main goals everyone in the sector should work towards:

All new buildings must operate at net zero carbon from 2030

100% of existing buildings must operate at net zero carbon by 2050

While these goals are insanely ambitious it’s critical to building a more sustainable and carbon-neutral world. With only several hundred net zero buildings extant around the world and with many buildings needing to follow suit builders clearly have their work cut out for them over the next few decades.

Now let’s look at exactly what is required to achieve net zero.

Attributes of Net Zero Buildings

Net zero buildings share several key attributes. According to the Canada Green Building Council these include:

Renewable Energy Generation: Buildings must create at least some and ideally all of their energy on-site.

Buildings must create at least some and ideally all of their energy on-site. Energy Intensity Metrics: Using metrics will encourage builders and building operators to create and maintain high efficiency reliability and resiliency (the ability to bounce back from environmental challenges).

Using metrics will encourage builders and building operators to create and maintain high efficiency reliability and resiliency (the ability to bounce back from environmental challenges). Embodied Carbon: This is the concept of how much carbon was generated in the creation and transport of the materials needed to build (or renovate). By measuring this we can incentivize builders to reduce it.

This is the concept of how much carbon was generated in the creation and transport of the materials needed to build (or renovate). By measuring this we can incentivize builders to reduce it. Lowering Emissions: Even once it’s in operation a building can still contribute measurably to environmental degradation. Metrics to assess emissions will help operators keep them as low as possible.

Even once it’s in operation a building can still contribute measurably to environmental degradation. Metrics to assess emissions will help operators keep them as low as possible. Reducing Peak Energy Demand: Buildings should seek to minimize power demands during peak demand which places a huge burden on the grid.

In order to achieve these goals building companies will need to invest in several sectors:

Insulation and sealing that maintain indoor temperatures and HVAC

that maintain indoor temperatures and HVAC Cutting-edge windows and doors that preserve energy

that preserve energy Lighting electronics and equipment that minimize energy use

that minimize energy use Intelligent design that both maximizes the human experience and reduces energy demand

that both maximizes the human experience and reduces energy demand Renewable energies (wind hydro solar)

How to Create a Successful Environment for the Future of Net Zero

To successfully implement net zero buildings construction companies will need to cultivate several elements:

Commitment from Forward-Thinking Companies Designers and Builders

Without a commitment from industry leaders we can’t hope to succeed. We need the participation of large and established companies as well as disruptive startups. This includes bringing more transparency to the construction process overall particularly on carbon emissions of all assets. (Initiatives like EC3 for Autodesk and Skanska’s Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3) are a great place to start.)

Watch more:

Government Buy-In

Net zero buildings won’t get anywhere without government help. That means a commitment to making a full change with building energy codes at the foundation of this change. Governments across the world must both nurture and enforce change for builders and offer incentives to early adopters.

This doesn’t just mean the national level. Local traction can be incredibly powerful and bring a sense of hometown pride for the cities and communities on the front of change. For example “Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto introduced legislation earlier requiring that government buildings are net-zero energy efficient. That occurred just weeks after the city released its first energy benchmarking report for city owned and operated buildings.”

NGO Participation

Non-government organizations have the responsibility to develop certification programs for forward-thinking businesses to adopt. They must support government initiatives and help train businesses on the skills needed to build net zero buildings.

Use of Innovative Materials

Getting to net zero involves widespread usage of innovative building materials. That means:

Adapting and reusing existing structures

Employing materials that effectively “bank carbon” by minimizing its output in processing

Using innovative window materials that transmit natural light without losing efficiency

Design with a building’s future in mind including future renovations and demolition

Examples of Net Zero Buildings in Action

Believe it or not a lot of these strategies are already in action around the world. Here are a few of our favorite net zero buildings from around the world.

Unisphere Silver Spring MD

Currently ranking as the largest net zero commercial building in the United States Unisphere is 135000 square feet of pure green efficiency. It has more than 3000 solar panels geo-exchange wells a heating/cooling system coupled to earth energies a natural automatic ventilation system thermal pool and green roof terraces that manage stormwater.

As if that’s not enough it also boasts electric charging stations and “daylight harvesting” which means offsetting energy use in a space by putting natural light to use instead wherever possible.

One Angel Square Manchester U.K.

Some buildings actually generate more energy than they can use. This is the case with the headquarters of The Co-operative Group designated a BREEAM Outstanding building. The facility can accommodate 4000 employees uses energy-efficient LED lighting and employs natural daylight to illuminate the interior whenever possible. It even owns farmland where it produces rapeseed to power its heating needs.

Wayne Aspinall Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse Grand Junction CO

Also top of our list of net zero buildings is the Wayne Aspinall Federal Building. Its renovation had at heart a simple goal: not only to modernize but to become the National Register of Historic Places’ first net zero building.

Today it is a poster child of sustainability as well as adaptation preserving the building’s original period-appropriate appearance. Soon the building plans to produce 100% of its energy needs on site.

The Joyce Centre for Partnership and Innovation Mohawk College’s Fennel Campus in Hamilton Ontario Canada

Canada’s largest net-zero building is a model for the nation’s green building programs which is probably why it’s been chosen as the future home to the Centre for Climate Change Management. Its goal is not only energy efficiency on site but also a string of programs that make it a paragon of sustainability and energy management. In the future we can expect a number of countries and organizations to look to this building for guidance in creating their own.

Among its accolades are 2000 solar panels maximization of natural light an energy-efficient building envelope stormwater harvesting capacity of up to 342000 liters and a variety of HVAC and lighting systems that minimize energy use. It was the first building in the country completed under the Canada Green Building Council’s net zero carbon pilot program.

Let’s just say we’re watching these buildings to see where they go next! If you're interested in learning about the next evolution in sustainability learn about how construction teams are achieving even net-positive buildings like the Kendeda Building of Innovative Design:

The Future of Net Zero Is About Our Future

Too often we view innovative solutions to big problems as a “would be nice.” We have to keep in mind though that our ability to execute these solutions reflects directly on our ability to halt (and ideally reverse) climate trends feed our populations save our coasts and oceans and generally succeed as a species in the 21st century and beyond. Net zero is not a “later when we have time” or a “we’ll think about it.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

As we know that stock price movement is always volatile affected by different factors such as industry performance politics economic variables company reputations investor sentiments company news company performance and public social media. Therefore predicting the price movement trends of stocks is really a challenging and interesting topic. Industrial is investing a lot of resources in ML (Machine Learning) algorithms or NLP (Natural Language Processing) to predict the stock price movement precisely. In this article I would like to share how to use Python to extract the stock news and build a sentiment analysis based on News Headline with NLP to predict the stock price movement.

Steps:

Extract the stock tickers Extract the Stock News Headlines Put into Sentiment Analysis Tools to calculate polarity scores Price may get increase due to positive news Price may get drop due to negative news

Introduction to NLP

Natural language processing has always been a hot topic in the data science field. NLP is a field that focuses on making natural human language usable by computer programs. It is a paradigm of extracting structured information from unstructured data which is meant typical text format may contain irrelevant information such as dates numbers facts as well. Due to the irregularities and ambiguities it makes the traditional program difficult to understand the data. Therefore we need to preprocess the text before analyzing it programmatically.

Applications of NLP:

1. Automatic Review Analysis System

2. Spam Filters

3. Voice text Messaging

4. Sentiment Analysis

5. Chatbot

6. Recommendation System

7. Machine Translation

Introduction to Web Scraping

Web Scraping is a path of extracting valuable data from the internet. Web Scraping is to minimize the effort of human beings to get the data from websites manually.

[Optional] If you are interested in Web Scraping you can read my previous posts. I have guided how to create a bot to extract the data automatically step by step.

Part 1: Installing the Python necessary package

Before installing the package let us create our py script in the desired directory. You are welcome to use any IDE like VS Code Pycharm Anaconda Jupyter Notebook Google Colab notepad++ and etc. It doesn't matter will not affect our tutorials.

In this demo I will challenge myself to use cmd and notepad to write my coding without any IDE hints.

Command Prompt for Creating folder and virtual Environment (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

mkdir nlp-stock-news

cd nlp-stock-news

python -m venv venv

Wait for a few seconds until the virtual environment done created.

Command Prompt for activating virtual Environment (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

cd venv/Scripts

activate

Next you will see the “(venv)” on your left-hand side of the file path.

It meant that it is the virtual environment therefore we need to install our necessary package within this virtual env only which will not be affected our project package version.

pip install beautifulsoup4 vaderSentiment pandas requests matplotlib

Installing the package (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

VADER sentiment analyzer will be used for text analysis and BS4 to extract the stock news headline information. Pandas is used for data processing whereas matplotlib is used for data visualization.

Since this topic is related to sentiment analysis allow me to explain more about the VANDER sentiment analyzer.

What is VADER?

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool which focuses to understand or analyze the emotions sentiments in social media. VADER is available in NLTK package and is workable for the unlabelled datasets. It will label the dataset with the semantic orientation as either positive or negative by giving the sentiment scores known as emotion intensities.

For example:

Positive Words:- Fun Happy Fantastics awesome love like enjoy good nice.

Negative Words:- angry awful boring confused stupid

Even more VADER is able to understand the basic word context like “I don’t love you” which will categorize it as a negative statement. What is more it also understands the emphasis of punctuation and capitalization such as “LOVE” or “!!!!!”.

Let us try some examples to test the functionality of VADER sentiment analyzer.

First of all we need to create a py file by using cmd.

Writing Code by using CMD (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

cd ../../

TYPE CON>test.py

Code Snippets:

from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer as sia test1 = ""I Love you..""

print(sia().polarity_scores(test1))

To terminate hit Ctrl+C or Ctrl+ZEnter (Ctrl+Z = EOF).

ModuleNotFoundError (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

If you are facing the ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘nltk’. Just installing the nltk package.

pip install nltk

Let us re-run the file again and check whether the issue has been solved.

testcode1 Output (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

python test.py

I guess you are able to get the meaning from the output right?

The output shows that in this sentence “I Love you..” a negative score is 0 neutral is 0.192 positive is 0.808 and compound is 0.6369 respectively. Compound value is computed by normalizing the scores from 3 categories which are negative positive and neutral respectively. Based on the compound value it is more than 0 which is a positive sentence.

Let us try 3 more test cases.

In order to edit our previous code since I am using Windows 10 no choice the only way is to use a notepad to edit my code.

notepad test.py

testcode2 (Screenshot by Author)

from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer as sia

test1 = ""I Love you..""

print(test1 ""==>""sia().polarity_scores(test1)) test2 = ""Sorry I don't love you..""

print(test2 ""==>""sia().polarity_scores(test2)) test3 = ""Let us be friend..""

print(test3 ""==>""sia().polarity_scores(test3))

testcode2 Output (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

I guess you notice the differences among the sentences and generate the different output. Based on the output of the sentence “Sorry I don’t love you..” it will categorize as a negative sentence whereas “Let us be friend” will categorize as a neutral sentence. It seems to work properly just like a human understanding. It also proves that VADER is clever enough to understand our human language.

Alright the testing phase ended so we move to the next phase getting the stock news from the web.

Part 2: Extracting the Stock Tickers from the web automatically

A stock ticker is a unique stock symbol with a series of letters assigned to a particular stock for trading purposes. I will guide how to crawl the stock tickers automatically instead of put manually. For more details suggested reading my previous article related to “Stock Market Analysis with Python Plotly Dash and PowerBI” I had guided clearly. In order to save more time I will re-use my previous code by modifying a few lines.

Stock Tickers Crawler (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

import requests

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup



html = requests.get('https://companiesmarketcap.com/tech/largest-tech-companies-by-market-cap/').text

soup = BeautifulSoup(html 'html.parser')

companyName = [x.get_text(strip=True) for x in soup.find_all('div' {'class': 'company-name'})][:10]

companyCode = [x.get_text(strip=True) for x in soup.find_all('div' {'class': 'company-code'})][:10]



print(companyCode)

Within these 7 lines we can extract 10 company stock tickers. As you see we are limiting 10 companies if you desired you are welcome to change the array slicing “[:<Number of Companies>]”. For example amend “companyName = [x.get_text(strip=True) for x in soup.find_all(‘div’ {‘class’: ‘company-name’})][:10]” to “companyName = [x.get_text(strip=True) for x in soup.find_all(‘div’ {‘class’: ‘company-name’})][:30]”. Below are the results of 10 companies and 30 companies respectively.

10 Stock Tickers

10 Companies Stock Ticker (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

30 Stock Tickers

30 Companies Stock Ticker (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

Part 3: Extracting Stock News Headline from Web

Alright now stock tickers are ready the next phase we need to extract Stock News Headline to do NLP sentiment analysis. Above I have listed out my previous Stock News Crawler it is a bot to extract the stock news information from the Star news official website but in this demo I will not use it there are 2 reasons.

Some of the company’s news from The Star may not really be related to finances (Query by stock Ticker). 2. Since I have no premium account to extract the full text of the news content I can’t do any NLP to filter out the irrelevant articles.

But no worries I will use another website which able to extract the relevant information but have some limitations.

Finviz is one of the websites that provided the information that we needed but it only showed the recent news.

Let me start the coding. I will guide one by one start from the basics and amend the code to be an automatic bot.

Get New Headlines Code (Coded and Screenshot by Author)



url = f'

req = requests.get(url headers={'user-agent': 'nlp_bot'}).text

html = BeautifulSoup(req 'html.parser')

headline = html.find(id='news-table') def news_headlines(ticker):url = f' https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t={ticker}' req = requests.get(url headers={'user-agent': 'nlp_bot'}).texthtml = BeautifulSoup(req 'html.parser')headline = html.find(id='news-table') return headline print(news_headlines('GOOG'))

For more details please read any web scraping documentation. In this code please take note to insert headers information when sending the requests to the finviz HTTP server. Without the user-agent the server will not return the data that you need.

Output:

Get New Headlines Output(Coded and Screenshot by Author)

As we see that we are able to extract the information that we need of course you can compare it with the original page the data is totally the same.

Finviz News Headlines Table(Coded and Screenshot by Author)

Next steps we need to preprocess this data and save it as dataframe for coming NLP processing.

Part 4: Data PreProcessing and save as structure dataset

Data Processing is always important when we perform data analysis. Based on the raw data we extracted it only shows the date information for the first row on that day others only show time.

Datetime Parser Class (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

class datetime_parser: def __init__(self):

self.date = ''

self.time = ''



def parsing(selfdateinfo):

dateinfo = [x.replace('\xa0\xa0' '') for x in dateinfo.split(' ')]

if len(dateinfo) > 1:

self.date = dateinfo[0]

self.time = dateinfo[1]

else:

self.time = dateinfo[0]



return datetime.strptime(self.date + "" "" + self.time ""%b-%d-%y %I:%M%p"")

We build a common DateTime parser to convert the raw data we extracted from the web and make it standardized.

Preprocessing function (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

def preprocessing(headline):

dParser = datetime_parser()

table = [x.a.text for x in headline.findAll('tr')]

date_info = [dParser.parsing(x.td.text) for x in headline.findAll('tr')]

print(table)

print(date_info)

I guess you notice I am using list comprehension instead of using for loop. For this one list comprehension is faster than the traditional for loop. For data processing I have written 2 articles to explain how to enhance the python code. It is not necessary for this course just additional knowledge.

def convert_to_DF(stock news):

stock_info = []

for x in news:

stock_info.append({**stock**x})



return pd.DataFrame(stock_info) def main():

stock_info = stock_ticker_crawler(limit=3)

stock_data = [convert_to_DF(x y) for x y in zip(stock_info news_headline_info)]

stock_data = pd.concat(stock_data)

stock_data.to_excel('final_data.xlsx')

print(stock_data)



if __name__ == '__main__':

main()

Here we go to link all the functions together. You can copy the full code and remember to install pandas and openpyxl package.

Finally complete the data that we need next we need to start Natural Language Processing.

Part 5: Performing Sentiment Analysis based on the stock news headline

Since our data are ready so let us start to do sentiment analysis. First of all we need to initialize our sentiment analyzer tool which is VADER and import the package.

from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer as sia def sentiment_analysis(title):

return sia().polarity_scores(title)['compound']

VADER Sentiment Analysis (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

The result has shown as above the sentiment analyzer generates the compound polarity scores. Therefore if more than 0 is a positive sentence less than 0 is a negative sentence. The simple stock news sentiment analysis bot has been done. Of course there are still a lot of methodologies to do our own sentiment analysis classifier by using sklearn TensorFlow Keras and etc.. A lot of tutorials are available on the internet. In the coming future I will prepare some NLP use cases to guide how to implement our own models or classifier on the applications.

Part 6: Data Visualization for Sentiment Scores

Data visualization is very important in the data science field it is a way to curate data into a form easier to understand highlighting the trends and outliers.

There are a lot of available BI tools in the market such as Power BI matplotlib seaborn plotly and etc..

matplotlib Mean Analysis (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

Excel Mean Analysis (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

According to the bar chart above it shows that the news of 06 March 2022 overall is good for Alphabet (Google) whereas 05 March 2022 is bad for Google it may affect Google’s stock price. Therefore we can extract the 05 March 2022 for verification.

Google 05 March 2022 Dataset

Google 05 March 2022 (Coded and Screenshot by Author)

Based on the scores values 1st and 3rd rows are the issues to affect the Google Stock Prices. From the human understanding we can confirm that the first one is one of the issues that may affect the Google stock markets heavily and 3rd one maybe not be an issue. Of course the classifier only based on the news headline may not be accurate but it is a quick way to do the stock price movement prediction.

Moreover we can copy the same code and paste to the PowerBi it will work as usual. Remember to move your main function by removing the tab make it visible by the power bi.

Conclusion

The good thing about using Power Bi we can drill through the detail list from the chart. It can provide quick analysis. If interested in Power Bi can view my previous articles “Stock Market Analysis with Python Plotly Dash and PowerBI”.

In a nutshell it is a quick way to analyze which news may affect the stock price movement or trends therefore investors can take early action on it. So this program can be used for daily monitoring. 🤣🤣🤣.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXRlLmFpLzEwLWJlc3QtZGF0YWJhc2VzLWZvci1tYWNoaW5lLWxlYXJuaW5nLWFpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best Databases for Machine Learning & AI,"Databases are fundamental to training all sorts of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) models. Over the last two decades there has been an explosion of datasets available on the market making it far more challenging to choose the right one for your tasks. At the same time the larger number of datasets means you can find the perfect fit for whichever application you're aiming towards.

Here’s a list of the 10 best databases for machine learning & AI:

Powered by Oracle MySQL is one of the most popular databases on the market. Created in 1995 it has consistently been one of the top open-source relational database management systems (RDBMS) used by major companies like Facebook Twitter Uber and Youtube.

What led to its rise in popularity? For one MySQL offers enterprise-grade gestures and a free flexible community license. It also has an upgraded commercial license and focuses on robustness and stability.

Here are some of the main advantages of MySQL:

Data security layers to protect sensitive data.

Scalability for when there are large amounts of data.

The Signal Side Arm app will switch on all police officers’ body cameras within 20 feet of a fellow officer who unholsters a firearm officials say assuring that key moments of an incident are recorded for use in later investigations.

Pasadena Police Department leaders will receive an order of this equipment and other gear in the coming months following the City Council’s approval of a five year $1.7 million contract between the city of Pasadena and Axon Enterprise.

Department officials will also have the ability to retrieve 18 hours of video prior to an incident tapping this new array of tools.

Mayor Victor Gordo said the agreement “opens a whole menu of options for the city’s police department.”

Interim Police Chief Cheryl Moody who discussed the department’s plan to implement the technology with Pasadena’s Community Police Oversight Commission on Thursday March 3 described the soon-to-be-available upgrades as “outstanding” because they will allow the department to be more transparent while investigating critical incidents.

Body cameras have been in use in Pasadena since 2016. However Moody said “there have been a couple of incidents in which the officer failed to even turn on their cameras.”

Currently officers have to manually switch cameras on and off which can be a hindrance in stressful situations according to Moody.

Fortunately Moody said technology enabled by the Axon 3 cameras such as Signal Sidearm — an app that activates all body cameras within a 20-foot radius of an officer who removes a weapon from a holster — allows Pasadena police and members of the public “an extra sense of security” knowing other cameras are turned on.

“That’s a really great feature for us and for transparency” she said.

Highlighting how police efforts were enhanced by technology that helped lead to arrests in the killing of Jamal Patterson last year Councilman Tyron Hampton said in a January interview after the cameras were presented to city leadership that he wishes the upgrades had been available earlier.

“I think if we had this technology it would have been helpful for the events leading up to (Anthony) McClain’s shooting” Hampton said. “This way we take out human error and ensure the officer’s camera — and all who are near them — are on so we have an idea of what exactly occurred.”

Moody said she couldn’t discuss the specifics of McClain’s shooting during the recent meeting with the Police Oversight commissioners but she did acknowledge the technology would’ve been helpful in investigating recent violent crimes.

“Had we had these cameras on Sunnyslope we’d have a ton of footage” she said “because this was almost a running gun battle so you had a lot of officers who had their weapons drawn so we would of had a lot of footage from that scene.”

Utilizing officer’s body-camera footage in-car video footage and audio recordings Pasadena Police Department officials ultimately pieced together an overview of last November’s shootout with a man who killed a local senior setting off a crime spree that ended in a fatal shootout with police.

A briefing released in January provided a deeper look at the harrowing 15-minute incident that spanned a two-block area but the PPD’s investigation into the incident is ongoing.

A one-time cost of $62500 for the upgrades in addition to an annual cost of $32000 for modules that would supervise performance of the department’s 295 cameras is “more than a worthy investment” Gordo said.

“This means police no longer have to think about turning on their cameras in a life-and-death moment” Gordo said. “They’ll respond to a call and it’ll all be done automatically with this system” so now the officers can focus on their job while knowing transparency will come later.

“That’s what I think is the biggest part – it’ll improve public confidence and transparency’ Gordo added. “And that’s why it’s important to employ available technology that will improve public safety and policing in Pasadena. This will take us in the direction of doing so while we strive to improve other tools we provide officers.”

Residents agreed during a December council discussion when public callers and council members alike applauded any attempts that would increase accountability responsibility and transparency in the city.

“It would make the public feel better about body-worn cameras if they actually did their job. So instead of saying don’t have them at all I’m saying If you have them let’s have them work and let’s have them work well” said Kat Ross representing Standing Up for Racial Justice Altadena-Pasadena. “It’d be great if when there was an incident the city could produce the last 18 hours of active camera use so we could really see as a public the full investigation.”

The new cameras are expected to be operational by Spring so Moody said the department is currently training officers to remember to tap their cameras.

“We try to make muscle-memory” Moody said” so it’s just repetitive repetitive repetitive training.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

A small city in Scandinavia was using flowmeters to report how much gas they were using and venting to the environmental authorities. The city was using mechanical meters with a local totalizer and no output. Every morning they had to send an employee to look at the totalizer from the two meters and calculate the actual difference from inlet gas and the burned gas to assess their plant performance and amount of gas flared.

Application

• Medium: Biogas

- Pipe: 2” (DN50)

- Temperature: ambient

- Accuracy requirement: ±2% of reading

Challenge

This biogas was somewhat ‘dirty’ and ‘wet’ and the municipality was questioning the meters’ totalizers. They were looking for a more reliable solution with outputs showing actual flow as well. When the company erected another biogas plant they were keen to find the best suitable solution.

Benefits: • Actual flow rate • Real time calculations of normal gas flow rate • Help for accurate reporting

Solution

Across both plants the customer opted for the PanaFlow Z1G DN50. The package we supplied included Pressure and Temperature sensors to read normal flow. After several months of operation the customer confirmed the meters were working per expectations and to their satisfaction.

But now the demolition of Aberdeen's Market is well underway with many memories set to be reduced to rubble.

Placed on the appropriately named Market Street the building was first opened in 1974 and became a staple for bargain hunters from across the north-east.

The first indoor market on this spot was opened in May 1842 but was destroyed by fire in April 1882. It was rebuilt and demolished again in 1971.

(Image: Daily Record)

It found a new lease of life when a massive Nuart mural was painted on the side of the building looking onto the Green.

An end of an era came when all the traders moved from the spot in 2020 in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.

In November 2020 plans were approved to demolish Aberdeen Market to make way for a leisure space.

Developer Patrizia said the project would inject ""new vibrancy"" into the area.

This was despite strong objections from the shopkeepers who had trade in the market.

(Image: Supplied)

Shaun Hose of Patrizia said: “Today’s decision is very welcome after four years of working on proposals for this site.""

In May 2021 a proposal was published that would see Aberdeen City Council purchase the market and the former BHS store. The property would be demolished and replaced with a partially open-air space for retail food and drink and leisure.

In October 2021 it was announced that the UK Government would contribute £20 million towards the redevelopment of the market which is expected to cost £75 million in total

Pictures obtained by Aberdeen Live by David Copeland show the demolition work proceeding inside the massive complex which hosted shops that were as diverse as pet shops to music stores.

(Image: Supplied)

What were once tiled floors have now been exposed as bare concrete with all the retailers in the once bustling hub now gone.

Piles of rubbish and demolished metalwork lay throughout the vast building as the demolition work continues.

David said: ""One the joys of my job was getting into the Old Aberdeen indoor market which is due to be knocked down very soon. Was not in the place much but thought share some photos got before it’s knocked down.""

The pictures have been shared on local social media- prompting a wave of nostalgia.]

Costs are going up due to a myriad of supply challenges and shoppers are feeling the effects as prices keep rising.

We've seen shortages before and with continuing disruptions to supply chains we were bound to see them again. These are six of the products you're likely to see running low—if you need them you may have to plan more in advance visit a couple of different stores or shop for more plentiful alternatives to avoid the sight of empty store aisles. (For more changes you'll see at the store soon here are 6 Things You'll See at Costco This Year.)

Milk

Got milk? Some grocery stores say they're struggling to keep it on shelves. The USDA reported that milk is still in short supply compared to years prior in small part because of reduced cow herds and in much larger part due to ongoing transportation labor and packaging shortages. Bryon Lehman a local farmer and board member of Dairy Farmers of America from Wichita Kan. gave KWCH-12 his perspective on the supply chain dilemma he and many U.S. farmers are facing.

""We have all the raw milk that's needed. It's more of a labor problem and processing"" Lehman said. ""We're no different out here on this farm. We can't find the help that we need. We're short of help…[And] we're 80000 semi drivers short in the United States now.""

Lehman added that he doesn't expect an end to the shortage any time in the near term so you may want to pour those glasses half-full for a while—or find a good substitute to tide you over.

Canned Goods

Having a cold drink in your hand might cost you a little more for a while. Aluminum remains in tenuous supply as prices peak from inventory deficits in China one of the largest exporters of the material reported Reuters. And the jump? A 24% price increase over the past six months according to The Wall Street Journal.

At the same time demand is higher than ever. The ""candemic"" that arose due to the recent popularity of canned beverages skyrocketed aluminum usage to unreachable heights. According to Waste Dive the Ball Corporation said they ""expect demand continuing to outstrip supply well into 2023.""

John Hayes the CEO of Ball told the site about other companies who want to venture into canned drinks ""We are capacity constrained right now. The reality is we don't have the cans to supply those people that are looking to go into it.""

Because of the lack of supply prepare for other canned goods to be short-stocked—soup pet food and alcohol to name a few.

Cream Cheese

This whipped spreadable bagel topping is still sparse on shelves. After COVID-related labor shortages and the cyberattack on Schreiber Foods hampered cream cheese production back in December some areas have seen continuing short supply into late February. A local news outlet reported seeing the effects in a Vermont bagel shop. Tammy Fersing the owner of the Burlington Bagel Bakery told MyChamplainValley that her store is missing cream cheese due to shipping delays and delivery issues.

If you're really in a pinch you can join the ranks of everyone who learned how to make their own with this recipe from Insider.

Wheat Corn Soybeans and Oats

The already-tight supply of the world's staple commodities took another hit with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Food Dive the two countries combined produce 29% of the wheat 19% of the corn and 80% of the sunflower oil for global exports. Back in February they reported that the conflict could lead to increased corn and wheat prices with a prediction of 20 to 30%. This leaves suppliers struggling to pay more to produce their products – like baked goods pasta packaged mixes and more.

Pasta

If you walked into your local grocery store and found the pasta aisle shockingly bare you're not the only one. Production for pasta has already been suffering from a lack of raw materials especially durum wheat. Now the conflict between Ukraine and Russia could put further pressure on wheat-based products. The two countries together produce over a quarter of the global wheat supply.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute David Laborde told The New York Times in February that the upcoming wheat harvest will give an indication about how the commodity is faring. ""By then if farmers could not harvest due to lasting military operations or if port facilities and railroads have been damaged the situation will be particularly gloomy"" he said.

In the meantime you may have better luck with finding gluten-free pasta—try subbing it in for your favorite Italian dish without the wheat.

Avocados

The popular heart-healthy fruit is going to be spread thin on your avocado toast for the next few brunches. Due to a combination of labor shortages and low rainfall avocado production hasn't kept up with booming demand which has created higher prices. The various associated farming costs aren't doing consumers any favors either. Price increases for water soil labor and freight all mean that you'll be paying more for your guac fix.

On top of production issues avocado imports to the U.S. from Mexico were delayed in February. An inspector was threatened for not certifying a shipment due to quality concerns which led to the U.S. halting inspections according to CBS News. With 80% of imported avocados supplied by Mexico producers were left with a backup of harvested fruit and longer wait times to transport them to stores.

The Banks Say It's Not Their Problem. (Published 2022),"Justin Faunce lost $500 to a scammer impersonating a Wells Fargo official in January and hoped that the bank would reimburse him. Mr. Faunce was a longtime Wells Fargo customer and had immediately reported the scam — involving Zelle the popular money transfer app.

But Wells Fargo said the transaction wasn’t fraudulent because Mr. Faunce had authorized it — even though he had been tricked into transferring the money.

Mr. Faunce was shocked. “It was clearly fraud” he said. “This wasn’t my fault so why isn’t the bank doing the right thing here?”

CHARLOTTE N.C. — A section of Charlotte FC fans were evacuated from their seats at Bank of America Stadium Saturday night during the team's inaugural home match against LA Galaxy.

Team officials confirmed to WCNC Charlotte sports director Nick Carboni a cellular antenna had slipped from its overhead mount and was no longer in a secure position. About 20 rows in section 520 were evacuated out of an abundance of caution.

Several members of the WCNC Charlotte team were attending the game when they noticed police directing fans in section 520 to leave. According to WCNC digital director Blair Shiff an officer with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said something was potentially about to fall.

WCNC Charlotte digital content producer Anders J.

Farmer Joe was enticed to take a bath with Claire both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmVkLWJhdGgtYmV5b25kcy1uZXctcGFyZW50LWNvbXBhbnktc2F5cy1pdHMtc3RpbGwtd29ya2luZy1vbi13aW5uaW5nLWJhY2stcmVwZWF0LWN1c3RvbWVycy0xZDZhYmRhM9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2JlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZHMtbmV3LXBhcmVudC1jb21wYW55LXNheXMtaXRzLXN0aWxsLXdvcmtpbmctb24td2lubmluZy1iYWNrLXJlcGVhdC1jdXN0b21lcnMtMWQ2YWJkYTM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bed Bath & Beyond’s new parent company working on winning back repeat customers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyonds-new-parent-company-says-its-still-working-on-winning-back-repeat-customers-1d6abda3 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmVkLWJhdGgtYmV5b25kcy1uZXctcGFyZW50LWNvbXBhbnktc2F5cy1pdHMtc3RpbGwtd29ya2luZy1vbi13aW5uaW5nLWJhY2stcmVwZWF0LWN1c3RvbWVycy0xZDZhYmRhM9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2JlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZHMtbmV3LXBhcmVudC1jb21wYW55LXNheXMtaXRzLXN0aWxsLXdvcmtpbmctb24td2lubmluZy1iYWNrLXJlcGVhdC1jdXN0b21lcnMtMWQ2YWJkYTM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

However a new SEC filing from Friday night revealed that someone at Berkshire Hathaway either Buffett himself or his portfolio managers is very excited about Occidental Petroleum.

As of Friday Berkshire owns 91.2 million common shares of the oil giant. They're worth $5.1 billion at tonight's close of $56.15. The stock gained 18% today and 45% this week.

It's been moving sharply higher along with the price of oil which has soared to around $115 barrel in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

And as Occidental was rallying Berkshire was buying.

More than 61 million of the shares now in its portfolio were purchased on Wednesday Thursday and today at prices ranging from $47.07 to $56.45.

The other 29 million shares were purchased this year on or before Tuesday. (Berkshire reported holding no OXY shares as of December 31 in its latest 13F filing.)

Berkshire did not respond Friday night to CNBC's request for comment.

We don't know exactly when it bought or what Berkshire paid for those 29 million shares because it had not yet hit the 10% ownership level that requires new purchases be disclosed within day after they are made.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vbWFoYS9uYW1lL2pvaG4tbWNrZW56aWUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzM2MDUzMDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John McKenzie Obituary (1928 - 2022) - Gainesville NE - Omaha World-Herald,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/omaha/name/john-mckenzie-obituary?id=33605300 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vbWFoYS9uYW1lL2pvaG4tbWNrZW56aWUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzM2MDUzMDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS91LXMtc2F5cy1ydXNzaWEtaXMtcmVjcnVpdGluZy1zeXJpYW5zLWZvci11cmJhbi1jb21iYXQtZmlnaHRpbmctaW4tdWtyYWluZS0xMTY0NjYxMjM0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. says Russia is recruiting Syrians for urban combat in Ukraine,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-says-russia-is-recruiting-syrians-for-urban-combat-fighting-in-ukraine-11646612349 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS91LXMtc2F5cy1ydXNzaWEtaXMtcmVjcnVpdGluZy1zeXJpYW5zLWZvci11cmJhbi1jb21iYXQtZmlnaHRpbmctaW4tdWtyYWluZS0xMTY0NjYxMjM0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ydXNzaWFuLXNvY2lhbGl0ZXMtc2hvd2luZy1zdXBwb3J0LXVrcmFpbmUtMTkyMzM2MjY5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Children of Russian Oligarchs Are Supporting Ukraine Despite Political Ties,"Activism comes in many forms: some take to the streets some raise money and others take to social media. While many have been taking it to the streets during the ongoing Ukrainian and Russian war some Russian elites are showing their solidarity through their social media.

These elite kids have a mixture of huge followings and political connections making their posts make headlines around the world.

One of the first to do this was Sofia Abramovich also known as the daughter of Russian oligarch and confidant of Vladimir Putin Roman Abramovich. She posted a message of her solidarity with the Ukrainian people on her Instagram story according to the NY Post. Along with that one of her posts powerfully read “The biggest and most successful lie out of the Kremlin propaganda is that most Russians are with Putin.”

Next Maria Yumasheva granddaughter of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin posted a photo of the Ukrainian flag to her Instagram on Feb. 24. She posted the photo with a caption that translates to “No War.”

Along with that according to her Instagram story from today she seems to be at an anti-war protest in Moscow.

The latest Russian socialite to show her stance on the ongoing war was the daughter of Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov named Elizaveta Peskova. According to the same NY Post article Elizaveta posted a photo with the translated caption of “No to the war.” However the post was quickly deleted.

Proceed at your own risk!

Bash’s past caught up to him during Transplant‘s stateside Season 2 premiere when he came face-to-face with his presumed-dead fiancée Rania.

More from TVLine

Transplant Recap

When the two finally had a moment to talk Rania explained that her father had been funneling regime documents to the Free Syrian Army. After their house was bombed they had to go into hiding and no one could know they were alive.

“But for five years? You could have found some way to get me a message” Bash countered.

Rania said she wanted to get in contact but she didn’t know where he was. Then when she learned that Bash had made a new life for himself and his sister Rania didn’t want him to risk everything to come and get her so she made the choice for him.

Transplant Recap

“It’s something that I don’t know if Bash necessarily made peace with in that he was OK with having lost that life” star Hamza Haq tells TVLine “but I think he understood the logic of it and was satisfied enough moving forward and trying to find a life and trying to find something stable in his life with Amira [and] in a potential courtship with Mags as we saw at the end of Season 1. And then here [Rania] is coming back and he’s sort of a deer in the headlights. It throws a lot of things into question for Bashir and we see him navigate all of those throughout the season.”

At the close of the season premiere Bash embraced a distraught Rania suggesting that the two will pick up where they left off. But is there room for Rania in Bash’s new life? “He has a second chance to rekindle a romance that he thought he had lost permanently” Haq shares. “This is somebody who brings him the comfort of home that his sister can relate to… And there is genuinely a good amount of love that still remains. But there’s also this other half of him that has moved on that has changed. Everything about the circumstances of his life has changed. As they try to figure out how to move forward there’s a speed bump or two along the way.”

Transplant Recap

One of those bumps might be a certain blonde doctor with whom Bash works. “I think it’s pretty evident what Bashir’s feelings are for Mags” Haq says. “Much like any personal relationship that he’s foraging he’s tentative because he’s afraid of losing people. And he’s also following Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to a tee. So until he’s figured out all these other things he won’t even explore something for himself because at some level until he achieves a certain level of comfort or a certain level of success or takes care of his sister he won’t think about what he needs as a person as a man and to some degree maybe he doesn’t even think he deserves it because of the enormous guilt that he feels over the loss of his parents and everything. And enter Mags who allows him to finally feel these sorts of things again and then enter Rania [with whom it’s] like ‘Well I had that already and now I have the opportunity to have that back.’ So there’s definitely conflict there.”

Elsewhere in the premiere Bishop survived his second stroke but he’ll be “facing some very difficult situations in regards to how and why he got to where we were at the end of Season 1” his portrayer John Hannah previews. “So there’s the ramifications of all of that that we have to deal with. But he very quickly [gets] back on his feet again.”

Schulze is the founder and chairman emeritus of Best Buy Co. Inc. and founder of The Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation. He’s also the founding benefactor of the Schulze School of Entrepreneurship at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis MN. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

The value of a college education has come under scrutiny in recent years. With average student debt in the US rising to more than $37000 in recent estimates more students are wondering if it is a choice they can afford. And as more affordable online programs become increasingly available others question whether the “traditional” college experience is relevant anymore.

As someone who did not attend college but who served for many years as a trustee on the board of the largest private university in my home state of Minnesota I myself have pressed our leaders in higher education to address rising costs and the burden of student debt so that every student can reap the rewards and returns of a traditional college education. But it is not just the cost of education that determines if a student will generate a positive return on the experience. It is also obviously what they learn and how they learn it.

One way to make college more impactful for all students is to engage them in learning the entrepreneurial skillset. Whether as an entrepreneurship major or minor or in liberal arts courses that explore the entrepreneurial mindset and process or through venture competitions startup incubators or design thinking workshops — teaching students to think and act as entrepreneurs does remarkable things. It motivates and energizes students it builds their critical and creative thinking capabilities it focuses them on the ways they can make an impact in the world and it prepares them to enter the workforce with passion purpose and confidence. Regardless of whether they start a business or not students with entrepreneurial training are better equipped to identify and craft opportunities for themselves and their employers to bring innovative thinking to the problems they face and to mobilize the resources they need to implement new and better solutions.

And while some may think that entrepreneurs are born I disagree. As is true in any discipline or craft someone with significant raw entrepreneurial talent still needs formal education and training. Formal education isn’t just about learning facts and formulas although being exposed to a broader range of ideas and knowledge is of course invaluable in and of itself. The best education is one that teaches people how to think. And an entrepreneurial education demands just that — it means you must take what you are learning and color it with your own unique perspective and creative insight. Unconventional out-of-the-box thinking requires confidence and boldness which are muscles worked in a formal educational setting. And students inspire and push each other as much as faculty and sometimes more.

I would also argue that calculated risk-taking — something essential for innovation entrepreneurship or creativity in any field — is worth teaching in a proper setting. The best entrepreneurs aren’t those who necessarily hit a home run on their first attempt; they keep trying and they learn from their failures. Being in that setting with expert guidance from faculty and collaboration with classmates offers security as well as permission to fail and the lessons around how to fail smart. Without that kind of lived experience in the classroom many would-be entrepreneurs never find the confidence to take the risks that could make their aspirations real.

A formal education can be especially helpful for potential entrepreneurs coming from underrepresented or marginalized backgrounds. Small business ownership is one of the best ways to build intergenerational wealth and we can’t afford for talented and driven young people to miss out on this opportunity.

Still the rising cost of education remains a critical issue that needs to be addressed if we wish to see these students excel. Universities must continue to cut costs and those of us with the resources to do so must step up to support scholarships mentorships and internships to help all students access and make the most of their experience.

Let’s not give up on college. The truth is it remains a crucial driver of success. But we must empower our students with the skills to be innovators creators and entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship education empowers students to think creatively to seek opportunities and solve problems to empathize with others to take risks to accept failure as part of the growth process and to help take a passion or idea and turn it into a viable business. Learning to think and act like an entrepreneur emboldens students to take charge of their own destinies and in doing so it powers the American Dream.

My success story is the kind of entrepreneurship story that people like to glamorize but the reason those stories are popular is because they’re so unlikely. What we need right now aren’t idealized stories of success but a reliable pathway for all bright young minds with the right ideas to make the most of their opportunities and entrepreneurial education provides just that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2ktd2VudC10by1iZXN0LWJ1eS1mb3VyLXdlZWtzLWFnby1hbmQtdGhleS1zdGlsbC13b250LWxldC1tZS1nby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I went to Best Buy four weeks ago. They still won't let me go,"I love you but please stop. By Ken Wolter -- Shutterstock

Let's go back to 1969 when our oven was built.

It had been a stalwart. It looked retro-timeless. If I could have hugged it I would have. But it died.

Then we looked around and realized that the hood above the cooktop hadn't worked for more years than I'll admit here.

I said years didn't I? That's given you a clue about our lives. I'm sorry about that.

""We need to get some new appliances"" said my wife who (in case you didn't know) is a scientist.

After measuring and thinking and thinking about measuring some more we decided to go to Best Buy. Somehow it made sense. Best Buy has survived and even thrived when so many other electronics stores have gone the way of our oven.

Best Buy? Actually it was better than that

We thought we knew what we wanted. Vaguely.

Samsung for a fridge and a dishwasher. Some sort of brand name we'd heard of for a range.

We walked around Best Buy and began to see things that looked as if they might work and fit. They were definitely nicer than the things we had. Our cooktop was at least 20 years old. The fridge was likely top-of-the-line during the Reagan administration.

And then we were gently accosted by a Best Buy salesperson.

We began to explain our thought processes and oddly he listened. He then walked round the store with us listened some more and gave us gentle advice.

But there wasn't a range that we liked. So he brought us over to his computer and asked what sort of range we liked.

My wife named some brand we'd happened to see online and he instantly knew what it was. No we hadn't pronounced it correctly.

He proceeded to show us our options on his screen. He explained which ones were immediately available. He described their various merits and flaws. He introduced us to brands we hadn't heard of -- Windster for example -- and not once did he try to upsell us to some grotesquely exaggerated appliance.

Within perhaps 20 to 30 minutes we'd bought everything we needed.

Except that we knew there would likely be an issue with delivery. Supply shortages abound. Yet this gentle wonderful salesman promised us delivery on a certain date. I confess we walked out of there bemused at what a pleasant shopping experience it had been.

""What was that?"" I said to my wife.

""That was pretty good"" she replied.

Tell us again how good we were

The next day I got an email from Best Buy with the subject line: ""Your Feedback Is More Important Than Ever.""

I was confused.

My feedback was ever important? Why is it so important now?

Naturally I read on. ""Your feedback is always important and helps us provide the great experiences you expect."" Ah so it's always been important and it's not in fact more important than ever.

I filled out the survey. It was a pleasure. The Best Buy salesman had been utterly wonderful.

But then the e-commerce began to e-xasperate. Another email arrived. It wondered whether we were getting the most out of our new fridge. A little difficult to answer this one as it wouldn't be delivered for another three weeks.

I ignored that email.

Still all went quiet until delivery approached. Would it happen we wondered. Would we suddenly be let down?

But no everything arrived on time. A text and a phone call announced the imminent arrival. Everything entered the house smoothly.

No but tell us again how good we were

The very same day I discovered another survey in my inbox. This one was headlined: ""Review Your Best Buy Purchase.""

How am I supposed to do that when the appliances are sitting in boxes because they only just arrived a few hours ago?

Best Buy you see already wanted me to help its next customer. Yet even if we'd had the range magically installed how were we supposed to review it if we hadn't even had time to cook on it?

Two days later -- oh you've gotten there already haven't you?

Another email: ""Your Feedback Is More Important Than Ever.""

No Best Buy. We've already established that it isn't. And I already filled out the feedback survey you sent a month ago. Didn't you get it?

Worse this email thanked me for my online order when did you read the last survey I'd filled in I told you how much I'd enjoyed your in-store experience.

Still Best Buy was done right?

It was. For approximately four hours.

That's how long it took for the company to send another email: ""Your Appointment Is Complete. How Did We Do?"" You did wonderfully until you started to send me all of these emails.

In the month between buying the appliances and having them delivered I received 18 various emails from Best Buy. Which to my mind is a lot.

I understand the purpose of surveys follow-up emails and selling. I know why companies send them. But once you've filled out a survey saying how very happy you were is it really wise to send more survey requests that make you a little unhappy?

This was all in between the other Best Buy emails that suddenly multiplied their way into my inbox begging me to buy more and more things. There's something about good e-commerce that becomes pestering e-commerce and Best Buy came mightily close to pestering.

You did a lovely job Best Buy. You should give your in-store salesman a large raise. Great employees are hard to come by.

But please are we done with the emails now? Or are you going ask for the recipes of everything we've cooked on the range?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS93aGVuLXRvLWJ1eS1wb2ludHMtbWlsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When does it make sense to buy points and miles?,"Many loyalty programs will sell you their program's points or miles currency with no strings attached.

You can jump online log in to your account and buy points or miles with a credit card and a few clicks. These programs usually have generous purchase limits meaning you could top up your balance with a six-figure amount in minutes.

What's the catch? Well the cost. The purchase price per point or mile is usually much higher than TPG's valuations.

The good news is that programs occasionally run promotions to buy points and miles. During these promotions you can often snag points and miles for about half their typical cost.

However you may not want to buy points and miles even when they're on sale. So in this guide I'll discuss when it makes sense to buy points and miles.

When should you buy miles?

It makes sense to buy miles when you can obtain more value for redeeming them than it costs you to purchase them. Say you were looking at a flight that would cost $500 in cash or 20000 points plus $50 in fees and taxes. If you could buy those 20000 miles for 1 cent each during a bonus promotion then the cost of that airfare with your purchased miles would only be $250 (20000 x .01 + $50) rather than the $500 for a standard cash fare.

That would be a great deal.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

But there are caveats.

The calculation above assumes that you can redeem the miles for the airfare you want at the redemption rate first quoted. The first problem with this assumption is that redemption availability constantly changes. The seat that may have been available today when you considered buying the points and miles might not be available tomorrow when you have purchased the points and miles and try to use them.

The second issue is that the number of miles you need could increase. Most programs increase mileage requirements from time to time — this is called a devaluation as the miles become less valuable. Some programs will give members warnings before changes happen but programs have also devalued miles overnight without notice.

If you're confident you can redeem the miles for the purpose you bought them for at the price you are happy with it can make sense to buy miles.

It can also make sense when you are a few thousand points or miles short of a big redemption such as first-class flights for your honeymoon. Even if the miles aren't on sale it can make sense to buy the last miles you need so you can go ahead and lock in your redemption.

When shouldn't you buy miles?

Obviously if it's cost-ineffective you shouldn't buy miles.

You should also keep in mind that when you are buying miles you are subject to the cost of the miles and the taxes and fees associated with booking your award tickets. For example Virgin Atlantic only requires 20000 miles for a round-trip flight from New York to London. With the current promotion you could buy 20000 Virgin Atlantic points for around $350. But before you think that you've effectively found a $175 one-way flight to London you need to understand the fee structure associated with this type of ticket.

First you'll need to pay a $33.50 transaction fee to buy the miles. Then when booking your ticket you'll pay $365 in taxes and fees. In this case the taxes and fees alone are more expensive than the cost of the miles. Suddenly your ticket looks closer to $750. You might be able to do better by paying cash outright for a paid fare.

Also when you are traveling on miles you are almost always unable to accrue airline miles or earn status.

It rarely makes sense to purchase miles if you don't plan to redeem them immediately — known as purchasing them ""speculatively."" This is because you can't guarantee their value in the future when you decide to use them because of devaluations and other ways loyalty programs can change their programs.

Bottom line

You can get some amazing deals by buying miles and points in the right circumstances. Over the past decade I've bought more than a million points and miles in different programs. That is because at the time I had immediate uses for them and could (and did) really maximize my travel.

If you are considering buying points or miles know that it's unlikely those points and miles will ever be worth more than they are right now. After all now that travel is back points and miles devaluations are on the rise. So if you're buying speculatively it's possible your newly purchased points and miles could drop in value before you use them.

That’s great! Laptops are brilliant and we have plenty of buying guides such as the best laptops 2022 best gaming laptops and best laptops for students which can help you find the ideal model for you.

However I’m going to go against my usual advice and say don’t buy a laptop this weekend.

That’s it. Put your wallets and purses away or your rune-filled pouches if you’re thoroughly immersed in Elden Ring and hold tight as this weekend may be a bad time to buy a new laptop.

Why? Well we know on Tuesday March 8 Apple will be holding a March Event and alongside rumors of new iPhones and iPads there’s a growing number of people who expect to see some new Macs and MacBooks at the event including possibly the MacBook Air 2022.

If these rumors are true then we could be days away from Apple revealing a follow-up to the best laptop you can buy right now.

(Image credit: Future)

The previous model the MacBook Air (M1 2020) absolutely blew us away when it launched. Thanks to the (then) new M1 chip designed by Apple this was a laptop that offered brilliant performance excellent battery life and a fanless thin and light design that made it completely silent when in use.

Add in a stunning screen solid build quality and a price tag that was quite a bit cheaper than rival Windows laptops that offer a similar level or performance and it’s little surprise that this is still the laptop we recommend you buy above all others even one and a half years after its release. The fact that it has dropped in price and is now even better value means ordinarily I’d have no qualms with recommending it even for people who usually hate Apple.

But don’t buy it this weekend. On Tuesday there’s a real possibility that we could see a new and improved MacBook Air with rumors suggesting it’ll be powered by a new M2 chip. This could bring vast performance improvements over the previous MacBook Air and in the past Apple has released new models of its MacBooks at the same price the previous model sold for.

That means by waiting a few days you may get a substantial upgrade for the same price. Of course if Apple does release a new MacBook Air I expect the price of the older model to then drop further. The existence of a new MacBook Air doesn’t suddenly make the older model obsolete. But it will lead to retailers dropping the price to clear stock for the newer model.

So even if you’re set on the MacBook Air (M1 2020) it’s still worth waiting a few days as it could mean you save a bit of money on the laptop you were thinking about buying.

What about Apple haters?

But what about people who are avidly anti-Apple? I suggest you still wait until Tuesday and see what Apple shows. You never know you may be impressed and if you aren’t then you’ve not lost anything.

I’ve been using Windows since 3.1 but the MacBook Air won me over with just how good it is and the new one whenever it arrives could do the same with you. These days most apps have macOS versions so the switch to macOS from Windows is a lot easier.

Also unlike Apple’s other products like the Apple Watch and HomePod that annoyingly only work with other Apple products Mac and MacBooks are thankfully less tied to Apple’s ecosystem. While you get some nice additional benefits from owning an iPhone or iPad alongside a MacBook you can use it if you don’t have any other Apple devices.

As a first Apple laptop then the MacBook Air is a great choice and any new model will likely be the same.

However if you’re thinking of buying a gaming laptop this weekend – go ahead. It’s unlikely Apple will show anything even remotely resembling a gaming laptop at the event and while the powerful new MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch can be configured with the M1 Max chip which can offer enough GPU power to play modern games gaming on Mac is still rather neglected.

But for anyone else considering a new laptop I really recommend you hold tight until after Tuesday. We may be about to see a follow-up to the best laptop money can buy right now."

The United Arab Emirates' global investment platform Investopia has signed a memorandum of understanding with the American investment corporation BlackRock the UAE Ministry of Economy said in a tweet today.

The memorandum stipulates that BlackRock will support and participate in workshops and discussions held by Investopia at the Dubai Expo 2020 on March 28. The event will focus on the future of global investment the official Emirates News Agency reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzE0MDEyYWU2LTZhM2QtNDNmZS04MmM5LTRjNTM3OGRjOTc0Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BlackRock funds ride high on ethical investment inflows,"Print this page

By building a dominant suite of exchange traded funds BlackRock has also developed a marketplace for people eager to align their beliefs with environmental and socially-conscious investments.

Competitors are now springing up such as the start-up investment fund Engine No. 1. Nevertheless BlackRock under chief executive Larry Fink remains by far the largest player in ETFs that have environmental social and governance (ESG) characteristics — via its iShares range.

Independent investment research group CFRA calculates that almost 60 per cent of all assets in ESG ETFs are held through BlackRock — and 64 per cent of new net fund flows into such funds in the past year have gone to BlackRock.

As a result BlackRock manages seven of the 10 largest ethically-themed ETFs in the US and the three largest such funds in Europe according to data provider Morningstar.

“In the ESG space specifically BlackRock has been very dominant” says Aniket Ullal head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA.

Although Europe has led the development of ESG products Americans have more money invested specifically in ESG ETFs. BlackRock’s ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF alone has $24bn of assets under management Morningstar reports. That is more than double the largest equivalent ESG fund domiciled in Europe which is also an iShares MSCI USA ETF.

This growth in the ESG ETF market in the US has largely been driven by young millennial investors who manage their own accounts.

US law discourages employers from putting ESG funds into 401(k) retirement plans. But while asset managers push the Biden administration to change this law demand for ESG ETFs is being “driven by younger investors specifically those with self-directed accounts” Ullal says. “They want their investments to reflect certain values.”

Still people looking to ESG funds for exposure to businesses that reflect their values will find their holdings dominated by the same few big companies. Microsoft is the most widely held stock in US ESG funds according to Bank of America and is often the top holding in the largest such vehicles. Apple and Alphabet are often the other two technology titans jockeying for the top position in such exchange traded vehicles according to an analysis of the largest fund holdings in the US and Europe.

Similarly ESG funds will typically exclude the same types of company: those that make civilian firearms controversial weapons or tobacco as well as businesses involved in coal or oil sands.

BlackRock has been able to win inflows for its sustainable investing products mainly because their charges are low — in most cases comparable to the cost of holding conventional non-ESG ETFs.

However there are competitors offering themed funds that will do more than passively track an ESG index.

Engine No. 1 the investment fund that won three board seats at energy group ExxonMobil in 2021 launched its inaugural ETF last June and now has $288mn of assets under management. Rather than excluding certain companies or rebalancing stocks its ETF challenges companies by voting at their annual general meetings. It seeks to “hold companies and leadership teams accountable”. The ETF promises to work actively with companies to drive performance.

Engine No. 1’s second ETF which began trading earlier this year invests in companies that are on target to have net zero carbon emissions. And it is a type of mandate that has become increasingly popular observes Rumi Mahmood a vice-president for ESG and climate fund research at MSCI the index supplier.

“One emerging area of growth particularly in Europe is funds that are aligned to explicit temperature targets” he says. Paris-aligned ETFs for example will track indices in which constituent companies “are on a trajectory toward a 1.5 degree target [of capping man-made climate change]” he explains.

But the new Engine No. 1 ETFs are notable in that they are actively managed. These ETFs do not merely track an index but are mandated to follow an active management process while still publishing their holdings each day. Now the enthusiasm for actively-managed ETFs is coming together with the enthusiasm for all things ESG says Ullal.

ESG funds’ popularity has also grown as their fees have dropped in recent years. For large asset managers such as BlackRock the fees charged for ESG ETFs have become comparable to those for conventional equivalents. The management fee for BlackRock’s largest ESG ETF is 15 basis points. “We will continue to see fee compression” Mahmood predicts.

One of the big questions for ETF providers going forward is whether ESG funds will become core holdings for investors Ullal says. “Will they stop holding the S&P 500 ETF and instead hold the ESG ETF equivalent?” he asks.

“If they want core US equity exposure will they [also] insist on an ESG screen? If that happens I think that will be a significant shift in the US market.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNodGltZXMuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvc3RhZ2UvcmVnZ2llLWZyb20tdGhlLWJsYWNrcm9jay1yb2FkLXByZXBhcmVzLXRvLWp1bXAtZnJvbS1jYW1lcmEtdG8tc3RhZ2UtMS40ODEyMDc50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reggie from the Blackrock Road prepares to jump from camera to stage,"As a weanling housewife many years ago I was told that I never need worry about entertaining Cork people: they only want to talk about themselves. The truth of this advice must be part of the success – which might be called roaring if it were not delivered sotto voce – of Patrick FitzPatrick’s alias as Reggie a personality shortly to jump the ravine from camera to stage sotto voce and all.

It might not be too great a leap: in one form or another FitzPatrick has been performing for several years by now merging his enlarged – and socially exaggerated – agony column Ask Audrey to a broadcast series on Red FM in which Reggie was a minor character among others in his scripts.

“I know people like Reggie” FitzPatrick says now. “And I really know Cork city well and its various languages. I know that there’s a right and a wrong side of the Rochestown Road but my characters are universal the pretensions are the same everywhere.” After a slight pause he adds that “the GAA plays a big part in the scripts really.”

As we meet in the city’s Metropole Hotel it seems too ironic to be plausible that this very template of the urban legend of the Cork woman rushing into the street crying that “my son the engineer is drowning!” should be in fact an engineer.

Writing gags for Brendan O'Connor's Saturday night TV show was the hardest and the best thing I've ever done. That was how I learned to land a joke

It’s an irony that FitzPatrick enjoys; the mill of his comedy is always ready for grist. It’s no great surprise then that when his original radio commentaries in studio sessions were upended by Covid he took his phone and his research to the South Mall still Cork’s legal and business epicentre bristling with brass plates. Where else for a man commenting from his exclusive fastness on the Blackrock Road who has little to say for Limerick a city that allows plumbers to play rugby? Or who acknowledges that one of the passions of his otherwise apparently orderly life is a campaign to keep “the Norries” who live on the north side of the river (itself sometimes called the moat) from trespassing on the southern Marina? Or who will ponder the influence of Roy Keane on the Cork accent and equally query why the people of Passage West always want to announce where they come from: “Guilt I suppose.”

It wasn’t always thus. An engineer after all. So reared in Kinsale educated first at Presentation Brothers’ College (Pres to the Cork cognoscenti) a graduate of UCC and then spending 14 years in Dublin where the mantle of the Cork mafia fell on FitzPatrick’s shoulders through the encouragement of journalist and broadcaster Brendan O’Connor who introduced him to the potential of journalism. And to a career in jokes.

“He got me going although it was a bit of the Celtic Tiger madness to make that change from IT. But writing gags for O’Connor’s Saturday night TV show was the hardest and the best thing I’ve ever done. That was how I learned to land a joke and that has really paid off in terms of Reggie.”

Ah Reggie. Reggie of the whispered aspersions from his multi-million-euro mansion in superb surburbia will be alive and well on the Everyman stage for three weeks in April. Everyman’s artistic director Sophie Motley agrees that it’s a long stint for a one-man show. And isn’t meeting your heroes always a risk? Could the transition from screen to stage deflate the impact of a character so successful on Twitter that it has as they say “gone viral”?

“No I think through working with Pat Kiernan it has been condensed into something larger than life” says Motley. “After all he has been a performer for years. I think that people will want to come and see this person who had helped so many of us get through the past two years. There’s something intriguing and exciting about that. And it also shows how by being utterly local you can be national and even international at the same time. People all over the world tune in to Reggie – and now he’s being taken on to another sphere.”

Motley’s robust confidence is bolstered not only by the fact of very good early ticket sales but by the pairing of FitzPatrick and Corcadorca’s Kiernan thus she believes surrounding Reggie with the experience tools techniques and magic of incredibly talented people. People such as Irene O’Mara lecturer and voice coach at the MTU Cork School of Music who must meet the challenge of tone and pace presented by an auditorium to a performer whose style is a confidential undertone.

As surnames are too common Reggie doesn’t admit to one; neither can he find “any crack at all” in religion or politics. He’s too pious to talk about sex (although there was that Maureen in Kerry) but somehow it seems to be here so allusively that it’s almost gone before you laugh as with the woman who does “this amazing thing with her tongue – very open-minded”. Or with the reminder that trust is so important when you’re cheating on your wife.

Facebook is a bit Turner’s Cross for him and to be honest he’d rather lick the street of Cappoquin than allow a Norrie into the Royal Cork Yacht Club. For more social complexity the northside includes Montenotte and Sunday’s Well but those old merchant elites cannot alleviate Reggie’s disdain.

'My characters are universal the pretensions are the same everywhere.' Photograph: Miki Barlok

The narrative fluency of his obscenities has the casual ease of chat with the lads although he assures me that he only uses the toned-down versions. “I try to avoid any actual nastiness. Anyway the Norries always win out. It’s not a derogatory term really and basically they just don’t care what anyone says about them. They get the jobs.”

With friends who share his patois he is secure in the nicknames and the double or quadruple titles although Seán Mac Seán Mac O’Shea O’Shea surely arises from his parents’ decision to link him forever to a grandfather’s tradition of Patrick FitzPatrick? No he says “It’s a Kerry thing I just repeated it.”

He is what he hears but that disguises the more reflective personality who has found a Cork peculiarity to hone a viewpoint echoing in asides. a slanted sentence a lifted eyebrow a question. He wonders what the internet offers to posterity there’s no telling how it will age and the challenge for him is to make something more substantial.

He’s not straining for anyone’s attention either. The Reggie clips are only two minutes long there’s no commitment – share it move on. “And there are no consequences really. A bit like Boris Johnson that fake sincerity. The really strange thing is that essentially Reggie is talking to himself.”

'It's a very Cork context' he admits 'but then Cork people are everywhere'

The impression is often of some delicious gossip culled from a life lived close to Cork’s own self-satisfaction. “It’s a very Cork context” he admits “but then Cork people are everywhere.” And everywhere is flesh for his scalpel; that localities have their own hilarity was brought into blistering focus with the pandemic restrictions forbidding movement outside the county bounds.

“Kilmallock” he muses. “Mentioning a place has a great resonance especially for Irish people. And it’s true in a way I’m also aiming for the kind of thing that Dame Edna does finding the right punchline. Some words sound funnier than others. Kanturk lands better somehow.”

'It’s not just me coming out with a mike there’s a flow to it' says FitzPatrick of the one-man show. Photograph: Miki Barlok

That hinterland of country towns is harvested for Ask Audrey in the Irish Examiner for which FitzPatrick also writes parenting advice and television reviews. There have also been books but of these several staples of his career so far Reggie has been the most profitable “relatively speaking”. That career so far has led to getting on the stage. “I wanted to do it live and the theatre’s PR Jean Kearney put me in touch with Everyman and Sophie and from there to Pat Kiernan a director with a great pedigree.”

In rehearsal at Ballymaloe’s Grain Store the performance is shaped to have purpose. There has been quite a lot of re-writing and sharpening: “It’s not just me coming out with a mike there’s a flow to it. As for where it will lead I don’t know except that working with people who know what they’re doing is the way to go now. Wherever that may be.’ As always the conversation ends in a question reminding me of Reggie’s invitation to his friends to select a Kerry town they might like to see moved to Cork: “But you’d be wasting your time now offering Listowel.”

Blackrock College underlined their Leinster Schools Senior Cup title credentials with an emphatic victory against Terenure College in a one-sided quarter-final at Energia Park on Sunday afternoon.

69-time champions at this grade ‘Rock had no fewer than seven try-scorers - centre Hugh Cooney bagged a brace - as they comfortably put their overwhelmed south Dublin rivals to the sword and became the first team to advance into the last-four of this year’s competition.

Firm favourites to progress after squeezing past fellow powerhouses St Michael’s College in a gripping opening round tie the Williamstown school dominated possession from the word go. Efficiently working their way through a series of attacking phases it was a matter of when rather than if they would take the lead.

When the play was transferred towards the right corner on six minutes team captain Gus McCarthy was on hand to drive over the line in confident fashion.

While outhalf Zach Quirke couldn’t find the range off his touchline conversion it wasn’t long before he was back on the kicking tee. Following an overthrow off a ‘Nure line-out inside their own ‘22’ ‘Rock found themselves on the front-foot once again.

They were subsequently rewarded for their patient build-up as inside centre Luke Kritzinger crossed the whitewash under a slew of opposition bodies for their second try of the contest in the 12th-minute.

Quirke was off-target for a second time in the wake of this five-pointer before finally opening his account with a routine bonus strike to compliment a third ‘Rock try from tighthead Paddy McCarthy.

A young brother of rising Leinster lock Joe McCarthy’s powerful finish was immediately followed by Cooney’s superb dash over the line on the right-wing. This ensured his side were already 22 points in front at the first-quarter mark and seemingly on their way towards a convincing triumph.

Gus McCarthy was close to claiming his second score off an intricate lineout move just shy of the half-hour mark but knocked the ball on from a delicate off-load by his namesake Paddy. Nonetheless a fifth try inevitably arrived through secondrow Alex Mullan and with Quirke supplying the extras Blackrock established an insurmountable 29-0 interval cushion.

Given it is the alma mater of both Brian O’Driscoll and Garry Ringrose there is often a heavy weight placed on the shoulders of outside centres in any ‘Rock team. The aforementioned Cooney certainly looks like he could be one for the future and he doubled his tally with a clinical close-range finish four minutes after the restart.

The introduction of a plethora of replacements did little to halt the momentum of a rampant ‘Rock as replacement scrumhalf Will Fitzgerald became the latest player to cross over on 48 minutes.

Despite the best efforts of skipper Darragh Brooks ‘Nure were simply coming off second best. While they had a couple of entries into the ‘Rock 22 they couldn’t create any sustained attacking momentum.

‘Rock on the other hand continued to discover gaps inside their defence and winger Eoghan Walsh raced over on the left flank for a try that rounded off a demolition job for Justin Vanstone’s charges.

Total rugby. That is what Blackrock produced to overwhelm Terenure in the Bank of Ireland Leinster Schools Senior Cup quarter-final at Energis Park on Sunday.

The hot favourites wasted no time in stamping their authority a familiar theme of backs and forwards sharing the ball to create space in close and out wide for captain Gus McCarthy centre Luke Kritzinger and tight-head Paddy McCarthy to score out-half Zach Quirke converting the latter for 17-0 in the 15th minute.

There was no way back for Terenure losing number eight Ultan Byrne to injury and relying almost exclusively on their defence to make a game of it captain Darragh Brooks Cuan Doyle Yago Fernandez-Vilar and James Clarke doing what they could.

The weight and quality of the pressure were relentless as centre Hugh Cooney and second-row Alex Mullan - Quirke converted the latter - rowed in with the fourth and fifth tries for 29-0 at the halfway point.

It would have been understandable for Terenure to buckle under the onslaught but replacements Ben Nolan Matthew Lydon and Peter McNamara made an impact.

Unfortunately it only made life more difficult for the well-oiled ‘Rock machine as Cooney on a hard line stretched the advantage.

The organisation and aggression of Blackrock’s defence matched that of their work with the ball the McCarthys Gus and Paddy always prominent from the front row.

The wearing down process was complete when left-wing Eoghan Walsh sprinted into the left corner and replacement Will Fitzgerald from close range rounded out the eight tries.

And while both deals closed out agreements reached in 2021 the market climate that helped generate the transactions is still in place and could spawn similar deals if macroeconomic factors of inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine don’t diminish investor confidence real estate executives told CoStar News.

Affiliates of Highgate Hotels and Cerberus Capital Management completed their $1.5 billion acquisition of CorePoint Lodging of which Blackstone affiliates held about a third of outstanding stock and approved of the deal.

Separately Brookfield Property Partners reported closing the sale of its investment in an extended-stay hospitality portfolio for $1.5 billion. A joint venture of Blackstone and Starwood Capital is the buyer.

While U.S. hotel industry performance has been slowly but steadily recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic the deals show the recovery of the hotel sector is on a much faster track.

“I think when you look at the volume of transactions last year was obviously strong. It was up almost 400% over 2020 but up over a low number” Kevin Davis Americas CEO at JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group told CoStar News in an interview.

What is more impressive Davis added is the number of deals that were flying around and are still being worked or considered. Driving the behind-the-scenes interest is the amount of capital available to invest.

There was a substantial amount of dry powder going into the COVID-19 pandemic and substantial amounts more raised in the early months as investors teed up for potential distressed buying opportunities he said.

“So the net is that you have a tremendous amount of capital ready to be deployed in the hospitality space” Davis said. “You couple that with the specter of inflation now at a 40-year high which coupled with the fact that hotels can reset rates every night that serves as a tremendous inflation hedge. I think that makes the sector much more attractive relative to some of the other commercial real estate asset classes.”

However Davis said investors are on high alert for potential macro issues surrounding the Federal Reserve’s response to rising inflation and whether the war in Ukraine escalates.

“The markets should hold up as long as we don’t have exogenous events like a full-scale war to undermine market confidence and as long as the Fed is deliberate and responsible in terms of raising rates” Davis said.

The completion of the CorePoint deal is a continuation of record mergers and acquisitions activity among real estate investment trusts last year according to Calvin Schnure senior vice president of research and economic analysis at the REIT industry trade group Nareit.

“There has been a flurry of mergers including deals going private and I expect these may continue” Schnure told CoStar News in an email. “There is a lot of money in the space these days. In terms of acquisitions (property-level purchases) 2021 acquisitions of $67.8 billion was the highest on record. With rising share prices giving REITs an attractive cost of capital many are expanding their footprint. That appears likely to continue this year.”

La Quinta Hotel Portfolio

CorePoint holdings consist mainly of midscale and upper-midscale select-service hotels consisting primarily of La Quinta-branded properties. As of Sept. 30 the REIT owned interests in about 160 hotels with roughly 22000 rooms. The hotels are located primarily in or near employment centers airports and major travel thoroughfares.

As of the end of September the properties had not fully recovered from the effects of efforts to shut down the spread of COVID-19 according to recent loan surveillance by Kroll Bond Rating Agency.

The CorePoint properties were subject to a commercial mortgage-backed securities loan with an outstanding balance of about $295 million in January according to CoStar data. KBRA said the principal balance was paid off that month.

KBRA estimated that the portfolio’s net cash flow through September was about 36% lower than when the loan was issued in 2018. In addition the properties were operating at occupancies that were below historical performance.

CorePoint had been pursuing strategic alternatives including a potential sale of the company since at least July and the REIT had been strategically selling off noncore assets since March 2019.

Affiliates of Blackstone own about 30% of CorePoint’s total outstanding shares and voted in favor of the sale. As it benefits from the sale of CorePoint Blackstone also has beefed up its ownership of hotels.

WoodSpring Suites Deal

Blackstone and Starwood Capital teamed up to buy 111 WoodSpring Suites hotels for $1.5 billion from Brookfield Property Partners. That purchase followed the joint venture partners’ acquisition of the Extended Stay America chain for $6 billion last summer.

With their pragmatic no-frills rooms attracting travelers from across the spectrum extended-stay hotels have enjoyed an advantage over other hospitality types in the recovery from the pandemic according to CoStar analysis.

Last year extended-stay chains ran at an average occupancy of 73% as other business-oriented hotels rebounded much slower. Given reaccelerating business demand and strong leisure travel expectations are that extended-stay hotels will outperform with further occupancy and rate acceleration and strong investor demand.

Blackstone and Starwood Capital lined up $1.2 billion of floating-rate debt from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup to finance its WoodSpring Suites’ purchase according to Commercial Mortgage Alert. That loan is expected to be rolled into a new CMBS issuance in the near term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bnNldGZ1bmVyYWxob21lcy5uZXQvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9yb2JlcnQtYmxhY2tzdG9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert L.

Would Snoop own any of the catalog? What about Dr. Dre and Tupac’s music? When Snoop later stated that he wanted Death Row to be an NFT label and the first in the metaverse it added another layer of questions and speculation. The Doggfather recently sat down with Tidal’s Elliot Wilson and clarified the specifics of the historic acquisition.

“Jimmy Iovine (Interscope Records co-founder and Dr Dre’s partner in Beats By Dre) told me that the people who own Death Row were at one of his parties and that he thought it would be a good idea for me to talk with them” Snoop said. “Jimmy knew that I wanted my masters. That’s what I was after. He put me in contact with Dave Kestenbaum (Senior Managing Director at the Blackstone Investment Firm) and we started talking about different things. He was like ‘I’m a fan of you Snoop. I’m with you. I ain’t tryin’ to hold this shit. I want to see you with it.'”

Snoop says that he saw Death Row depreciating while he was helping to rebuild Def Jam (Snoop Dogg was named executive creative consultant at Def Jam early in 2021) and he decided to fulfill his obligations to Def Jam (he has one year left) so that when he made his move to acquire Death Row he couldn’t be accused of not accomplishing what he was paid to accomplish. After Snoop signed a few artists namely Benny The Butcher and dropped a few projects he “Went to get some shit that I was supposed to have because it ain’t in the right hands. It needs to be in my hands.”

Snoop told Wilson further “To be in control of the brand means that I got all of the pieces that I need to do what I got to do from the masters to the publishing to the IP to the label to the logo to everything. It’s all mine. I’m able to move it around and do what I need to do with it. 2Pac’s masters came back to him [his estate] last year. I got a great relationship with his estate and I’m pretty sure we’re going to be able to work something out. Same with Dr. Dre and The Chronic. I got The Chronic album. I got Doggystyle Tha Doggfather Murder Was The Case Dogg Food Above The Rim. I got all those records.”

Snoop also spoke of the possibility of releasing Latin and EDM versions of some of the Death Row classics as well as making his debut ""Deep Cover"" and the ""Dre Day"" B side : ""Puffin' On Blunts And Sippin' On Tanqueray"" available for the first time digitally. When asked about the prospect of signing new artists Snoop says: ""Im not in there trying to develop: 'Hey man you should rap like this. You should do this. Im trying to find motherfuckers that got shit already locked and loaded and I can just throw the Death Row logo on it.'""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwcmkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ibGFja3N0b25lLXZhbGxleS80MHRoLWFubnVhbC1wYXd0dWNrZXQtc3QtcGF0cmlja3MtZGF5LXBhcmFkZS1oZWxkLXNhdHVyZGF5L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwcmkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ibGFja3N0b25lLXZhbGxleS80MHRoLWFubnVhbC1wYXd0dWNrZXQtc3QtcGF0cmlja3MtZGF5LXBhcmFkZS1oZWxkLXNhdHVyZGF5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,40th Annual Pawtucket St. Patrick’s Day Parade held Saturday,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/blackstone-valley/40th-annual-pawtucket-st-patricks-day-parade-held-saturday/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwcmkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ibGFja3N0b25lLXZhbGxleS80MHRoLWFubnVhbC1wYXd0dWNrZXQtc3QtcGF0cmlja3MtZGF5LXBhcmFkZS1oZWxkLXNhdHVyZGF5L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwcmkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ibGFja3N0b25lLXZhbGxleS80MHRoLWFubnVhbC1wYXd0dWNrZXQtc3QtcGF0cmlja3MtZGF5LXBhcmFkZS1oZWxkLXNhdHVyZGF5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Fourteen people are killed in the mishap including the three members of the flight crew and 16 are rescued all suffering injuries of varying degree. An investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board will determine the probable cause of the mishap was an accumulation of ice on the surfaces of the wings.

A Durable Machine

The Douglas DC-3 Commercial Transport developed in the mid-1930s was an all metal low-wing twin-engine aircraft. It was not only highly reliable but comfortable and by 1939 approximately 90 percent of commercial air travelers were flying on this model aircraft. The Douglas Aircraft Company produced 455 DC-3s for the airline industry and 10174 transports designated the C-47 Skytrain for the military during World War II (1941-1945). It was durable adaptable and easy to maintain and fly. The aircraft was 64 feet 8 inches in length with a wingspan of 95 feet and powered by two 1200 horsepower Wright R-1820 Cyclone radial engines. At a cruising speed of 192 mph the Douglas DC-3 had a range of 1495 miles. It carried two pilots one flight attendant and had accommodations for up to 28 passengers depending on the cabin configuration. After more than six decades hundreds of DC-3s remain in service carrying passengers or cargo. It is considered one of the greatest aircraft of all time.

Seattle Air Charter was solely owned and operated by William F. Leleand (1917-1949) of Seattle. The company held a non-scheduled air carrier operation certificate issued June 4 1947 and was authorized to carry both passengers and cargo.

Yale Students Onboard

On Sunday afternoon January 2 1949 Seattle Air Charter Douglas DC-3C registration No. NC79025 was sitting on the apron at Seattle-Boeing Field International Airport (now King County International Airport) passenger terminal awaiting a crew to transport 27 Yale University students to New Haven Connecticut. The students had chartered the plane to fly them back to Yale after a two-week Christmas vacation.

During the day the DC-3 had been parked on the field without wing covers. At approximately 4 p.m. it began to snow and up to three inches accumulated on the tarmac and surfaces of the aircraft. The temperature gradually dropped to well below freezing leaving the ship covered with a layer of slush and ice. The 6 p.m. departure time was delayed so that the heavy accumulation could be removed. At 7:30 p.m. the copilot Emmett G. Flood Jr. (1917-1962) inspected the plane and refused to make the flight because of the severe icing. He left the field and returned home to Mercer Island. The pilot George W. Chavers (1915-1949) engaged Kenneth A. Love (1910-1949) to substitute as copilot. William F. Leland owner of Seattle Air Charter would be onboard the flight as a reserve pilot. All the pilots were experienced having served with the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II.

The weather continued to deteriorate with snow and low-lying fog periodically reducing visibility to less than half a mile well below minimum standard for takeoff. The freezing slush was removed from the aircraft as it sat on the ramp but a clear layer of ice soon reformed. Another attempt was made by Chavers Leland and an aircraft mechanic to remove the ice with a solution of isopropyl alcohol. They were able to rid the top surfaces of the wings and tail of ice but neglected to remove a layer which had formed on the underside of the wings. And as the DC-3 sat patches of rime and ice reformed on the top surface of the left wing.

Calamity on the Ground

At 9 p.m. the U.S. Weather Bureau advised Chavers that field conditions would remain variable with periods of near zero visibility mainly due to fog. Chavers decided to board the passengers and taxied the DC-3 to the north end of Runway 13 to wait for the fog to lift. At 10:04 p.m. the fog lifted briefly and the tower cleared the flight for takeoff. The aircraft rolled down the 7500-foot runway and after 1000 feet the ship became airborne. The DC-3 began to veer to the left and flew for 1800 feet before the left wing suddenly dipped and the wing tip scraped the ground. The pilot immediately aborted takeoff and the DC-3's tail wheel touched down followed by the main landing-gear wheels. The aircraft continued onward at approximately 100 mph for 700 feet crashed into an earth revetment by a Boeing Field hangar and immediately burst into flames.

The air-traffic controller in the tower saw the DC-3's navigation lights veer off the runway and knew that a crash was likely imminent. He immediately notified the Boeing Field Fire Department located only 200 feet from the revetment hangar. The watch captain heard the impact and responded immediately with a crash wagon and two fire trucks arriving at the scene within one minute. The three firefighters on duty were assisted by two Boeing mechanics and three United Airlines ramp employees who were responsible for rescuing many of the students from the burning plane.

Ambulances transported the injured victims suffering from burns lacerations and smoke inhalation to Harborview Hospital in Seattle for medical treatment. More firefighters and equipment quickly arrived from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and nearby communities and helped to quell the raging gasoline fire and drag the twisted wreckage away from the hangar.

A full night crew had been working inside the Boeing hangar and all escaped without injury. The hangar door had been wide open and fortunately the runaway plane hit the adjoining revetment and not the building. The hangar housed a new Boeing Stratocruiser loaded with 2000 gallons of aviation fuel which was promptly towed out of harm's way.

Aftermath

Early Monday morning January 3 1949 King County Coroner John P. Brill Jr. (1909-1971) and his deputies removed all the bodies from the charred fuselage. They were taken to the King County Morgue located in the basement of Harborview Hospital for identification and disposition. Thirty people had been aboard the DC-3 including the three pilots and all were accounted for. Sixteen had survived the crash and ensuing fire and 14 had perished most burned beyond recognition.

On Wednesday January 5 a memorial service was held in Battell Chapel on the Yale University campus for the 11 students killed in the airplane mishap. The service was officiated by the Yale chaplain Reverend Sidney Lovett and attended by numerous school officials and professors and hundreds of the victims' classmates.

On Tuesday January 18 the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) opened an official investigation into the Seattle Air Charter crash at Boeing Field. The two-day hearing was held at the U.S. Courthouse in Seattle during which a panel of four CAB officials elicited testimony from numerous witnesses into the circumstances surrounding the tragic accident. A point of controversy was a question of tower clearance during a period of below takeoff visibility minimums at Boeing Field. The board said that air-traffic controllers were not responsible for informing pilots of prospective Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) rule violations. The CAB enacted safety regulations and conducted accident investigations while the CAA has responsibility for enforcing the rules. The board went on to say that an examination of the wreckage determined there had been no engine or structural failures. At the time of takeoff the aircraft had been in excess of its permissible weight. The accumulation of ice on the wings not only added additional weight but also critically altered the plane's aerodynamics.

The official CAB Accident Investigation Report dated May 4 1949 concluded: ""The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the attempt to take off in an airplane which had formations of ice and frost on the surfaces of the wings"" (""Civil Aeronautics Board Accident Investigation Report: Seattle Air Charter Douglas C-47A-50-DL (DC-3) NC79025 Seattle Washington January 2 1949"" Civil Aeronautics Board File No. 1-0002).

The all-composite design contrasts to the welded tanks commonly used throughout the industry for rockets’ stages — although Rocket Lab’s Electron is an outstanding example of composites albeit on a much smaller scale.

For Boeing’s new tank the all-composite structure is 4.3 meters in diameter and “similar in size to the propellant tanks intended for use in the upper stage of NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket.”

And that is the part of the advancement that pushes composite technology forward: large lightweight tanks that can help increase a rocket’s overall performance by reducing vehicle mass — which translates into a greater payload-to-destination mass capability for the overall system.

For the Boeing all-composite tank testing and modeling so far indicate the potential to increase the SLS Block 1B’s performance by up to 30% if the Exploration Upper Stage’s design with welded tanks were switched to the new all-composite structure.

“That’s a near-term system that could benefit pretty greatly from this sort of technology … should NASA see this as a beneficial upgrade in performance for that part of the mission” said Jim May Technology Integration Specialist Space and Launch Division Boeing in an interview with NASASpaceflight.

“And as a lot of us in the space industry know mass is very important to space systems. And so as we’ve kind of matured this composite technology where composites are a good place to reduce the structural mass on things like tanks we saw an ability or a way to reduce pretty significantly the mass in propulsion systems in the tank area — paired with a material that can support and hold in cryogenic fuels.”

But getting to the point of being able to test this technology bring it to TRL 6 and be ready to offer this new all-composite structure for future rockets and deep space missions took time and effort.

“So this kind of validated the scale the ability to build this at scale and meet the same requirements [as metallic tanks]. And the hard part of this technology is doing it at large scale” related May.

In particular having a facility large enough to build the tank was a challenge. According to Boeing “You need a fiber placement facility that can handle a structure of this size to layup in one piece within the material out-time and an autoclave that it will fit in. Not many organizations have composite fabrication facilities that can handle a part of this size.”

After finding the location the tank underwent final assembly between 2020 and 2021 having originally been intended for DARPA’s Experimental Spaceplane Program.

“DARPA’s interest is in advancing the technology of these propulsion systems” noted May. “And we’re building the tank in one large composite piece without an incremental metallic liner. But building it to the same requirements you would build metallic tanks to avoid losing your propellant to permissibility.”

Following its construction the tank was taken to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville AL where it underwent a series of pressure tests and inspections.

“We did a number of pressure cycles and stopped partway through to thoroughly inspect the tank for any damage” Boeing explained. “That requires draining the tank moving it out of the test facility and removing parts for interior inspection. Then putting it all back together moving back into the test area and connecting and testing all the instrumentation again. This was not just one simple test sequence.”

In a final test designed to over-pressurize the tank and burst it – known as a test to failure to validate computer modeling – the tank reached a maximum pressure of 3.75 times its design requirement and still did not burst — with Boeing noting that no major structural failures were identified.

In addition to pressure tests leak and permeation tests were also conducted to verify tank performance and that the tank was not leaking cryogenics.

On top of the size challenge of the composite tank “the cryogenic part is one of the harder parts of getting composites to work” related Mr. May.

Per Boeing “We ran the tank test with liquid nitrogen but we have done coupon and element tests at both liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen temperatures. At cold temperatures some of the properties are slightly lower but coupon and element tests provide the appropriate data that allows us to design a robust composite tank that can meet requirements even at these extremely low temperatures.”

Liquid nitrogen boils at -196°C (-320°F). For comparison liquid oxygen has a maximum stable temperature before evaporation of -183°C (-297°F) while liquid hydrogen has a maximum temperature of -253°C (-423°F).

As Mr. May said “What our goal was and what we have shown in our test here is that we’ve raised the Technology Readiness Level of this technology to about a TRL 6. So what we see is this basically being ready for implementation into a production vehicle design.”

“And that’s the big step forward in this technology in that we think it’s ready for primetime for real space applications now. And that’s what’s been missing historically in these larger composite tanks is that while there’s been some testing no one’s really taken it to a point to be ready to push it on to production.”

So where does this fit in terms of future applications?

According to Mr. May SLS’s pending Exploration Upper Stage — while an obvious candidate — is not the only space application. Boeing sees any deep space mission or rocket that uses cryogenics as potentially benefiting from the technology.

In addition space is not the only realm where Boeing sees applications for this new tank technology. Aircraft represent another potential market.

“Boeing is also looking at ways to have more sustainable aviation technologies. And one way we’re looking at are huge hydrogen-powered aircraft” said Mr. May. “So this technology that works well for cryogenic storage in space also applies to hydrogen storage in atmospheric conditions as well.”

“And so these tank designs are kind of the first generation of things we’re gonna be looking at that can fit inside of an aircraft and burn hydrogen which essentially just makes water vapor as its byproduct.”

But will companies and agencies be interested?

“I think with any new technology there can be some reluctance to go after the risk of something new” admitted May. “The upside here is that we have some evidence of running these tests that these systems perform at least as reliably as historical metallic tanks with the performance gains we get mass-wise from having a composite system.”

“And so we’re ready to propose these into future programs and also be able to show that they’re going to meet the same safety reliability and performance statistics of historical different material systems.”

It has been on the ropes many times before with near-death knockout blows but that is when the company has responded best and fought back to emerge stronger than ever.

Flashback to 1955 when United Airlines placed its order for 30 DC-8s which gave Douglas a 55 to 20 lead over the 707. It was facing a wipe-out but widened the cabin to match and exceed the DC-8’s and American Airlines came on board. The rest is history.

Just 15 years later in 1970 it was facing another disaster with McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed’s trijets sweeping the market the SST canceled and it’s 747 and 737 stumbling with only a trickle of orders.

Fifty thousand workers were laid off which prompted this sign below to be erected.

Yet only a few years later in 1978 Boeing bounced back to launch the very successful 757 and 767 below. With the 767 it was able to win back key US giants such as American United TWA and Delta Air Lines.

Move on another 10 years and McDonnell Douglas and Airbus cleaned up the market with their 300-seat MD-11 and A340 designs leaving almost no room for a third competitor.

But again it wiped the floor by going clean sheet and efficient with a giant twin the 777.

In fact the 777 forced McDonnel Douglas to merge with Boeing. As one MDC chief engineer told management in a memo that even an improved version of the MD-11 the MD-11X with a new wing was “tragically uncompetitive against the 777-200ER” let alone later variants like the 777-300ER.

READ: Qatar Airways Qsuite the ultimate in privacy

Scorecard? 777 all variants 2069 MD-11 200 and Airbus A340 all variants 377.

Next Boeing was chastised for not matching the Airbus A380 which was going to replace the 747 with doom forecast by many scribes and analysts. The last A380 has been delivered and Boeing will deliver its final 747 in 2022.

In fact while Airbus built 251 A380s it would sell another 270 747s mostly a new variant the 747-8.

It held its nerve and came up with innovation and technology in the form of the 787 which upended the market.

Certainly under pressure from former McDonnell senior management– who are no longer with Boeing – the production process was fouled up and thus costs blew out but the design is sound – very sound.

Now it has to be bold and call on its founders for inspiration.

Bill Boeing’s great words say it all: “Our job is to keep everlastingly at research and experiment to adapt our laboratories to production as soon as practicable to let no new improvement in flying and flying equipment pass us by.”

Mr. Boeing’s good friend and competitor Donald Douglas whose company would eventually merge with Boeing said: “Dream no small dream it lacks magic – dream large and make the dream real.”

That dream now is the twin-aisle 797 – it has magic it has space it has real sizzle and passengers will flock to it in droves particularly when they will be demanding space as never before in the post COVID world.

No aircraft will be able to compete with it – none!

It will fly 8 to 10 hours non-stop with a full load and for that length of flight a single-aisle in a typical economy configuration is a nightmare.

The configuration would be 2-2-2 or 2-3-2 for low-cost/charter operators similar to the mockup below shown in 1991 at the Paris Air Show.

A single-aisle challenge to the Airbus A321 and A321XLR is an utter waste of money unless you could cut fuel consumption per passenger by 40 plus percent – which you cannot.

Airline chiefs such as Qantas’s Alan Joyce said Boeing would be “mad not to build it.”

On Saturday (March 5) Mastercard and Visa — the two largest credit card and digital payment processors — both suspended operations in Russia forcing Russian banks to consider alternate systems. Tinkoff Alfa Bank and Sberbank the biggest lender in Russia are all looking to switch to the UnionPay system.

PYMNTS wrote recently about Mastercard and Visa’s decisions to get out of Russia with both of the processors releasing statements Saturday that they would suspend operations within Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

The statements were issued very close to one another and both companies announced their plans to amp up their original plans to stop operating in Russia.

“With this action cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by the Mastercard network. And any Mastercard issued outside of the country will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs” the Mastercard statement said.

Visa said it had been “compelled to act” and was working with clients and partners in Russia to cease all transactions there.

Visa CEO Al Kelly said that while the company doesn’t like that it has to impact employees clients partners merchants and cardholders in the country there was no other choice — because of the country’s threats to “peace and stability” the company had to “respond in line with our values.”

Visa’s statement said “all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country and any Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia will no longer work within the Russian Federation.”

Both companies’ actions follow a growing wave of global outrage and financial sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden in his State of the Union address announced plans to “cripple the Russian economy” after the central banks moved to freeze hundreds of billions in foreign reserves globally.

Russia has also largely been blocked from moving money internationally through SWIFT.

Janjigian MD Discusses Immunotherapy for Gastric Cancer,"At the 2022 International Gastric Cancer Conference Yelena Y. Janjigian MD chief of Gastrointestinal Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center spoke with CancerNetwork® about using immunotherapy as first-line therapy to treat gastric cancer. She also discussed specific trials that when read out have the potential to impact the standard of care.

Transcript:

In terms of immunotherapy for gastric cancer it really has transformed the field in the last 2 years. Several important studies resulted in [positive results in the] first-line metastatic setting both in HER2-negative disease with the CheckMate 649 study [NCT02872116] and HER2-positive disease was KEYNOTE-811 study [NCT03615326].12 We know that in stage IV disease this treatment works. We also know that gastric cancer in general at the time of resection is at extremely high-risk for cancer recurrence in the systemic fashion meaning outside of the initial resection location.

The truth is in gastric cancer and in the management of localized disease many studies are ongoing but [the results have not been read out]. The only time we use immunotherapy in localized disease is in resected esophageal or gastroesophageal junction [GEJ] adenocarcinoma [which a sizeable] percentage of patients would fall into [this category] because in the [United States] and the Western population true gastric cancers are relatively less common than GEJ proximal tumors. With those tumors patients technically qualify for adjuvant nivolumab.3 Of course there’s a caveat that the approval stands for patients who received prior chemo-radiation and then had surgery. We don’t tend to use radiation therapy in the United States for localized gastric cancer and even some GEJ tumors likely do not need radiation therapy. That’s the caveat. There are many studies that are ongoing or finished and soon to be read out in localized gastric cancer with preoperative use of the combination of chemotherapy such as FLOT [flouracil leucovorin oxaliplatin and docetaxel] or capecitabine/cisplatin in combination with immunotherapy. That’s the MATTERHORN study [NCT04592913] and the KEYNOTE-585 [NCT03221426] study; those will be reading out.

Acetaminophen/ paracetamol is widely being adopted by individuals and healthcare providers and are sold over the counter which is boosting sales in the market. Paracetamol is widely consumed as it is suitable to all age groups i.e. adults children’s pediatrics and geriatrics to treat mild to moderate pain. Paracetamol is the most efficient and safe drug to manage pain when consumed in a controlled dosage.

The most prescribed OTC (over the counter) drug is acetaminophen which is widely used as the first line of treatment. As chronic disorders have symptoms of pain demand is projected to increase over the forecast period.

According to the CDC in 2019 20.4% of adults had chronic pain and 7.4% of adults had chronic pain that frequently limited life or work activities. Similarly in the U.K. around 26% of patients with diabetes were found to have peripheral neuropathic pain. Paracetamol can be combined with other pain management drugs that are sold through prescription only which is expected to continue boosting sales.

Further increasing awareness regarding palliative care in terminally ill patients is boosting the adoption of analgesics for pain management. Since the prevalence of pain is over 75% in advanced disease conditions sales are expected to gain traction in the forthcoming years.

In the U.S. palliative care services are delivered following government and commercial reimbursement policies. Hospital palliative care programs in the U.S. include palliative care consultation teams and dedicated in-patient care units. Non-hospital palliative care programs include ambulatory care and office and home-based palliative care programs.

For patients assigned to the avelumab (Bavencio) plus axitinib (Inlyta) arm 17.1% of those with high troponin T values had a major cardiovascular adverse event (MACE) versus 5.2% of those with lower values (relative risk 3.31 95% CI 1.19-9.22) reported Brian I. Rini MD of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and colleagues.

But this difference was not seen in the sunitinib (Sutent) arm at 5.1% versus 5.7% for those with high and low troponin T levels respectively (RR 0.89 95% CI 0.20-3.98) according to findings appearing in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

""We suggest that baseline assessment of troponin T levels may be considered when starting treatment with an ICI [immune checkpoint inhibitor] plus a VEGFR inhibitor particularly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors"" Rini and his colleagues wrote. ""Patients with high troponin T levels should be monitored closely for cardiac symptoms during treatment potentially including ECG monitoring and a cardiologist should be involved in patient management from the outset of treatment.""

However the authors added cardiac history ""should not exclude patients from receiving ICI plus VEGFR combination therapy.""

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline in the trial was significantly more frequent in the combination arm (8.5% vs 1.6%) but most patients recovered and the decline was not associated with other significant cardiac events or symptoms Rini's group reported. Thus ""routine monitoring of LVEF in asymptomatic patients is not recommended.""

JAVELIN Renal 101 randomized 866 RCC patients with previously untreated advanced disease 1:1 to either the PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor avelumab plus VEGFR inhibitor axitinib or to sunitinib a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Results of the phase III study led to the FDA approval of avelumab-axitinib in this setting.

The rationale for the current study the authors noted is that checkpoint inhibitors and VEGFR inhibitors have been associated with cardiovascular adverse events ""creating a theoretical potential for an increased incidence of MACE with combination treatment."" This study they said is the first to prospectively assess LVEF decline and serum cardiac biomarkers in patients treated with a checkpoint inhibitor plus VEGFR inhibitor.

Approximately 60% of patients in each arm of the study had a history of hypertension. At data cutoff median exposure to avelumab axitinib and sunitinib was 37.2 39.2 and 31.7 weeks respectively.

Overall MACE (defined as grade ≥3 cardiovascular adverse events) occurred in 31 patients (7.1%) in the combination arm and 17 patients (3.9%) in the sunitinib arm a non-significant difference that was reduced in exposure-adjusted analyses Rini and his colleagues observed.

Other cardiovascular baseline risk factors and serum cardiac biomarkers were not significantly predictive for MACE the authors noted although there was trend toward an association with dyslipidemia in the combination arm.

""Because of the small number of patients with MACE in our study the predictive value of serum biomarkers other than troponin T cannot be ruled out"" wrote Rini and his colleagues. ""Larger studies are needed to confirm the findings in this study.""

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDMvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc3RlcmxpY2h0LWJyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktZG9ub3IuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Donor Barry Sternlicht Assails Brown’s Deal With Protesters,"One of Brown University’s major donors the billionaire real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht on Friday sharply criticized the school’s agreement to hold a board vote on cutting investments tied to Israel calling it “unconscionable” and saying he had “paused” donations to the school.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9qYW5lbGxlLWJyb3duLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtYmlydGhkYXktdHdvLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1zb24tZ2Fycmlzb24tZGVhdGgtODY0NDI3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janelle Brown Celebrates 55th Birthday Two Months After Son Garrison's Death,"Janelle Brown is marking a milestone two months after the death of her son Garrison Brown.

The Patriots met with Maye on multiple occasions including a trip to North Carolina for the Tar Heels Pro Day. During that trip Mayo and company spoke with longtime and well-respected coach Mack Brown. Mayo specifically said he received a “glowing recommendation” from the Tar Heels head coach and noted how that conversation eased any nerves about drafting Maye.

Brown a 46-year coaching veteran met with a handful of New England reporters on a video conference Monday and relayed what he told Mayo and company during the pre-draft process.

“I’ve learned that I want the high school coach to tell me the truth in recruiting so I’m very honest with the NFL coaches” Brown said. “This is important to them.

“So with Coach Mayo I knew this is huge for him just starting out in this first year. So I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye. We all put our checks in the mouth of players and that’s what you’re (Mayo) gonna do. And I would rather have Drake Maye than anybody in the country leading my football team.’

I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye.’ Mack Brown on conversations with Jerod Mayo

Brown’s recommendation to Mayo was echoed throughout the pre-draft process and again Monday. Brown praised Maye for his toughness competitiveness and ability to lead a rocker room with his mix of positive reinforcement and constructive criticism.

Brown even spoke to the Maye athletic and authentic family along with the quarterback’s longtime girlfriend. Maye introduced his three brothers and girlfriend to reporters during his introductory press conference at Gillette Stadium.

“He’s an unbelievable person” Brown said. “He’s one of the nicest toughest most competitive young people I’ve ever been around. I’ve said often I would adopt him. He’s that perfect of a kid. It sounds kind of corny but it’s true.”

Brown also relayed a story as to how Maye included other position groups whenever he was approached with an NIL deal. It was one of the many ways Maye proved his worth as a teammate.

“So if they came and said ‘We want you to do this advertisement.’ He said ‘Well the offensive linemen need to be with me and they need to be paid.’ Or ‘Well we want you to get fed through the seafood company for the year.’ And he said ‘That’s great the receivers and their families need to get fed too.'”

But Brown made it clear to New England’s organization the competitor they were getting too.

“He is not coming to Boston to lose” Brown said.

It seems that message was heard loud and clear throughout the Patriots organization."

He is a serial entrepreneur investor non-profit founder and author of In The Black 2050: a model for Black economic leadership in the 21st century. Born and raised in Louisville KY Tre is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and Harvard Business School. His corporate experience includes various roles at Brown-Forman and renewable energy commercialization at GE Energy. As an entrepreneur he has founded/operated several companies in consulting e-commerce cpg entertainment biofuels and blockchain. As an angel investor Tre has built a portfolio of over 80 startups and counting.

01. What are you looking for in startups for the Build in Tulsa Techstars Accelerator?

In terms of industry focus we are essentially agnostic. I have some industries that personally interest me more than others but my intention is to not let that be a barrier to prevent anyone from applying. Instead the Tulsa program will focus on pre-seed and even idea stage companies using an approach more similar to a venture studio than a traditional accelerator. Essentially

Outside of government policy I believe innovation has the best chance of creating and accelerating positive change whether it be around reducing inequality addressing climate change increasing standards of living affordable housing food/water security etc. So I look at potential impact in addition to potential economic value. Beyond that I still hold on to the model I learned way back in business school…P.O.C.D.:

People: Are the people involved capable experienced and trustworthy? This is the most important. I want founders who are highly adaptable have a high work ethic eagerness to learn and can quickly synthesize new information coaching/advice and customer feedback to improve the product and customer experience. I like to see evidence of the ability to execute and recruit people to a mission even if a founder is a first-time entrepreneur.

Opportunity: Is the opportunity attractive from a product-market fit total addressable market and defensibility perspective?

Context: Factors that affect the outcome of the opportunity but are generally outside management’s direct control. This category includes interest rates regulations macroeconomic activity technology and some industry variables like competition or relative business bargaining power.

Deal: The implicit and explicit contractual relationships between the company and all resource providers. Does the deal (funding round) make sense for all parties involved?

Finally and most importantly we look for companies that will get a lot of value from Techstars in addition to being a good investment.

02. What are some of the biggest learnings from your career and entrepreneurial journey that you bring to being a Techstars MD?

Whenever possible don’t assume. Test gather data adjust and repeat. Failure doesn’t have to be final if you learn from it and keep moving. In the age of hyper-novelty those who adapt quickly and effectively win.

Talent and genius can only take you so far. Relationships and support systems matter. It’s not always the “best and brightest” who go the farthest.

Finding solutions to problems is relatively easy if the problem is physically possible to solve it’s simply a matter of time energy and resources. But identifying the right problem to solve in the first place is where true entrepreneurs shine. And solutions might not always be that obvious and may come from unexpected places which is why it is important to be able to gather and synthesize as much information as possible to connect the dots. That’s my superpower.

03. What is your favorite thing about the Tulsa startup scene?

First how open welcoming and collaborative it is. People are genuinely interested in being helpful and the community is small enough that you can get to pretty much anyone you need with an introduction or two. Second there are a lot of resources in Tulsa focused on a relatively small tight-knit community creating an overall ethos of abundance and sharing rather than scarcity and competition. This high level of community connectivity and concentrated resources means that things tend to move pretty fast in Tulsa. There’s something special happening in Tulsa but you have to experience it to really understand.

04. What does our partner Build in Tulsa bring to the accelerator?

As mentioned above the startup ecosystem in Tulsa is very tight-knit. Build In Tulsa has the local relationships that put them one call/email/text away from most of the people and resources our founders will need including some that they might not even know they need until they magically appear like presents from Santa! For such a relatively new organization they have already proven their effectiveness and ability to make a big impact in a short period of time. For founders that are willing to stay in Tulsa after the program or at least locate some resources here (e.g. 2nd HQ customer success team IT team etc.) the possibilities are endless.

05. If you could have coffee with any entrepreneur who would it be and why?

I’m a big science and engineering nerd so Lonnie Johnson is probably at the top of the list. He is an inventor engineer and entrepreneur most famous for inventing the Super Soaker and Nerf gun which both contributed a lot of fond memories to my childhood as an 80’s baby but he has done a lot more than that including a stint at NASA and some very interesting work in sustainable energy. Funny enough I’m actually two degrees of separation from him and I used to live like 10 minutes away from him so I probably need to make that meeting happen soon.

If you are interested in applying to the Build in Tulsa Techstars Accelerator submit your application by May 11.

BY MARIE PULEO | POMPANO BEACH REAL ESTATE AND DEVELOPMENT REPORTER

The Isle Casino Pompano Park is getting a major makeover and a new name. Last month Caesars Entertainment owner and operator of Isle Casino Pompano Park held a groundbreaking ceremony for several projects to expand and renovate the casino which is being rebranded as Harrah’s Pompano Beach.

The enhancements to the casino are the first phase in a multi-phase development of the 223-acre Isle Casino property located on the southeast corner of Powerline Road and SW Third Street (Racetrack Road).

The Cordish Companies in partnership with Caesars Entertainment is redeveloping the area surrounding the casino facility into Live! Resorts Pompano – a large-scale mixed-use project that includes entertainment retail dining hotel residential office and logistics elements. The joint venture was announced by Caesars Entertainment (formerly Eldorado Resorts) in 2018.

The Cordish Companies has already constructed 12 Live! facilities in cities throughout the United States including Atlanta Baltimore St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Caesars Entertainment operates over 55 gaming and entertainment destinations including Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

“Outside of the Las Vegas strip this is the largest development that this company will do for quite some time” said Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg at the Pompano groundbreaking.

As part of the rebranding to Harrah’s Pompano Beach the casino’s interior will undergo extensive renovations including new lights and flooring throughout new restaurant space remodeling of public restrooms and a rebrand of the existing poker room as South Florida’s official World Series of Poker (WSOP) Poker Room.

A four-level 580000-square-foot parking garage is currently being constructed off the northern access road at 777 Isle of Capri Drive on the east side of the existing casino building.

[sc name=”new-ads-1″][/sc]

A new section is being added to connect the parking garage to the existing casino which will ease access to the casino and provide an expanded gaming area. The garage which is designed to look more like a building than a parking structure will add more than 1500 parking spaces.

A significant portion of the Isle Casino property is currently surface parking areas. The new parking garage will serve the casino and is not technically part of the Live! Resorts Pompano development but it is being built to free up some of the surface parking areas so they can be developed by The Cordish Companies.

The next phase of construction which will be starting soon includes a new smoking terrace addition to the casino and a new 14-seat bar. Currently the casino has a small smoking patio accessible only through the Laurel Lounge which is reserved for certain loyalty club members. The new smoking terrace will add 12500 square feet of outdoor gaming that will be open to the general public without having to go through the Laurel Lounge.

The parking garage the casino’s interior renovations and the gaming terrace are expected to be completed at approximately the same time. Once that happens the Harrah’s Pompano Beach name will officially take effect which is expected to be in about six months according to Jennifer Swope director of marketing for Isle Casino Pompano Park.

“Harrah’s Pompano Beach is just one piece of a collaborative effort with The Cordish Companies to reimagine this area of Pompano Beach” said Reeg.

“It is incredibly exciting for The Cordish Companies to join our partners Caesars Entertainment and the City of Pompano Beach to celebrate this milestone” said David Cordish CEO and Chairman of The Cordish Companies.

Cordish said it was an important step in advancing “this game-changing project that will provide thousands of new jobs and create a unique destination for residents and visitors to the region.”

Isle Casino Pompano Park currently features 1500 slots 40 poker tables electronic table games two restaurants and racing amenities including a high-tech sports bar and an area where patrons can wager on simulcast races.

Isle Casino Pompano Park is home to Florida’s last remaining harness racing track which dates to the mid-1960s. The harness racing track and grandstand will eventually be replaced by components of the Live! Resorts Pompano project.

Currently the City of Pompano Beach is reviewing site plans for several components of Live! Resorts Pompano – an e-commerce distribution center an entertainment complex a retail development that includes a Publix and a Topgolf facility.

""I know exactly what she's gone through"" Osmond said. ""And first of all the pressure is enormous. That's why I love the theater … the smaller theater and I can get very intimate with this show.""

Osmond's is performing Tuesday through Saturday until November 2022 at Harrah's Showroom.

DONNY OSMOND SAYS ‘REINVENTION’ IS KEY TO LONGTIME SUCCESS IN HOLLYWOOD

""I'm not a stranger to pressure"" Osmond added. ""I've been doing this all my life. So every night when I get up there it's not really pressure to meet anymore. Yes I wanna do a great job.""

Adele announced the cancellation of her residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in a teary video she shared to social media Jan. 21. At the time she revealed ""half"" of her team had come down with COVID-19 and that it would be ""impossible to finish the show.""

""Hi. Listen I'm so sorry but my show ain't ready"" the singer said in a video statement as she became choked up. ""We've tried absolutely everything that we can to put it together in time and for it to be good enough for you but we've been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and COVID .

""I can't give you what I have right now"" she said. ""And I'm gutted I'm gutted. I'm sorry it's so last minute. We've been awake for over 30 hours now trying to figure it out.""

Osmond went on to say he believes Adele's last-minute decision to pull the plug on her residency was most likely ""one of the biggest decisions of her life.""

""I don't really know exactly what went down but for her to be able to pull the plug at the last minute it must have been pretty serious"" Osmond said. ""Especially with people getting COVID and all that kind of stuff. It must have been one of the biggest decisions of her life to pull the plug like that.

""I can feel for her. I mean we really take so many precautions to make sure that everybody is safe but when you get that many people backstage working on an enormous show what a decision that had to be made that must have been very tough.""

What does it take for a product to survive and thrive generation after generation? For some companies it is adhering to the ideas of a visionary founder; for others it’s adapting to the market. Some products that we’ve known forever have become part of conglomerates and while they maintain their brand identity to a greater or lesser degree have become just one of many products under a giant umbrella – but at least they’ve managed to last.

To determine the oldest products on the market in America 24/7 Tempo derived information from History and other historical websites company websites state and city history sources and various media outlets. Some material was updated from previous 24/7 lists.

Boldface names like Heinz Kraft and Campbell’s made the list. So did uniquely American soft drinks including Coca-Cola Pepsi and Hires Root Beer – as well as one historic beer brand. (These are America’s 30 oldest beers.)

There are also some candy companies whose output has defied Father Time – and a number of firms making candy and other products still owned or run by their founding families. (These are the largest Fortune 500 companies still run by their founders.)

Some of the items that have stood the test of time are household cleaning products such as 20 Mule Team Borax Libman corn brooms and Murphy’s Soap. And in the kitchen you might use cutlery and cookware made by American companies that are more than 100 years old.

Brands like Brooks Brothers which has made ready-to-wear suits since the California Gold Rush of 1849 and luxury goods provider Tiffany remain the gold standards in their respective industries by not compromising on quality even as tastes and their competitors have changed.

Photo / Whanganui Regional Museum Collection ref: CVC.071

As we celebrate International Women's Day on March 8 now is a good time to reflect on the pioneering women who emigrated to New Zealand and settled in Whanganui.

One such woman was Jessie Campbell the great-grandmother of celebrated composer Douglas Lilburn. While recorded history tends to focus on the achievements of men during the early settlement of frontier society Jessie Campbell is a good example of how women made significant contributions to family decision-making resourcefulness and economic stability. The Whanganui Regional Museum holds copies of Campbell's letters and a detailed journal the originals of which are held in the Alexander Turnbull Library.

Born Jessie Cameron in 1807 in Inverness Scotland to John and Louisa Cameron Jessie married Moses Campbell when she was 20. From Perthshire Moses was a captain in the 72nd Highlanders.

In August 1840 the Campbells arrived in Wellington on the Blenheim a New Zealand Company-chartered emigrant ship with their five young children in tow. Jessie kept a detailed journal of her time on the Blenheim and her letters back home to friends and family in Scotland give an insight into early settler life in New Zealand from Jessie's perspective.

She recorded that shipboard life came with a bland diet so the Campbells brought additional food with them - sheep ducks and hens - which were killed on board. In her journal Jessie remarks that one evening for dinner they ate the best pea soup she had ever tasted.

The Blenheim arrived in Wellington on December 27 1840 but the family discovered the land allocated to them was in fact in Whanganui.

Delays in surveying it meant however that it would be some time before they could take possession so they stayed in Petone. In November 1841 the Campbells finally set sail for Whanganui from Wellington on board the Clydeside. The voyage was treacherous and while crossing the bar of the Whanganui River the pilot ran the ship onto the North Spit among breakers before dislodging.

The Campbells took over two adjacent 100-acre sections bordering Lake Wiritoa. Jessie described their new home as ""the best house in Wanganui"". She was one of many women who were required to adapt to their new lives. But this adjustment proved liberating for women in some ways.

Jessie had a strong role in the family's decision-making and strongly influenced the family's future. A shrewd observer she recognised the business acumen carpentry skills and knowledge of cattle possessed by her cousin John Cameron and insisted her husband go into partnership with him.

Work was scarce so Campbell and Cameron concentrated on raising cattle while Jessie resourcefully supplemented the family's income by contributing £1 a week from her flourishing dairy. Cash was scarce in Whanganui so bartering at which Jessie showed great skill was common between settlers. She bartered her dairy produce to pay the family's expenses including goods from the shoemaker and tailor.

She even made her own cheese.

""I have so much milk that I have actually made some small cheese the rennet made from pigs' stomach which does very well. We have pumpkins not yet at their full growth which already measure 4ft. in circumference"" she wrote.

Jessie Campbell died on October 18 1885 aged 77. Her obituary in the Wanganui Chronicle ran on October 20 1885 noting:

On Sunday afternoon Mrs Campbell (widow of the late Captain Campbell) one of Wanganui's oldest and most respected residents passed peacefully away to her rest. The deceased lady who was in her 78th year succumbed to an attack of bronchitis which an enfeebled system was too weak to resist. Though she had been ailing for about a fortnight she was only confined to her room for four or five days and retained perfect possession of her mental faculties to the last.""

The Banks Say It's Not Their Problem. (Published 2022),"Justin Faunce lost $500 to a scammer impersonating a Wells Fargo official in January and hoped that the bank would reimburse him. Mr. Faunce was a longtime Wells Fargo customer and had immediately reported the scam — involving Zelle the popular money transfer app.

But Wells Fargo said the transaction wasn’t fraudulent because Mr. Faunce had authorized it — even though he had been tricked into transferring the money.

Mr. Faunce was shocked. “It was clearly fraud” he said. “This wasn’t my fault so why isn’t the bank doing the right thing here?”

At my company 60% of my investors are women and 60% of capital is from women.

I want to shout to the rooftops about how I overcame the odds in the dismally undiverse world of tech. Only 1% of venture capital in Europe is managed by all-women teams and there are still overwhelmingly more male angel investors than women.

So why do so many investors not care? And why did so many people want to dissuade me from trying to find female investors?

How I did it

In France you might think it’s nearly impossible to raise from a female angel with experience investing. There are about five female entrepreneurs in French tech who have sold their companies and are now investing. Given their public profiles they’re understandably bombarded with requests from entrepreneurs — both men and women — every day.

So I knew I needed to talk to women who might not have experience with angel investing but who had the financial means and valuable business expertise needed. I reached out to a number of smart powerful and thoughtful women in C-suite roles who I had met over my 20-year career who could commit between €20k and €50k each.

I organised a pitch meeting with 20 women and in two hours I had €300k and 10 new investors. I then asked those investors if they knew women who would be interested to invest. Little by little my network of potential investors started to grow. In the end I raised €1m.

Roughly 80% of my female investors had never angel invested before. Many were flattered to be asked; it was usually their powerful husbands being asked to invest in B2B tech companies like mine while they only ever got approached about things that had to do with fashion or childcare.

Learning to ignore the sceptics

Finding these women took time. But it was the feedback I got from sceptics (mostly men) that made me even more determined to get at least a majority of my capital from women.

One female serial entrepreneur/investor from an older generation than me asked me why I was so hell-bent on raising from women.

“Men have the money” she said.

“You’re losing your focus on the business” one male investor chided.

But isn’t all fundraising taking focus away from the business whether you’re raising from men women or animals? And why aren’t men ever accused of this?

If I could find 21 women to invest in my business I don’t understand why every tech startup in Europe doesn’t have at least one

It was clear to me how valuable having female investors was from day one.

The male investors I spoke to asked the same three questions: “How will you achieve product-market fit? What’s the market size? What’s your go-to-market strategy?”

The female investors asked me questions that made me think and pushed me to consider new things. I’m in the business of making workforce and location management simple for hybrid companies; the women asked me about my views on how hybrid work would evolve how the needs of employees and companies would evolve they asked me about my vision.

The road ahead

And I’m still not satisfied. First my original goal was to have 100% female investors. Unfortunately I did not reach that goal. But I made sure that the 40% who were men were the best of the best. And they should know they’re damn lucky to be included!

And while I may have achieved a level of gender diversity unheard of in tech I didn’t manage to do well on other measures of diversity.

My investors are highly educated white women who come from wealthy backgrounds. If I am to truly serve the diverse needs of my customers my investors need to reflect that diversity. And that includes things like ethnic cultural and socioeconomic diversity.

If I could find 21 women to invest in my business I don’t understand why every tech startup in Europe doesn’t have at least one female investor. Or maybe try two if you’re really crazy!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmR5c3Rhci5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL25iYS9wYWNlcnMvMjAyMi8wMy8wNi9wYWNlcnMtdnMtd2l6YXJkcy1nb2dhLWJpdGFkemUtaGFzLWNhcmVlci1oaWdoLWtyaXN0YXBzLXBvcnppbmdpcy1tYWtlcy1kZWJ1dC82OTI4Njg4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Coach's decision': Goga Bitadze scores career high but hardly plays in 2nd half of Pacers' loss,"WASHINGTON — Goga Bitadze was in a groove Sunday night at Capital One Arena and no play proved it more than the one the Pacers big man made just before halftime. With the shot clock winding down Oshae Brissett tossed the ball to Bitadze on the perimeter. The 6-foot-11 center was being hounded by Wizards forward Deni Avdija but dribbled down the lane crossed over behind his back and even lost the ball briefly before picking it up and banking in a midrange jumper.

The difficult and perhaps lucky shot gave Bitadze 17 first-half points on 6-for-6 shooting to match his career high but he cooled off significantly in the second half mainly due to a lack of playing time.

When asked why Bitadze didn't play more in the third quarter the period that Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said ""killed"" his team Sunday he cited it was ""just a coach's decision."" That decision paved the way for the Wizards to take control of the game and hold on for a 133-123 victory.

The Pacers (22-44) remain fifth in the lottery standings one game behind Oklahoma City but tied in the loss column. Indiana is two games ahead of Sacramento in sixth.

After starring in the first half Bitadze remained on the bench until the 1:42 mark of the third quarter. By that time the Wizards flipped a four-point halftime deficit into a seven-point lead behind Kristaps Porzingis who played for Carlisle in Dallas and made his Washington debut.

""It's tough man when you're feeling it like that but it's coach's decision"" Bitadze said of barely playing in the third quarter. ""I trust coach. Whoever he felt like should've been out there was out there and I was just staying ready.""

Bitadze totaled a career-high 20 points on 7-for-7 shooting from the field and 4-for-4 shooting at the free-throw line. The third-year big man also had six rebounds and three 3s in 24 minutes nearly matching Porzingis' 25 points and five rebounds. Porzingis was acquired from Dallas at the trade deadline but the 7-3 center hadn’t played since Jan. 29 also against the Pacers due to a bruised right knee.

Bitadze who was selected 18th overall by the Pacers in the 2019 NBA Draft scored an and-1 layup on Porzingis early in the fourth quarter but he was subbed out with 4:46 remaining and didn’t play again.

""(Bitadze) was great. He gave us great minutes"" Carlisle said. ""(Jalen) Smith played well too so that's why he went in ahead of him. (The Wizards) were small at the time so against a smallish lineup Smith is gonna be a little better with switching and stuff like that but Goga played extremely well. I'm really happy for him.""

The Pacers made a fourth-quarter surge led by Buddy Hield. He scored 10 of his 19 points in the period and nailed back-to-back 3s to help cut the Wizards’ lead to 116-113 but Indiana couldn’t get over the hump. After Hield missed a 3 that would’ve tied the game Kyle Kuzma converted an and-1 layup on Tyrese Haliburton on the other end. Kuzma made the ensuing free throw to push Washington’s lead back up to six points with just over four minutes left in the game.

Smith made a layup with 2:31 left to pull Indiana within three points again but Porzingis emphatically slammed the door on a comeback with two dunks down the stretch.

""He hurt us a lot around them and a couple of the 3s that he hit in the second half were timely 3s"" Carlisle said of his former player. ""He's gonna play well (with the Wizards). This team is set up very well for his skill set. He looked great (Sunday). He looked healthy. He looked strong. He gives Washington a really different dimension to their team.""

Kuzma had a big game alongside Porzingis totaling 23 points eight assists and five rebounds.

Malcolm Brogdon paced Indiana with a game-high 27 points and four assists. Tyrese Haliburton had 15 points a game-high 11 assists and seven rebounds. Smith and Duane Washington Jr. added 15 and 11 points respectively.

From the Pacers' perspective though the night still belonged to Bitadze who's had an up and down season.

""He needed a night like (Sunday)"" Brogdon said. ""He's a guy that works hard man. He's come a long way since his first year in the NBA. I've really watched him mature on and off the court so he deserves to have a night like (Sunday). He deserves to have more nights like this. So for me it's always about encouraging him to come out be locked in focused on his job and performing at a high level."

Carnival Spirit’s cruises from the Mobile Alabama Cruise Terminal will be seasonal and will run for six months each year before the ship is moved during the summer months to Alaska she said.

Related stories:

Duffy in Mobile Saturday announced the new plans for Mobile during a news conference on the day that cruising returned to Alabama’s port city following a 720-day hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It will be a great ship for Mobile and will allow us to operate longer itineraries of six to eight days with eastern and western Caribbean sailings” Duffy said. “It gives people a lot of options.”

The Spirit’s arrival will come following a year-long pause in cruising from Mobile.

That pause will begin in mid-October when the Carnival Ecstasy sails for the final time. The Ecstasy is the Miami-based company’s oldest operating ship and was departing from Mobile Saturday for the first sailing out of the city since the pandemic began in March 2020.

“I don’t like to have a gap at all” Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson said about the forthcoming cruising hiatus. “But by the same token it’s good to know there is a very bright future.”

‘Unique opportunity’

Indeed the arrival of the Carnival Spirit will give cruisers options out of Mobile that they have not had since cruising returned to Alabama in 2016 following a five-year hiatus.

The Spirit will be the first none-Fantasy class ship to sail out of Mobile with cruisers since 2016. The vessel is newer – it was launched in 2000 compared to the 1991 launching of the Ecstasy – and is bigger. The capacity for the Carnival Spirit allows for more than 2100 passengers which is slightly more than the Ecstasy and the Carnival Fantasy which sailed out of Mobile from 2016 to 2020. The Fantasy was retired during the COVID-19 pandemic and has since been sold for scrap.

But for city officials the Spirit’s biggest allure is with its itineraries which includes destinations that have not been offered before out of Mobile.

The vessel is also taking longer excursions of six to eight days. Currently excursions offered out of Mobile are sailing for shorter time periods to Cozumel and Progreso Yucatan.

“We think more customers will come in and stay before and after longer in Mobile” said David Clark president & CEO with Visit Mobile. “With those longer opportunities you will be able to see more of the Caribbean. This is an opportunity we never had before in Mobile and it’s a good thing.”

Duffy said the commitment for sailings out of Mobile will be for two-to-three years. She said the company has opened up its itineraries to 2024 and is planning for 2025 soon.

“Mobile is a great drive-to destination for many of our guests” she said. “We have ships in New Orleans that people can drive to as well. The difference now is the ships in New Orleans are for seven days or shorter cruises. (In Mobile) we’re giving people something different.”

She said the seasonal excursions from Mobile will offer an opportunity for people to cruise from the city to Alaska since the Carnival Spirit will head north for the summer months.

“It gives the opportunity for people to come to Mobile to take that journey when the ship moves from Mobile up to Seattle” Duffy said. “It’s a very very unique opportunity for people to come to Mobile for those cruises and there is a lot of demand for those itineraries.”

Filling a ‘void’

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson speaks during a news conference on Saturday March 5 2022 at the Mobile Alabama Cruise Terminal in downtown Mobile Ala. (John Sharp/jsharp@al.com).

The challenge for Mobile could be on finding alternative uses for the cruise terminal whenever the Spirit is not sailing out of the venue.

Stimpson said he’s uncertain on how the venue could be utilized although he said the absence of a ship could open the venue up for offering more weddings.

“It’s the prettiest location we have along the (Mobile) river” said Stimpson who acknowledged that the city will have a “void” during the summer months. The Ecstasy’s sailings this summer will mark the last time cruising will occur in Mobile during the summer season for the foreseeable future.

Stimpson said that cruising brings approximately $12 million in economic impact to Mobile. On an annual basis the cruise industry can fill up to around 35000 hotel rooms in Mobile.

It also helps pay for the city’s bills. Whenever a cruise ship is in the city it brings in around $6 million in annual gross revenues from wharfage and parking alone.

The revenue offsets the outstanding bond payments on the cruise terminal. The city’s typical debt on the venue is around $1.8 million. The terminal’s bond does not expire until 2030.

During fiscal year 2020 – the year that cruising was halted during the pandemic – only around $3 million in gross revenues were generated from the terminal.

“We’ve been fortunate during COVID that our revenues are up” Stimpson said referring to the city overall. “But there is a hole created by not having a cruise ship here. We have to backfill when we don’t have the revenue to amortize the debt on the cruise terminal.”

Cruising he said is “beneficial not to just the city (government)” but also to downtown’s restaurants and bars.

Clark said he’s hopeful that there is potential to lure a second Carnival cruise ship to Mobile or for the city to attract a cruise ship from another company.

“The infrastructure is there for the most part (to support more than one cruise ship at the same time)” Clark said. “We have to continue driving demand for cruising from Mobile.”

Stimpson said there will be a need to upgrade the cruise terminal once the Ecstasy departs in October. The biggest upgrade will involve spending potentially up to $5 million to replace the facility’s gangway or the raised platform that serves as the walkway leading cruisers and crew members from the terminal to the vessel.

‘Emotional’ return

For now Stimpson and other city officials are all smiles as a cruise ship has returned to the city for the first time since the industry was shuttered during the onset of the pandemic.

“Many of you have been waiting a long time to take this vacation” Stimpson told a crowd of cruisers who gathered to listen to the news conference hours before the Ecstasy department the terminal. “We are glad to be a part of it.”

The news conference also served as a celebration -- or as Carnival cruise officials labeled it a “Sailabration” -- of the company’s 50th birthday. It drew not only representatives of the local media but a large group of cruisers who looked on and applauded at the announcement that the Spirit will be arriving to Mobile in 2023.

A crowd of cruisers await a news conference to begin on Saturday March 5 2022 inside the Mobile Alabama Cruise Terminal in downtown Mobile Ala.

The news conference was also a celebration for Carnival has it has almost resumed sailings at all of its homeports. The Ecstasy’s departure from Mobile was the 20th Carnival Cruise Line ship to resume sailing since the COVID-19 pandemic upended the global cruising industry.

“We are almost completed with all of our fleet back in service” Duffy said. “It’s emotional for our crew to have guests finally back on board.”

Among those waiting to board the ship were Ray and Melanie West of Calhoun Georgia. The couple were going on their 48th cruise and their 11th from the Mobile terminal.

“We’re excited to have a newer and bigger ship (coming to Mobile)” said Ray West referring to the Carnival Spirit. “This (terminal) is within driving distance from almost everywhere in the Southeast.

This news comes as Carnival Ecstasy resumes sailings from Mobile for the first time in two years.

Carnival Spirit from Mobile Alabama

On Saturday it was a special day at the Port of Mobile Alabama when Carnival Ecstasy resumed operations and kickstarted Carnival’s service from the city after a two-year absence. During the event the cruise line also announced its future plans on sailings from Mobile.

The cruise line will introduce a new seasonal six- and eight-day cruise program with the Carnival Spirit. The vessel will begin the new offering from October 6 2023 through March 30 2024.

The Spirit-class ship will sail the eastern and western Caribbean including visits to Bimini Half Moon Cay and Mahogany Bay along with more ports of call. The sailings will open for booking on March 9 2022.

It was previously unclear which ship would operate from the port in the future but Carnival Cruise Line and Mobile will continue the partnership which first started in 2002.

“For more than a decade cruises out of Mobile have brought countless visitors to our city from across the Southeast — providing a boost to our hotels restaurants attractions and dozens of other local businesses in the surrounding region” Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson said. “Simply put Mobile’s economy is not operating to its full potential without a cruise ship in its harbor. We are fortunate to have had a great partnership with Carnival Cruise Line for several years and as we celebrate Ecstasy’s departure today we look forward to many more.”

Cruises Resume from Mobile

The details of the future plan for Carnival cruises out of Mobile were announced during a special “Back to Fun” and 50th Birthday kickoff event as Carnival Ecstasy resumes service for the first time in two years and restarts operations from the port.

The Fantasy-class cruise ship departed on Saturday from Mobile on a five-day Western Caribbean voyage that includes a call at Cozumel Mexico. To commemorate the restart and the sailabration voyage to start Carnival Cruise Line’s 50th Birthday festivities Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy and Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson hosted the ribbon-cutting ceremony which officially welcomes the first guests back on board.

“We have certainly missed seeing that iconic funnel in our downtown skyline and welcoming cruisers from across the country to Mobile these past two years so we are so ready to get Back to Fun as our partner Carnival Cruise Line returns to the Port of Mobile” added David Clark president and CEO of Visit Mobile.

Carnival Ecstasy offers four- and five-day Western Caribbean itineraries from the port through October 10 2022. The four-day voyages visit Cozumel and the five-day voyages include Cozumel along with Costa Maya or Progreso.

There will also be a one-time 10-day Carnival Journeys cruise that departs on September 10 2022. The sailing features Key West Grand Turk Amber Cove Grand Cayman and Cozumel.

Following service from Mobile Carnival Ecstasy will sadly leave the fleet in October. The ship’s fate is not yet known but the hope is that she is sold to another operator rather than following her sister’s ships that have already been scrapped.

It’s an important time for Carnival Cruise Line as the festivities for its 50th birthday have kicked off. During Carnival Ecstasy’s first sailing back there will be a special ship meetup on March 7 with six other ships in the fleet between Cozumel and Costa Maya.

The Fantasy-class vessel is also marking Carnival’s return to Mobile offering a series of four- and five-night cruises from the homeport.

On its return cruise the ship is sailing to Cozumel – where it will spend one entire night docked – as part of a five-night voyage.

With itineraries that also sail to other Mexican ports and the Western Caribbean the Alabama program has departures scheduled through Oct. 10 – when the Ecstasy departs on its last commercial cruise for Carnival.

According to a recent announcement the vessel – and its sister Carnival Sensation – are the next to be retired by cruise operator. A buyer has not been named.

Currently the oldest vessel in Carnival’s fleet the Carnival Ecstasy originally entered service in 1991. Second in a series of eight ships known as the Fantasy Class the 2040-guest ship was last refurbished in late 2019.

During the renovation it received a Bonsai Sushi Express eatery a new video arcade a new Dreams Studio photo venue and general upgrades to its retail shops.

The two-week-long drydock also included routine maintenance throughout the vessel as well as the replacement of carpeting tile work and furniture as needed according to a statement issued by Carnival at the time.

Previously in 2017 the Ecstasy received most of the company’s most recent food beverage and entertainment concepts including Guy’s Burger Joint RedFrog Rum Bar BlueIguana Cantina Alchemy Bar BlueIguana Tequila Bar and more.

Other highlights of the ship include a resort-style tropical-themed main pool area a WaterWorks Park and a Serenity adults-only retreat.

The Ecstasy is the first of three ships reentering service for Carnival through the end of the month.

On Mar. 7 the Carnival Spirit is welcoming the guests back offering short cruises to the Bahamas from the Port of Jacksonville.

(WALA) -The Carnival Ecstasy is back on the waters and is making its voyage to Mexico out of Mobile. Carnival Cruise and the Port City celebrated Saturday morning before the ship set sail.

The Ecstasy which will take passengers to Cozumel Mexico is the first ship to leave from Mobile since the industry restarted operations in July.

Carnival and the city not only celebrated the end of a two-year cruising hiatus and welcomed guests back but also celebrated Carnival’s 50th birthday.

“I can’t think of a better celebration as we come out of these past two years our 50th birthday. We are kicking off our birthday week with our Carnival Sailabration” said Christine Duffy Carnival Cruise Line President.

While this week’s restart of cruising will only last until mid-October with the Ecstasy getting pulled out of Carnival’s fleet Carnival’s return to the Port City is no longer out of the picture. Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy announced some welcome news for the Port City.

“We are going to be bringing... Carnival Spirit to Mobile.”

Duffy said the Carnival Spirit will be newer larger and have lots of amenities offering season cruising from Mobile with six and eight-day itineraries.

“We’re giving guests something different for people who want to come to Mobile. So you’ll see because it’s a longer cruise we’ll probably attract different guests than we would for the shorter cruise” said Duffy.

Mayor Sandy Stimpson was thrilled about the new ship and its bright future with Mobile.

“It really gives us a huge opportunity to prove to Carnival you know that we have the customer base in this market to support a ship like that which can lead to better things in the future even” said Mayor Stimpson.

Carnival Spirit will make its way home to the Port City by the end of October 2023.

Carnival Cruise Line said Spirit will offer cruises to Mexico the Bahamas Jamaica and Belize out of Mobile.

The Carnival Ecstasy is sailing for a 5-days to the Western Caribbean.

City leaders cut the ribbon Saturday morning to celebrate it and also some exciting news for future cruises.

This trip leaving Saturday kicks off the 50th birthday celebration for Carnival.

“Here we are right after Mardi Gras back in Mobile with Carnival Ecstasy which is a new ship for Mobile. The ship looks great and the team is excited” President of Carnival Cruise Lines Christine Duffy said.

Mayor Sandy Stimpson says it’s great to have cruises back as they bring in lots of tourists and revenue for the City of Mobile.

It’s just going to be very beneficial not just to the city but to all those bars and restaurants and hotels that support it” Stimpson said.

And that’s already happening passengers coming in days ahead of time to take in what Mobile has to offer ahead of this trip.

“The area’s just very delightful. We took in some sights and we came in a day early. We’ve had a great time” Lynn Vessini said.

It’s even been more convenient for some to cruise out of Mobile.

“We’ve cruised out of New Orleans but this is a little shorter drive from us and I think it’ll be a great time” Bill Evans said.

Duffy said the Carnival Ecstasy will be retiring after this season and replaced by a new ship the Carnival Spirit

“Carnival Spirit is a newer larger ship many more accommodations lots more balconies suites amenities. She will be arriving in October 2023” Duffy said.

That means after this season there will be a year off before another crew set sail from the Port City and during that time the City Of Mobile will have to prepare for a bigger ship

“I don’t like having a gap at all but on the same token it’s good to know that there is a very bright future and that’s what we have to point toward” Stimpson said.

The Carnival Spirit set to sail in October next year will take trips to Mexico the Bahamas Jamaica and Belize.

So while the state-owned airline hasn’t been able to operate many international flights the carrier’s global route network is about to shrink even further.

Aeroflot suspends international flights March 8 2022

Aeroflot has announced plans to suspend all international flights in the coming days. Specifically:

Aeroflot’s international flights from Russia will be suspended as of March 6 2022

Aeroflot’s international flights to Russia will be suspended as of March 8 2022

The only exception to this will be flights to Belarus which will continue to operate (though for political purposes that might as well be considered a domestic flight). This change has come at the recommendation of Russia’s state aviation authority.

Aeroflot is suspending international flights

Why is Aeroflot suspending international flights?

The primary motivation for Aeroflot suspending international flights has nothing to do with airspace closures or with Aeroflot’s ability to sell tickets being greatly limited. Rather it has to do with the risk of the carrier’s planes being seized. All kinds of sanctions are being imposed against Russia and among those the European Union has added a ban on leasing aircraft to Russian airlines.

Some of the world’s largest aircraft leasing companies are based in the European Union so hundreds of jets operated by Russian airlines are at risk of being seized. Aeroflot is refusing to cooperate with leasing companies’ demands to return the jets so the decision has been made to just operate planes domestically. This way aircraft leasing companies can’t seize these jets while they’re at foreign airports.

So yeah Aeroflot is essentially flying around “stolen” jets domestically at this point. With the Ruble having collapsed I also can’t imagine that Aeroflot would even be able to make lease payments anymore. And to think that in 2020 Aeroflot outlined a plan to become a global five star airline.

One has to wonder what the long term goal here is? I guess Aeroflot hopes these sanctions will be lifted eventually and the airline can keep flying these jets in the future? Seems like a stretch but then again one has to wonder what the long term plan is for so much going on right now…

Aeroflot’s big jets will now exclusively fly domestically

Bottom line

Aeroflot is suspending its international flights by March 8 2022 with the exception of flights to Belarus. That’s because aircraft leasing companies are trying to seize jets that are operated by Aeroflot and if the airline operates internationally there’s a high risk of that happening. By just keeping these jets in Russia Aeroflot is unlikely to face any issues with its fleet being taken away… at least for now.

What do you make of Aeroflot’s decision to suspend international flights?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWVyb2Zsb3QtaGFsdHMtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1mbGlnaHRzLXJpc2stZm9yZWlnbi1wbGFuZXMtaW1wb3VuZGVkLTIwMjItM9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWVyb2Zsb3QtaGFsdHMtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1mbGlnaHRzLXJpc2stZm9yZWlnbi1wbGFuZXMtaW1wb3VuZGVkLTIwMjItMz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aeroflot halts international flights fears planes could be impounded,"Domestic routes are due to continue unchanged as are flights to Belarus. Pavel Golovkin/AP

Aeroflot Russia's flagship carrier announced a halt on all international flights from March 8.

The company said in a statement that domestic flights will continue as normal.

Fights to Belarus will not be affected either according to the airline.

Aeroflot Russia's flagship airline has announced it is suspending international flights except those to Belarus.

There is a high risk of foreign-leased planes being impounded due to sanctions imposed on Russia according to the country's aviation agency Rosaviatsiya.

In a statement posted on its website on Saturday Aeroflot said there would be a temporary suspension of all international flights from March 8 ""due to the occurrence of additional circumstances that impede the operation of flights.""

The suspension doesn't apply to foreign airlines from countries that have not imposed sanctions on Russia and haven't shut down their airspace.

The statement added that the airline would let passengers with one-way tickets fly up until March 8. However it will cancel return tickets for passengers who are scheduled to depart Russia after March 6 and come back after March 8.

Domestic routes are due to continue unchanged the statement said.

S7 Russia's biggest private airline and second-largest globally said on Friday it was ceasing all international flights as of Saturday according to Reuters.

The company did not give a reason for the move.

Aeroflot and S7 did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

The move follows sanctions imposed by Western countries including the US and those within the EU. After the UK banned Russian planes from its airspace Russia issued its own ban in retaliation.

Insider's Taylor Ardrey previously reported that Estonia and Romania have also barred Russia from their airspace along with many other European countries.

There has been global condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine which President Vladimir Putin has called a ""special operation.""







The EU gave aircraft lessors until March 28 to end any rental contracts in Russia as part of the sanctions to punish Putin. The sanctions banned ""any plane owned chartered or otherwise controlled by a Russian legal or natural person"" from entering EU airspace.

Chinese companies sent seven satellites into space from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China's Sichuan Province on Saturday aiming to build the nation's first low-Earth orbit (LEO) broadband communication test constellation.Six satellites were produced by Beijing-based start-up GalaxySpace and a commercial remote sensing satellite was launched by a Long March-2C carrier rocket and entered their planned orbits.The successful mission proved that China has built up the low-cost batch development and networking operation capabilities of satellites all factors that are necessary to build a satellite internet mega-constellation.The six broadband communication satellites will form China's first LEO broadband communication test constellation together with the first satellite of GalaxySpace and build a satellite-ground fusion 5G test network codenamed ""Mini-spider Constellation"" capable of providing communication services for more than 30 minutes each time.The six satellites with an average weight of 190 kilograms have a communication capacity of more than 40 gigabytes per second (Gbps) each.The development cost of a single satellite has been reduced to half of the firm's first satellite according to the firm.GalaxySpace launched China's first LEO broadband private communications satellite on January 16 2020.With the iteration of technology and improvements in industrial batch production capacity the unit prices of satellites can drop rapidly and the commercial value of domestic satellite internet has bright prospects industry analysts said.The satellites will verify the networking technology and service capability of the LEO internet constellation. They will also verify remote-sensing technology which will mark the start of verification and application of communication and remote-sensing integrated technologies for LEO satellites.The ground data processing system was developed independently by Beijing Four Squares Technology a satellite data analysis company.Xi Xiaofei founder and CEO of the company told the Global Times that there was no precedent in the industry for LEO satellites to carry both remote sensing payloads and communication payloads at the same time.Applications in the two systems are usually independent playing a pivotal role in each of their domains without forming a whole and the efficiency of information acquisition and utilization is still low.""The strategic position of LEO remote-sensing satellites has become increasingly prominent. As the accuracy of satellites continues to improve the raw data grows exponentially. At the same time remote sensing as an important factor in scenarios such as emergency rescue and disaster relief maritime monitoring and global target monitoring needs to achieve minute-level response"" Xi said.Remote sensing and communication integration combined with intelligent ground-data processing systems will accelerate emergency responses.Demand for China's domestic commercial launches has been growing rapidly in recent years. Due to the low technology threshold LEO satellites are becoming the main development direction of commercial satellites and the market size continues to expand Jiang Jie a rocket expert with the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology said at the sidelines of the two sessions which kicked off in Beijing on Friday.Satellite internet which uses satellites to provide high-speed internet services even in hard-to-reach rural areas has emerged as a key driving force for the world economy.Morgan Stanley has estimated that the global space industry will generate revenue of $1 trillion in 2040 about 50-70 percent from satellite internet.China's constellation is small compared with Starlink owned by Elon Musk's firm SpaceX which already has more than 2000 satellites in orbit. But China is ramping up efforts to promote the application and transfer of space technology in the next five years according to a white paper on the country's space program issued in January.China will accelerate the integration of satellite applications with the development of industries and regions and space information using new-generation information technology such as big data and the Internet of Things the white paper said.The country will extend the integrated application of remote-sensing satellite data on land at sea and in the atmosphere.The National Development and Reform Commission included ""satellite internet"" among its new infrastructure initiatives for the first time on April 20.According to a forecast by GalaxySpace founder and CEO Xu Ming there will be at least two global satellite internet companies in the future one of which will be Starlink and the other will be from China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS91bmlvbi1kZS10cmFuc3BvcnRzLWFlcmllbnMtaGlzdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The History Of French Carrier Union de Transports Aériens,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS91bmlvbi1kZS10cmFuc3BvcnRzLWFlcmllbnMtaGlzdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1cnJpeWV0ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS90dXJraXNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLWV4dGVuZHMtZmxpZ2h0LXN1c3BlbnNpb24tdG8tdWtyYWluZS1tb2xkb3ZhLTE3MTk4NdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1cnJpeWV0ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvdHVya2lzaC1haXJsaW5lcy1leHRlbmRzLWZsaWdodC1zdXNwZW5zaW9uLXRvLXVrcmFpbmUtbW9sZG92YS0xNzE5ODU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turkish Airlines extends flight suspension to Ukraine Moldova,"Turkish Airlines extends flight suspension to Ukraine Moldova

ISTANBUL

Turkey’s flag carrier has announced that it has further extended its suspension of flights to and from Ukraine and Moldova amid the conflict that broke out in the region.

Starting from Feb. 24 Turkish Airlines halted flights to those countries. On Feb. 28 it said it extended the suspension until Mach 15.

In a statement on March 3 the carrier said flights to and from Ukraine and Moldova were further suspended until March 18.

It also canceled a flight from Istanbul to Russia’s Sochi scheduled for March 6.

Meanwhile Turkish Airlines on March 3 evacuated members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) from Sochi.

An airplane belonging to the flag carrier brought 130 OSCE members of different nationalities from Sochi to Istanbul.

OSCE members were on a mission in Ukraine’s breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. When the security situation deteriorated and clashes began they first traveled to the Russian city of Rostov via land. As flights were canceled they moved to Sochi from where the Turkish carrier airlifted them.

Ahmet Bolat the chairman of Turkish Airlines’ board of directors and the executive committee said that the Ukraine conflict’s impact on the carrier is likely to be limited.

“We have had experienced a similar crisis in the past. We will weather this one too” he said.

Bolat noted that the share of Russia and Ukraine in Turkish Airlines’ global operations is around 2 to 3 percent and even smaller in cargo operations. “That is why the crisis impact on Turkish Airlines should not be large” he said."

A KFC customer was left feeling 'physically sick' after claiming she discovered a ""caterpillar"" doing ""a little dance"" on her fried chicken.

Jody Bishop and her partner had ordered from the Ebbw Vale branch of the fast-food restaurant for a cosy Friday night-in at their home in Tredegar Wales.

The pair had each ordered a meal for one containing two pieces of original recipe chicken two hot wings and two fillets and tucked into their food Wales Online reports.

But after putting her plate down partway through the meal to go and get herself a drink Jody returned from the kitchen and said she noticed something small and dark ""doing a little dance"" on the hot wing she had bitten into just moments earlier.

The tiny insect which the pair said they believe to be a caterpillar can be seen in a video wriggling on the plate as it is gently prodded by a piece of fried chicken with Jody and her partner struggling to believe what they were seeing.

""We'd ordered these two meals for one for delivery"" she said. ""We were halfway through eating it and everything seemed to be fine. I went to get myself a drink and came back and noticed something moving along the chicken bone.

""It was doing a little dance on the chicken it was horrible. That piece of chicken had just been in my mouth and God knows how many more there might have been in there.""

After finding the discovery Jody stopped eating immediately and was left feeling ""physically sick"".

""I had to run to the toilet and be sick"" she said. ""It was so unpleasant to say the least. I actually couldn't believe that it had happened but it left me feeling so unwell knowing I'd just taken a bite out of that chicken.

Jody said she even had to go home early from her job on a Covid testing site the following day as she continued to feel ill hours after.

Woman horrified to find 'wriggling caterpillar' on KFC chicken wing she was eating

A woman was left feeling ""physically sick"" after finding a caterpillar wriggling over the KFC chicken wing she'd just bitten into.

Jody Bishop and her partner fancied a takeaway to top off a cosy night in at their home in Tredegar Wales and decided to place an order with the popular fast food chain.

They received their order from the nearby Ebbw Vale branch and both tucked into their own meal for one - which contained two pieces of original recipe chicken two hot wings and two fillets Wales Online reports.

Jody then put her plate down to fetch a drink but when she returned she spotted something small and dark ""doing a little dance"" on the hot wing she had already bitten a chunk out of.

The pair who recorded the squirming insect said they believe the creepy crawly was a caterpillar.

In the clip it can be seen seemingly wriggling on the plate as it's gently prodded by a piece of fried chicken.

Jody said: ""We'd ordered these two meals for one for delivery. We were halfway through eating it and everything seemed to be fine.

""I went to get myself a drink and came back and noticed something moving along the chicken bone.

""It was doing a little dance on the chicken it was horrible. That piece of chicken had just been in my mouth and God knows how many more there might have been in there.""

After finding the discovery Jody stopped eating immediately and was left feeling ""physically sick"".

""I had to run to the toilet and be sick"" she said.

""It was so unpleasant to say the least. I actually couldn't believe that it had happened but it left me feeling so unwell knowing I'd just taken a bite out of that chicken.""

Jody even had to go home early from her job on a Covid testing site the following day as she continued to feel ill hours after.

She said she has tried repeatedly to get in contact with KFC to complain about the incident.

The pair did get a refund for the meal but she think more should be done.

Alouette River Management Society (ARMS) has put together their annual Adopt-a-Butterfly fundraiser and will have almost 200 kits available this March.

ARMS has been hosting this fundraiser for the past three years said Alex Holmes with the organization adding that people can start placing orders for their kits starting March 3.

“With the species we use for the adoptions Painted Lady butterflies they transform in just three weeks. This allows us to be able to view the changes as they happen — becoming a chrysalis and emerging as a butterfly. Painted Ladies are a great addition to help pollination occur in the local area helping spread pollen for local wildflowers” she said.

The organization has 200 kits available for adoption and each kit includes one live caterpillar caterpillar food and instructions on each life’s stages. Each kit is for $30 and the organization is also providing butterfly houses for an additional $10.

“This is a fundraiser that helps to fund our education programs including classroom programs community opportunities and salmon programming” said Holmes.

Those who purchase the kit will be able to watch real time the natural cycle of a Painted Lady. Participants are also encouraged to document their care of the butterflies teaching them how to observe changes in the environment around them.

“Once a butterfly emerges from the chrysalis it takes a few hours for its wings to dry out. Once they are dry they are able to fly. At this time they have to be released from their butterfly house. You want to do this on a warm day too cold and the butterfly won’t survive. We again encourage participants to document and take photos we always like to see the success and joy as the butterflies are released” she said.

Many companies are on board,"OMAHA Neb. — If you build a shiny new office building will your employees show up to work in it?

Many U.S. companies are banking on it because they believe working in person is better for collaboration and training young employees. So even though most employees are still working from home offices and dining room tables today some companies are willing to spend big on showplace headquarters.

Businesses recognize there is a place for offices despite the fact that they plan to give workers more flexibility to work from home and might see cost savings from limiting their real estate holdings.

In a sign of how committed companies are to keeping offices some 57% of the more than 2300 office projects that giant architecture firm Gensler is now working on were started last year in the middle of the pandemic.

Minneapolis Fire Department crews responded to multiple calls across the city Saturday night as a wintry mix fell.

Around 7:15 p.m. firefighters responded to a Phillips neighborhood building near Park Avenue South and East 26th Street for an underground vault that had caught fire with visible smoke. No fire extended to the building according to a spokesperson for the department. Xcel Energy was called to the scene.

Crews also responded to a fire at a home in the area of East 57th Street and 26th Avenue South. Erik Rognerud/KSTP

Responders left the scene to Xcel and in the care of building management with a few crews on standby in case of popup fires.

Crews also responded to a fire at a home in the area of East 57th Street and 27th Avenue South just southeast of Lake Nokomis. According to a spokesman the home had caught fire earlier Saturday around 2 a.m. and was turned back over to the residents. KSTP crews on scene saw the upper level of the house badly damaged and charred and crews still on scene at 9 p.m.

When crews arrived at the scene there were flames visible on the second floor and fire did extend to the neighbor’s home. The cause of that fire is under investigation. No one was injured.

Also Saturday evening firefighters responded to a gas leak at a 26-story apartment building on the corner of East Hennepin Avenue and Fourth Street Northeast.

According to the department the incident arose from a malfunctioning heater on fifth-floor parking. About 40 people were evacuated from the second-sixth floors; all other residents sheltered in place. Crews only had gas readings on floors two through six.

Centerpoint Energy and building maintenance shut down the heater and they were able to use the building’s HVAC system to ventilate.

It is unknown whether any people were displaced.

More information about all of these incidents is expected soon. Nothing further is known at this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mumbai-based UPL valued at around ₹55000 crore is one of the largest agrochemicals companies in the world. The company produces industrial chemicals chemical intermediates and speciality chemicals and offers crop protection solutions.

View Full Image UPL in merger talks with 2 American cos

The promoters of UPL are considering several options but leaning towards a merger because it may fetch much better value for their 28.24% stake and public shareholders one of the two people cited above said seeking anonymity.

“A merger at this stage is likely to fetch at least a 15% premium to UPL’s current worth which translates to around $8.9 billion or ₹63000 crore—the largest deal in the agrochemicals space in Asia if formalized"" said the first person.

A spokesperson for UPL denied talks of a potential merger with FMC Corp. or CF Industries.

UPL has hired investment bank Evercore Group LLC to advise the promoters on the best option and whether a merger deal would benefit members of the promoter family and public shareholders.

Goldman Sachs too has been hired by one of the two American firms to explore a merger or takeover in India. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment.

UPL is currently overseen by octogenarian chairman and founder Rajnikant Devidas Shroff. He started the business as a manufacturer of mercury salts at a British plant. The chairman’s elder son Jai is the CEO of UPL while his younger brother Vikram serves as a member on the company’s board.

The two American firms are keen on expanding their footprint and all the three companies are laying stress on ESG (environmental social and corporate governance) clean energy and sustainability-oriented business processes the two people said.

CF Industries Holdings is a leading manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen products.

Responding to an email from Mint Chris Close a US-based spokesperson at CF Industries said “CF Industries does not comment on market speculation.""

Philadelphia-based FMC Corp. is a global agricultural sciences firm that helps growers produce food fibre and fuel apart from providing crop protection solutions.

Replying to an email on a potential deal with UPL FMC spokesperson Lars Weborg said “FMC does not comment on industry rumours or speculation.""

If the merger plan goes through “the shortlisted entity (CF Industries or FMC) may own a majority stake in the merged entity while the Shroff family may hold a minority stake. Since a large number of shares are held by public shareholders UPL promoters may look for buyback of shares from the market to make any potential merger process easier"" said the first person.

The board of UPL on Thursday approved a buyback proposal. On Friday while the benchmark Sensex closed down by 1.4% UPL’s stock was only marginally down by 0.17% to ₹713.5. The stock has gained about 3% since the buyback was announced.

An email to Evercore Group remained unanswered.

UPL offers a range of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals including herbicides insecticides and seed treatments. It also sells other products used to stimulate plant growth store crops conserve water and a line of disease-resistant seed varieties.

In 2018 UPL acquired Arysta LifeScience Inc. for $4.2 billion in a deal that transformed the company into one of the world’s largest generic agrochemicals firms.

As part of that coverage we quoted a pediatrician who lambasted the agency at a hearing about its plans as well as Spectrum's application to be allowed to idle. To present a fuller picture we present his testimony in full below:

Dr. Patrick Schnell Dr. Patrick Schnell

I am a board-certified pediatrician and fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics who has worked for several years as a hospitalist and emergency department physician at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx where asthma rates are among the highest in the country. In addition I have worked at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan and as a pediatric Chief Resident at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. I have also spent two years treating pediatric patients with cancer.

My entire professional life has been focused on evidence-based decision making in the interest of prevention and of public health.

As such I feel qualified to testify in this matter and hope that the Department of Environmental Protection which it seems up to this point has never considered public health when granting variances to idlers will not only listen but finally act.

The biggest question for me is why there seems to be a need to educate the DEP about the most basic and obvious facts related to air pollution. The Department of Environmental Protection should already be aware of the impact of air pollution on human health. Anyone reading the newspapers let alone scientific medical or environmental journals is.

So let me just briefly summarize the situation:

Nine out of 10 people in the world (and 10 out of10 people in New York City) are breathing polluted air based on World Health Organization standards



Breathing polluted air contributes to 7-8 million premature deaths worldwide



Air pollution causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma lung cancer pneumonia ischemic heart disease and strokes



Air pollution particularly traffic related air pollution causes neurological diseases such as dementia Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer's in adults and causes delays in brain maturation with associated learning problem and behavioral issues in children



Air pollution is associated with a worse outcome in patients with Covid-19 infection



Air pollution has long term effects on the immune system and increases the risk for chronic metabolic diseases

As you can see idling and its resultant air pollution has a profound impact on public health.

But public health is not just a theoretical construct. Traffic related air pollution adversely affects the health of each and every New Yorker.

When deliberating on [Spectrum's] request for a variance I am sure DEP has already spent several hours considering the supposed merits of it. How much time has DEP spent considering the impact of this decision on New Yorkers? Almost nine million people live in New York and almost two million of them are children. Surely most New Yorkers simply assume that DEP acts in their best interest certainly in the interest of the environment since isn’t that what the name says: Department of Environmental Protection?

If every child living in New York wrote a letter about this variance to DEP and if DEP spent one minute reading each letter without taking a break then DEP would spend a total of 38 years reading those letters. If every New Yorker wrote a letter then DEP would have to spend 167 years to read those letters. I hope this gives you a sense of how many lives will be adversely impacted if a variance was granted in this case.

In the end I do not think it is a question about DEP’s knowledge. Rather the question is whether the DEP actually cares about New Yorkers.

No 8-year-old wrote you a letter about how hard school was after waking up three times over-night because of shortness of breath and the need to take asthma medications.



No 6-month-old complained to you that it took five extra days of laborious breathing and a visit to the ER go get over a horrible viral upper respiratory tract infection.



No fetus contacted you to remind you of the fact that his or her intellectual development and capacity for learning will be affected throughout life as a result of intrauterine traffic related air pollution.

But the one letter you did read is the one from Charter Communications [Spectrum's parent company]. Apparently at this point several iterations of this letters have been submitted and while the language used is becoming more and more polished — we are now reading about commitments about lofty goals about robust reporting about live alerts etc. — it remains plainly obvious that the company continues to fail to demonstrate the presence of any hardship at all as required by law. Although this company may well have been encouraged by DEP’s lack of critical review of idling requests in the past it should be obvious that the mentioned ""2035 goals"" cannot serve as an excuse for the fact that no action or insufficient action has been taken by Charter Communications over the last several years to become compliant with the idling law.

I urge DEP to not let itself be bullied into granting a variance to the idling law for Charter Communications based on a request that even in its latest iteration is hardly more than a confirmation that the company has done nothing over the last several years to adopt available technologies.

If DEP were to re-issue a variance to Charter Communications it would:

ignore binding existing guidelines outlining criteria which must be fulfilled for a variance to be granted



abdicate its role as a public servant acting against instead of in the interest of New Yorkers and



it would additionally actively discourage companies such as Charter Communications from investing into alternative power sources.

It is beyond time for the New York City DEP to live up to its name and to be an ambassador for New Yorkers not for companies trying to maximize their short term profits by harming New Yorkers’ health and wellbeing.

LOUIS MISSOURI US – Chevron USA Inc. a subsidiary of Chevron Corp. and Bunge North America Inc. a subsidiary of Bunge Ltd. announced on May 3 the creation of Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC signaling the close of their previously announced transaction.

The new company will develop renewable fuel feedstocks leveraging Bunge’s expertise in oilseed processing and farmer relationships and Chevron’s expertise in fuels manufacturing and marketing.

Under terms of the agreement St. Louis-based Bunge will contribute its soybean processing facilities in Destrehan Louisiana US and Cairo Illinois US. Chevron San Ramon California US will contribute about $600 million in cash to the joint venture which aims to establish a reliable supply chain from farmer to fueling station for both companies. The two companies anticipate approximately doubling the combined capacity of the facilities to 7000 tons per day by the end of 2024.

“Partnering with Chevron a global leader in energy is a significant step forward in building the capability to make changes at scale to help reduce carbon in our own and our customers’ value chains” Gregory A. Heckman chief executive officer of Bunge said when the deal was first announced last year. “I am confident that our shared networks global footprint and expertise is the right partnership to build a successful long-term and low-cost enterprise that will help meet the demand for next generation renewable fuels.”

Under the agreement Bunge will continue to operate the facilities. Chevron will have the purchase rights to the oil for use as renewable feedstock to manufacture diesel and jet fuel with lower lifecycle carbon intensity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L3RoZXNlLTMtb2lsLXN0b2Nrcy1hcmUtY2FzaGluZy1pbi1hcy1jcnVkZS1wcmljZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 3 Oil Stocks Are Cashing in as Crude Prices Top $100 a Barrel for the First Time in Years,"Higher oil prices are a boon for these oil stocks.

Oil prices continue their ascent this year recently topping $100 a barrel as Russia invaded Ukraine. They could push even higher if global governments place direct sanctions on Russia's oil industry. That would make an already tight oil market -- fueled by growing demand following the pandemic and years of underinvestment -- even tighter.

These higher oil prices are benefiting oil producers. Three oil stocks currently cashing in on triple-digit crude prices are Chevron (CVX 1.28%) Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN 0.63%). Here's why they're ideal options for investors who want to play the return of triple-digit oil prices.

Using the gains wisely

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Chevron): When U.S.-integrated energy giant Chevron reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings they were nothing short of impressive. Revenues came in at $48.1 billion with earnings of $5.05 billion or $2.63 per share. That was well above Q4 2020 when the company lost $0.33 per share on revenues of $25.2 billion. The big driver of the year-over-year improvement was basically rising oil prices. Given that oil prices continue to rise first-quarter 2022 results are likely to be just as impressive.

So clearly Chevron is cashing in on the high price of oil right now. But that's not what's most interesting here. What's more important is what Chevron is doing with this windfall and that's investing for the future -- only not the future of oil the future of cleaner alternatives. The company just announced plans to buy Renewable Energy Group (REGI). This $3.15 billion all-cash deal brings with it a collection of refining assets that use things like used cooking oil waste animal fats and vegetable oils as feedstocks. These renewable fuels allow Chevron to stick to its core as it greens its business.

Notably Chevron has been slow to shift toward cleaner alternatives which has aggravated ESG-inclined investors. However it is now proving that it has the scale and thanks to oil price increases the financial capacity to quickly get into emerging clean energy areas via acquisitions. So not only is Chevron benefiting mightily from higher oil prices but it's making sure that it makes good use of the opportunity that high prices are affording it.

A gusher of cash flow and dividends

Matt DiLallo (Pioneer Natural Resources): Pioneer Natural Resources made two bold moves when oil prices were lower setting it up to cash in on a future rebound in the oil market. In late 2020 it bought Parsley Energy for $7.6 billion. Last year it followed that up by spending $6.2 billion on DoublePoint Energy. The deals expanded its oil production and scale while reducing its costs.

These acquisitions enabled Pioneer Natural Resources to cash in on higher oil prices last year. The oil producer hauled in a record $3.2 billion in free cash in 2021. That included $1.9 billion in Q4 fueled by oil prices that averaged $76.38 per barrel in the period. Pioneer returned $1.9 billion of that money to shareholders via dividends and its share-repurchase program.

With crude oil recently topping $100 a barrel Pioneer will generate an even bigger cash flow gusher this year. That sets the company up to pay out an enormous amount of dividends given its unique framework. In addition to its base dividend -- which Pioneer recently increased by 25% -- it pays a variable dividend of up to 75% of its excess free cash flow each quarter. At $100 a barrel Pioneer could pay out up to $27 per share in dividends this year. That implies a potential dividend yield of more than 11% at the recent share price in the $240s. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) the U.S. oil-price benchmark was recently above $110 a barrel. The rise in crude prices will give Pioneer even more free cash flow to pay out in dividends.

That dividend framework makes Pioneer Natural Resources a great way for investors to cash in on higher crude prices this year.

Expect big dividends as oil prices rise

Neha Chamaria (Devon Energy): Given the unprecedented rally in oil prices investors in Devon Energy can expect a windfall. That's not an exaggeration. Devon Energy's war chest must be swelling with every rise in oil price and the company wants to return a large chunk of those incremental cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends. In other words as Devon cashes in on higher oil prices so should its investors.

Mid-February Devon reported stunning numbers for 2021. Its operating cash flow tripled in the year and the company generated its highest-ever free cash flows all thanks to higher commodity prices. The company didn't just boost its dividend but also its share-repurchase program.

Wait. To say Devon simply boosted its dividend would be an understatement. The thing is Devon pays a fixed as well as a variable dividend under a new dividend policy it initiated in 2021. So far every quarter Devon was paying a fixed dividend of $0.11 per share and a variable dividend equal to 50% of the extra cash flow it's left with after covering its capital expenditure and fixed dividend.

That policy has brought in solid passive income to shareholders so far including a record total dividend of $1.00 per share they're about to receive based on the company's stellar Q4 cash flow growth.

Now Devon has increased its fixed quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share. At the same time its variable dividend component should zoom now that crude oil has surpassed $100 per barrel. With Devon's lower cost production also rising after its merger with WPX Energy in early 2021 it's a win-win time to be a shareholder in this 4.5%-yielding stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L3RlY2gvMjAyNC8wNS8xMjlfMzI1MDA4Lmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL20ua29yZWF0aW1lcy5jby5rci9wYWdlcy9hcnRpY2xlLmFtcC5hc3A_bmV3c0lkeD0zMjUwMDg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Founder's great-grandson takes control of GS Caltex,"GS Caltex CEO Hur Sae-hong / Courtesy of GS Caltex

Born in 1969 Hur is a great-grandson of the late Hur Man-jung one of the co-founders of LG Group ― from which GS Group was spunoff in 2005 ― and the oldest son of GS Caltex Honorary Chairman Hur Dong-soo who is the second-oldest son of the founder's oldest son also the late founder of Samyang Tongsang Hur Jung-koo.



When the GS Caltex honorary chairman resigned as director in 2016 the position of the board chairman went to his cousin as GS Group's owner family members have customarily chaired the unlisted oil refining company's board of directors.



The latest replacement of the board chairman has been interpreted as part of the owner family's ongoing attempts to hand over control to the late founder's great-grandchildren. Along with the GS Caltex CEO GS E&C President Huh Yoon-hong and GS Senior Vice President Hur Suh-hong are among the heirs who have come to the fore recently. They are expected eventually to vie for the group's control.



Some industry officials also viewed the GS Caltex CEO's appointment as board chairman as proof of GS Group's solid partnership with Chevron as the U.S. energy company with a 50 percent stake in GS Caltex is said to have agreed to his appointment. Since Chevron established an oil refining company here in 1967 as a joint venture with LG Group the U.S. firm has maintained its ties with GS Group which holds another 50 percent stake in GS Caltex. The new board chairman also worked previously for Chevron between 2003 and 2006 before he joined GS Caltex in 2007.



As the GS Caltex CEO tightened his grip on the company he is expected to accelerate efforts to find new growth engines. Last July GS Caltex invested 30 billion won ($25 million) in Kakao Mobility to cope with new technologies. It also launched Energy Plus Hub a futuristic gas station which offers electric vehicle charging car sharing drone delivery and convenience store services.

Chevron and NewMed which operate Israel’s two biggest offshore reservoirs — the Tamar and Leviathan gas fields — are expected to export 2.5-3 bn cubic meters (bcm) of gas this year the Israeli energy ministry said last month following an agreement announced by Israeli Energy and Water Minister Karine Elharrar. This could increase to 4 bcm in subsequent years the ministry said.

This marks the first time Israel exports natural gas to Egypt via the Arab Gas Pipeline which has been renovated in recent months as part of a plan to export natural gas from Egypt to crisis-stricken Lebanon via Jordan and Syria.

Israel currently ships gas to Egypt via the Eastern Mediterranean Gas (EMG) pipeline that runs between Ashkelon and Arish which has an approximate annual capacity of 7 bcm.

All part of our east-Med energy hub ambitions: The Oil Ministry has been looking to increase the amount of gas it imports from Israel for re-export to Europe which is in search of alternative suppliers to decrease its reliance on Russian gas. Late last year the Madbouly government signed agreements with Greece and Israel laying the groundwork to up import and re-export volumes. That said it’s not clear whether Egypt or the EU have the capacity to up their gas trade: Oil Minister Tarek El Molla said in December that Egypt’s Idku and Damietta LNG terminals are both running at full capacity while Europe doesn’t have catapacity at import terminals needed to significantly increase LNG imports.

Background: We first started importing gas from Israel in 2020 under a landmark USD 15 bn contract signed in 2018 that saw Egyptian firm Dolphinus agree to purchase 64 bcm over a 10-year period. In 2019 the two sides agreed to increase the supply to 85.3 bn bcm over 15 years.

Customers who order and pay for their food on the Chipotle app at Chipotle.com or via marketplace vendors can select their pickup time and drive to the pickup window to grab their food without leaving their vehicles. Chipotle introduced the Chipotlane concept in 2019.

The first 50 people in line for Friday's opening will receive free Chipotle merchandise.

The California-based fast-casual chain known for its burritos tacos and other items opened its ninth Springs location Friday in the Victory Ridge development southeast of InterQuest and Voyager parkways in northern Colorado Springs.

And Chipotle already has another location in the works.

A proposal submitted recently to city government planners by a Denver real estate developer shows a 10th Chipotle would be built north of Dublin and Tutt boulevards on the Springs' northeast side. The site is just east of the busy Powers Boulevard residential and commercial corridor.

Chipotle like several national brands has been well established in Colorado Springs though it hasn't added a location since opening in 2009 at the University Village Colorado shopping center on North Nevada Avenue.

Elsewhere Chipotle has three restaurants along Academy Boulevard and locations on or near Powers Garden of the Gods Road Southgate Road and Tejon Street in downtown.

Asked why it's now expanding in the Springs Chipotle replied via email that it has a goal of having at least 7000 restaurants in North America and is on the lookout for new locations.

Last month the chain opened its 3000th location in Phoenix according to a Chipotle news release. This year Chipotle plans to open 235 to 250 restaurants after opening 215 in 2021 in the U.S. Canada and Europe the release said.

All locations are corporate owned; Chipotle says it's the only chain of its size to own and operate all of its restaurants.

""Chipotle is targeting growth in dynamic communities such as college towns and areas with interstate access and Colorado Springs is a great fit"" Chipotle said in its email.

Chipotle's new location in Victory Ridge at 1846 Democracy Point is 2400 square feet; it has indoor seating for 40 people and about a half-dozen outdoor tables with seating for 24 more.

The new Chipotle is the first in the Springs to offer what the restaurant chain calls its ""Chipotlane"" — a drive-thru pickup lane.

Customers who order and pay for their food on the Chipotle app at Chipotle.com or via marketplace vendors can select their pickup time and drive to the pickup window to grab their food without leaving their vehicles. Chipotle introduced the drive-thru concept in 2019.

""This format has proven to enhance guest access and convenience as well as increase new restaurant sales margins and returns"" Chipotle said in a news release when it opened its 3000th restaurant.

The Chipotle planned near Dublin and Tutt boulevards which would be about the same size as the Victory Ridge location also would have a drive-thru lane.

Asked if existing Chipotles will be remodeled or expanded to accommodate drive-thru lanes the company said via email that it's ""exploring opportunities to expand our Chipotlane footprint in Colorado Springs.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vY2RhcHJlc3MuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9tYXIvMDYvc2F2ZS10aW1lLXNhdmUtbW9uZXktYXRob2wv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Save time save money in Athol,"The grand opening was Saturday for Idaho's Dollar General in Athol at a new building north of Highway 54 off old U.S. 95.

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality.

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

The woman said the man made small talk about the apartments across the street before demanding she give him her car keys the affidavit states.

The woman told officers she immediately started calling for help. Brown then jumped in the back seat and began pulling her son out of the car when church staff came outside and confronted him according to the affidavit. Brown began threatening to blow up the church and said he worked for the president before running away the affidavit states.

When officers arrived at the church on Cheyenne Blvd. they received a burglary call from the Nashville Korean Seventh-Day Adventist Church next door.

The squad did lose several key contributors from last season including most notably Paul Arriola who signed with FC Dallas. Kevin Paredes Felipe Martins and newly acquired FC Cincinnati midfielder Junior Moreno are among the departures from last season.

STORYLINES TO WATCH

The previously mentioned Junior Moreno just acquired by FC Cincinnati on February 25 will make his first appearance against D.C. in just his second game with FCC. Moreno made 97 regular season appearances including 91 starts with D.C. between 2018-21.

“We are very close friends” Acosta said about Moreno. “We had been talking before he came here and the truth is I am very happy that he is here because he person who is very close to me. I try to help him as much as possible so that he gets accustomed to this beautiful city. I try to take him at home to make him food things like that.”

CAPTAIN LUCHO – Speaking of Luciano Acosta should he wear the captain’s armband on Saturday night it will be the 30th time he has captained FC Cincinnati. He closes in on Kendall Waston who captained the Orange and Blue in 41 regular season contests the most in club history.

UC Health still in its infancy after splitting from the Health Alliance of Greater Cincinnati to become its own entity just a few years prior sought to transform itself from a teetering health system once on the brink of bankruptcy into a sustainable major academic referral center.

Lofgren the second-ever president and chief executive officer of UC Health a position he held for eight years departed Cincinnati Friday confident he helped make that vision a reality for the academic health system.

Now he aspires to complete that same mission elsewhere.

On Monday the 67-year-old takes over as the first president and chief executive officer of the newly-created OU Health a merger of the University of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Health Authority and Trust. It's a new challenge he plans to make the capstone of a career he strategically designed around building academic health institutions.

When he looks back on his eight years in Cincinnati – a time frame in which UC Health grew its revenue by $1 billion from 2013 to 2022 – the Royal Oak Michigan native said he's proud to have played a part in building a modern academic health system mostly from the ground up in Cincinnati.

""We really have grown the organization"" Lofgren said in an interview with The Enquirer his final public engagement as president of UC Health. ""It's a reflection of the growth of those high-end subspecialty programs that regardless of how complex your problems are you can get world-class care here in Cincinnati.""

Lofgren oversaw a massive increase in capital spending with minority and women business enterprises while at UC Health. During fiscal year 2021 the health system spent more than $12 million with minority and women business enterprises a 50% increase from the previous year while all UC Health capital projects had at least 40% inclusion of minority and women-owned subcontractors.

Lofgren highlighted three things as accomplishments during his tenure:

Building ""life-altering"" destination programs offered at UC Health.

Developing an ability to attract and invest in the academic missions that support those programs.

The health system's partnerships it built with the community including its commitment to investments within diverse communities.

But another success he said was UC Health's role in the region's pandemic response.

Lofgren alone was a key local and Ohio leader in the response to COVID-19 leading the team of health officials guiding the response of southern Ohio health systems to COVID-19 and appearing at numerous news conferences on the disease.

But the foundation he helped build at UC Health when it comes to areas of expertise that became particularly prevalent during the pandemic allowed an effective local response to the novel virus he contends.

""The way in which UC Health responded to the pandemic and the importance of the expertise and leadership of our academic health system I think was never more evident than during the pandemic"" he said.

""The things that the people I've been surrounded with have been able to accomplish over the last eight years is humbling.""

During the height of the pandemic Lofgren was appointed by Gov. Mike DeWine as one of three zone leaders to coordinate with the Ohio Department of Health on COVID-19 trends and lead response efforts. Lofgren led zone 3 which comprises 16 counties in its coordination and pandemic response. A new zone 3 will be selected after his departure.

Locally he did everything from providing updates on what was happening at state and local levels to signing off on ventilator requests when the region needed to tap into the state's stock.

""I had to spend some time with him on the phone on Christmas Eve trying to get ventilators down here and he was just great"" said Tiffany Mattingly vice president of clinical strategies for the Health Collaborative the coordinating group for the region's 40 hospitals.

Lofgren was often found updating the public on COVID-19 trends at state and local news conferences. and was involved in many panels as each new variant emerged.

""He was a calming sound confident reliable voice"" Mattingly said. ""He was there when you needed him. He had a great perspective on things. If he had fear in his voice it wasn't heard from us.""

Cultural transformation

Lofgren's interim replacement will be a name familiar to UC Health. Chief Financial Officer Rick Hinds who has been with the health system even before it became UC Health will take over as interim president and chief executive officer. A national search will be conducted to find a permanent president.

Lofgren said he hopes the next president of UC Health focuses on maintaining what his team calls the ""UC Heath Way"" a cultural transformation about how the health care system works and treats patients.

""It's very foundational"" he said.

He highlighted the importance of continuing to attract unique subspecialists who bring skills to the area not seen elsewhere and hopes the region will finally get a National Cancer Institute-designated center.

But the biggest challenge the industry faces as it emerges from the pandemic is workforce shortages something that was subterranean before the pandemic but rose to the surface once COVID-19 began its terror he said.

""We entered into the pandemic really having a nursing shortage"" Lofgren said. ""Even the nurses that come they frequently aren't attracted to bedside. So I think how we further develop the care teams develop the workforce and use technology in a way that augments and supplements their work rather than being a burden is going to be one of the biggest challenges.

""We're going to have to rethink about what the care team looks like because just trying to throw people in the way we've done before isn't going to get it done.""

A capstone

When OU Health called Lofgren seeking to bring what he built in Cincinnati to Oklahoma City Lofgren saw the opportunity as a calling.

""I realized it was an opportunity for me to use my skills and experience and frankly the things I've learned here in Cincinnati to help launch this new program"" he said. ""I really see it as an astounding capstone to my career over the next couple of years.

It will likely be his last landing spot he said adding that his wife jokes he has an expiration date on his back. But one last opportunity to transform an institution was an opportunity too good to pass up.

Lofgren came to UC Health after more than 30 years in academic health care including leadership roles at University Health Systems Consortium University of Kentucky Medical College of Wisconsin and University of Pittsburgh. He was the only physician to serve as president of a health system in Greater Cincinnati throughout his tenure in Ohio.

UC Health – which operates the University of Cincinnati Medical Center West Chester Hospital Daniel Drake Center for Post-Acute Care Lindner Center of Hope and more than 30 outpatient service locations – is one of the 10 largest employers in the Cincinnati region with more than 12000 workers.

During Lofgren's tenure the University of Cincinnati Medical Center in Corryville announced one of the largest expansions in its 200-year history totaling $221 million. In 2019 the hospital committed to spending $110 to double the size of UCMC's emergency department and $40 million to make way for two new parking garages.

He leaves confident that UC Health is in position to catapult itself to ""hit the stratosphere"" but leaving the community itself will be difficult he said.

""I've lived in a number of different communities and one of the things that was absolutely striking to me is that I've never been in a community where the entire community was this committed to making sure that it's a great place to live"" he said. ""People really are here and committed to making Cincinnati a wonderful place to live and raise a family. This community is really committed to itself.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuYWwuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvaHVudHN2aWxsZS9uYW1lL2plcnJ5LWZsZWRkZXJtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzM1MzI2NjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jerry Fledderman Obituary (2022) - Huntsville AL - AL.com (Huntsville),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.al.com/us/obituaries/huntsville/name/jerry-fledderman-obituary?id=33532666 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuYWwuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvaHVudHN2aWxsZS9uYW1lL2plcnJ5LWZsZWRkZXJtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzM1MzI2NjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Pada awal Maret 2014 keduanya mendatangi rumah duka seorang gadis teman sekolah mereka Ade Sara.

Mahasiswi itu ditemukan tak bernyawa di pinggir Tol Bintara Bekasi Jawa Barat pada 5 Maret 2014 atau delapan tahun yang lalu.

Siang itu tidak ada yang tahu bahwa Hafitd dan Assyifa merupakan kunci jawaban teka-teki kematian ini. Sambil menangis orangtua Ade Sara yaitu Suroto dan Elizabeth bertemu keduanya yang datang untuk ""berbelasungkawa"".

Namun bangkai cepat tercium. Elizabeth mendapat pesan dari penyidik yang menangani kasus kematian putri semata wayangnya untuk menahan Hafitd dan Assyifa.

Elizabeth pun berusaha berbincang dengan Assyifa agar dia tidak kabur dari rumah duka.

Elizabeth mengatakan dia berusaha tegar ketika berbincang dengan pembunuh anaknya tersebut. Dalam benak dia mempertanyakan mengapa harus Assyifa teman anaknya sendiri yang menghilangkan nyawa Ade Sara.

""Lalu saya jabat tangan dia saya pegang saya pegang pundaknya sempat saya elus saya berkata sambil gemetar"" ujar Elizabeth dalam tayangan Kompas TV bertajuk ""Satu Meja eps Ade Sara"" pada 14 Maret 2014.

""Sambil bergetar saya bilang 'Assyifa kalau memang kamu pelakunya tante maafkan kamu'. Sampai saya bergetar gitu. Dia ngomong begini 'apa tante ngomong apa?"" ujar Elizabeth.

Penyiksaan 26 jam

Dua hari sebelum jasadnya ditemukan Ade Sara mengalami penyiksaan bertubi-tubi dari teman dan mantan kekasihnya itu. Kepala Resor Bekasi Kota saat itu Kombes Priyo Widiyanto mengatakan penganiayaan terjadi pada rentang waktu Senin pukul 19.00 WIB sampai dengan Selasa (4/3/2014) pukul 23.00 WIB.

""Selama 26 jam mereka melakukan penganiayaan"" ujar Priyo.

Mulanya Assyifa berhasil membujuk Sara untuk bertemu karena ingin diinfokan soal Goethe Institute tempat les bahasa yang korban ikuti.

Kedua perempuan itu pun bertemu pada Senin. Sementara Hafitd menyusul kemudian.

Sara lalu diajak masuk ke mobil KIA Visto milik Hafitd. Mobil itu menjadi tempat penyiksaan Ade Sara. Hafitd menyetrum Ade Sara sebanyak tiga kali.

Assyifa lalu menjambak rambut Ade Sara yang sudah lemas. Ia kemudian menurunkan tubuh Ade ke bawah.

Penganiayaan masih berlanjut. Hafitd dan Assyifa bergantian menganiaya Sara berupa pemukulan penyetruman pencekikan menggunakan tali tas dan penyumpalan mulut korban dengan tisu dan kertas koran.

Hasil visum kemudian mengungkapkan bahwa penyumpalan mulut yang menyebabkan Sara meninggal dunia.

Setelah Sara meninggal Hafitd dan Asyifa tetap menempatkannya di kursi belakang mobil Hafitd.

Mereka berdua membawa jasad itu berkeliling Jakarta dan sekitarnya hingga kemudian membuang jasad Sara di pinggir tol pada Rabu dini hari.

Selama penyelidikan dan persidangan Hafitd dan Assyifa memiliki motif berbeda. Hafitd mengaku sakit hati kepada Sara yang memutuskannya karena alasan perbedaan agama.

Ia semakin geram saat mengetahui Sara kembali berpacaran dengan laki-laki berbeda agama.

Hafitd juga kesal karena Sara enggan bertemu dan berkomunikasi dengannya setelah putus.

Di sisi lain Assyifa mengaku cemburu lantaran Hafitd masih sering menghubungi mantan pacarnya.

Ia pun takut Hafitd kembali berpacaran dengan Sara.

Seumur hidup di penjara

Setelah sekitar empat bulan sidang berlangsung Hafitd dan Assyifa pun dijatuhkan vonis oleh majelis hakim pada sidang putusan Selasa (9/12/2014).

Majelis hakim menjatuhkan hukuman selama 20 tahun bagi sejoli pembunuhan Ade Sara ini.

""Menyatakan terdakwa Assyifa Ramadhani telah terbukti secara sah dan meyakinkan telah melakukan pembunuhan berencana dan menjatuhkan pidana selama 20 tahun"" ujar Ketua Majelis Hakim Absoro di Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat.

Kedua pelaku menangis di pelukan ibu masing-masing yang hadir di sidang putusan. Assyifa bahkan pingsan. Meski begitu keduanya memilih tidak mengajukan banding.

Akan tetapi justru jaksa penuntut umum yang mengajukan banding ke Pengadilan Tinggi (PT) DKI.

Kala itu PT memutuskan memperkuat vonis hakim PN Jakpus sehingga Hafitd dan Assyifa tetap divonis 20 tahun penjara.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubmluZG9uZXNpYS5jb20vb2xhaHJhZ2EvMjAyMjAzMDUxMTQxMjEtMTQyLTc2NzA5Ni9jbGFyZW5jZS1zZWVkb3JmLW1hc3VrLWlzbGFtLWtpcmltLXBlc2FuLWNpbnRhLXVudHVrLWR1bmlh0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25uaW5kb25lc2lhLmNvbS9vbGFocmFnYS8yMDIyMDMwNTExNDEyMS0xNDItNzY3MDk2L2NsYXJlbmNlLXNlZWRvcmYtbWFzdWstaXNsYW0ta2lyaW0tcGVzYW4tY2ludGEtdW50dWstZHVuaWEvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clarence Seedorf Masuk Islam Kirim Pesan Cinta untuk Dunia,"--

Sejatinya bukan merupakan suatu hal buruk ketika seseorang yang dicinta memutuskan suatu hal yang patut didahulukan selain asmara.

Sebut saja perihal pekerjaan atau mungkin beberapa masalah pribadi yang sulit diungkapkan terhadap pacar atau mungkin istri.

Segalanya merupakan suatu hal normal selama pasangan tetap tak melepas komitmennya untuk menganggap Anda adalah orang yang patut dibahagiakan.

Namun hal ini bisa jadi berbeda apabila kasusnya pasangan justru menganggap Anda sema sekali bukanlah prioritas atau malah hanya opsional semata.

Alhasil ada kans hubungan cinta nampaknya akan bergejolak apalagi kemungkinan besar pasangan punya sosok selingkuhan.

Cyberwarfare has been an increasingly contentious aspect of many cyberattacks especially in recent years and this campaign by Russia has been pivotal in shaping the future of IT security in warfare.

In response to the unfortunate situation in Ukraine a new wave of hacking activities has started. In fact the cyber-crime rate has tripled in Ukraine since Russia’s recent interference. Many security-related companies have stepped up their effort to combat this issue.

Furthermore software development companies are getting out of Russia and choosing to conduct business with countries that support Ukrainian cyber-freedom rather than supporting Russian aggression.

Cisco Supporting Ukraine

Due to ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia Cisco along with several other tech companies decided to stand with Ukraine.

On behalf of Oracle’s 150000 employees around the world and in support of both the elected government of Ukraine and for the people of Ukraine Oracle Corporation has already suspended all operations in the Russian Federation. — Oracle (@Oracle) March 2 2022

A couple of weeks ago Cisco Systems made the unfortunate move of terminating its participation in the Russian market. As the CEO of Cisco Systems has informed all staff that they will be shutting down their business operations in Russia.

However Cisco has not justified the reason behind this decision but it clearly depicts that they are taking their stand with Ukraine like other tech companies.

Companies Supporting Ukraine

In this support campaign the companies that are terminating their work in Russia are:-

Apple Inc

Oracle Corp

Boeing

Exxon Mobile Corp.

Walt Disney Co

Google

Microsoft

SAP

Nokia

Intel

AMD

Cisco

Here’s What the CEO of Cisco Stated:-

“Cisco is stopping all business operations in Russia and Belarus and will continue to focus on supporting our Ukrainian employees customers and partners while providing humanitarian aid and accelerating our efforts to protect organizations in Ukraine from cyber threats. We stand with Ukraine and condemn this unjustified war.”

In response to the current situation in Ukraine Vectra AI has announced their support for the cybersecurity community in which they are offering several security services and tools for free:-

Network defense

Cloud security

SaaS apps

Moreover as a security measure several VPN providers are providing free licenses to their all paid products to all Ukrainian citizens.

At least that’s the view of two analysts with Citi who argue that the height of social responsibility at this moment requires putting your investment money into the stocks of companies that make weapons.

“Defending the values of liberal democracies and creating a deterrent which preserves peace and global stability” is so important that weapons makers should be included in funds that carry an E.S.G. or “environmental social and governance” label the two analysts Charles J.

Most recently then Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossello signed Act 60-2019 (“Incentives Act”) into law on July 1 2019 with an effective date of January 1 2020. Chapter 2 of the Incentives Act includes measures to attract individual investors to Puerto Rico by providing many incentives to resident individuals such as full tax exemptions on Puerto Rican-source dividends and on capital gains stemming from the appreciation in value of securities. Further under Chapter 3 of the Incentives Act Puerto Rico implemented changes to entice business entities to move their operations to Puerto Rico by reducing Puerto Rican corporate taxes and providing exemptions from property taxes municipal taxes and taxes on dividend distributions for income generated and property used in exempt operations.

Individuals

While it may make sense from a U.S. federal income tax perspective for high income U.S. taxpayers to consider expatriating from the U.S. many people do not want to give up their citizenship or green card simply to reduce their federal income tax liabilities. Additionally expatriating U.S. citizens are subject to certain immediate tax consequences as a result of the expatriation tax regime. The expatriation rules generally apply to any U.S. citizen who has relinquished his or her citizenship.

Puerto Rico offers a compelling alternative to expatriation. U.S. citizens who become bona fide residents of Puerto Rico can maintain their U.S. citizenship avoid U.S. federal income tax on capital gains including U.S.-source capital gains and avoid paying any income tax on interest and dividends from Puerto Rican sources. The expatriation rules do not apply to U.S. citizens who relocate to Puerto Rico because the relocation by itself does not require any renunciation of U.S. citizenship. Therefore if an individual relocates to Puerto Rico the move does not result in an expatriation tax.

Further U.S. citizens and resident aliens living in Puerto Rico are generally subject to U.S. tax on worldwide income. However a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico for an entire taxable year may exclude income from sources within Puerto Rico for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An individual is considered to be a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico only if he or she satisfies all of the following three conditions: (1) physical presence test (2) tax home test and (3) closer connection test. A special rule applies for the year of the move.

The taxpayer moving to Puerto Rico is required to file Form 8898 with the IRS and file Form 1040 for the year of move. Form 8898 requires the taxpayer to provide information concerning compliance with the above requirements.

Further Chapter 2 of the Incentives Act offers tax incentives to individuals who relocate to Puerto Rico. For an individual to qualify under Chapter 2 of the Incentives Act he or she must be considered a resident individual investor (“Resident Individual”). A Resident Individual is defined as a person who is domiciled in Puerto Rico by having a physical presence in Puerto Rico for at least 183 days during the taxable year and has not been a resident of Puerto Rico for the ten years prior to January 1 2020. Further Resident Individuals must apply for and obtain a tax exemption decree under Act 60. To obtain access to the approved and signed tax exemption decree a one-time fee of $5000 must be satisfied and deposited into a special fund to promote the relocation of Resident Individuals to Puerto Rico. Further all Resident Individuals that hold a Tax Exemption Decree must comply with an annual contribution of $10000 to a duly organized and registered nonprofit organization in Puerto Rico. Lastly a Resident Individual must purchase residential property in Puerto Rico within the first two years after obtaining the decree.

If a Resident Individual qualifies for the tax benefits under Chapter 2 of the Incentives Act the individual is eligible to receive a 100% tax exemption from Puerto Rican income taxes on all dividends and interest. Further a Resident Individual would receive Puerto Rico income tax exemptions on capital gains stemming from the sale or exchange of securities that appreciated in value after the individual establishes domicile in Puerto Rico. Thus gains realized from securities acquired after establishing domicile in Puerto Rico are exempt from Puerto Rico income tax. However U.S. investors need to appreciate that capital gains derived from securities acquired prior to the individual becoming a Resident Individual are exempt only to the extent that the gain is attributable to the increase in value of the securities after the individual is domiciled in Puerto Rico. The portion of the gain attributable to the increase in value of the securities prior to establishing domicile in Puerto Rico is subject to the applicable Puerto Rico capital gains tax rate but if such gain is recognized after ten years from the date that the individual becomes domiciled in Puerto Rico the Resident Individual benefits from a tax rate reduced to 5%.

Of special note on January 27 2021 the Large Business and International Division of the IRS announced that it had opened an audit campaign addressing taxpayers who have claimed Puerto Rico tax benefits without meeting the bona fide resident requirements. For example according to the IRS these individuals may be excluding income subject to U.S. tax on a filed U.S. income tax return or failing to file and report income subject to U.S. tax. This campaign will also address those individuals who have met the bona fide resident requirements but may be erroneously reporting U.S.-source income as Puerto Rico-source income in order to avoid U.S. taxation. Thus taxpayers moving to Puerto Rico will need to maintain the appropriate recordkeeping and obtain appropriate tax advice in view of anticipated heightened IRS scrutiny.

Businesses

Chapter 3 of the Incentives Act is meant to act as a facilitator to develop Puerto Rico as an international export service and commerce center. Under Chapter 3 business owners who establish qualifying businesses in Puerto Rico can enjoy significant tax benefits such as reduced Puerto Rican corporate taxes and exemptions from property taxes municipal taxes and taxes on dividend distributions for income generated and property used in the exempt operations

Chapter 3 of the Incentives Act applies to businesses that maintain a bona fide office or establishment in Puerto Rico and conduct eligible services for export or promoter services. An export service provider includes businesses that are engaged in among other business areas: (1) research and development; (2) advertising and public relations; (3) economic environmental technological scientific managerial marketing human resources computer and auditing consulting services; (4) “creative industries” including income related to the broadcasting or the sale of copyrights for a recording intended for audiences outside of Puerto Rico; (5) drafting of construction plans and engineering architectural and project management services; (6) professional services; (7) centralized management services including but not limited to strategic direction planning distribution logistics and budgetary services; (8) electronic data processing centers; (9) computer software development; (10) distribution whether it is physical online through the cloud or related to blockchain technology and the income earned from the licensing program subscriptions or services fees; (11) voice video audio and data telecommunications between persons located outside Puerto Rico; (12) call centers; (13) shared service centers; (14) educational and training services; (15) hospital and laboratory services including medical tourism and telemedicine sites; and (16) investment banking and other financial services.

If a service for export business qualifies for the tax benefits under Chapter 3 of the Incentives Act the net income stemming from the business is subject to a 4% Puerto Rican corporate tax. Further distributions from earnings and profits is not subject to Puerto Rican income tax.

Two years ago the wipes industry was challenged with extraordinary demand for disinfecting products due to the Covid-19 pandemic and this surge led to a global increase in capacity by manufacturers of wipes and the materials that make them. Today as restrictions have eased with schools offices and travel opening up and the general public becoming less worried about the risk of infection demand for disinfecting products including wipes has leveled off.Michael Wettstein VP Sales Kleen Test Products  a manufacturer of wipes says that after over 18 months of high demand the household wipes market has softened. “This softness in the market is primarily driven by the high inventories that currently exist throughout the retail landscape as retailers and distributors stocked up heavily to meet the immediate demand. As we all learned more about the transmission of Covid-19 and consumers became less concerned about the risk of being infected by Covid-19 due to surface contact consumer demand for household cleaning wipes slowed.”After consumers couldn’t find product on the shelf two years ago the scenario has changed drastically says Brian Sansoni senior vice president Communications Outreach & Membership American Cleaning Institute (ACI) . “Today products are readily available. People are not locked up in their homes anymore; they were cleaning more at home. Now comparatively they’re out and about: they’re traveling they’re dining in restaurants. The cleaning occasions aren’t as proficient as they were when we were all at home. So compared to where we were the demand isn’t as high.”People are still buying wipes but just not at that unbelievable level that they were in 2020. “I think everyone knew that was eventually going to happen” he adds.An American Cleaning Institute survey that was conducted in February 2022 by the research firm Ipsos found that 78% of respondents have disinfecting sprays or wipes in their homes. Meanwhile 88% of those surveyed said that disinfecting frequently touched surfaces is important to them in helping prevent the spread of illness in their home. “Clearly people still recognize that they need to regularly clean and disinfect in their homes” Sansoni says.Right now the industry is dedicated to still making sure cleaning and hygiene remain front and center in consumers’ daily lives. The focus now is on what ACI calls smart targeted hygiene: using the right product in the right way at the right time. “That’s why cleaning and disinfecting wipes are still so valued in millions of households on a weekly basis” he adds.According to market research firm Euromonitor International  in 2021 globally interest in household disinfecting wipes flagged considerably due in large part to vaccination progress and a commensurate softening of consumer cleaning intensity out of pandemic fatigue. “However per capita/household consumption over the next five years is expected to remain above pre-pandemic norms due to enduring health vigilance and cleaning practices” says Liying Qian senior analyst at Euromonitor International.This is indicated in Euromonitor’s consumer surveys as well. In North America for example 70% and 58% consumer respondents said they expect more frequent hand washing and frequent disinfecting of common surfaces respectively to be permanent changes in consumer behavior post-pandemic according to Euromonitor’s Consumer Health Voice of the Consumer survey fielded in April 2021.Even with the current slowdown in the market Kleen Test Products still expects growth in the wipes category. “Despite the popularity of wipes there are still consumers who currently use traditional cleaning products some or all of the time” Wettstein says.The company anticipates growth within the wipes market will come from these customers transitioning from other cleaning products to wipes for more of their cleaning needs. Additionally new and innovative wipes products entering the market will generate growth. “As household cleaning wipes manufacturers continue to increase the efficacy of the solutions and pair those solutions with the appropriate fabrics more and more consumers will change from traditional cleaning products to wipes as the cleaning performance will meet their needs in a much more convenient format than using a spray liquid and a towel” he adds.Ernesto Levy chief growth officer at Radienz Living  a North American manufacturer of home and personal care products says consumer desire for clean and healthy homes will continue to drive growth in the category. “Furthermore the normalization of working from home or hybrid work arrangements will further drive the desire for home environments that foster peace of mind.” Rockline Industries  one of the major wipes manufacturers in North America is confident the wipes market will continue to grow. In fact the company announced major investments during the pandemic to keep up with the increased demand for wipes. A $20 million disinfecting wipe production line installed in Sheboygan WI nearly doubled the company’s production capacity. The company also spent more than $18 million on the installation of additional production lines at its three Arkansas-based wet wipes manufacturing facilities The new equipment includes high capacity wet wipe production lines in Rockline’s 370000-square-foot facility in Springdale its 240000-square-foot facility in Russellville and its 1.2 million-square-foot facility in Booneville.The investments in its Wisconsin and Arkansas operations are now fully operational. “Continual reinvestment in our business is a core value at Rockline so we are perpetually investing in our growth” says Christopher Dresselhuys business director North American Retail Products Rockline.Rockline fully expects the home care wipes market to continue growing in the coming years fueled by the organic forces that have always existed according to Dresselhuys. “In particular factors such as permanent hybrid or full work-from-home employment scenarios mean people are spending more time in their home environments and that is leading to increased cleaning activity. The pandemic has also increased people’s awareness and sensitivity to how sanitary their personal environments are and keeping those environments as clean as reasonably possible is now seen as an important part of maintaining their personal wellness routines.”Despite consumers opting for any cleaning product and disinfectant they could get their hands’ on early on in the pandemic environmental sustainability has remained at the forefront for the wipes industry supply chain. Driving this is global anti-plastics legislation and consumers’ growing desire for environmentally friendly alternatives. Manufacturers have been working hard to make greener products by increasing the use of plant-based fibers in wipes substrates reducing the amount of plastic packaging used and/or using recycled materials as well as developing more plant-based cleaning formulas.In February The Albaad Group  a global manufacturer of nonwovens and wet wipes confirmed it was committed to the sustainability trend in wipes when it announced it would invest around €50 million in expanding and improving its environmentally friendly nonwoven production line. The line will produce a sustainable fabric that will be made entirely from natural fibers and will be biodegradable fully flushable and plastic-free.“As one of the world’s largest producers of wet wipes and nonwovens we at Albaad understand and embrace the importance of innovation as an engine that drives growth and we are committed to delivering eco-friendly products of the highest quality in order to create a better world for us to live in” says Albaad CEO Dan Mesika.The company expects to launch the new nonwoven line in 2023.As wipes continue to be a norm in consumers’ cleaning routine Qian of Euromonitor says the amount of plastic waste they generate and the harmful chemicals they contain become a growing concern. “Consumers are embracing ingredients and formulas associated with both physical and environmental well-being to elevate perceptions of more holistic propositions. Ingredient-led improvements and narratives help bring credibility transparency and education around safety and sustainability. More companies are beefing up a proposition that embodies personal and planetary health to meet demand for purpose-driven credentials.“That being said” she continues “sustainability is important to a limit if we take into account pricing and other consumer priorities. For example when asked what product features consumers are willing to spend more for sustainable features are ranked behind quality performance claims (e.g. stain removing) and value for money according to Euromonitor’s Voice of the Consumer Lifestyles survey fielded in January and February 2022. In other words sustainability is better valued when paired with high quality and efficacy” she says.Likewise ACI’s National Cleaning Survey shows product effectiveness is still the most important attribute for consumers in choosing cleaning products.According to Sansoni ACI’s member companies wipes manufacturers included are putting a premium on developing innovative and sustainable products to meet growing consumer demands. “What this shows us is that ACI member companies are working to create products that are sustainable and effective.”For its part Rockline continues to work diligently to improve the sustainability of its products. “Consumers continue to demand that the products do their job cleaning effectively and efficiently but still demand sustainability where possible” Dresselhuys says.Rockline achieves this by taking an “all of the above” approach in its sustainability related efforts. The company is exploring optimally sustainable materials material reductions and operational improvements as well as ensuring its suppliers are complying with sustainability standards.Similarly Kleen Test’s efforts start at the early stages of product development as its technical teams work with its customers and suppliers to focus on providing sustainable formulas and packaging materials.“Kleen Test continues to identify new suppliers and materials that meet the needs of a market that is looking for more sustainable options” Wettstein says. “Despite the headwinds caused by the current excess supply in the retail and distributor network growing inflation and the fear of recession there is still a continued focus and interest in improving the sustainability of cleaning products.”For Radienz Living virtually all of its offerings have an eco-friendly alternative to them – whether it’s formulas packaging or substrate according to Levy. Radienz offers a canister that uses 23% less plastic flatpack wipes that offer portability with less plastic use and it uses substrates that are 100% plant-based. Additionally disinfecting using the company’s exclusive Citric Acid based disinfecting formula delivers the same germ kill claims without harsh chemical worries.For major wet wipes manufacturer Nice-Pak  the company’s environmental initiatives span the entire life cycle of its products including increasing the use of sustainable wipe fibers reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its operations and promoting sustainable forestry according to John Iarocci vice president of R&D and Quality at Nice-Pak. “We support healthy forests in our supply chain by prioritizing the use of cellulosic fibers sourced from environmentally managed forests” he says.Nice-Pak has also made a commitment to use 100% certified fiber in its flagship Nice ‘N CLEAN brand by the end of 2025.On the formulation side Mike Lyons VP of business development and general manager Brands Nice-Pak says it’s clear that consumers are looking for less chemicals. Early next year the company will be introducing Nice ’N CLEAN Kitchen Sanitizer a sanitizing wipe that kills 99.9% of common household bacteria including Covid-19 but leaves no harsh chemical residue – so it’s good for use on surfaces around kids and pets.The two biggest brand names in wipes Lysol and Clorox  are also innovating in the eco-friendly space.Although Clorox halted production of its Compostable Cleaning Wipes which it launched in January 2020 during the early part of the pandemic to prioritize the manufacture of products that could be manufactured quicker production has since resumed and the company expects compostable wipes to become a large portion of its portfolio in the future.In fact in partnership with Meredith Corporation’s Real Simple last year Clorox launched the Real Simple Cleaning Collection  a new line of EPA Safer Choice Certified products. The debut items in this line of natural cleaning products include an All-Purpose Cleaner spray and Compostable Wipes.Both the Real Simple All-Purpose Cleaner and Compostable Wipes are formulated without parabens dyes and other harsh chemicals and are safe for use on hard non-porous surfaces including granite tile and stainless steel. The All-Purpose Cleaner spray made using renewable energy features a 99.9% biobased formula and the Compostable Wipes can be composted when users are done. Both products are available in two scents: Sweet Orange & Basil and Cherry Blossom & Rose.Meanwhile Reckitt recently launched Lysol Disinfecting Wipes Made From 100% Plant-Based Fibers which are formulated to kill 99.9% of viruses and bacteria on surfaces around the home. The plastic-free wipe is made from 100% plant-based fibers and comes in a recyclable canister. Like other Lysol disinfecting wipes Lysol Disinfecting Wipes Made From 100% Plant-Based Fibers clean and disinfect most household hard non-porous surfaces and kill the Covid-19 virus in 30 seconds.Lysol Disinfecting Wipes Made From 100% Plant-Based Fibers is available in a Fresh Citrus scent and comes in 30-count and 70-count packages.Meanwhile a new brand— Biom­ —marrying the power of good design with functionality to bring sustainable innovation to everyday wipes is looking to clean up what it calls a “horribly wasteful industry.”Biom set out to reimagine the way that consumers interact with wipes by developing an aesthetically pleasing and eco-friendly refillable dispenser that minimizes plastic waste.“We are eliminating single-use plastics to the maximum extent and providing safer solutions that are kind to both humans and the environment while still maintaining efficacy for the task at hand” says Will Gahagan the company’s CEO and co-founder.The company’s patented refillable dispenser allows for optimal results—one fresh wipe is guaranteed during each use. The dispenser is available in Sea Foam Black White and Hunter Green color options.“The pandemic has driven a 150% increase in the use of disinfectant wipes” says Gahagan. “Consumers are seeking out these types of products now more than ever but are unaware of the harm they cause to both themselves and the environment which is what inspired my co-founder Hank [Schellenger] and I to create biom. The industry has long lacked innovation and the consumer demand for change is certainly present—before our website even launched we had an impressive waitlist.”While developing the wipes Gahagan and Schellenger evaluated viscose bamboo viscose 40% hemp and 60% viscose and cotton. “The 100% viscose is able to be produced using less water than the other options which we liked” says Gahagan. “We also found the substrate to perform better than the other options as a scrubber. The hemp/viscose was interesting as it had the strongest absorption but the feel was a bit rougher which we received some negative feedback on.”Biom ultimately chose a viscose substrate with a lower GSM (40%) than most other cleaning and hand wipes found on the market which reduces the amount of material used and also allows the wipes to break down faster. According to Gahagan biom wipes were tested and broke down in 14 days in aerobic conditions and 28 days in anaerobic conditions. They are also home compostable unlike many other wipes which advertise as being compostable but require access to a local compost facility.Biom’s Sanitizing and All-Purpose Wipes contain all-natural scents derived from essential oils with no synthetic fragrances. All wipe fibers are extracted from sustainably grown wood using a unique closed-loop system which recovers and re-uses solvents minimizing the environmental impact of production. Biom’s wipes are gentle on the skin with efficient moisture management and a high tenacity profile. To eliminate the single-use tube that many wipes are available in biom’s packaging is made from 75% post-consumer recycled material and is #1 (PET) using a flow wrap machine to reduce plastic waste by +85%.“We craft all of our wipes with the consumer and planet in mind” Gahagan says. “As it relates to formulations we operate under the mantra ‘less is more’ and we look to strip away all ingredients which are not necessary. We chose to produce an all-purpose cleaner and a sanitizing line as we are big believers that not all bacteria is bad bacteria and in the wake of Covid we were concerned that everyone was going a bit crazy disinfecting everything. Thus we went forward with a skin friendly germ killer and a more gentle cleaner with a mild soap (all purpose).”In the sanitizing line biom uses 65% alcohol as the active (organic derived from sugar beets) in the formulation. “We chose alcohol as it is effective against 99.9% of bacteria safe to use on skin—we add a dash of aloe to prevent hands from drying out—and also effective on surfaces like keyboards doorknobs phones and other bacteria prone areas. Alcohol is a great solution as it does not require washing a surface with water after use (like most other disinfectants).”Biom’s All-Purpose wipes are ideal for more regular cleanups and are effective at covering larger surfaces. They are made with a vegetable-derived surfactant which is a mild soap that is safe on humans pets and surfaces.Biom’s All-Purpose and Sanitizing Starter Kits are available from $39 which includes a refillable dispenser and two wipe refills. The brand’s plant-based Sanitizing Wipes are available in Eucalyptus Chill and Bergamot Bloom scents while the All-Purpose Cleaning Wipes are available in Lavender Ease and Grapefruit Zest scents.",,,,,,,,,

Lumber prices are continuing to surge amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and traders could soon see even bigger price swings.

Futures have been on a wild ride since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and they soared to a record high of $1711 per thousand board feet last May. After tumbling through the spring and summer they have been rebounding and got a fresh jolt from Russia's war. Since Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine prices have jumped 14% to $1452 putting them just 15% below the all-time peak.

The war in Ukraine has ""just aggravated the bull market we have in commodities"" said David Russell VP of market intelligence at online broker-dealer TradeStation. ""With the bull market in commodities like oil and a lot of metals that we've been seeing that only gives extra support to something like lumber.""

Western sanctions in response to the invasion are hammering Russia's economy and political pressure is building up for more. US Rep. Victoria Spartz a Ukraine-born Republican lawmaker from Indiana told Fox Business that the West should target Russia's markets for lumber and energy to stop its attacks.

Such sanctions could rattle lumber prices further. Russia is the largest lumber exporter in the world and its forest-product exports were worth more than $12 billion last year said trade journal Canadian Forest Industries which cited data from Wood Resource Quarterly.

Even before the war began lumber prices were volatile. In January they fell 15%. Since February 1 they've soared 55%. Just prior to Russia launching attacks on Ukraine February 24 a report from the Wall Street Journal noted prices of leading lumber futures were so wild that they ended at daily limits in 25 of 35 trading sessions this year.

And starting Monday price swings will have more room to run. Exchange operator CME Group is widening lumber's daily trading limits by 90% beginning March 7. That means the maximum daily up or down move will be $57 per thousand board feet and $86 per thousand board feet the following day if prices close at the aforementioned limit the operator said.

De-escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war may not offer much price relief either as several factors have been applying upward pressure. The US housing shortage and a continuing focus on home improvement are keeping demand high. And flooding in the key lumber hub of British Columbia last year has kept distribution snarled and supply chains constrained.

Even so the fact that lumber prices remain below all-time highs amid the geopolitical crisis could signal a move to an ""equilibrium"" Russell said.

""I think that the actual frenzied surge we saw in lumber already happened"" he said.",,,,,,,,,

LONDON: Russia's escalating war in Ukraine has sent commodity and energy prices soaring boosted safe havens and hammered Europe's common currency and its stock markets.Below are six charts showing the recent dramatic market moves:The euro fell below $1.10 on Friday for the first time in almost two years having shed over 3% against the dollar this week for its biggest weekly fall since March 2020.The single currency was nursing even bigger losses against the Swiss franc. It is down almost 4% over the week in its biggest such fall since January 2015 when Switzerland abandoned the franc's three-year-old cap against the euro.Worries that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will deal the economy a fresh blow especially as energy prices soar explain why the currency is one of the week's biggest losers.Prices of raw materials from wheat to various metals have soared to multi-year highs as Western sanctions have disrupted air and sea shipments of commodities produced and exported by Russia.Russia and Ukraine are two of the world's biggest exporters of wheat which scaled a 14-year peak on Friday having gained nearly 40% since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.Russia is also a supplier of metals. Aluminium hit a record high on Friday while copper where the country supplies 3.5% of world supplies was also flirting with a fresh all-time peak.Brent crude prices rose another 21% over the week closing at their highest since 2013 with buyers and shippers increasingly shunning Russian oil supplies which total up to five million barrels per day (bpd).Neither the possibility of a million bpd of Iranian crude coming on tap in case of a revived nuclear deal with the West nor developed countries' deal for a coordinated release of 60 million barrels made a dent.European gas prices notched an astonishing 120% weekly gain  to hit 208 euros per megawatt hour -- a record high.European banks had another gruelling week hit by a triple whammy of Western sanctions on Russia a scaling back of rate hike expectations and a worsening macroeconomic environment.The moves reverse all the gains made earlier this year when it appeared that economic recovery would allow central banks to raise interest rates benefiting banks.A European banking stocks index fell around 16% its worst week since March 2020 bringing year-to-date losses to 20%. Shares in Russia-exposed lenders such as Austria's Raiffeisen and France's SocGen fell around a third over the week.Turmoil in European markets heightened uncertainty over the economic outlook and a scaling back of rate-hike bets meant investors were keen to snap up safe-haven bonds.In Germany -- the euro area's benchmark bond issuer -- 10-year bond yields fell 30 bps this week in their biggest one-week fall since the euro debt crisis in 2011.At -0.08% German Bund yields are back in negative yield territory.

teaches biological sciences at Krea University . Speaking to Saranathan outlines his discovery of single cell gyroids in bird feathers — and why this could transform technology:I’ve trained as a physicist but I was always deeply interested in birds. When applying to graduate school at Yale  I wanted to continue my interest in birds alongside researching physics. So I became a biomedical engineer working on bird colour. For my PhD I studied how birds make the colour blue. This contains cyanine prevalent in plant tissue. Animals also sport blue but they have created an entirely new way of making this — theirs is a structural colour where the physical infraction of light gets scattered by different interfaces. The portion of the visible light that falls on these structures is reinforced and reflected while everything else is not.These colour-producing and scattering nanostructures are microscopic about 500 times smaller than the width of a human hair. These can be arranged periodically or randomly with a hidden order that makes blue look the same whichever direction you see it from. Consider a laptop TV or phone. You’d want the same information from these whether you tilt your head this way or that.Single cell gyroid structures (R) give the pitta bird its intense blue colouration. Photo courtesy: V. Saranathan Macaulay Library Cornell Lab of OrnithologyHowever in fact there is only a narrow angle where you can actually see the screen with high fidelity. With birds like blue jays though no matter where you tilt your head you get back the same information the same colour through a perfect quasi-random reflector which makes light bounce back. I’ve also researched butterflies with a vivid green on their wings. If you gently touch one you’ll find a glitter-like substance on your fingers. These glittering entities are single scale cells. As I discovered each has a unique structure called a gyroid a crystal like a building block. A single unit is the gyroid where three channels come together fuse and gyrate away.Imagine a cube now — a division makes the cubic material into two equal surfaces. That is a gyroid surface which is an efficient way to increase surface area. But in the case of birds these surfaces are filled in on one side with keratin the other side being air — with this arrangement you get a single gyroid crystal which is actually really hard to synthesize. Somehow birds evolved to make this structure in their feathers light interacting with these to create a vivid blue — my research found that over time the female preference for pure blue in mates led to this unique ordered structure.A single gyroid has superior optical powers. It interacts very well with light and electrons — if we design photovoltaic cells with such single gyroid crystal symmetry these can extremely efficiently transform solar energy into electrical energy. In fibre optics too a cladding on fibre opticals using this structure ensures light won’t escape and losses are minimised. Making these structures is extremely hard but the birds offer us a template. My eventual goal is biomimetics where we understand exactly how birds grow these structures — if we can copy this that will be transformative for human technology.: Birds have crystalline structures in their feathers which make certain light or colour reflect back to our eyes their feathers never fading. Picture by: Vinod SaranathanI’ve researched many birds to understand the single gyroid structure in their feathers. Some really surprised me — the South American paradise tanager has red and blue on its back its head a bright green its throat violet and its belly an electric blue. Pitta or navrang birds in India are named thus because of the colours they sport. Produced by this structural colouration these are surreal in vibrance — but their physics is as fascinating as their beauty.",,,,,,,,,

Calls have been mounting for a boycott of McDonald’s Coca-Cola and PepsiCo as the companies have thus far not joined the ranks of other major global firms in pulling their operations out of Russia.

Three Ukrainian supermarket chains announced they are removing Coca-Cola products from their store shelves and the hashtags #BoycottCocaCola #BoycottPepsi and #BoycottMcDonalds were trending on Twitter over the weekend as customers vowed to shun their products so long as they continue to do business with Russia.

Dozens of big corporations including Apple and Netflix have halted operations in the country in the 10 days since President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine.

But while many firms have taken a stand several food and drink companies have stayed silent and refused to cut ties with Russia.

Major players including McDonald’s Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are now coming under increasing pressure from both political figures and social media users to pull their business from the country.

Ukrainian supermarket chain Novus said on Friday that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products – including Coca-Cola Fanta Schweppes and BonAqua mineral water – slamming the company as “shameless” for continuing to “work for the invaders in full strength”.

“Our supermarket chain no longer cooperates with the Coca-Cola company which continues to operate in the territory of the aggressor” the company said in a Facebook post.

“We are abandoning all products belonging to the brand.”

Supermarket chain Fozzy Group also said it was pulling products from shelves and stopping all future deliveries.

“From today we are removing all products from the shelves of Silpo Fora FOZZY Cash&Carry Market super Thrash (Thrash) stores and stop all future deliveries” the company said according to Interfax-Ukraine.

Varus also joined in the boycott citing the “official position of the Coca-Cola company to continue its activities in the market of the aggressor country”.

The boycott came after Russian state-owned media source TASS reported on Thursday that the company had pledged to keep business open in the country.

A spokesperson for Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company – the bottling company that has exclusive rights to distributing its products in Russia and other countries – allegedly told the outlet that “all operational production and logistics facilities of Coca-Cola in Russia are working”.

“We are fully responsible to partners society and thousands of our employees in Russia. Our top priority is the safety of our employees” the spokesperson reportedly said.

The Coca-Cola Company has not denied the statement.

On Thursday the company released a statement saying it was donating €1m to support the Red Cross movement in Ukraine as well as donations to Red Cross organizations in the neighboring nations of Romania Hungary Slovakia and Poland.

“While these are our actions today we will continue to monitor the situation closely” the company said.

The company did not mention Russia in the statement and called for “peace in the region”.

Meanwhile neither McDonald’s nor PepsiCo have released statements on Russia’s war on Ukraine.

New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli sent a letter to several major companies including McDonald’s and PepsiCo on Friday calling on them to halt operations in Russia.

He warned the companies that they face “significant and growing legal compliance operational human rights and personnel and reputational risks” by continuing to do business in the country.

A boycott from them would play a major role in “condemning Russia’s role in fundamentally undermining the international order” he wrote according to Reuters.

The letter was also sent to other major businesses including beauty giants Estee Lauder Cosmetics and Coty confectionery giant Mondelez and FMCG company Kimberly-Clark.

McDonalds has 847 restaurants in Russia with the country accounting for around 9 per cent of its total revenues according to the company’s website.

For PepsiCo Russia made up around 4 per cent of its global revenues last year with the company claiming to be the largest food and beverage manufacturer in the country.

(NEXSTAR) — Beverage giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are facing harsh criticism Friday after news of both companies’ continued operations in Russia amid the invasion of Ukraine. The attention led both #BoycottCocaCola and #BoycottPepsi to trend on Twitter Friday with many swearing off products from both.

Pressure to pull business from Russia comes after numerous governments and businesses implemented a cascade of economic consequences following the unprovoked attack on Ukraine that began Feb. 24.

The Economist correspondent Oliver Carroll reported Friday that Ukrainian supermarkets Novus and Silpo are boycotting Coca-Cola for the time being. Reuters explains both beverage companies have around 4% revenue exposure in Russia. Pepsi also has two production plants in the country.

Attorney and legal commentator Tristan Snell tweeted Friday: “Coke AND Pepsi are still doing business in Russia. I won’t buy ANY of either company’s products until they halt operations in Russia and stop supporting Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine.” Political personality Majid M. Padellan said “Coca-Cola appears to have decided its profits are more important than the lives of Ukrainians.”

The United Nations says one million Ukraine residents have fled the country. UN reports at least 227 civilians have died and at least 525 people were wounded.

Coca-Cola and PepsiCo did not immediately respond to request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL21pbmQtYm9keS9kaWQtY29jYS1jb2xhLWNvbnRhaW4tY29jYWluZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Coca-Cola contain cocaine? An anthropologist reveals the complicated truth,"That Coca-Cola contains cocaine is a popular middle school rumor and it’s not completely unfounded.

Even its nickname Coke hints at this secret ingredient. The answer is a little more complicated than expected.

Was/Is there cocaine in Coca-Cola?

Cocaine — as in the white powdered substance — was never part of the original recipe and is not used in Coca-Cola today. The drug is a highly concentrated substance However the soda gets the first part of its name from the coca leaf from which cocaine is derived. Coca-Cola once contained coca leaf extract. This extract is called ecgonine a substance that resembles cocaine but is less processed. There is no coca in Coca-Cola today and the soda has been coca-free since 1929.

The other part of its name cola comes from the kola nut which grows in West Africa and contains caffeine. Coca in its raw form is also a stimulant so between these two ingredients it was a potent beverage.

Coca leaves can be brewed into a tea to treat altitude sickness. Shutterstock

Where does coca come from?

Coca leaves grow in western South America and they’ve been around far longer than Coca-Cola. Coca was precious to native Andean peoples like the Wari Tiwanaku and Inca according to paleoethnobotanist Matthew Biwer a professor at Dickinson College.

The earliest known evidence of coca dates back to 6000 B.C.E. Biwer says on coastal Peru in the Nanchoc Valley. Archaeologists started finding it in earnest in specimens that date back between 800 and 3600 B.C.E. in the region. The plant traditionally consumed as a wad stuck between the lip and the gums had recreational and ritualistic connotations. As archaeologists began finding more evidence and depictions of coca they noticed images of people with a wad protruding from their cheek — a coca wad. It’s still used to this day and not just for making cocaine.

“It's kind of like having your coffee in the morning with many people” Biwer says. He even likens the feeling of chewing these leaves to having a strong cup of coffee. Chewing coca leaves doesn’t produce nearly the same effect of snorting pure cocaine. “It's not a mind altering hallucinogenic effect. When you're just chewing the coca it's more of a mild subdued pleasant effect.”

It’s also used to make offerings. Biwer recalls witnessing rituals in which coca leaves are presented or burned for nature deities.

He says that the amount of cocaine that could come from a dose of coca is “negligible.” While it might show up on a drug test it certainly won’t keep you going for a three-day bender.

Back in Pemberton’s day substances like coca and opium were common ingredients because they were feel-good compounds whose life-threatening effects remained unknown. Coca and cocaine are anesthetics in addition to stimulants. Doctors used them as anesthesia while operating. Even pharmaceutical companies were marketing it — until patients started dying from accidental overdoses. Pemberton came from a point in history when men hawked a lot of snake oil claiming its curative properties and before Coca-Cola was just a soda it was sold as medicine.

Coca still is used medicinally. Tourists who travel to the Andes are advised to take coca tea to quell altitude sickness. It also soothes the stomach and suppresses the appetite.

Have other drugs been used in food?

Almost definitely not in the same way coca was used in Coca-Cola. (Your cousin’s pot brownies don’t count.)

But there’s a rich tense history of drugs vacillating between medicinal and deviant status even to this day. Just as opiates and coca were once considered legitimate medical drugs now Western medicine has started to turn its attention back to LSD psilocybin and ketamine.

So there was never technically any cocaine in Coca-Cola — just the extract of the plant that makes it. But Coca-Cola as a sugar drink whose original namesake components came from South America and West Africa is far more than the all-American drink we see it as.

Many customers vowed not to use the products for as long as they continued to do business with Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.

Multiple other brands such as Apple and Netflix have stopped operations in the country after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a military assault in Ukraine just 10 days ago.

Still many food and drink companies have stayed silent on the issue and are continuing to do business with Russia.

But now increased pressure on McDonald’s Coca-Cola and PepsiCo from both political figures and social media users has caused the brands to come under fire.

So far three Ukrainian supermarket chains have already announced they will be pulling Coca-Cola products from the shelves.

Supermarket chain Novus said on Friday that Coca-Cola products such as Coca-Cola Fanta Schweppes and BonAqua mineral water will no longer be sold adding that it was “seamless” for the company to continue working for “the invaders in full strength.”

“Our supermarket chain no longer cooperates with the Coca-Cola company which continues to operate in the territory of the aggressor” Novus said in a statement on Facebook.

“We are abandoning all products belonging to the brand.”

Another chain called Fozzy Group announced that it would also be pulling products from shelves.

“From today we are removing all products from the shelves of Silpo Fora FOZZY Cash&Carry Market super Thrash (Thrash) stores and stop all future deliveries” the company said.

In a letter on Friday New York state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli urged companies to think about their Russian business dealings as they face “significant growing legal compliance operational human rights and personnel and repetitional risks Reuters reported.

DiNapoli added that suspending or ending business in Russia “would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market.

It would also play a part in “condemning Russia’s role in fundamentally undermining the international order” he said.

Ikea Spotify and Nike are some of the major companies that have recently severed ties with Russia. Retail brands such as Publix and Kroger removed Russian vodka from store shelves.

Similar to DiNapoli’s actions British politician John Mann tweeted: “If McDonald’s and Starbucks continue to sell in Russia then an international boycott of their products should be instigated.”

On social media people have been less kind to the franchises.

“I will boycott MacDonalds [sic] until you stop doing business with war criminal Russia” wrote one Twitter user.

“Guess who is doing business as normal in #Russia no surprise #BoycottMcDonalds” wrote another user with a photo of a Russian McDonald’s.

“Come on. boycott Macdonalds” tweeted another user in response. “Can we all sacrifice burgers to avoid sacrifice of Ukrainian people?”

The Sun has reached out to McDonald's and Coca-Cola for comment but has yet to receive a response.

It was ... a sticky situation. On Saturday morning a semi truck carrying thousands of Coca-Cola products was involved in a collision on Interstate 10 in Pomona California CBS2 Los Angeles reports. The impact caused the vehicle to tip over with its cargo which spilled on the highway and its driver was trapped in the cabin. Fortunately respondents managed to rescue the driver who reportedly suffered minor injuries. The person who collided with the truck was reportedly uninjured as well.

However the road surface was covered with Dr. Pepper and other soft drinks for hours CBS2 Los Angeles also reports. The mess was so bad that authorities had to narrow the freeway from 10 lanes to two which backed traffic up by at least an hour. To get a real sense of the scale though one should look at the time frame of the incident and the clean up. The collision occurred just before 6 a.m. KNX News reports and the freeway only resumed full capacity at 1:50 p.m."

Krack was an engineer at Sauber when their partnership with BMW began with a sudden increase in financial resources becoming available to them as they looked to compete at the front of the field.

Aston Martin took over from Racing Point last season with a significant investment coming in from team owner Lawrence Stroll in his quest to create a race-winning environment with ‘Team Silverstone’.

The team has traditionally punched above its weight in Formula 1 but around 200 more members of staff have been recruited and a new and improved factory is being constructed as they look to become championship contenders within the next few years.

What a send-off! We'll take good care of him @BMWMotorsport. Let's get to work Mike. 💚 pic.twitter.com/UkOt7ysFk3 — Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team (@AstonMartinF1) March 4 2022

Former BMW motorsport boss Krack was describing what attracted him to the team during the process of him becoming team principal and he said he feels “extremely privileged” to be in his new position – and sees added “possibilities” for the team in the future.

“When I looked at Team Silverstone or all the names that the team had over the last years I sensed a little bit the situation as we had with Sauber” Krack told media including PlanetF1.

“We were in a similar situation where at times we were really overperforming to our possibilities and then we had a big partner coming in [BMW] where you all of a sudden had possibilities that you never had before. We have something similar here.

“I think that really is quite attractive besides the factor [Formula 1] is the ‘Champions League’. You have a great bunch of people that know how to use their funds very cleverly and then you are provided with additional possibilities so the similarity is quite blatant.

“So this helped me in making the decision [to join] but at the end of the day it’s just Formula 1 per se that is super super attractive then I think there won’t be any better team than this one with all these new challenges these new possibilities we are having so I’m extremely privileged.”

The team finished a distant seventh place in last season’s Constructors’ Championship and Krack admitted that if he wants to keep Sebastian Vettel in the sport beyond 2022 Aston Martin are going to have to provide the four-time World Champion with a competitive car to drive.

They completed three days of running in Barcelona last week and while the competitive order is yet to be established the official pre-season test in Bahrain may give a clearer indicator of where they stand in the early stages of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY2hpbXByZXBvcnRzLmNvbS9uY2YtY29uc3RpdHV0ZXMtY29tbWl0dGVlLXRvLWludmVzdGlnYXRlLXJlc29sdmUtbnVwLWRwLXJvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NCF Constitutes Committee to Investigate Resolve Nup -DP Row,"The National Consultative Forum (NCF) for Political Parties has formed a committee to establish the root causes of differences between two opposition political parties the National Unity Platform (NUP) and the Democratic Party (DP).

The move was taken during the NFC plenary that sat at its offices in Kampala on Friday.

“Whereas the Forum appreciates the ideological differences existent amongst Political Parties and Organisations we are cognizant of the wrangles ensuing between political parties and organizations such as the National Unity Platform (NUP) and Democratic Party (DP)” the NCF spokesperson Michael Osinde told reporters after the plenary.

“As a result the NCF plenary in execution of its mandate under Section 20(4)(e) of the Political Parties and Organizations Act 2005 (as amended) which mandates the Forum to resolve conflicts and disputes among Political Parties and Organizations resolved to constitute a team to establish the root cause of the conflict and forge a way forward” Osinde communicated NCF resolution.

Pursuant to Section 20(4)(e) of Political Parties and Organizations Act Osinde said members of the select committee will engage the leadership of both NUP and DP to hear their side of the story before engaging the two in a dialogue.

The Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) National Chairman Wasswa Birigwa who chaired the plenary session said the NUP-DP conflict is not only a set back to the two parties but the entire opposition.

“A proposal came today that we need to call them and see if we can find a solution for what seems to be a difficult situation between the two. They are abusing each other which is not a good thing for not only our individual parties but all of us within the opposition. We want to see if we can be able to sit and find a way of resolving those issues” he said.

DP leadership particularly its President Nobert Mao has of late been engaged in a “social media war” with NUP supporters and some of its leaders.

Mao castigates NUP for receiving funding from Government under the Inter Party Organization for Dialogue (IPOD) forum but refusing to attend IPOD meetings.

NUP on the other hand says President Museveni uses IPOD to show the world that he engages his opponents in dialogue while continuing to kidnap arrest torture and kill opposition supporters.

Under IPOD every political party with representation in Parliament gets funding from Government based on its numerical strength in the House.

The funding which is released on a quarterly basis is passed through the Electoral Commission.

In the latest release the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party which has majority members in the House got 17.1 billion shillings representing 74.3% of the total amount released NUP – 3.1 billion (13.5%) FDC – 1.7 billion (7.4%) DP – 485 million 2.1%) UPC – 485 million (2.1%) JEEMA – 53 million (0.2%) and PPP – 53 million (0.2%).

In a February 19 tweet castigating NUP Mao said “Acknowledgement of receipt. IPOD Money has hit the account. The party Treasurer has confirmed in writing. And some people think hyenas can refuse meat raw or cooked.”

Meanwhile Mao also recently attacked NUP after the latter’s supporters in the United States took the streets protesting Speaker of Parliament Jacob Oulanya’s referral to the United States for medical treatment.

Mao who just like Oulanya hails from Northern Uganda accused Buganda dominated NUP party supporters of being tribal

The NUP however in response said its supporters were never protesting Oulanya being an Acholi but rather the poor health system in Uganda.",,,,,,

But access to reliable high-speed broadband remains elusive for many areas of the region.

The pandemic-driven influx of new year-round residents and an increase in second homeowners choosing to stay on the Cape and work from home heightened awareness of the inadequacies of the region's broadband infrastructure and access.

""The number-one (request) we got during COVID was: 'We just came to our summer house … and I need a dedicated gigabit at my home'"" Steve Johnston CEO of OpenCape told the Barnstable County Assembly of Delegates last week. There are 162000 households on Cape Cod and 46% are seasonal homeowners who could live here and work remotely — if they had connectivity.​

It's going to cost about $125 million to provide the same level of connectivity Capewide that Main Street Falmouth Woods Hole and downtown Hyannis now have access to he said. The achieve that goal last-mile connections to more homes and businesses in the region will have to be completed.

2022 technology:A promising year for electric vehicles health care space exploration

Erin Perry deputy director of the Cape Cod Commission said she and her staff are seeking money to pay a consultant to assess the current network and gaps in service examine broadband access affordability countywide and identify communities that have a lack of access.

Perry estimated the assessment would take six months to a year to complete.

Building a fiber-optic network on Cape Cod

In 2013 OpenCape's network went live with 350 miles of fiber optic cable covering all 15 towns on the Cape Nantucket and 38 towns in southeast Massachusetts that connect to Boston and Providence.

Since then the network has grown exponentially Johnston said. ""We now have 550 miles of fiber (optic cable). We cover 92% of the largest business customers on Cape Cod (with 200 or more employees).""

Yet OpenCape business customers are currently using less than 2% of the network's data capacity he said.

""Right now I could pump the entire internet traffic through the fiber we have. It's just investing in that 'last-mile' connection"" he said. ""As we’re connecting these small businesses we’re adding last-mile connections (to homes)"" essentially linking the ""Route 6"" of broadband networks into residents' driveways.

5G not coming to the Cape anytime soon

""Cape Cod is not on the top of any list for rolling out 5G; it is primarily an urban tool"" Johnston said. ""You need multiple radios per mile to provide that dense super-fast coverage.""

The term 5G simply means “fifth generation of cellular technology.” It refers to a bundle of standards that increases the speed at which data flows reduces slow-moving data and makes wireless services more flexible.

OPINION:Community investment in broadband access reaps long-term benefits beyond cash

But many customers on Cape Cod would be happy with a reliable and affordable broadband connection.

FalmouthNet is looking to connect all of Falmouth Johnson said ""because they have some of the worst service on Cape Cod.""

As a Sandwich resident he said his Comcast bill is $385 a month which he described as ""obscene.""

""It's ridiculous that people have to pay that kind of money to have lackluster service"" Johnston said. ""We have the opportunity to change the paradigm.""

Government money sought for Cape Cod last-mile broadband connections

Massachusetts allocated $50 million to improving broadband access in December Johnston said whereas New York and North Carolina each have allocated $1 billion.

""We (OpenCape) spend a lot of our energy on the Cape ... because the need here is the biggest"" he said. ""On the Cape you don’t have choice. You don’t have competition (between broadband providers). We see it as our mission to connect as many people as we possibly can.""

American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) money offers an opportunity to change that paradigm said Johnston who has reached out to the Cape Legislative delegation for support. Commissioners and residents who took the county's survey about how ARPA funding should be used identified broadband as an infrastructure priority.

Teresa Martin:Community investment in broadband access reaps long-term benefits beyond cash

Were OpenCape to realize another $5 million in funding Johnston said the Outer Cape would be the first place he would focus on.

""The fiber on the Outer Cape gets a little more abuse; it gets 'sand-blasted' daily"" he said. ""Co-ax cable (used by Comcast) was primarily designed to deliver Internet service over a video pipe. It’s nowhere close to as efficient (as fiber).

""Great connectivity is the one stop-gap that we could actually control; it would be the biggest boost that we could do"" Johnston said. ""There are a couple towns on the Cape that would benefit dramatically by doing what we did in Falmouth. We’re talking to them right now.""

Does Barnstable County have a role in expanding last-mile broadband?

Barnstable County was OpenCape's first seed investor according to tech columnist Theresa Martin an OpenCape co-founder and technology columnist for the Times.

""I think the county deserves a thumbs-up"" Martin said. ""It’s really a question of infrastructure. The technology is a secondary 'how.' Don’t start off going down the rabbit hole of technical details. Over time we know that will change. Infrastructure needs to be in place to support this. There's got to be investment to make that happen.""

When OpenCape was formed the idea was that publicly funded middle-mile broadband infrastructure would be supplemented by private investment for last-mile development. That private investment never materialized in rural areas such as the Cape because for-profit companies had a higher return on investment in more densely populated areas.

""The Cape is not alone in the last-mile conundrum"" Martin said. ""The Cape is relatively low-density. Investment is not very attractive. OpenCape is targeted to 'the middle mile.' That is the investment barrier.""

Johnston said he looks forward Election Day Nov. 8 with the hope that a new governor will prioritize investment to improve the Cape's — and other rural areas' — last-mile connections.

""We need a plan for broadband for the commonwealth"" he said. ""Massachusetts is one of 16 states in the country that doesn’t have a central broadband office.""

If given the money Johnston said many towns would be willing to invest in Main Street initiatives.

Teresa Martin:Connectivity on Cape Cod a challenge despite technological advances

""That's kind of where we’ve been stuck for the past 10 years and it’s very frustrating"" said Sandwich Assembly Delegate James Killion. ""We’re using a very small percentage of the region's fiber capability and we’re not leveraging that value.""

""In some states AT&T has lobbied hard to halt community broadband. In Massachusetts we have to give our state some credit for not succumbing to that"" he said.

Comcast promises to increase last-mile broadband on Cape Cod

Public-private partnerships work said Tim Kelly Comcast's vice president of Government and Regulatory Affairs for the Boston region which serves 315 communities in New England. Comcast extended free access to all of its Xfinity hotspots during the pandemic.

""Feeder fiber goes into every neighborhood on the Cape"" Kelly said. ""The service here should be the same as in Boston. The Cape has everything everyone else has ... but there are impediments and hurdles"" such as permitting along the Cape Cod National Seashore.

Over the next four years Kelly said Comcast will be adding more network capacity. ""We’re not digging up streets. We have the infrastructure already in place.

Where's the money?:Construction of canal bridges needs to begin within five years says Keating

""The pandemic has shown the importance of broadband more than ever"" he said. The Massachusetts Broadband Institute at the Mass Tech Collaborative the state government body overseeing broadband connectivity is looking for a $1.5 million investment to bring the Cape up to speed.

Comcast’s Internet Essentials program offers broadband connections via its Affordable Connectivity Program. Similarly Kelly said a Comcast partnership in Provincetown currently offers subsidy programs for income-constrained families.

Wellfleet has the most homes not connected said Wellfleet Delegate Lilli Ann Green. ""In the summertime routinely my service diminishes.""

""Give me addresses"" Kelly said. ""We’ll get it fixed. We’ll get it done.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2N4bWVkaWEub3JnL3Nwb3J0cy9jY3gtc3BvcnRzLXNwb3RsaWdodC1pc21hZWwta2FudGUtcGFyay1jZW50ZXItd3Jlc3RsaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CCX Sports Spotlight: Ismael Kante Park Center Wrestling - CCX Media,"CCX Sports Spotlight: Ismael Kante Park Center Wrestling

I paid more than $1000 for a new 4K TV and it angers me that I have to pay more to watch shows in 4K like Netflix which charges extra for the 4K package. Is there anything in 4K for free that I can watch? Especially something worth watching!? — Elvin Capitol Heights Maryland.

Elvin you would think that after paying several hundred dollars (or more in your case) for a new 4K TV you could watch an abundance of programming in 4K without shelling out even more money.

However I have to warn you that there are very few free 4K options. Netflix as you note offers 4K programming with its $19.99 a month plan (the most expensive plan it has). Amazon Prime has 4K but you need a Prime membership. A few other streaming services such as Disney Plus feature 4K programming but again you have to pay up. HBO Max which starts at $9.99 a month has roughly 20 titles in 4K but they are only available in its $14.99 plan.

There are also Blu-ray movies and TV shows in 4K (usually costs more than $20 a disc) and Pay-Per-View options from services such as Vudu (usually costs $5.99 a movie.).

Click Amazon: See Today’s 1-Day-Only Deals!

DIRECTV Comcast Altice fuboTV YouTube TV Verizon and Dish also offer some shows and sporting events in 4K but you know about the escalating cost of pay TV service. (And in You Tube TV’s case you have to pay $20 a month extra for a 4K add-on package.)

Unfortunately the broadcast networks (CBS ABC Fox NBC) have yet to launch 4K editions of their live channels so you wouldn’t be able to access free 4K using your antenna.

So is anything in 4K free? Really free?

Well yes.

YouTube (the free service not YouTube TV) actually has some 4K videos for free. I would recommend checking out YouTube’s HDR channel which can be found here. The vids are available in both 4K and HDR (High Dynamic Range) which can add realism and vividness to the 4K picture.

The current lineup at the 4K HDR channel which now has 238000 subscribers includes videos from the space shuttle New Year’s Eve fireworks celebrations close-ups of mouth-watering foods being cooked travelogues from Los Angeles Seattle and other cities and a few video game previews. As YouTube itself often is it’s a smorgasbord of this and that but there’s no programming from basic cable channels or other live television services.

You can watch YouTube on the 4K TV HDR channel via an app on your Roku. (Note: To watch 4K on Roku you will need a 4K-enabled Roku device such as the Premiere or Ultra.)

Finally Vimeo also has some 4K videos on its free video-sharing service. Mostly just travel stuff though.

Elvin I hope that helps. Happy Viewing and stay safe!

WOLFFORTH — The South Plains College men didn't beat Odessa College all season — not until the Texans really needed to at least.

Standout guard Kieves Turner poured in 31 points and South Plains upended eighth-ranked Odessa 87-83 in Saturday's finals of the NJCAA Region V tournament taking any guesswork out of whether they can make the NJCAA Tournament field.

South Plains (20-11) claimed the automatic berth to the national tournament March 14-19 in Hutchinson Kansas. In doing so the Texans ended the Wranglers' 19-game win streak.

Odessa (27-6) won the Western Junior College Athletic Conference regular-season championship by five games beating South Plains twice on the way to sweeping through the 16-game conference schedule undefeated.

On Saturday Turner went off again. The 6-foot-1 sophomore from Coatesville Pennsylvania had a school-record 50-point game in the regular-season finale against Midland College and had three 30-point-plus games in January.

Jaden Harris scored 12 points for the Texans. Eric Coleman Malek Abdelgowad and Savion Gallion added 11 apiece.

Dontrell Hewlett and Anthony Marshall scored 14 and 13 respectively for Odessa.

SPC women 64

Clarendon 54

WOLFFORTH — Raija Todd scored 23 points and South Plains College beat Clarendon College 64-54 Saturday in the championship game of the women's NJCAA basketball tournament at Frenship.

Celia Sumbane added 19 points for South Plains (20-8) which earned an automatic bid to the NJCAA Tournament from March 16-21 at the Rip Griffin Center. The Lady Texans will go in on a six-game win streak.

Mah Minthe scored 17 points for Clarendon (24-9) and Aileen Marquez added 14.

A&M-Kingsville 72

LCU men 69

FRISCO — Jacob Majors hit a 3-point goal with six seconds left to help Texas A&M-Kingsville upset top-seeded Lubbock Christian University in the semifinals of the Lone Star Conference tournament at the Comerica Center.

The 12th-seeded Javelinas led by as many 17 points in the first half but watched the Chaps roar back and grab the lead in the final 15 seconds on a layup by Lloyd Daniels.

After a timeout the Javelinas drew up a play to get Majors a look in the corner and he made the shot to put A&M-Kingsville up 70-69.

The Chaps subsequently tried to rush down the floor but Majors ended up getting the ball on a steal. After an intentional foul and two free throws by Kingsville the Javelinas were able to run out the final seconds.

Daniels led LCU (26-3) with 19 points and Aamer Muhammad scored 16 – all in the second half. Mackenzie had 14 points and LSC Player of the Year Parker Hicks had 10 points and eight rebounds.

TAMUK (18-9) will play West Texas A&M (27-6) at 1 p.m. Sunday for the championship and a berth in the upcoming Division II NCAA Tournament.

Saturday was the third win of the tournament for the Javelinas the lowest seed in an LSC tournament to reach the finals. This is just the second year LSC has had a 12-team field.

LCU women 60

Angelo State 51

FRISCO — Juliana Robertson racked up 20 points 12 rebounds and four steals leading No. 5 seed Lubbock Christian University over No. 4 seed Angelo State in a Lone Star Conference tournament quarterfinal Friday night at the Comerica Center.

The point total was the second-highest of the season for Robertson a 5-foot-10 senior from Kerrville Tivy. It was her seventh game this season with double-digit rebounds.

Laynee Burr had 17 points and four assists as the Lady Chaparrals won their sixth game in a row and Channing Cunyus chipped in eight points.

LCU (26-5) advanced to a Saturday night semifinal against No. 1 seed West Texas A&M (21-10) which beat Texas A&M International 75-56.

West Texas A&M was the last team to beat LCU downing the Lady Chaps 55-48 on Feb. 10 in Canyon.

Tayjanna McGhee-Pleasant led Angelo State (15-13) with 19 points. Roosevelt graduate Payton Brown was next with 14 and Blakely Gerber added eight. All three played for Wayland Baptist last season and followed coach Alesha Ellis from Wayland to Angelo State.

Explore See latest videos charts and news Morris Day Prince See latest videos charts and news

The controversial move which prompted Day to complain on social media that the estate was “taking my name away from me” was instigated by Comerica — a bank that has been serving as the court-appointed administrator of Prince’s assets during a years-long legal battle.

But those proceedings are nearly complete and set to wrap up later this year and the groups of heirs that will soon take control of the estate are now speaking out in Day’s favor.

Primary Wave a prominent music company that has acquired a 50 percent stake in Prince’s estate by buying out several heirs released a statement Saturday (March 5) that it “does not currently have any say in the affairs of the estate” but opposed Comerica’s tactics with Day.

Trending on Billboard

“We have reached out to Comerica to let them know that we do not agree with their decision and believe they should do the right thing here which is to let Morris Day continue to use the name” Primary Wave said. “Morris Day has Primary Wave’s full support.”

Meanwhile L. Londell McMillan an attorney and advisor who represents the group of heirs that will control the other 50 percent of the estate voiced a similar sentiment on Twitter.

“COMERICA AND THEIR ADVISORS CURRENTLY RUN THE PRINCE ESTATE” McMillan tweeted. “I THINK THIS IS HORRIBLE. I SUPPORT MORRIS DAY [100 percent.] WE CANNOT WAIT TO TAKE OVER THE ESTATE FROM THOSE IN CHARGE. HOPEFULLY SOON.”

A spokeswoman for the estate did not immediately return a request for comment on Primary Wave and McMillan’s comments. In a previous statement the estate said the discussion with Day had been “amicable” and that it was “surprised and disappointed to see his recent post.”

Day the frontman for the Prince-affiliated funk band The Time kicked off the controversy on Thursday when he claimed in a Facebook post that the Prince estate had told him he could no longer use the name “Morris Day and The Time.” He said Prince had never voiced such objections before he died in 2016 of a fentanyl overdose.

“The people who control his multi million dollar estate want to rewrite history by taking my name away from me thus impacting how I feed my family” Day wrote in the post. “So as of now per the Prince Estate I can no longer use Morris Day & The Time in any capacity.”

Day’s post was sparked by a December letter from the estate’s attorneys in which they told him he had “no right” to use the band name “in any form.” The letter cited a 1982 agreement in which Day allegedly agreed that Prince’s company would retain control of the trademark rights to “The Time.” The estate then offered to license the name back to Day for an undisclosed price.

In a practical sense the new statements from Primary Wave and McMillan mean that Day will likely be allowed to use the “The Time” name in the long run. But exactly when the heirs will assume control is not entirely clear.

A tax settlement with the IRS in January was the final major hurdle to closing the estate proceedings and a judge approved a rough plan last month for distributing Prince’s assets. The parties expect the case to close during 2022 but there is no hard schedule for doing so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdWx0aW1hdGVjbGFzc2ljcm9jay5jb20vcHJpbmNlLWVzdGF0ZS1tb3JyaXMtZGF5LXRpbWUtZGlzcHV0ZS1yaWdodC10aGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prince Estate Urged to 'Do the Right Thing' in Morris Day Dispute,"Morris Day's public sparring match with the Prince Estate to use the name Morris Day and the Time has garnered support from a crucial party: Primary Wave the music industry group that owns a 50 percent stake in the late musician’s estate.

Earlier this week Day released a statement claiming he was no longer allowed to use the name Morris Day and the Time ""in any capacity."" He accused the Prince Estate of ""[wanting] to rewrite history by taking my name away from me thus impacting how I feed my family"" after he had ""given 40 years of my life building up a name and legacy that Prince and I came up with.""

Because Prince died without a will his estate is currently under the control of Comerica Bank which was appointed to oversee the legal proceedings involving his assets. The lengthy proceedings are set to end later this year. Yesterday Primary Wave released a statement imploring the bank to grant Day permission to use the Time name.

""We have reached out to Comerica to let them know that we do not agree with their decision and believe they should do the right thing here which is to let Morris Day continue to use the name"" Primary Wave said (via Billboard). ""Morris Day has Primary Wave's full support."" The company also noted that it ""does not currently have any say in the affairs of the estate.""

Day also received public support from L. Londell McMillan an attorney who represents the heirs who will control the other half of Prince’s estate. ""Comerica and their advisors currently run the Prince Estate"" he tweeted. ""I think this is horrible. I support Morris Day [100 percent]. We cannot wait to take over the Estate from those in charge. Hopefully soon.""

The Prince Estate for its part has refuted Day's version of events. ""Given Prince's longstanding history with Morris Day and what the Estate thought were amicable discussions The Prince Estate was surprised and disappointed to see his recent post"" the Estate said in a statement. ""The Estate is open to working proactively with Morris to resolve this matter. However the information that he shared is not entirely accurate.""

Formed in 1981 the Time marked Prince's first instance of recruiting and producing another artist. He built the group around Day who was his high school classmate. The Time released four albums between 1981 and 1990 and broke up in the early '90s. Day continued touring as Morris Day and the Time even as Prince retained the rights to the band name. In 2011 Day and his original Time bandmates released the album Condensate under the name the Original 7ven.

Day released another statement yesterday thanking fans for their support. ""I want to thank everyone for their thoughts & support regarding this estate matter"" he wrote. ""I felt all of your love and energy yesterday and I look forward to your continued support until we find resolve. Thank you!!""",,,,,,

The Chennai based motorcycle producer could be using this alias for one of its upcoming models in the nation.

It is not the first time that Royal Enfield will be using this name as the company way back in the 1950s had a motorcycle with the same moniker. Also the name ‘Constellation’ has previously been trademarked by Royal Enfield’s parent company Eicher Motors in 2005.

The Royal Enfield Constellation 700 was a model that was only available in North America. The bike was on the market from 1958 to 1963 and was dubbed the “first Superbike” of the time. The Super Meteor 700 and the Interceptor 750 were inspired by the Royal Enfield Constellation 700. The 692cc parallel-twin motor had a maximum power output of 36 horsepower and was powered by a single Amal TT Carburettor.

As of yet there are no concrete sources that suggest on which bike this moniker will be sitting on but judging by the previous model that wore this badge we believe it could be used for one of the upcoming 650cc bikes from the Chennai based bikemaker. Currently there are three contenders which could bear the Constellation name – the first is a true-classic cruiser that will have a low seat swept-back handlebars and forward-set footpegs while the second one is a bike with more upright ergonomics and mid-set foot pegs. The second bike mentioned here has been seen in two trim levels in the country during its testing in which the first variant had alloy wheels with an upside-down fork setup while the second had wire-spoke wheels and a traditional fork setup.

While other than Constellation Royal Enfield in the recent few years has also trademarked names like Flying Flea Roadster Shotgun Sherpa and Hunter however we are yet to see a model with any of these mentioned names. Another speculation is that this newly trademarked name could also be used for a number of different things that Royal Enfiled produces or could produce. The list of things that can get this name includes electric motorcycles motorcycle saddles mudguards wheels and handlebar grips or any other OEM accessory or line of accessories.

In other news Royal Enfiled is currently in the preparation of launching its newest product – the Scram 411. The new model is a road-focused version of the company’s outgoing adventure vehicle Himalayan. The RE Scram 411 will borrow design cues from its sibling ADV and will come with features like a reworked instrument console with the Tripper navigation pod a cast metal-finished headlamp cowl single seat and altered side panels among the other modifications.

It will also get spoked 19-inch wheels wrapped with some dual-purpose tyres. As for the pricing of this model Royal Enfield has abstained from making any remarks but we assume that is likely to start from Rs 1.80 lakh. The Scram 411 is expected to make its debut in the latter part of this month.

Given the team that stood in the Hawks' way maybe they should make the lettering extra big. Possibly throw in some glitter.

A comeback from a 10-point deficit in the first half and staunch defense with the game on the line sent Corning to a 46-44 victory over four-time defending champion Elmira in Friday night's Section 4 Class AA championship game at Ithaca High School.

""A lot of days in practice we look up and there's nothing on our banner so it's great to bring something home"" said junior Alyssa Dobson.

Dobson scored 14 of her game-high 16 points in the second half. She hit two 3-pointers during an 8-0 run to open the third quarter that turned a 24-18 halftime hole into a 26-24 lead. Elmira led 22-12 until backup Kathryn Ouyang buried two 3-pointers to help the Hawks close the gap heading into the locker room.

Jenna DiNardo added 10 points for Corning and Kellie Zoerb scored eight. They spearheaded a Corning defensive effort that limited Elmira to six field goals in the second half.

Talking title

Corning East and Corning West both won sectional titles in girls basketball for the school district with West capturing the Class B state championship in 1995. However no championships had come since the schools combined for sports in 2010.

""I can’t even explain how I feel right now and I can’t even wait to celebrate more"" DiNardo said. ""I feel so good. We’ve been working so hard for this. This is all we’ve been wanting all season and we can’t wait to go farther.""

Round 3 goes Corning's way

Elmira beat Corning twice in the regular season 75-49 at home and 51-48 in their most recent meeting to clinch the program's sixth straight division title.

""It’s tough to beat a team three times in a year"" Elmira coach A'Don Allen said. ""They had a great game plan we didn’t play as well as we could have. They played their tails off. I have no complaints about their effort.

""We have some pretty lofty goals that obviously we’re not going to be able to attain at this point but I thought they worked really hard and I have a locker room full of kids that are feeling tough right now.""

Lauren Miller was high scorer for top-seeded Elmira (16-3) with 14 points. Megan Fedor scored 11.

Why this outcome was different

Corning took away many of the the things Elmira does well.

The Express' bids to quickly turn rebounds or turnovers into fast-break chances were denied by steals or tipped passes from the Hawks.

Elmira's strong half-court defense was often picked apart in the paint because of pinpoint Corning passes.

Jalea Abrams the Express' top scorer at more than 20 points a game was held to seven none in the second half.

""We worked hard in practice every day went over their game plan"" Dobson said. ""We knew they were going to switch up some things and they were going to keep some things the same. We just came in and executed what we knew was going to work.""

Dobson said Corning girls have played together since they were 8 years old and their chemistry and trust in one another were determining factors Friday.

""We were just like we know how to beat them"" DiNardo said. ""We can beat them and we can prove it. We just needed to play the game we know how to play. We’ve all been playing together for so long and you saw it we had great chemistry out there we had great energy. Everything was just clicking.""

Hawks made key defensive stops

During their 54-52 semifinal win over Horseheads the Hawks needed late defensive stops to preserve the win. That was the case again Friday.

Elmira cut a 42-38 Corning lead to one on a 3-pointer from Payton Ross with 3:10 remaining. After two free throws from Dobson put Corning up 46-42 with 2:18 to play Amarionah Dixon's bucket cut the lead to two with just over two minutes remaining.

The Express had multiple chances to tie or take the lead but they ended in turnovers or contested shots.

Abrams' driving layup with 20 seconds left hit high off the top of the backboard. Elmira forced a held ball to get the ball back. As the clock ticked down Miller heaved the ball toward the basket and the ball ended up in Dobson's hands after an Elmira player saved it from going out of bounds.

DiNardo said Corning was aware of Elmira's shooters in crunch time and played together and aggressively on the defensive end.

""They made all the right adjustments"" Allen said. ""We were a little behind on our rotations and they ended up getting a lot of baskets we wouldn’t normally (give up). Looking back on it there’s a lot of things I wish we would have done differently but it’s a two-point game. It came down to a couple possessions. They made plays and we didn’t and that’s basketball at times.""

Reflecting on Elmira's season

Elmira's streak of sectional championships came with a core group that included Division I college players Zaria DeMember-Shazer Kiara Fisher and Morgan Gentile. There was no postseason last season because of a reduced schedule caused by the pandemic but this Elmira team created its own identity that included the Southern Tier Athletic Conference tournament championship.

The senior class includes Fedor Miller Dixon and Khamiah Inman.

""My four seniors they mean so much to this program and I know it feels kind of crappy right now but when the dust settles they’ll understand how much they have meant to this program"" Allen said.

A couple of Corning seniors celebrated titles in Saturday’s New York State Indoor Track & Field Championships— one now a two-sport state champion this school year.

Jack Gregorski of Corning is New York State Public High School Athletic Association 3200-meter champion following an 8-minute 57.96-second showing. That was good for second overall back of an 8:57.49 by Myles Hogan of Fordham Prep.

Gregorski took to the start line as No. 2 seed at Ocean Breeze Athletic Complex on Staten Island.

“It feels great. I came out here to prove myself and I really think I did that today” he said. “I had expectations going in and I think I hit all of them.”

He added of his preparation: “I felt my training was perfect. I’ve been amping up the effort all through cross country and now indoor track and I think that helped everything come together today.”

Gregorski was Class A state cross county champion _ and the Hawks runaway team champ _ in November at Chenango Valley State Park.

Corning’s Elyssa DeRosa finished overall No. 1 in the girls weight throw heaving one 49 feet 9 inches on her sixth and final attempt. That was 23 inches better than the runner-up.

DeRosa came in seeded third on a 46-10¾.

“It feels amazing. I was not expecting this that’s for sure” she said. “This was a massive PR for me. It all came together.”

On the boys side a 4:18.10 brought Corning junior Ashton Bange fourth overall and second among public schoolers in the 1600 that race headed by a 4:13.55 from Fordham Prep’s Hogan.

The Hawks’ quartet of Gregorski Bange Gabe Cornfield and Tevin McLaren turned in a 7:58.64 in the 3200 relay fourth overall third among public schoolers and 2½ seconds off first.

Johnson City junior Dayzin Legare took fifth in the 55-meter dash on the strength of a 6.52. He was 11th in the 300 (35.75).

Dryden senior Bryant DePaull cleared 6 feet 2 inches for seventh in a high jump competition headed by a couple who got over 6-5.

Vincent VanMaaren of Delhi and Aidan Gallagher of Lansing each cleared 13 feet in the pole vault sharing ninth.

In the girls competition Vicky Mordvinova a junior from Elmira ran 2:56.80 in the 1000 good for ninth.

Corning sophomore Sarah Lawson was 10th in the 3000 (10:07.58).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFyZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLzIwMjIvMDMvMDUvY29ybmluZy1iZWF0cy1lbG1pcmEtc2VjdGlvbi00LWNsYXNzLWFhLWJveXMtYmFza2V0YmFsbC1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAvOTM1MTM0NDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Henderson scores 27 to lead Corning triumph over Elmira in Section 4 Class AA boys final,"Corning put the finishing moves on a dazzling two-step through the Section 4 Class AA boys basketball tournament Friday night rolling to a 76-56 victory over Elmira in the championship game at Ithaca High School.

Isaiah Henderson a sophomore hit eight of 12 shots from the field all five of his foul shots and went 6-for-9 from 3-point range as part of a 27-point effort that helped Corning capture its first sectional title since 2017.

Landen Burch added 14 points and eight rebounds. Corning led 21-10 after one quarter and 39-25 at the half. A 12-0 spurt late in the third quarter extended the advantage to 61-33.

""Kudos to our kids"" Corning coach Mike Johnston Jr. said. ""They came out and they executed and they played like they wanted to be champions. I'm really proud of them.""

Corning was a 71-43 semifinal winner against Ithaca on Tuesday. The Hawks' sectional dominance came after they lost out on the Southern Tier Athletic Conference tournament championship 67-66 in double-overtime against Union-Endicott.

Anthony Brooks led Elmira with 15 points. Seth Myles added 11 and Xavier Jones scored nine on three 3-pointers.

The Express finished with a 9-9 record after losing seven of its first nine games. Elmira beat Horseheads 52-38 in the semifinals.

Talking title

""We've been practicing for it forever so it feels good to finally win it"" Henderson said.

Said Hawks point guard Jackson Casey who had seven points and three steals: ""We put long hours in in practice. We worked hard we came together as a team we had each other's backs we have full trust in each other. I'm glad we could come out and showcase all the work that we do.""

Up Next

Corning (15-2) will take on Section 9 champion Newburgh Free Academy (16-3) or the winner of Sunday's Section 1 final between Mount Vernon (19-0) and North Rockland (23-0) in a regional final at 1:45 p.m. March 13 at Visions Veterans Memorial Arena in Binghamton.

The Section 1 vs. 9 sub-regional is scheduled for 5 p.m. March 8 at Kingston High School.

Cool Insuring Arena in Glens Falls will host the boys final four. Class AA games are set for March 18 and 19.

""It’s amazing I love it"" Casey said of the title. ""We’re going to celebrate it but ultimately we’ve still got more basketball to play. Now we’re entering the state tournament so now we’ve got to get ready for that.""

Dramatic difference from last meeting

Nearly a month ago Corning went to Elmira's gym and was dealt its first loss 47-32. Casey said avenging that defeat wasn't a focus but there's no denying that setback impacted the Hawks.

""They held us to 32 points at their place. Thirty-two points"" Johnston emphasized. ""That’s stellar defense and they made it pretty clear in the paper they wanted to get in our head. That was something from that moment on we preached especially this week about being tougher mentally. We made some adjustments offensively and changed a little bit of our game plan. We doubled our score from that last time we played.""

Corning's focus on being mentally tough was one of the keys Friday Henderson said.

""Coming out with energy and keeping our composure. Last time we lost it. We did better this time"" he said.

Henderson put on a show

Henderson scored at least five points in every quarter and hit at least one 3-pointer in each. He joined the rest of the starting unit on the bench for good with just over three minutes to go.

It took a bit of a nudge to get him going.

""Isaiah started slow and we just kept talking. 'You've got to be tougher you've got to play tougher look for your shot' "" Johnston said.

Said Henderson: ""He just told me to be aggressive every time I touched the ball with the score but don't force anything and be smart.""

Henderson credited the screens set by his teammates with providing quality looks throughout the evening.

Hawks' bench produced

Nesu Maphosa contributed nine points for Corning and Aidan Chamberlin the Hawks' other starter scored five. Corning went 23-for-26 at the foul line paying off Johnston's heavy emphasis on free throws during practices.

Johnston liked the effort from the bench and was happy everyone could get minutes in a sectional final.

""I got great minutes from my kids off the bench"" Johnston said. ""Logan Booker played a really good game Nick Garner was solid. Zayan Muhammed gave me good minutes Reed Walrath was another one.""

Ryan McNutt ascended to the awards platform’s top step Saturday at Ithaca College during New York state boys swimming championships.

The Corning senior bested the 100-yard freestyle field with a 45.58-second clocking 12-100ths of a second clear of second place at Kelsey Partridge Bird Natatorium within IC's Athletics & Events Center.

“It feels really awesome. This is my last race as a high school swimmer so I’m really psyched to have that icing on the cake” said McNutt who’ll next join Penn State University’s swim program.

Did he believe state supremacy to be attainable?

“This year yes” he said. “I knew I had the potential. I was going in as one of the top (seeds) but I knew there are always those guys who can sneak up on you. It took a lot of extra work to be able to get here but it’s really awesome to end it this way.”

Cullin Cole of Horseheads placed seventh in 46.87.

McNutt was fourth overall in the 200 freestyle (1:41.08).

The 200 free relay brought top-five finishes for two Section 4 teams.

Waverly’s Jerrell Sackett Ryan Clark Kaden Wheeler and Oscar Williams went 1:26.83 third overall and second-best among public schoolers. Fifth place overall went to Horseheads’ Emmett Hanson Shoonfon Li Andrew Schrage and Cole (1:27.13).

Wolverines junior Sackett was fourth (21.22) and Cole fifth (21.31) in the 50 freestyle. Horseheads (3:13.7) and Waverly (3:14.38) swam to seventh- and ninth-place finishes respectively in the 400 free relay."

It didn't go well,"IT? Or MI5? Image: Shutterstock

The more we've come to rely on technology the more we've lurched toward surveillance.

In one sense it's all too human. Who trusts anyone these days?

ZDNET Recommends The best work from home tech Upgrade your office or workshop with these gadgets that will boost your productivity. Read now

In another however it's a dark portent of a world gone twisted.

I've never been the same since reading the tale -- posted to Reddit last year -- of a company that used an IM system that offered three status choices: idle available or in a meeting. This fine system registered an employee as ""idle"" if they didn't touch their keyboard for five minutes.

And what a word to use anyway -- idle -- as if you're lazing around thinking about nothing at all. Some of people's best work is performed when they're idle leaning back and staring into space.

I wanted to believe this was an isolated piece of software even though I felt sure it wasn't. And then there came the long and torrid story recently reported by Business Insider of a company called CoStar.

There had been a ""mass exodus"" at this commercial real estate data firm. People choose to leave tech companies all the time especially in the current climate of full employment. At CoStar though one of the reasons for employee discomfort was reportedly the enrollment of its IT department as well something of a spy network.

The 15 people in IT were asked to perform 100 video calls to other employees. Spontaneous ones. (CoStar denies this happened.)

They were reportedly told to say they were checking to see if the company's VPN was working as it should.

As Business Insider tells it the IT people were ""told to note whether that employee answered the call promptly and enabled their video during the chat and to log more personal details including a description of where that person was working and whether they were dressed professionally.""

One person's idea of professional dressing is another person's ""why did you spend so much money on that hat from Neiman Marcus?""

Back to the alleged spying.

Apparently if the employee didn't respond to the call three times they were put on the naughty list. Or worse shown straight to the door.

Too often technology is being used as a substitute for other skills -- management for example. A good manager understands that some employee metrics can't be analyzed. There are contributions that can't be measured either by a machine or by a spy report.

Tracking employees by the minute sucks the humanity and the dignity out of work. Is it so surprising that companies are suddenly finding it difficult to hire good employees -- or any really?

Equally I'm left to wonder about the IT employees asked to perform surveillance.

I know a couple IT people. They tell me of occasional requests from management to surveil others -- requests that turn their stomachs. When I ask how they deal with it they shrug as if it's simply part of their job these days. Keeping the network together by day spying by day too.

As business software becomes ever more powerful and ubiquitous those in charge are tempted toward the sneaky and iniquitous. Too many believe it's their right to know everything about their employees. Too many have little regard for the one thing that suffers: trust.

What are they afraid of?

And while both deals closed out agreements reached in 2021 the market climate that helped generate the transactions is still in place and could spawn similar deals if macroeconomic factors of inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine don’t diminish investor confidence real estate executives told CoStar News.

Affiliates of Highgate Hotels and Cerberus Capital Management completed their $1.5 billion acquisition of CorePoint Lodging of which Blackstone affiliates held about a third of outstanding stock and approved of the deal.

Separately Brookfield Property Partners reported closing the sale of its investment in an extended-stay hospitality portfolio for $1.5 billion. A joint venture of Blackstone and Starwood Capital is the buyer.

While U.S. hotel industry performance has been slowly but steadily recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic the deals show the recovery of the hotel sector is on a much faster track.

“I think when you look at the volume of transactions last year was obviously strong. It was up almost 400% over 2020 but up over a low number” Kevin Davis Americas CEO at JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group told CoStar News in an interview.

What is more impressive Davis added is the number of deals that were flying around and are still being worked or considered. Driving the behind-the-scenes interest is the amount of capital available to invest.

There was a substantial amount of dry powder going into the COVID-19 pandemic and substantial amounts more raised in the early months as investors teed up for potential distressed buying opportunities he said.

“So the net is that you have a tremendous amount of capital ready to be deployed in the hospitality space” Davis said. “You couple that with the specter of inflation now at a 40-year high which coupled with the fact that hotels can reset rates every night that serves as a tremendous inflation hedge. I think that makes the sector much more attractive relative to some of the other commercial real estate asset classes.”

However Davis said investors are on high alert for potential macro issues surrounding the Federal Reserve’s response to rising inflation and whether the war in Ukraine escalates.

“The markets should hold up as long as we don’t have exogenous events like a full-scale war to undermine market confidence and as long as the Fed is deliberate and responsible in terms of raising rates” Davis said.

The completion of the CorePoint deal is a continuation of record mergers and acquisitions activity among real estate investment trusts last year according to Calvin Schnure senior vice president of research and economic analysis at the REIT industry trade group Nareit.

“There has been a flurry of mergers including deals going private and I expect these may continue” Schnure told CoStar News in an email. “There is a lot of money in the space these days. In terms of acquisitions (property-level purchases) 2021 acquisitions of $67.8 billion was the highest on record. With rising share prices giving REITs an attractive cost of capital many are expanding their footprint. That appears likely to continue this year.”

La Quinta Hotel Portfolio

CorePoint holdings consist mainly of midscale and upper-midscale select-service hotels consisting primarily of La Quinta-branded properties. As of Sept. 30 the REIT owned interests in about 160 hotels with roughly 22000 rooms. The hotels are located primarily in or near employment centers airports and major travel thoroughfares.

As of the end of September the properties had not fully recovered from the effects of efforts to shut down the spread of COVID-19 according to recent loan surveillance by Kroll Bond Rating Agency.

The CorePoint properties were subject to a commercial mortgage-backed securities loan with an outstanding balance of about $295 million in January according to CoStar data. KBRA said the principal balance was paid off that month.

KBRA estimated that the portfolio’s net cash flow through September was about 36% lower than when the loan was issued in 2018. In addition the properties were operating at occupancies that were below historical performance.

CorePoint had been pursuing strategic alternatives including a potential sale of the company since at least July and the REIT had been strategically selling off noncore assets since March 2019.

Affiliates of Blackstone own about 30% of CorePoint’s total outstanding shares and voted in favor of the sale. As it benefits from the sale of CorePoint Blackstone also has beefed up its ownership of hotels.

WoodSpring Suites Deal

Blackstone and Starwood Capital teamed up to buy 111 WoodSpring Suites hotels for $1.5 billion from Brookfield Property Partners. That purchase followed the joint venture partners’ acquisition of the Extended Stay America chain for $6 billion last summer.

With their pragmatic no-frills rooms attracting travelers from across the spectrum extended-stay hotels have enjoyed an advantage over other hospitality types in the recovery from the pandemic according to CoStar analysis.

Last year extended-stay chains ran at an average occupancy of 73% as other business-oriented hotels rebounded much slower. Given reaccelerating business demand and strong leisure travel expectations are that extended-stay hotels will outperform with further occupancy and rate acceleration and strong investor demand.

Blackstone and Starwood Capital lined up $1.2 billion of floating-rate debt from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup to finance its WoodSpring Suites’ purchase according to Commercial Mortgage Alert. That loan is expected to be rolled into a new CMBS issuance in the near term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2ZzdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8wNS90b3VyLWJ1cy1zaWdodHNlZWluZy1idXNpbmVzcy1zbG93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We Rode a Double-Decker Tour Bus Around San Francisco,"Gallery of 4 photos

Among the slides Kailyn 29 and Chelsea 30 were standing side-by-side together.

Chelsea had on a red see-through top over her black blouse while wearing gloves.

Her long and wavy red hair had blonde streaks at their ends.

Next to her Kailyn tied the bottom of her black shirt and buttoned it up to the top.

Her long blonde hair flowed and curled as she modeled in ripped jeans.

Both Teen Mom 2 stars were glammed up and smiled at the camera.

MTV fans were shocked to see the fashion sense of the twosome during their younger days.

One fan said: ""Kail on the other hand is looking good in number 8.""

Another fan mentioned: ""Chelsea was covering her hands even way back then. I love these. More please.""

A third fan added: ""KAIL in the black outfit. The outfit isn't great but she looked good!""

A fourth person wrote: ""Chelsea’s black pants look like the ones I wore in elementary school in the 90s.""

A commentator chimed in: ""Chelsea looks good in that red top.""

Kailyn and Chris Lopez share sons Lux four and Creed one.

She is also the mother of 11-year-old son Issac with Jo Rivera and 8-year-old son Lincoln who she shares with Javi Marroquin.

Chelsea and her husband Cole DeBoer share three children: son Watson four and daughters Layne three and Walker 10 months.

She also shares daughter Aubree 12 with her ex Adam Lind who she recently claimed has not done any ""set-up time to see"" the tween.

THE B-LIST FRIEND

Back in October Kailyn had opened up about her Teen Mom experiences on her latest Coffee Convos podcast.

During the installment the MTV mom explained why she was never a ""first choice.""

She opened up: ""There was a time when we first started Teen Mom. I came in late.

""I was not supposed to be on 16 & Pregnant Season 2. I was supposed to be on 16 & Pregnant Season 3.

""So I was a last-minute exchange to move to 16 & Pregnant Season 2.""

She continued: ""Everyone had already known each other. Chelsea and Leah [Messer] were like besties on the show.

""I felt like I was always the second choice to them. I was always second best. I was always an afterthought.""

The TV personality star felt like a ""B-List friend"" because if ""Chelsea and Leah were busy"" then she would be asked afterward.

Kailyn concluded: ""I may be a B-List friend for somebody else but I don't give a sh*t.""

When COVID-19 cases were at an all-time high Costco was quick to adopt certain prevention regulations and changes like the food court's touchless condiment stations face mask policies and even the store's COVID-19 vaccine rollout service to ensure safety—not to mention other store offerings like at-home testing kits and administering booster shots. But in most cases members were (and still are) expected to adapt to the megastore's safety rules that were just updated on March 3.

As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) closely monitors the number of COVID-19 cases throughout the country it appears that the number of infections in the U.S. has been decreasing. Despite this sharp decline Costco doesn't seem to be letting up on pandemic policies that were originally established. Here are all the details from Costco's ""Updates and Coronavirus Response"" webpage. (For more changes happening at the warehouse near you here are 6 Things You'll See at Costco This Year.)

Face Mask Policy

The warehouse used to recommend that members continue to wear face masks throughout the store. Prior to March 3 the ""Updates and Coronavirus Response"" site said that Costco will continue to follow mask regulations in an effort to ""protect the health and safety of our members and employees"" but now the page simply says that ""locations will follow the face mask regulations of the applicable state and local jurisdictions.""

The last time the chain dropped mask rules in the Spring of 2021 some members became angry and wanted the chain to leave it in place.

Temporary Item Limits

Product limits are nothing new to the seasoned Costco shopper. If it seemed like you just couldn't get enough toilet paper and cleaning supplies it's because you could not. As per store policy Costco imposed purchase limits on certain items like paper towels and bottled water. Nearly two years into the pandemic and some of the purchase limits have yet to be lifted. While the COVID Updates page refers to these limits as ""temporary"" it seems like only time will tell how just how much longer the restrictions could remain in place.

Special Operating Hours for Members Ages 60 or Older

Costco says that any members who are 60 years or older can avoid the hassle of a crowd and shop during the Special Operating Hours which are on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 10 a.m. (but in the select cities of Brooklyn N.Y. Culver City Calif. Iwilei (Honolulu) Hawaii and Westbury N.Y those hours are from 8 to 9 a.m.).

The warehouse clarifies that this isn't only for seniors however because apart from the aforementioned medical professionals the site notes that ""those with disabilities or who are immunocompromised"" will also be able to take full advantage of the special store hours.

Access for Healthcare Workers and First Responders

Healthcare professionals are also able to enter the store during special store hours as stated on Costco's COVID Updates site. The website further clarified that these roles include ""pharmacists and all hospital employees with a hospital ID…police officers EMTs and firefighters."" While often reserved for seniors 60 years or older these health care workers and first responders can gain a well-deserved entry into the store during these special hours as opposed to regular members.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Costco Food Courts

Some of us can't imagine parting with the $1.50 food court hot dog or the onion crank and thankfully we didn't have to! The beloved food court has stood the test of time and remains open. While the food court has seen its fair share of changes in the past year—like the removal of seating areas and adding touchless soda dispensers–Costco says that ""All Costco Food Courts are open"" despite the possible seating capacity limits and varied menu selection. This is great news for any shoppers who want to grab a quick bite from the megastore.

Martin Roberts couldn't hold back the tears as he broke down outside Costco claiming his purchase for Ukranian child refugees had been rejected.

The Homes Under the Hammer star headed to the supermarket to buy multiple bottles of Calpol to send to families fleeing the war-torn country.

However Martin says when he got to the till his shopping was barred due to Costco's strict medicine buying policy.

In a teary video outside the store Martin got very emotional as he revealed how fellow shoppers came to his aid.

Crying into camera from the car park Martin 58 said a number of people chipped in on his behalf to make sure all the bottles were brought.

The Queen and the late Duke of Edinburgh moved to Windsor Castle permanently at the start of the global health crisis in March 2020 in order to better isolate and stay separate. Prior to 2020 they would go to Windsor at the weekend and also spend the week there for both Easter week and Royal Ascot week but spent the rest of the year at other homes.

In addition to weekends and specific periods Her Majesty also spent her formative years during the Second World War at Windsor Castle with her younger sister Princess Margaret.

The Queen has decided to make Windsor Castle her permanent home for the rest of her reign and will only be returning to Buckingham Palace for official duties. Given health and travel restrictions for different nations she continues to hold many virtual engagements which she can easily do from Windsor.

Buckingham Palace is currently undergoing £369 million refurbishments that are not meant to be completed until 2027. Plans include adding a ramp to help make the palace step-free replacing the roof of the Picture Gallery and adding a new energy centre new water tanks and standby power generation. Despite the global health crisis the refurbishments are said to be continuing on schedule.

While The Queen will now be spending the majority of her time at Windsor Castle she will still be seen at Buckingham Palace. In June much of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations are centred around Buckingham Palace including the often-discussed balcony appearance.

Her Majesty had been scheduled to host a diplomatic reception at Windsor on Wednesday 2 March but it was postponed to a later date.

The Monarch who turn 96 next month has spent the pandemic at Windsor which had traditionally been her weekend residence. However it has always been known that The Queen felt more at home at Windsor than in central London.

It is expected that Her Majesty will return to London when necessary for official duties but with her seemingly declining health and advancing age this is likely to be infrequently.

There is also ongoing work to repair Buckingham Palace from years of neglect which makes this also a logical step in order to facilitate the repairs.

It was previously thought that Her Majesty along with other Royals with apartments in the palace would be moved into other wings as necessary to allow for works’ access.

Prince Charles and Camilla are expected to move into Buckingham Palace when he accedes to the throne as the main working hub of the Monarchy (although the court is officially located at St James’s Palace next door to Clarence House).

The Rose of Shires' ties to royalty crop up throughout its heritage but perhaps one of its most well-known connections to the crown is that it is the site of the execution of Mary Queen of Scots.

The cousin of Queen Elizabeth I was beheaded at Fotheringhay Castle in East Northamptonshire on February 8 1587 after being accused of conspiring to assassinate the English monarch.

There are theories that Mary's entrails were buried in Northamptonshire despite her body being entombed in Westminster Abbey but there are rumours that there could be more to this tale than meets the eye.

Oundle which is just three miles away from Fotheringhay is a historic market town and one of its most impressive buildings The Talbot Hotel has a history entwined with that of the ill-fated queen.

There has been an inn on the site of The Talbot since the 1500s running right through the Tudor period but the building you can see on the main street through the town was rebuilt in 1626.

According to several sources including Kettering-born author Marian Pipe who wrote 'Northamptonshire Ghosts and Legends' stones from Fotheringhay castle were used to build the hotel we see standing today.

Legend also has it that the panelling in the bedrooms great horn window and the staircase are all from the ancient Fotheringhay Castle which is now just a grassy mound.

These were all rumoured to have been bought by local developer William Whitwell so it's possible the staircase that sits in the hotel now could be the very same one that Mary Queen of Scots descended on the morning of her execution.

The legend also goes on to say that her executioner stayed at The Talbot the night before his grim task dining on pigeon pie.

All of this has led to ghostly tales of the haunting of the hotel.

""The tragic queen is said to haunt the upper stairs and two of the bedrooms at the top"" Marian Pipe said.

""Many people have see the ghostly figure of a woman in a long black dress standing at the foot of a bed in one of the rooms. She is sometimes seen gazing sadly through the mullioned windows on the stairs.

""Occasionally the guests sleeping on that floor have been awakened by a woman's sobbing which continues for hours. Often the manifestation will occur after alterations have been carried out in the building.""

The Talbot Hotel acknowledges the rumours of haunting on its own website where there is a comprehensive history of the building.

Today two very large paintings hang at The Talbot testifying to its connection to the famous queen one of which shows a despairing Queen Mary sitting at a table.

Whether the Queen's presence in the hotel goes further than these paintings is a mystery but its historic connection to the tragic monarch cannot be doubted.

The Radahn Festival is when Radahn’s followers call forth all who wish to die in glorious combat. The idea is that someday a powerful enough warrior will be able to take down Radahn who longs for death and freedom from the Scarlet Rot that eats away at his body.

Interestingly the Radahn Festival will only start after a very specific mechanic has been activated the Grand Lift of Dectus. This lift can be found in the northern part of Liurnia of the Lakes but players will need two items to activate it.

Dectus Medallion (right) – this can be found in Fort Faroth in Caelid.

Dectus Medallion (left) – this can be found in Fort Height along the eastern edge of Mistwood in Limgrave.

When you have both pieces you can bring them to the Grand Lift of Dectus and activate it with them. Doing so will also activate the teleporters near the Impassable Greatbridge Site of Grace.

Activate the teleport to get sent into Redmane Castle. Now all you need to do is walk through the castle until you come to a crown that has gathered. Some will be real people while some will be ghostly. Speak with the NPC at the top of the nearby platform to begin the Radahn Festival and prepare to fight the demigod in question.

""Warnie was an all-time great a once in a century type cricketer and his records will live on forever. We all grew up watching Warnie idolising him we all had posters on his wall had his earring"" said Cummins to cricket.com.au as he choked up occasionally in remembering the Aussie great.

The game was never the same after Warnie emerged and the game will never be the same after his passing. Rest in peace King.""

Maxwell on the other hand could not hold back tears in a gut-wrenching and emotional interview to Fox Sports. Calling himself ‘broken’ with the tragic news Maxwell recalled the life and times of Warne and how the Australian legend played an instrumental role in the early days of his career.

As the cricketing world struggles to come to grips with the tragic news of Warne's passing Maxwell explained how Warne was just the type of senior pro and guide a youngster would hope for.

""He was a pretty life-loving person. You'd be hard pressed to find a more caring loyal generous person than him. He gave his time to pretty much every cricketer that came through. He saw every leg spinner that was playing international cricket state cricket when he was commentating he'd be out there helping them out. That was just the sort of person he was he just gave his time so generously. He found a way to he inspired multiple generations of players wanting to be Shane Warne. That’s the legacy he's going to leave"" added Maxwell.

""He was (fun to be around). Even just to talk to him about normal stuff he was just so knowledgeable and so caring and friendly. When myself and Finchy (Aaron Finch) started playing poker with him and going around to his house being openly invited to just have these nice chats with him we’d always make an effort to turn up early so we could talk about other stuff. He was just so giving with his time and more than happy to give back.""

The bespectacled opener had to go however as replays confirmed the Cummins delivery would have gone on to hit the middle stump.Imam's maiden Test century was studded with 16 boundaries and two sixes.Australia are visiting Pakistan after a 24-year gap to play three Tests three one-dayers and a Twenty20 International.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0L3Jlc3QtaW4tcGVhY2Uta2luZy1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWNhcHRhaW4tcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtcmVzcG9uZHMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8zNjBhY2M1YmQ2OWI5MjEzN2Q3MjlhNDQxMTI2ZDc2YtIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0L3Jlc3QtaW4tcGVhY2Uta2luZy1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWNhcHRhaW4tcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtcmVzcG9uZHMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8zNjBhY2M1YmQ2OWI5MjEzN2Q3MjlhNDQxMTI2ZDc2Yj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Warne’s body will be brought home,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/rest-in-peace-king-australian-captain-pat-cummins-responds/news-story/360acc5bd69b92137d729a441126d76b on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0L3Jlc3QtaW4tcGVhY2Uta2luZy1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWNhcHRhaW4tcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtcmVzcG9uZHMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8zNjBhY2M1YmQ2OWI5MjEzN2Q3MjlhNDQxMTI2ZDc2YtIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0L3Jlc3QtaW4tcGVhY2Uta2luZy1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWNhcHRhaW4tcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtcmVzcG9uZHMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8zNjBhY2M1YmQ2OWI5MjEzN2Q3MjlhNDQxMTI2ZDc2Yj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Can’t believe he’s gone‘: Warner reveals how ‘gobsmacked’ Aussie team learned of Warne’s death,"Australian star David Warner has opened up on the tragic passing of cricket icon Shane Warne and how he and the Australian team learned of his death at the age of 52.

“I found out from James (Erskine) after everyone from his family was notified” Warner said on Fox Cricket’s Shane Warne tribute special.

“Just before it got out we spoke to the guys and we were in the bus ready to come back to the hotel.

“Everyone was just absolutely gobsmacked. There was silence in the cars and we came back.

“It is just like anyone that you lose it is just like part of your family. You look at the tributes that are coming out around the world we raised a glass and shared some great memories and stories about Shane and what he did for cricket and world cricket in general.”

Warner paid tribute to Australia’s greatest bowler and arguably the greatest ever by sharing his own memories of Warne.

“He has (touched everybody in Australian cricket)” Warner said.

“From my personal stories I had Warnie’s poster on my wall like every other young cricketing kid.

“I just grew up wanting to be like Shane. I started my journey bowling like him and batting in the middle order.

“Through 17s and 19s I tried to replicate everything that Warnie did with his action. I think everyone has seen my action alongside his. I just wanted to be like Shane from a bowling front.

“The special memories that I remember from Shane’s playing days was 2001. It was probably going to be a draw. Both England and Australia got 500. I remember Warnie going for 150 in his first innings and he only took one wicket.

“Then he changed it in his second innings and took 4-40 off 37 overs and changed that game dramatically and England were bowled out for 120.

“To witness what one guy can do from nothing. That wicket was flat and he changed the course of the game. That was amazing.

“The other one was I know he will be kicking himself still to this day was when he got 99 against New Zealand and everyone stirs him up about Daniel Vettori bowling a no-ball.

“Those are small memories of watching him on TV.”

Warner also lamented the loss of Warne’s knowledge of the game as a commentator and a mentor.

“I was in a privileged position of learning from Warnie being around the group and in the commentary box just the knowledge he had of the game” Warner said.

“Nothing would be happening out in the middle and he would say a few things to a couple of us and we would implement that the next day or in the next game and things just panned out and worked.

“He just knew the game so well. He was loved by every single person in the world that knows the game of cricket and people that don’t know the game of cricket.

“I just can’t believe he is gone.”

Earlier Candice Warner revealed how husband and Australian opener David Warner received the sad news of Shane Warne’s tragic passing before breaking the news to shattered teammates.

Speaking on Triple M Mrs Warner revealed David Warner was contacted by Warne’s manager after Australia’s first day’s play in the first Test against Pakistan.

“I haven’t spoken to Dave but we have exchanged text messages and he said he received the message from Shane’s manager James Erskine and delivered the news to the team” Candice Warner said on Triple M.

“It was already a hard day with the loss of Rod (Marsh) and other things that have been going on in Pakistan.

“To have a hard day on the field and then come back home to the hotel to that news is devastating.

“I think it will inspire them to want to play and do it for Warnie and for Rod. But whether they can do that or not. It is a lot to take and being so far away form Australia at the moment it will be difficult but they can do it.”

Australia men’s captain Pat Cummins spoke in a moving tribute to Warne who he called a “once-in-a-century cricketer” after the 52-year-old’s death.

Warne an Australian cricket great and the best leg-spinner of all-time was confirmed to have died by his management in the early hours of Saturday (AEDT) after a suspected heart attack.

It was the second blow for Australian cricket in 24 hours after the death of wicketkeeping great Rod Marsh who passed away after a major heart attack last week.

Cummins called Marsh a “colossal figure” on Friday in the hours leading up to the first match of Australia’s Test series with Pakistan.

Now Cummins and the men’s Australian Test team has been forced to deal with another devastating loss — as has the entire cricketing world.

“On behalf of the entire playing group and support staff here in Pakistan I want to express our shock and sadness over Shane’s sudden passing” Cummins said in a video message.

“We are all numbed by the news. Shane was a once-in-a-century cricketer and his achievements will stand for all time but apart from the wickets he took and the games he helped Australia win what he did was draw so many people to the sport.

“So many of us in the playing group grew up idolising him and fell in love with this great sport as a result while many of our support staff either played with him or against him.

“It has been a terrible couple of days for Australian cricket with the passing of Rod Marsh and now Shane. Our thoughts are with both families and in Shane’s case particularly with his parents Keith and Bridgette his brother Jason and his children Jackson Summer and Brooke.

“The game of cricket was never the same after Shane emerged and it will never be the same now he has gone. Rest in peace King.”

Several other current Australian cricketers have taken to social media to express their shock and sadness at Warne’s death less than 24 hours after that of Marsh.

Steve Smith also currently in Pakistan with the national team wrote that it was “hard to fathom that we’ve lost two Australian legends within 24 hours” in his Instagram status.

Opening batter David Warner meanwhile wrote: “Two legends of our game have left us too soon. I’m lost for words and this is extremely sad. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Marsh and Warne family. I just cannot believe it. RIP you will both be missed.”

“Absolutely lost for words. The true GOAT. RIP Warnie” wrote Nathan Lyon on his Instagram story.

Philippe Coutinho gave a masterclass and Danny Ings offered Southampton a painful reminder of his prowess as Aston Villa’s revival continued in style with a 4-0 hammering at Villa Park.

Ings who joined Villa from Southampton in the summer for £25million scored one and made two while Coutinho netted once claimed an assist and could have had a hat-trick as Steven Gerrard’s side made it successive victories.

Ollie Watkins and Douglas Luiz scored Villa’s other goals in their biggest win since beating Liverpool 7-2 in October 2020 while it ended Saints’ five-match unbeaten run in the Premier League.

Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster made vital saves from Watkins Coutinho and Ings to prevent an even heavier defeat.

Southampton were wearing their yellow and blue change kit to show support for Ukraine and Saints fans hung scarves of those colours to greet their team before kick-off.

But it was Villa fans who were cheering as their team took the lead in the ninth minute.

Watkins turned Oriol Romeu with ease before calmly curling home a shot after Ings provided the pass.

It was the 100th goal Watkins had scored in league football which includes 10 on loan at non-league side Weston-super-Mare and his seventh of the season.

In a rare break Southampton midfielder Stuart Armstrong curled inches wide trying to pick his spot.

Villa’s Jacob Ramsey unmarked at the far post could only head wide from John McGinn’s corner.

Watkins should have doubled Villa’s lead in the 31st minute. Coutinho provided the perfect through ball but his shot was palmed away by Forster.

The closest Southampton came to scoring was in the 33rd minute. Valentino Livramento crossed but Che Adams could only head on top of the net.

Romain Perraud drove wide for the visitors who were to regret their missed chances as Villa went on to dominate.

Coutinho twice went desperately close sandwiched in between setting up the second goal.

First Forster blocked his shot with his right leg after Watkins pulled the ball back from the left.

Then agonisingly the Brazilian curled the ball fractionally wide after Watkins’ headed flick left him in the clear.

In between Coutinho’s superb movement beat the offside trap as he latched on to Calum Chambers’ chip and unselfishly squared for Luiz to tap home in the 44th minute.

Villa made the game safe with two further goals within nine minutes of the restart.

Coutinho turned one way then the other before firing through Forster’s legs in the 52nd minute after Ings cut the ball back.

Two minutes later Ings netted with a first-time shot that swerved away from Forster into the far corner from Matty Cash’s cross.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy8xMC1jb21wYW5pZXMtdGhhdC1wYXktd29ya2Vycy0xNS1vci1tb3JlL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy8xMC1jb21wYW5pZXMtdGhhdC1wYXktd29ya2Vycy0xNS1vci1tb3JlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 companies that pay workers $15 or more,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox8.com/news/10-companies-that-pay-workers-15-or-more/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy8xMC1jb21wYW5pZXMtdGhhdC1wYXktd29ya2Vycy0xNS1vci1tb3JlL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy8xMC1jb21wYW5pZXMtdGhhdC1wYXktd29ya2Vycy0xNS1vci1tb3JlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oYWlsZXktYmllYmVyLXdvcmUtcGx1bmdpbmctcGluay0xNTQ2NDQyMTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hailey Bieber Wore a Plunging Pink Dress with the Clunkiest Platform Boots,"It's already been established that Hailey Bieber's dressing philosophy for Paris Fashion Week is ""go big or go home"" but now she's extending that way of thinking all the way down to her feet.

On top Hailey looked like your typical supermodel in a pretty pink silk dress with halter straps and a plunging neckline and on bottom she went full-on rock star in a set of super tall super chunky black platform boots that hit just below her knees. The grunge boots were in stark contrast with the rest of Bieber's elegant look which also included tiny gold hoops a soft pink manicure and rosy makeup that matched her dress.

Fresh off the heels of Moesha Brandy returned to music in March 2002 with the Rodney Jerkins-produced LP that earned her the title “The Vocal Bible” which she’s still known as today. The album’s elevated merger of UK garage funktronica and contemporary R&B strayed away from her more soul-centric coming-of-age projects. On Full Moon fans were introduced to “B Rocka” the grown woman embodying Brandy’s angelic voice now speaking on adult experiences such as love betrayal heartbreak and growth.

In the midst of a neo-soul movement at the turn of the century Full Moon arrived with a distinct 2000s R&B sound including vocal arrangements harmonies and beats that continue to serve as reference points for musicians today. Despite mixed reviews from critics upon its release the LP debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 snagged a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album and is certified platinum by the RIAA.

On Full Moon Brandy’s riffs are clean intricate and intentional the harmonies are no less than masterful and the production has aged beautifully.

By now Joe Diffie’s “John Deere Green” is easily one of the most popular ’90s country songs out there. Pretty much any country fan can tell you exactly who Billy Bob loved or what the town thought about his artwork up on the water tower.

Written by the incredible Dennis Linde “John Deere Green” is still covered live by a ton of today’s biggest country stars and American Aquarium even included the Joe Diffie classic on their ’90s country cover album Slappers Bangers & Certified Twangers Vol. 1.

Play

But back in the early ’90s Diffie wasn’t so sure about the song – and it even made his mom cry when she first heard it.

Diffie talked about the song in a 2019 interview with CMT and admitted that he hated the song when it was first pitched to him:

“I didn’t really care for the song when I first heard it. I was like ‘That is horrible.'”

Well luckily he came around and recorded the song for his 1993 album Honky Tonk Attitude. But when he played the song for his parents his mom Flora was horrified by the song – and even started crying:

“I played it for my parents and my mom started crying and I’m like ‘What’s the matter?’

And she was just crying and crying. I said ‘Well what is it?’ She said ‘Nothing.’ I said ‘Well what’s the matter?’

She goes ‘You’re singing rock and roll.’

I’m not singing rock and roll. I was like ‘I can’t believe you’re crying over this song and that you think I’m singing rock and roll.’ But that’s what she thought.”

Play

Apparently Mama Diffie warmed to the song – although she probably didn’t have much of a choice because it would eventually go on to become one of her son’s most popular songs even though it never hit #1 on the charts.

The chart performance didn’t seem to matter though because the song obviously became a fan-favorite and may be even more popular almost 30 years later than it was when it was first released. Diffie even admitted that it was the first song that fans would yell for at concerts.

And it just goes to show you that the debate around what’s “country” and what’s not isn’t new. If “John Deere Green” was “rock and roll” in the ’90s (at least according to Joe Diffie’s mom) you’ve gotta wonder which songs that aren’t considered “country” now will eventually be looked at as country classic.

(DTN/Progressive Farmer photo by Jim Patrico)

AJ and Kellie Blair are fixing a large wooden fencepost on the corner of a harvested cornfield. A few weeks ago a combine driver backed into the post and knocked it over. With harvest done the young couple finally has time to repair the damage before setting up an electric fence and turning cattle into the cornstalks.

They brought three work vehicles to the field with them: a front loader to do the heavy work a side-by-side to carry electric fenceposts and tools and an ATV to get the Blairs where they need to go in a hurry.

Sure enough they forgot a tool and AJ hops onto the Polaris Sportsman 450 H.O. EPS to hustle back to the shop.

""I thought we might be moving away from the ATV when we bought the side-by-side three or four years ago"" AJ says later. ""But the four-wheeler is just so handy to hop on and go.""

ATV FOR ALL SEASONS

Seems the Blairs always need to get somewhere in a hurry on their diversified farm in central Iowa near Dayton. They use an ATV for checking cattle in their feedlot and cow-calf operations. They put it in the back of the pickup when cropping chores take them to the far reaches of the farm and Kellie uses it for scouting fields during the growing season.

All of these uses and more make the Blairs the perfect farm couple to test the Polaris which they did for about three months in 2021 through harvest and into the late fall.

Bottom line for them Kellie says: ""This particular Polaris was a basic model without a lot of bells and whistles which is fine because we don't need a lot of bells and whistles. We want something that will get us from one place to another and this one worked really well for us.""

MACHINE SPECIFICS

Here are some facts on the Sportsman 450 H.O. EPS for model year 2022.

-- VALUE. It's one of the smaller ATVs in the Polaris lineup and the company advertises it as a ""value"" model.

-- ENGINE. The Sportsman 450 H.O. has a liquid-cooled Prostar 4-Stroke SOHC single-cylinder engine that generates 33 hp and is fed by an electronic fuel-injection system. It uses a Polaris Variable Transmission (PVT) which is designed to change gears depending on vehicle power engine output and variable load condition. An in-line shifter is located on the right side of the body. The Sportsman 450 features on-demand all-wheel drive which is activated with a switch on the handlebar.

-- SUSPENSION. Polaris is proud of the Sportsman 450's suspension system which has sealed MacPherson front struts with an 8.2-inch travel. The independent rear suspension system features dual A-arms with a 9.5-inch travel. With standard 25-inch 6-ply tires ground clearance is 11.5 inches.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3JlLmNvbS9wZ2EvbmV3cy8yMzEwMjkx0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc2NvcmUuY29tL3BnYS9uZXdzLzIzMTAyOTEvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trying to keep PGA TOUR status Brehm leads Puerto Rico Open,"RIO GRANDE Puerto Rico (AP) — Fighting to keep PGA Tour status Ryan Brehm shot a 4-under 68 in rainy conditions Saturday to open a three-stroke lead in the Puerto Rico Open.

Brehm with wife Chelsey at his side as his caddie is making his final start on a minor medical extension and needs to win or finish second alone to retain status. He had a 15-under 201 total at Grand Reserve.

“Obviously if you would have given me that at the start of the week I’d have taken it” Brehm said. “There’s just so much golf left. I mean honestly all Chelsey and I are trying to do is make one good swing after another and march along. That’s really all we’re trying to do.”

The 35-year-old Brehm is winless on the PGA Tour. He's ranked 773rd in the world.

“I know that somebody’s going to play well probably more than one person so it’s up to me to go out and do my job and play my game” Brehm said. “We’re probably not going to change much strategically. We’ll hit irons off some tees and drivers off others.”

Michael Kim was second after a 70. Since winning the John Deere Classic in 2018 Kim has made only 16 cuts in 76 starts on the PGA Tour including one stretch of 25 consecutive events without making it to the weekend. He was No. 75 in the world when he won and now No. 1030.

“It’s been a while since I’ve been in contention but felt really comfortable out there comfortable with my game and really looking forward to tomorrow” Lee said.

Chad Ramey (68) Andrew Novak (69) Tommy Gainey (69) and Max McGreevy (71) were 11 under.

University of Oklahoma senior Chris Gotterup was 10 under after a 70. Making his PGA Tour debut he won the Puerto Rico Classic collegiate event two weeks ago at Grand Reserve.

Puerto Rico native Rafa Campos shot a 73 to drop to 5 under.

The event is being played opposite the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando Florida. The winner will receive a two-year exemption and gets in the PGA Championship but will not be exempt for the Masters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3JvZ2VyLXZpbmNpb24tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzM1MzU1NDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Vincion Obituary - Sellars Funeral Home at Mt.

Cue the last-minute scramble to Google this year's nominees binge a few of the buzzier films and wonder to yourself if Olivia Colman has been stranded inside AAA (Academy Award International Airport) for the last four years. (If so we have some airline miles you can borrow Ms. Colman!)

If you're like me this scramble usually involves watching a year's worth of trailers and reading a few self-important reviews so you can formulate approximately one minute of intelligent monologue for each potential winner. But thanks to a third year of being mostly at home due to the pandemic I've actually seen most of these distinguished films documentaries and shorts.

Should you find yourself needing to catch up on the Academy Award nominees you're in luck: You can watch most of the contenders on your next flight via inflight entertainment libraries and streaming services.

Here are my nine nominees for the best films to watch on your next flight — and which viewing platforms to use.

'Dune'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

At the risk of immediately diminishing all of my credibility I'll admit that this is the only film on the list I haven't actually seen. However as a vaguely conscious millennial I do know a few things about it.

The latest iteration which is nominated for best picture and best visual effects plus eight other awards is the first installment of a two-part adaptation from the prolific science fiction novel of the same name. It follows Timothée Chalamet (who plays protagonist Paul Atreides) as he fights an intergalactic system of feudalism tastefully small weapon and sharply chiseled jawline in tow. And if you are tuning in for Queen Z (aka Zendaya) you'll be sorely disappointed as she only appears on screen as character Chani Kynes for seven minutes.

Sound bites aside ""Dune"" the novel paved the way for iconic franchises like ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek."" Even though I haven't seen this most recent film adaptation its mere presence alone makes ""Dune"" well worth the high-altitude watch.

Where to watch: on American Airlines Delta Air Lines and United Airlines and via Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video.

'No Time to Die'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

Move over Daniel Craig. There's a new 007 on our screens.

Lashana Lynch stars as Nomi the lethally talented agent who took over the 007 alias following the conclusion of ""Spectre."" Lynch made history as the first black woman to hold this emblematic title. In classic fashion Craig's character doesn't stay retired for long as a new threat to the world with a mysterious connection to James Bond's past sends the 007's of yesterday and today on an epic mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist.

The Bond movies are famous for their ominous and artful title sequences and ""No Time to Die"" is no exception. This new version begins with a haunting original song from Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell earning the sibling duo their first nomination for best music (original song) from the Academy. The film is also nominated in the best sound and best visual effects categories.

Where to watch: on American Airlines and Southwest Airlines and via Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video.

'Spencer'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

""Spencer"" is not a biopic. I repeat: ""Spencer"" is not a biopic. Instead the film hones in on the royal family's 1991 Christmas celebration in Norfolk England when Princess Diana has reached her breaking point.

Alternating between dizzying vignettes of the princess of Wales' spiral out of Buckingham Palace's good graces and gut wrenchingly heartfelt scenes with Princes William and Harry ""Spencer"" emboldens its audience to take a fresh empathetic look at a beloved figure from history.

Anchored by a beautifully nuanced and career-making performance by Kristen Stewart who is nominated in the best actress in a leading role category ""Spencer"" leaves us with many things to love. Stewart haters do yourselves a favor and sit this one out.

Where to watch: on Delta Air Lines and United Airlines and via Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video.

'Luca'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

The most streamed movie of 2021 according to audience insights firm Nielsen best animated feature film-nominated ""Luca"" is a pure delight. The latest coming-of-age tale from Pixar Animation Studios follows a shy but curious sea monster Luca as he explores life above the water's surface.

I will be honest about my affinity for this animated gem — this is an LGBTQI+ movie no questions about it. For starters it was released in June 2021 (aka Pride Month) and chronicles the friendship between two boys (ahem sea monsters) who realize they share an alienating difference that both bonds the boys to one another and garners disapproval from their communities. They quite literally turn into rainbow creatures when they are presenting as their truest most authentic selves.

Metaphors aside Luca is a must-watch movie due to its nostalgic stop-motion style fantastic voice acting and important universal message.

Where to watch: on Southwest Airlines and via Disney+.

'Cruella'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

Is Disney's focus on live-action movies getting a bit tired? Yes it sure is. Well at least that's what I thought until last summer when I saw ""Cruella"" which features Emma Stone as the young up-and-coming fashion talent Estella who evolves from orphan prodigy to diabolically iconic Disney villain Cruella.

Throughout the film you'll notice a few deviations from the animated classic. To start Disney finally reveals the story behind Cruella's deep-running hatred of Dalmatians. There are also the absence of the character's signature cigarette holder and the addition of a dress with a 40-foot train made entirely of garbage. In fact ""Cruella"" clinched a much-deserved Oscar nod for best costume design (in addition to a nomination for best makeup and hairstyling) thanks to the work of wildly talented Jenny Beavan.

Feeling territorial over Glenn Close's 1996 portrayal in ""101 Dalmatians""? Never fear — she served as an executive producer for this 2021 remake ensuring the villain remained ""perfectly wretched"" and just a bit more humanized.

Where to watch: on Southwest Airlines and via Disney+.

'King Richard'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

How could you possibly father raise and train not one but two of the most decorated athletes of a generation maybe even of all time? ""King Richard"" takes a peek at how Richard Williams a man from Compton California did just that while raising tennis phenoms Venus and Serena Williams.

Played by the ever-lovable Will Smith Richard Williams is just one of many incredible characters in this part-biopic part-sports movie flick but there's more to ""King Richard"" than its cast.

The film's flawless tennis sequences enhance the plot and heighten the emotional intensity felt throughout standing out in a genre that's often dominated by action scenes that seem stunted and ostentatious. At its core it shows the powerful desire by a father to provide a better life for his children — a classic American dream tale many viewers can relate to. It's no wonder then that it scored a slew of nominations for everything from best original screenplay to best picture.

Where to watch: via HBO Max and Apple TV+.

'Don't Look Up'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

To put it bluntly: The critics got this one wrong. Prominent reviews have used all kinds of creative phrases to express dissatisfaction with ""Don't Look Up"" but that's not what you'll get from me an everyday viewer with no authority on the matter. Fortunately enough folks at the Academy share my sentiment to have nominated it for categories like best picture and best original screenplay.

""Don't Look Up"" is satire in its highest form and incredibly campy in its approach. It parodies the inevitable demise of our planet and our ""leaders"" selfish inaction through the story of two scientists who are propelled into mainstream politics when they realize a giant meteor is on a catastrophic collision course with Earth. If its thought-provoking complexities are not enough to persuade you to watch its amazingly talented cast — including Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Meryl Streep and Timothée Chalamet among others — will.

This film is a lightning rod and a skewer. It's the artistic adaptation of the real-world concern many of us have about the state of our planet and the lack of progress by our leaders to protect it. The less you know about it going in the more you will enjoy it. Trust me; you won't regret watching it.

Where to watch: via Netflix.

'The Power of the Dog'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

It's Kirsten Dunst's world and we are all simply living in it. That's the easy part. Describing ""The Power of the Dog"" (which has been nominated for a mind-boggling 12 awards including best picture and best directing) is a bit more difficult.

This film tests the confines of its genre depicting the psychologically complex dynamic of a family against the tried-and-true backdrop of the Wild West. Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays Phil Burbank) delivers a scathingly visceral performance that serves as a cautionary tale of the far-reaching impacts of toxic masculinity. Jesse Plemons and Dunst (a real-life married couple who portray newlyweds George Burbank and Rose Gordon) also deliver in a big way making a relationship in the era of straw mattresses somehow seem quite enviable.

""The Power of the Dog"" is the type of film that will have you initially thinking it's going in one direction before ultimately tossing aside any predictions for where the story will go as you'll be proven wrong 10 times over by the time the credits are rolling.

Where to watch: via Netflix.

'The French Dispatch'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

Although this most recent offering from director Wes Anderson didn't receive any nominations making it by far the biggest snub of the 94th Academy Awards it is a love letter to print journalism that you won't want to miss.

""The French Dispatch"" may well be the perfect movie choice for a flight as it is constructed episodically as three stories told in a fictional magazine's final issue. While it may lack some of the narrative earnestness and mass appeal of Anderson's early works it possesses everything else you could possibly want and expect from the acclaimed director. The set design and color palette are a five-course meal. The plots are both absurdly dramatic and hilariously quirky. And the cast boasts so many stars (think: Tilda Swinton Owen Wilson Frances McDormand and Benicio del Toro among others) that it could be an Academy nomination meeting in and of itself.

It is truly criminal that ""The French Dispatch"" was shut out of all Oscars categories especially best cinematography and best production design.

Where to watch: on United Airlines and via HBO Max and Amazon Prime Video.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1leWVzLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tZC1jLXRvLWNhcGUtdG93bi1zZXJ2aWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines Eyes Washington D.C. to Cape Town Service,"[ Routes ] By Winston Shek

In an application with the Department of Transportation United Airlines filed for the rights to fly between Washington-Dulles and Cape Town South Africa with its Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. If accepted these flights will commence around November 17 2022 with thrice-weekly services on Tuesdays Fridays and Sundays.

The proposed flight would depart Washington-Dulles at 6:30 P.M. and arrive in Cape Town at 4:15 P.M. the following day. The flight would return from Cape Town at 9 P.M. and arrive in Washington-Dulles at 6 A.M the next day. These flights would operate year-round with “seasonal flexibility to adjust capacity to potential fluctuations in demand.”

United Airlines touts its ability to offer multiple services to South Africa including its flights from Newark/New York to Johannesburg South Africa and Cape Town South Africa. With both flights to Cape Town the Chicago-based carrier proposes a combination of near-daily services to Cape Town. In total United Airlines would enhance consumer access to 45 destinations serving nearly 90 percent of all U.S. to Cape Town demand. From Cape Town United Airlines’ passengers can experience further connectivity via a codeshare with Airlink and access 15 destinations in Botswana Namibia South Africa and Zimbabwe.

United Airlines would add its fifth service from the United States to the continent of Africa and add its third African service from Washington-Dulles. In 2021 the carrier improved its connectivity to West Africa by adding flights from Washington-Dulles to Accra Ghana and Lagos Nigeria on its Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. United Airlines hopes to intensify its competition on Delta Airlines the largest U.S. carrier to Africa and the incumbent carrier to Africa.

Washington-Dulles would receive its first service to Cape Town South Africa. In the past South African Airways operated a daily nonstop service between Washington-Dulles and Johannesburg before converting the flight into a Johannesburg to Dakar Senegal to Washington-Dulles routing. Later South African Airways changed the routing with a stop either in Dakar or Accra and suspended the route in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

United Airlines plans to operate the 257-seat Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Cape Town to Washington D.C. This aircraft features 48 Polaris Business class seats 21 Premium Plus seats 39 Economy Plus seats and 149 economy class seats.

Competition with Delta Air Lines

Similarly Delta Airlines applied for the rights for thrice-weekly flights between Atlanta and Cape Town in February 2022. These flights would commence on November 18 2022 with 305-seat Airbus A350-900 service supplementing existing service from Atlanta to Johannesburg. Delta Airlines would depart Atlanta at 8:45 P.M. arriving in Cape Town at 6:45 P.M. the following day. The aircraft would depart Cape Town at 9 P.M. arriving in Atlanta at 6:25 A.M. the next day.

However allocated flights between South Africa and the United States are limited with only 21 frequencies and there are currently only four frequencies available. Since both carriers are competing for frequencies United Airlines replied to Delta Airlines’ application claiming that Delta Air Lines’ proposal offers unpredictability and lacks vision. The airline cited that the Atlanta-based carrier terminated services in April 2020 due to the retirement of its Boeing 777-200LR the aircraft most suitable for services to South Africa.

Earlier in 2020 and 2021 Delta Air Lines proposed a triangle route from Atlanta to Johannesburg to Cape Town to Atlanta spurred out of the need to operate flights at a maximum payload on the Airbus A350. Later this proposal was rejected by the South African Government and now Delta Airlines connects Atlanta and Johannesburg nonstop.

In a reply to Delta Air Lines United Airlines proposed that if Delta Air Lines agrees each carrier should split the frequencies so that each airline receives two each. Therefore this leaves the Department of Transportation with the opportunity to grant rights to either Delta Air Lines or United Airlines or split the frequencies between both carriers.

DVN,Devon Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L3RoZXNlLTMtb2lsLXN0b2Nrcy1hcmUtY2FzaGluZy1pbi1hcy1jcnVkZS1wcmljZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 3 Oil Stocks Are Cashing in as Crude Prices Top $100 a Barrel for the First Time in Years,"Higher oil prices are a boon for these oil stocks.

Oil prices continue their ascent this year recently topping $100 a barrel as Russia invaded Ukraine. They could push even higher if global governments place direct sanctions on Russia's oil industry. That would make an already tight oil market -- fueled by growing demand following the pandemic and years of underinvestment -- even tighter.

These higher oil prices are benefiting oil producers. Three oil stocks currently cashing in on triple-digit crude prices are Chevron (CVX 1.28%) Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN 0.63%). Here's why they're ideal options for investors who want to play the return of triple-digit oil prices.

Using the gains wisely

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Chevron): When U.S.-integrated energy giant Chevron reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings they were nothing short of impressive. Revenues came in at $48.1 billion with earnings of $5.05 billion or $2.63 per share. That was well above Q4 2020 when the company lost $0.33 per share on revenues of $25.2 billion. The big driver of the year-over-year improvement was basically rising oil prices. Given that oil prices continue to rise first-quarter 2022 results are likely to be just as impressive.

So clearly Chevron is cashing in on the high price of oil right now. But that's not what's most interesting here. What's more important is what Chevron is doing with this windfall and that's investing for the future -- only not the future of oil the future of cleaner alternatives. The company just announced plans to buy Renewable Energy Group (REGI). This $3.15 billion all-cash deal brings with it a collection of refining assets that use things like used cooking oil waste animal fats and vegetable oils as feedstocks. These renewable fuels allow Chevron to stick to its core as it greens its business.

Notably Chevron has been slow to shift toward cleaner alternatives which has aggravated ESG-inclined investors. However it is now proving that it has the scale and thanks to oil price increases the financial capacity to quickly get into emerging clean energy areas via acquisitions. So not only is Chevron benefiting mightily from higher oil prices but it's making sure that it makes good use of the opportunity that high prices are affording it.

A gusher of cash flow and dividends

Matt DiLallo (Pioneer Natural Resources): Pioneer Natural Resources made two bold moves when oil prices were lower setting it up to cash in on a future rebound in the oil market. In late 2020 it bought Parsley Energy for $7.6 billion. Last year it followed that up by spending $6.2 billion on DoublePoint Energy. The deals expanded its oil production and scale while reducing its costs.

These acquisitions enabled Pioneer Natural Resources to cash in on higher oil prices last year. The oil producer hauled in a record $3.2 billion in free cash in 2021. That included $1.9 billion in Q4 fueled by oil prices that averaged $76.38 per barrel in the period. Pioneer returned $1.9 billion of that money to shareholders via dividends and its share-repurchase program.

With crude oil recently topping $100 a barrel Pioneer will generate an even bigger cash flow gusher this year. That sets the company up to pay out an enormous amount of dividends given its unique framework. In addition to its base dividend -- which Pioneer recently increased by 25% -- it pays a variable dividend of up to 75% of its excess free cash flow each quarter. At $100 a barrel Pioneer could pay out up to $27 per share in dividends this year. That implies a potential dividend yield of more than 11% at the recent share price in the $240s. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) the U.S. oil-price benchmark was recently above $110 a barrel. The rise in crude prices will give Pioneer even more free cash flow to pay out in dividends.

That dividend framework makes Pioneer Natural Resources a great way for investors to cash in on higher crude prices this year.

Expect big dividends as oil prices rise

Neha Chamaria (Devon Energy): Given the unprecedented rally in oil prices investors in Devon Energy can expect a windfall. That's not an exaggeration. Devon Energy's war chest must be swelling with every rise in oil price and the company wants to return a large chunk of those incremental cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends. In other words as Devon cashes in on higher oil prices so should its investors.

Mid-February Devon reported stunning numbers for 2021. Its operating cash flow tripled in the year and the company generated its highest-ever free cash flows all thanks to higher commodity prices. The company didn't just boost its dividend but also its share-repurchase program.

Wait. To say Devon simply boosted its dividend would be an understatement. The thing is Devon pays a fixed as well as a variable dividend under a new dividend policy it initiated in 2021. So far every quarter Devon was paying a fixed dividend of $0.11 per share and a variable dividend equal to 50% of the extra cash flow it's left with after covering its capital expenditure and fixed dividend.

That policy has brought in solid passive income to shareholders so far including a record total dividend of $1.00 per share they're about to receive based on the company's stellar Q4 cash flow growth.

Now Devon has increased its fixed quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share. At the same time its variable dividend component should zoom now that crude oil has surpassed $100 per barrel. With Devon's lower cost production also rising after its merger with WPX Energy in early 2021 it's a win-win time to be a shareholder in this 4.5%-yielding stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Real estate industry too despite facing multiple challenges in the past five years continues to be the preferred investment option for Indians. We expect robust growth coming this year at the back of new trends and technological interventions.

Last year the contribution of Indian real estate has emerged as one of the biggest drivers for the economic recovery in a time when numerous industries took the hit. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as more conducive policy reforms like reduction of stamp duty in multiple states lowest possible home loan interest rates et al.

Our industry has transformed itself by focussing on customer-centricity which has emerged as the winning mantra helping us post exponential growth in the last few months especially in MMR region. The MMR region has become the newest outlier in the Indian real estate with record number of housing registrations and new launches. The COVID-19 pandemic has also aided growth by making home ownership as the number 1 priority across the world.

Moving forward as the sector is looking at emerging technologies materials processes that help develop a superior quality home in a shorter time frame here is a list of mega trends which are currently being witnessed in the sector and are expected to continue to shape the future of Indian realty:

Sustainable realty is the new choice for the conscious homebuyer

As the world prepares to counter the effects of climate change every bit done to minimise environmental degradation will go a long way in saving the planet. Over the past few years we have seen consumers becoming increasingly conscious about their carbon footprint. Today's new-age consumers are conscious of their lifestyle choices and aim for sustainable living.

Developers are thus undertaking multiple initiatives and adopting green building practices such as solid waste management water recycling rainwater harvesting utilisation of renewable sources of energy efficient design that optimises natural ventilation and ensures adequate blue and green infrastructure in their properties. While such practices became the norm some time ago 2022 is expected to witness more of such environment-friendly building processes.

Digital-first approach is becoming more mainstream

The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digitisation across sectors including the real estate industry. Due to restrictions posed by the pandemic as buyers were forced to stay indoors developers had to pivot to more innovative digital solutions to ensure continued demand. Practices like AR sightseeing online open houses as well as virtual bookings became more common. While as of now only a limited number of developers have adopted digital solutions with this New Year we hope to see digitisation becoming more mainstream across the industry - with smart contracts and unique virtual experiences for homebuyers.

Workspaces are a part of new-age homes

Next gen home buyers have started buying homes with workspaces and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years. What started as a necessity during the pandemic has now become a part of the lifestyle with more and more organisations permitting remote working and hybrid option to their workforce. Many developers already have a supply which has a dedicated workspaces to cater to this need.

With all these trends taking shape in the realty ecosystem we see a new futuristic era of real estate development in India as it bounces back as a leader in best practices of real estate at a world stage. With its young population and demand for growth India is well suited for positive trends for the coming years. When the pandemic comes to an end millennials will be approaching the average age to become first-time homebuyers. As the newest and largest generation of buyers millennials will push new housing patterns and digital demands in real estate.

The realty sector in India is one of the pillars of the economy and is the second-most elevated business generator in the country after agriculture as the sector is interlinked to 250+ allied industries. The sector contributes almost 6-7 percent of the economy and is set to increase to around 13 per cent by 2025. All in all the future will be a harbinger of growth innovation and investment for the residential real estate sector.

Sooner rather than later every finance company will be a crypto company. The trends are clear. Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum as an asset and a payment option.

For many reasons it’s not hard to see why the finance industry is coming around to crypto. Traditional financial service providers want to build a bridge to the crypto economy for their customers looking for higher yield investments. Customers appear to be ready for banks to be their onramp to crypto. A December 2020 survey by Cornerstone Advisors showed that 60% of cryptocurrency holders would definitely use their bank if it offered them the opportunity to invest in digital assets. The same study revealed that 65% of banks and 76% of credit unions said fintech partnerships will be important to their business strategies. For the institutions that are taking longer than expected it’s mostly due to general operational due diligence . When these institutions finally enter they'll do so at scale. As crypto investor Mike Novogratz said “ The Herd Is Coming .”

Today crypto adoption and investment are accelerating. According to Pymnts  nearly 75% of consumers view cryptocurrency as an investment opportunity. The study also found 60% of crypto holders want to transact with it. Global VC funding for blockchain firms surged to a record $25B in 2021. Over 1000 blockchain deals were executed in 2021 surpassing 2020’s level of 662. Of those 2021 deals 79% were early-stage investments. A few examples of finance companies leaning into crypto include headlines like:

Still I am amazed by how many finance companies and startups don’t have crypto as a part of their business pitch. I recently spoke with a Fintech founder and asked him if he’s considering offering crypto as an option for his customers. To my dismay I learned that crypto wouldn’t be on his roadmap for at least 12 months. Turns out his lack of consideration was not because of why but a question of how. To this I replied “Crypto mullet.”

A mullet is a hairstyle with the hair cut short in the front but longer in the back. The front presents as serious and confident compared to the exciting irreverent and textured hair flowing behind. Business in the front party in the back. To some the description is analogous to crypto in that the traditional finance front end will allow access to crypto for more conservative users. Fintech in the front crypto in the back.

Bankless a popular podcast wholeheartedly embraces this thesis that finance companies will increasingly move towards crypto. In one of my favorite episodes  Bankless explains the “ DeFi mullet ” from the Fintech side of things and explores how financial institutions are leveling up with the infrastructure provided by crypto startups. As they explain when you add crypto as a feature to your platform a few things happen:

Increased engagement across other products

Increased revenue generation

Participation at the bleeding edge of innovation

Increased market cap

Crypto mullets are playing out in front of our eyes across every sector of finance. Financial and commercial activity has moved in the direction of crypto especially with Mastercard offering innovative crypto loyalty solutions  Visa’s crypto-linked card usage hitting $2.5 billion in its first quarter and conferences like Money2020  covering the sector more thoroughly.

According to The Block Research  traditional financial institutions want to distribute crypto products or use crypto as backend infrastructure due to the increased client demands. Some of the top institutions are not only hiring digital asset leadership and incubating projects but also outsourcing their crypto infrastructure for trading exchange-traded products  custody and more.

Fintech startups once viewed as the disruptors of traditional finance are being disrupted. One Fintech using the crypto mullet well is mobile banking app Current . Current aims to answer peoples' need for easy access to participate in the cryptoeconomy while building wealth. Late in 2021 Current announced plans to provide its 3M+ customers with hybrid financial products. Current has enlisted backend support from Coinbase Cloud in its bid to combine DeFi services with the best of its traditional offerings. Coinbase Cloud provides the infrastructure that allows Current to build products with a seamless user experience that blends high-yield DeFi with traditional finance applications. Current Chief Technology Officer Trevor Marshall told CoinDesk in an interview “We’ve flirted with bringing crypto back into our project for a while now but there were always obstacles in the way. When DeFi really took off in 2019 we were able to get over a lot of the technical hurdles.”

Fintechs like Current are abstracting away the complexities through our crypto infrastructure — while capturing all of the benefits of offering crypto. There are various ways finance companies can offer products on top of our node infrastructure to improve financial outcomes for customers. For one by leveraging our scalable node infrastructure companies can expand their product offering with a multi-chain staking service and provide staking for their customers with integration support from Coinbase engineers throughout the development process and no coding required.

If finance companies don’t add crypto to their roadmap then crypto-native companies will continue flooding the bottom of the existing market until relentlessly moving up and displacing their largest competitors. Finance companies are already faced with the innovator’s dilemma; most don’t know it yet. But with the blazing pace of innovation that could change in a matter of days. Coinbase Cloud can get a finance company from A to Z quickly and easily.

Context: Hong Kong government announces HK$10000 e-voucher handouts

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po revealed during last month’s budget speech a basket of relief measures for individuals and businesses. A repeat of last year’s e-voucher scheme is among the highlights.

Under the plan 6.6 million eligible residents will be able to receive HK$10000 worth of digital vouchers through electronic payment platforms. The money can be used in restaurants and shops and on public transport.

Eligibility for the vouchers remains the same as last year’s. This means new immigrants from mainland China and permanent residents aged 18 or above are qualified.

Face Off: How helpful will the HK$5000 vouchers be?

Chan said the previous round of digital coupons cost the government HK$36 billion and boosted growth by at least 0.7 per cent. The bill for the latest round is estimated to reach HK$66.4 billion and is projected to boost the economy by 1.2 per cent.

“Hong Kong residents especially the grass roots face financial pressure during this difficult time so we hope they can spend the money on what they need” he said adding the new round would last longer and people could take their time in spending the money.

Residents who signed up for last year’s handout will automatically receive the first instalment of HK$5000 in April. But for those who previously chose Octopus as their electronic wallet they will receive HK$4000 and HK$1000 in two payments that month.

People who did not register for last year’s vouchers will have to apply this time around.

For the remaining instalment expected to be disbursed in the summer every eligible Hongkonger would have to reapply so that electronic payment systems which did not participate in last year’s scheme could join Chan said.

The existing payment platforms are Octopus Cards AlipayHK WeChat Pay HK and Tap & Go.

Other one-off measures to ease the financial strain of residents included a salaries tax cut of up to HK$10000 for more than 2 million residents rates concessions totalling as much as HK$5000 for residential properties a HK$1000 electricity tariff subsidy for every household and a fee waiver for university entrance exams.

News: Concern groups call for cash instead of consumption vouchers for underprivileged

In response to the government’s announcement to hand out HK$10000 in digital vouchers to 6.6 million eligible Hongkongers some concern groups and politicians argue cash would serve many struggling residents far better.

The Concerning Grassroots Housing Rights Alliance said cash handouts would have been more beneficial to low-income residents who could easily spend the money on rent and other bills.

Legislator and New People’s Party member Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee who is also a top adviser to city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor agreed that cash handouts were more preferable than e-wallet deposits although she too welcomed the initiative.

“A large number of people are out of work or suffering income loss under the pandemic” she said. “Offering cash should be more helpful. And by issuing consumption vouchers you are basically benefiting restaurants retail shops and the electronic payment platforms.”

Shop owners on the other hand had a mixed reaction to news of the handouts. Waye Chong 32 who runs a Taiwanese food shop in North Point said the scheme offered only a limited boost to his business.

“It is hard for us to compete with the big companies and consumers have a low desire to spend during the pandemic” he said.

Chong called on the government to launch more direct funding or offer subsidies to small businesses if the pandemic failed to improve.

David Yeun Chun-kit 32 a personal trainer welcomed the initiative as it eased some of the stress surrounding his job security. He said he planned to buy more personal protective gear with his vouchers.

A previous survey by the Democratic Party also found 70 per cent of 550 respondents preferred cash handouts.

However Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the main objective of the scheme was to boost local retail consumption. Unlike cash vouchers cannot be spent on rent or taxes nor can they be saved indefinitely.

“If the epidemic situation is not completely controlled and going out is not encouraged in April you can choose to shop online” he said. “Or you can choose to spend it later. There is still plenty of time.”

Issue: Hong Kong finance chief acknowledges concerns over e-vouchers

During a radio programme last month Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po pledged to help those who took part in last year’s voucher scheme but had cancelled their Octopus cards or deleted their electronic payment apps to get their first instalment on time in April.

“We hope to distribute the first half of HK$5000 in vouchers to those greatly impacted by the epidemic as soon as possible. They have the flexibility to decide when to use it” Chan said.

But some callers who dialled into the radio programme were worried about being excluded because of changes to the electronic wallets they had registered.

Lack of clarity from authorities on lockdown has fuelled panic buying

“I replaced my Octopus card with the JoyYou card when I turned 60. Does that mean I can’t get the first batch of money?” asked a woman named Wan referring to the personalised version of Octopus that allows seniors to take public transport at a discount.

“I deleted the Tap & Go app after its chaotic delivery of vouchers last year. As I no longer remember my account number and password what should I do?” asked another middle-aged woman named Lai.

In addition to Octopus Tap & Go AlipayHK and WeChat Pay HK were the other payment platforms recognised by the government to distribute the previous round of vouchers.

Chan conceded that the performance of certain platforms was “unsatisfactory” last year and said his colleagues were working out how to allow those in similar situations to get their vouchers as soon as possible.

Separately at a Legislative Council Finance Committee meeting Chan was asked whether residents who registered for the scheme and had since emigrated would receive the vouchers. He told lawmakers the government would review the eligibility requirement after the April payment had been disbursed.

Jessie Wong Hok-ling head of the budget and tax policy unit in the Financial Secretary’s Office said it was difficult for immigration authorities to determine whether a person leaving Hong Kong was equivalent to emigration.

She added that there would be self-declaration requirements to ensure the applicant lived in the city.

In this interview with JOSEPHINE OKOJIE she spoke about her ministry and the vision behind it. Excerpts:

Can you share with us your journey into the ministry?

Bosede Adetunji is a woman that has always loved to serve God and wants to be God’s tool to HIS creatures since 1988 when I confessed Jesus as my Lord. I hailed from Ile-Ife Osun State and lived all my childhood and adulthood in Ibadan Oyo State until I got married and relocated to Lagos. I have a BSc in mass communication majored in public relations and a minor in broadcasting. My Christian journey is filled with many challenges triumphs victories uphill and many others that you cannot imagine. But in it all God has always been faithful and proven His Majesty in each situation. I had always known I would be God’s instrument because of the diverse experiences and encounters I have had. Ever before the opportunity to travel overseas with my husband and children came I had been shown in dreams and diverse forms. I was a key member of the women’s ministry and my activities were always different compared to other leaders. Even though I served in many ministries of which I always wanted to belong to the children’s ministry. But never knew that the passion of not being able to withstand a woman crying or being cheated could override that of children.

My husband was graced to bring the entire family to the USA through the visa lottery program. I discovered after my wedlock that my husband was a God’s covenant child it was then many of the aged dreams started unfolding. And after many efforts to avoid the ‘Church’ part of the ministry failed we succumbed to God’s grip and dived into God’s original intention for my husband to start a church in 2006 in the USA which I co-Pastor along with him.

How did you get the inspiration for ‘The Esteemed Woman’ and what is the vision behind the ministry?

The inspiration came as an instruction from a dream which I thought was for the church we belong to at that time. I narrated the dream to our first lady as to the way God wanted the women in the ministry to be handled. But the same dream came with the same instructions three years and six months after we had left ministry and two years after my husband and I had started our Church which also had its own women’s ministry already! So it was very tough for me to start or promote or expand it. I have to technically relinquish my role from the church’s women’s ministry to be an overseer.

Read also: Heritage Bank NGO position women for wealth creation

Prayerfully I drafted one of the church leaders to become the president. But I got tongue lashed all the way because no one was in my hot-shoes to feel the heat; or heard each whisper of the Holy Spirit’s instructions. The vision started as it is with the instruction…‘Lily in His Hands’ …women are as precious as these flowers in My Hands. And that was exactly the registered name in the USA. Until the passion for seniors started coming up then God approved of the WhatsUp Seniors and Recreation; But reminded and instructed me that women are to be Highly Esteemed in every platform I operate in thus the birth of The Esteemed Woman and its separation for Lily In His Hands came into being. The vision statement is to help women overcome obstacles of purpose vision and mindset into the full potential of success & wealth irrespective of what their background story is.

Who is your target audience and what mediums are you using to get your audience?

The target audience is women with their visions life purpose and mindsets. And I am not going to change that. But men are always welcome in our conferences. I learnt that men that go or support their wife to conferences grow to be more understanding. I reach women through my podcasts and weekly teachings through Facebook Instagram LinkedIn also have a YouTube channel on The Esteemed Woman.

You are so passionate about God and the things of God. Are you a Pastor?

Yes I am an ordained Pastor

You are also passionate about women; does that mean you are only called for the women’s ministry alone?

Yes I am passionate about women. But I currently have a bend to the feathers on my cap. It was after the advent of The Esteemed Woman that I got my certification as Life Coach from LCTI; and Leadership Coach through John Maxwell Team. So when you listen to my videos or my live broadcast I combine women to visions business and leadership topics. So my audience determines my pitches and statements.

What are the challenges you are facing in the ministry and how are you managing them?

The challenge is we the women. And it is more of our mindset no wonder God is sending more women into the field of empowerment and mind-shift messages. We are the most multitask creature God created. We do and give to other creatures but forget ourselves at the backside. A high percentage of us are yet to discover how valuable we are thus making our development to be more social (that is what people can see) rather than our economical and personal developments. In essence we are more occupied with others to the detriment of ourselves.

Apart from the ministry do you run a business?

Yes. I am a CPR Instructor. I teach individuals healthcare providers and agencies how to do CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation). I sell my speeches too; I am a public speaker at church events. I also sell my books through my website and Amazon.

Where do you see the Esteemed Woman in the next five years?

I see the waves of God’s blessing moving The Esteemed Woman across nations. As God has opened the gates and doors of Nigeria even during the pandemic I am in no doubt that the same hands of God will bring womanhood to the knowledge of valuing themselves by adding values to their gifts and visions to live in the purpose God has for all.

How are you managing the ministry business and family?

It was tough at the inception but God has always been faithful. Aside from granting peace on all sides He is always been in the business of sending help at intervals like physical moral and financial help from people has been tremendous.

What is your advice to that young person who wants to go into ministry?

My advice for a younger person who’s willing to go into ministry is to be convinced of who she is. This is what will make her self-esteem to be broadened and strong. Otherwise passing through the hurdles of the process might be strenuous or difficult. Shalom!",,,,,,

Dollar stores national chains that sell a wide variety of goods at around a dollar if not exactly thanks to inflation are a large presence on the Baltimore retail scene with over 50 locations across the city with more on the way. Critics say the major chains - Dollar Tree Family Dollar and Dollar General – target economically distressed areas and often squeeze out locally-run businesses.

Now legislation is up for debate in the Maryland General Assembly that proposes to place restrictions on these “small-box” stores in Baltimore to try to prevent oversaturation and nudge these chains into becoming “good partners.”



“These dollar stores say ‘I know our model will undercut everybody around and then we'll become the only game in town’” Sen. State Mary Washington said. “That is the definition of predatory. It just has no place in Baltimore City and in any neighborhood that's trying to recover.”

Washington is sponsoring the bill in the General Assembly and said the idea for the legislation came from the experience of her district. She represents a part of north Baltimore with a high concentration of dollar stores and the trend doesn’t seem to be slowing down.

There is a Dollar General at 25th Street and Greenmount Avenue then a Family Dollar three blocks later at 28th Street. This year when Dollar General announced plans to open another store moving into a vacant storefront on 32nd Street Washington said she knew something needed to be done.

""This bill ensures that there is economic diversity ensures that businesses that have invested in our city for decades - family-owned businesses – do not have to fight against entities that are designed to pull off of their profits. It's tough enough with COVID and existing economic conditions.”



Her bill would allow for city zoning officials to review plans for small-box stores before they open. It would prevent new stores from moving into an area that already has one less than a mile away. Finally new and existing stores would be required to enter into community agreements that would give residents input on how the stores operate.

The three chains declined to be interviewed for this story but Dollar General did release a prepared statement about Washington’s bill.

“Although we are sometimes referred to as a ‘dollar store’ we are much more than that. We describe ourselves as today’s neighborhood general store which much better captures who we are and strive to be"" a spokesperson for Dollar General said in a statement. ""We’re disappointed anytime elected officials make the decision to limit consumer choice as well as our ability to serve the local community""

The chains have been recently in the news because of price increases due to inflation making them no longer technically “dollar stores.”

Also Family Dollar is now recovering after and cost the company $34 million. Washington believes the incident reflects on how the company operates.

“If there were one or two then you'd say ‘Well OK that was just the individual operator.’ But when you have hundreds across the country being closed for the same reason it has to be a part of their model” she said.

But the financial health of these stores is pretty secure. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar which are actually the same company along with Dollar General have still profit margins of around 30 percent.

Diana Emerson executive director of Waverly Main Street promotes small businesses in Waverly and said her group supports the bill partly because of the chains' national reputation.

""One of the bigger concerns is that the dollar stores in general have not been good partners to the community. They're typically not the cleanest of stores. A lot of times they don't treat their staff really well. And those are things that are all concerning to our community"" Emerson said.



Washington said the business practices of dollar stores can make them easier targets for crime. The stores are usually staffed by one to two people. Also the stores frequently are overstocked and unorganized making it easier for thieves to surprise employees.

A report by Baltimore journalist Alec MacGillis detailed how dollar stores are frequent targets of armed robberies across the country.

Willow Lung-Amam an associate professor of urban studies and planning at the University of Maryland said Washington’s bill is part of a national trend of communities seeking more regulation of these smaller stores.

She said dollar stores often sell products that are of poor quality and their pricing can be deceptive.

“We have lots of really great opportunities for particularly local and family-owned businesses” she said of the Waverly neighborhood she represents. “And we have a discount store already at Herman's which is a family-owned business that's been there for a long time.

Dollar stores national chains that sell a wide variety of goods at around a dollar if not exactly thanks to inflation are a large presence on the Baltimore retail scene with over 50 locations across the city with more on the way. Critics say the major chains - Dollar Tree Family Dollar and Dollar General – target economically distressed areas and often squeeze out locally-run businesses.

Now legislation is up for debate in the Maryland General Assembly that proposes to place restrictions on these “small-box” stores in Baltimore to try to prevent oversaturation and nudge these chains into becoming “good partners.”



“These dollar stores say ‘I know our model will undercut everybody around and then we'll become the only game in town’” Sen. State Mary Washington said. “That is the definition of predatory. It just has no place in Baltimore City and in any neighborhood that's trying to recover.”

Washington is sponsoring the bill in the General Assembly and said the idea for the legislation came from the experience of her district. She represents a part of north Baltimore with a high concentration of dollar stores and the trend doesn’t seem to be slowing down.

There is a Dollar General at 25th Street and Greenmount Avenue then a Family Dollar three blocks later at 28th Street. This year when Dollar General announced plans to open another store moving into a vacant storefront on 32nd Street Washington said she knew something needed to be done.

""This bill ensures that there is economic diversity ensures that businesses that have invested in our city for decades - family-owned businesses – do not have to fight against entities that are designed to pull off of their profits. It's tough enough with COVID and existing economic conditions.”



Her bill would allow for city zoning officials to review plans for small-box stores before they open. It would prevent new stores from moving into an area that already has one less than a mile away. Finally new and existing stores would be required to enter into community agreements that would give residents input on how the stores operate.

The three chains declined to be interviewed for this story but Dollar General did release a prepared statement about Washington’s bill.

“Although we are sometimes referred to as a ‘dollar store’ we are much more than that. We describe ourselves as today’s neighborhood general store which much better captures who we are and strive to be"" a spokesperson for Dollar General said in a statement. ""We’re disappointed anytime elected officials make the decision to limit consumer choice as well as our ability to serve the local community""

The chains have been recently in the news because of price increases due to inflation making them no longer technically “dollar stores.”

Also Family Dollar is now recovering after and cost the company $34 million. Washington believes the incident reflects on how the company operates.

“If there were one or two then you'd say ‘Well OK that was just the individual operator.’ But when you have hundreds across the country being closed for the same reason it has to be a part of their model” she said.

But the financial health of these stores is pretty secure. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar which are actually the same company along with Dollar General have still profit margins of around 30 percent.

Diana Emerson executive director of Waverly Main Street promotes small businesses in Waverly and said her group supports the bill partly because of the chains' national reputation.

""One of the bigger concerns is that the dollar stores in general have not been good partners to the community. They're typically not the cleanest of stores. A lot of times they don't treat their staff really well. And those are things that are all concerning to our community"" Emerson said.



Washington said the business practices of dollar stores can make them easier targets for crime. The stores are usually staffed by one to two people. Also the stores frequently are overstocked and unorganized making it easier for thieves to surprise employees.

A report by Baltimore journalist Alec MacGillis detailed how dollar stores are frequent targets of armed robberies across the country.

Willow Lung-Amam an associate professor of urban studies and planning at the University of Maryland said Washington’s bill is part of a national trend of communities seeking more regulation of these smaller stores.

She said dollar stores often sell products that are of poor quality and their pricing can be deceptive. Lung-Amam who is also the director of the small business anti-displacement network said the stores are known for selling smaller portions of popular goods so if someone calculates the price per ounce a traditional grocery store may actually have the better deal.

“They’re thinking about the impact of these large national chains and where they may fit into a ‘small box’ footprint” Lung-Amam said. “A lot of things fit into a small-box footprint. We're seeing increasingly Walmart's and Amazon's fitting into a small box footprint. We see Starbucks fitting into a small box footprint. So just because something small doesn't mean that it's not impactful in terms of the impact on small local and particularly independently-owned and minority and immigrant small businesses.”

City councilwoman Odette Ramos said she found out about the latest dollar store – planned for 32nd Street – by chance. It came to her attention when the owners of the store applied for a permit to add landscaping outside. Even though she and neighborhood groups opposed the new store they have no ability to stop it.

“We have lots of really great opportunities for particularly local and family-owned businesses” she said of the Waverly neighborhood she represents. “And we have a discount store already at Herman's which is a family-owned business that's been there for a long time. So that just wasn't part of our plan to have a dollar store there.”

Ramos said she supports Washington’s bill. She plans to introduce similar legislation on the city council.

“We want public input in the process. So not outright banning but making sure that the public is informed and that they have a voice and a role to play in whether or not the community wants this or not.”

""We've been able to look at the end goal and realize that you know there's a light at the end of the tunnel and also realizing that we have customers that we want to service and provide you know excellent products for and they keep a smile on our faces too"" Antonio Williams said.

The store is known for its unique selection of items from cleaning supplies to children's books in multiple languages with most items clocking in at around 98 cents.

Despite Dollar Tree locations announcing they would raise prices to $1.25 Tryon Dollar Store is remaining consistent with its prices.

""We realize that it's a competitive market"" Andrea Williams said. ""We have to kind of stay in the game but want to get a little edge you know. Family Dollars are great stores but you know there are things that we offer that are unique you know unique items and also our service our customer service so you can't put a price on that.""

The Williams' said they look forward to continuing to serve customers in the Charlotte area always putting quality first.

You can go into some stores and the quality may not be there but we stand behind a lot of them Antonio Williams said. ""So you know with that it's been a learning experience.

Dominion notified customers in this month's billing that it filed for a rate increase. If approved residential customers using 1000 kilowatt-hours of electricity could see an increase in the monthly bill of about 51.9% which is $6.53 beginning in May according to reports.

During these shows the band will perform the album in its entirety every night. On March 16 and 17 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville Little Feat will invite a number of guests musicians to the stage and film the shows for future release.

Waiting for Columbus was originally recorded during seven live nights in 1977 when the band brought a recording team to four shows in London and three in Washington D.C.

Little Feat’s current roster features Bill Payne (keyboard vocals) Kenny Gradney (bass) Sam Clayton (percussion vocals) Fred Tackett (guitar vocals) Scott Sharrard (guitar vocals) and Tony Leone (drums).

In celebration of the tour Little Feat has shared a version of “Dixie Chicken/Tripe Face Boogie” recorded on November 16 2021 at The Egg in Albany NY.

Bill Payne reflected on all these events in a statement he shares with Relix:

Songs collide stars align windows and door fly open to let in the sunshine. In 1972 such an occurrence took place at the Fox Theatre in Long Beach CA. Little Feat had just completed playing the first Diamond Head Crater Festival on Oahu. The Fox was our first gig on the mainland. I was upstairs lying on a hardwood bench going over the set in my mind. “Dixie Chicken” and “Tripe Face Boogie” were played together but I wanted a longer jam section. In my sleep deprived exhaustion I heard the changes got up and relayed them to our drummer Richie Hayward who was down the hall.

When we get to the instrumental everyone will drop out but us.” I asked him to bring the volume down and we would wind our way through the jam to another break. It was a keyboard lick that would bring everyone back into Lowell’s slide solo.

Voila!

50 years later in 2022 we are still playing a version of that arrangement. Feat will bring “Waiting For Columbus” to your city this year. The energy is there in abundance thanks to the timeless music and the inclusion of our newest members Scott Sharrard on guitars and vocals and Tony Leone on drums and vocals along with Kenny Gradney on bass Sam Clayton on percussion and vocals Fred Tackett on guitar mandolin and trumpet. I’ll hold down the keyboards and vocals.

We will be filming this concert with an array of guests at the Ryman Auditorium March 16 & 17.

The winds are favorable and the sailing is smooth. See you on the proud highway.

Bring your Sailin’ Shoes!

“I think you have to find a way to just get in the zone and not let nerves or pressure affect you” says Price 27 whose hometown is Canton. “You have to find a way to stay calm and do what you’ve always done.”

Keeping calm and carrying on has given him a career in building what are known as chain-reaction or Rube Goldberg machines — those huge precisely choreographed contraptions that take hours to set up and are the ultimate version of toppling a row of dominoes.

Now Price has a new job. He’s one of the judges on “Domino Masters” the new reality competition that premieres at 9 p.m. Wednesday. Hosted by “Modern Family” star Eric Stonestreet the family-friendly contest is similar to the network’s popular “Lego Masters."" Except the goal here is not just to build a masterpiece but to collapse it in dazzling style.

The show features 16 teams of three people each that will compete in elimination challenges with different themes each week. Price will judge the results along with Danica McKellar a Hallmark movie actress and original “Wonder Years"" cast member who also is a mathematician and Vernon Davis the NFL great and an art gallery owner with an eye for design.

As the teams vie to win $100000 as the last trio standing Price also will be providing expert commentary and sizing up weakness in the construction of the contraptions.

Already he's considered the Simon Cowell of the series because he isn't afraid to call out the contestants on where they're falling short. “I think everyone thinks of me as a more critical judge. I’ve seen some of the best domino art in the world. … I’m constantly pushing the contestants to do something bigger and better.”

Price was just 13 when he became interested in creating elaborate chain-reaction machines which usually consist of levers ramps and rolling balls that go to elaborate lengths to trigger a simple task. He watched YouTube videos to learn the craft and got encouragement from his parents who let him take over the family’s basement for his builds.

Eventually he became such a skilled artist that he needed more space. “Over the years (the projects) slowly grew in size and then I realized that there’s only so much you can do at home” he says. In 2013 he made it to the quarterfinals of NBC's “America’s Got Talent"" competing under the stage name Sprice. Heidi Klum knocked over the first domino of a chain reaction machine he set up at Radio City Music Hall that ended in a burst of fireworks.

In 2015 Price organized an event held at the Michigan Science Center that invited builders from several countries to join forces for a massive chain-reaction machine. The Incredible Science Machine as the participants called themselves reconvened in 2016 and wound up breaking the Guinness World Record at that time for the most dominoes toppled in a circle formation (more than 76000). At the 2017 edition Price says they set the record for most total dominoes toppled in the United States (nearly 250000).

A graduate of Canton High School and Michigan State University (where he majored in mechanical engineering) Price relocated to California six years ago and makes his living by constructing chain reaction machines for film TV and advertising industries.

Through his business Sprice Machines he has done builds for Pokemon’s 25th anniversary and Fox's World Series coverage. In 2020 he appeared on Fox's New Year’s Eve show in a segment where co-host Ken Jeong — seemingly accidentally but really on purpose — bumped into an elaborate domino collapse planned for midnight much to Price’s feigned disgust.

At his website SpriceMachines.com and his YouTube channel you can see those projects and other fanciful demonstrations including his bread-slicing machine. He's always working on something. When it comes to perfecting a domino collapse practice makes perfect.

“It all comes down to experience. It’s not something you can be good at on the first try. You really learn from your failures” says Price. One secret to success? Massive builds are done in segments that are connected one at the end so that ruining one of them by accident won’t destroy the entire piece.

More:Incredible Science Machine attempts to break the world record

Next up for Price is a visit to metro Detroit for an attempt to break the record for the world’s largest domino wall. He plans to attempt the 100000-domino build at Taylor’s Trillium Academy school where his sister teaches with a toppling scheduled for April 2 to coincide with the run of ""Domino Masters."".

Being on the show has given Price renewed appreciation for how tough it is to construct a complex Rube Goldberg machine under the glare of TV cameras and the restrictions of a relatively small time limit. Under normal circumstances domino artists aren't necessarily working under a clock and can take breaks to alleviate things like a sore back.

“If I had been a contestant (on the show) the time pressure would have been a big deal (for me)” he admits.

He promises plenty of drama and tension for viewers watching to see to whether the hopes and dreams of the competitors tumble.

Says Price “I think they’re going to be on the edge of their seats.”

“When we look across the US business we continue to believe that consumer demand for Domino’s remains very strong across the country” said Richard E. Allison chief executive officer in an April 28 earnings call to discuss first-quarter financial results. “It is our current capacity to serve that strong demand particularly for delivery customers that has continued to be our greatest near-term challenge.”

US same-store sales declined 3.6% in the quarter ended March 27. US carryout same-store sales rose 11% but US delivery same-store sales dropped 11%.

“The decline in US same-store sales in Q1 was driven by a decline in order counts which were pressured by the very challenging staffing environment which had certain operational impacts such as shortened store hours and customer service challenges in many stores both company owned and franchised” said Sandeep Reddy chief financial officer. “The decline in order counts was partially offset by ticket growth resulting from higher menu prices as well as more items per transaction and increases to our average delivery fee.”

Ann Arbor-based Domino’s breaks down its US stores into quintiles based on staffing levels relative to a fully staffed store Allison said.

“When we look at the same quintiles relative to the delivery business we see the stark impact that staffing had during the first quarter” he said. “We saw a 17-percentage-point gap in delivery same-store sales between stores in the top 20% and those in the bottom 20%. It is this disparity in delivery performance that is driving the overall contrast in performance across our US business. The gap between our top performers and our bottom performers has widened over the past year and we are keenly focused on lifting up the underperforming stores.”

Domino’s is not only raising wages for delivery drivers but also pointing out how the position could lead to a management role Allison said. A TV commercial shows a woman who began as a driver and now is an owner for Domino’s.

“If you want to be a general manager at Domino’s and an owner at Domino’s it all starts as being a driver” Allison said.

International same-store sales excluding the impact of foreign currency rose 1.2% in the quarter.

“India once again led our international markets in store growth and opened (its) 1500th store during the quarter” Allison said. “This was accompanied by a continued same-store sales growth. We also continue to see strong sales and store growth from China.”

Companywide in the quarter Domino’s had net income of $91 million or $2.50 per share on the common stock which was down 23% from $118 million or $3 per share in the previous year’s first quarter. Lower income from operations of $22 million resulted from lower US company owned stores and supply chain operating margins and higher general and administrative expenses. Revenues increased 2.8% to $1.01 billion from $984 million. Domino’s stock price on the New York Stock Exchange closed at $353.88 per share on April 28 which was down 5% from $372.91 per share at the close of April 27.

“We got off to a slow start in January due to the omicron surge which impacted our stores and supply chain centers further limiting our capacity to serve customer demand particularly in the delivery channel” Allison said. “After a return to modestly positive US same-store sales in February we turned negative again as we began to overlap the impact of the 2021 federal government stimulus in March and have continued to face that overlap in April.”

He added “We have action plans in place that are designed to address the issues in our US business as well as other initiatives that we are developing but that work will take some time and we believe that we will continue to face pressure both on the top line for our US business and on our bottom-line earnings over the next few quarters. While we remain very optimistic about our ability to drive long-term profitable growth in the near term 2022 is shaping up to be a challenging year.”

The company is working on several initiatives to improve profitability Reddy said.

“These include No. 1 exploring further optimization of our consumer pricing architecture in the United States” he said. “Specifically this covers our many levers of pricing which includes our standard menu pricing national offers local offers and delivery fees to enable both our company owned and franchisee stores to better cover the cost increases we are facing in both the food basket and labor market.

“No. 2 efficiencies in our cost structure as we seek to ensure that revenues consistently grow faster than expenses. No. 3 actions to accelerate our capacity to service the demand we see and generate incremental sales growth. Once implemented we expect the initiatives I just covered to enable annual operating income margins to recover to pre-pandemic levels post 2022.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluby5jb20vY29udGVudC9wdXJwbGUtbGF1bmRyeS1yb29tLWlkZWFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surprise! This Lavender Laundry Room Is the Kids' Favorite Hangout,"We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.

You know you’ve nailed a laundry room renovation when it’s even the kids’ favorite space. “When their friends come over this is the only room I find them in” says Kourtney designer Mindy Gayer’s recent client in Cosa Mesa California—with music blasting and paper-bag puppets everywhere of course. The main priority however was always to create a full-on command station for the mom of three. She needed somewhere for cleaning supplies and craft storage plus a designated place to fold clothes; the laundry room’s current spot in a utility closet just didn’t cut it.

The laundry room before.

That somewhere ended up being a spare bedroom on the second floor now a shade of lavender that’s nearly the exact same color as Kourtney’s childhood bedroom. “My hope is that if the room is conveniently close to the kids’ rooms they’ll someday do their own laundry!” the mom explains. Here’s how Gayer pulled off the transformation.

Treat Violet as a Neutral

The original plan was to paint the room including all the millwork a subtle gray-blue. But Kourtney couldn’t get the idea of lavender out of her head. “It was the color I painted my teenage bedroom when my parents gave me free rein on design choices” she explains. It’s grounded by a checkered terracotta floor tile and Gayer insists the shade—Eagle’s View by Dunn- Edwards—can act as a neutral.

Double-Team It

With three rambunctious children under 13 dirty clothes pile up quickly. Kourtney needed not one but two washer-and-dryer sets. The team chose to stack each pair side by side—washers on the bottom dryers on top. “I can sit there and toss colors into one and whites into the other” Kourtney explains (she prefers to sort everything on the ground). When it’s time to dry delicates a custom rack pulls down from behind the sink keeping the floor clear for that next load.

Call It a Wrap

Despite its primary intention laundry is probably the least frequent thing that happens in the room. Two desks let Kourtney answer emails while simultaneously supervising homework. The three rods above a counter-height table hold wrapping paper for the near-constant birthday parties her little ones attend.

Keep It Closed Off

“My cupboards are filled to the brim with brightly colored ribbons beads glue guns you name it” says Kourtney. “I love to craft.” And sleek closed storage will always look neater than color-coded open shelving. If she needs to reach the tippy-top shelves where she puts her more seasonal materials (think: tinsel and holiday-only wrapping paper) she just stands on her desk chair. The floor-to-ceiling storage is worth the stretch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL25ld3MvNDgyMjY0NS9hc2hsZXktYmlnZ3MtbXVyZGVyLXBpenphLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXRydWUtY3JpbWUtZG9jdW1lbnRhcnkv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy80ODIyNjQ1L2FzaGxleS1iaWdncy1tdXJkZXItcGl6emEtZGVsaXZlcnktdHJ1ZS1jcmltZS1kb2N1bWVudGFyeS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ashley Biggs cops recall horror scene after jilted man lured ex to her death using fake Domino’s pizza d...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.the-sun.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 797.42 points to close at 32817.38 dragged down by a nearly 8% loss in American Express. The S&P 500 declined close to 3% to 4201.09 falling deeper into correction territory. The 500-stock average sits more than 12% from its record close. The Nasdaq Composite lost 3.6% to 12830.96 and now sits in bear market territory more than 20% from its all-time close. As the Russia- Ukraine war continues investors are monitoring the potential economic ramifications of disruptions in the global supply of energy. ""Consequently 'stagflation' is rapidly becoming the central focus in portfolio strategies"" said Jim Paulsen chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group. ""Preparing for slower growth and more persistent inflation is driving investor fears and actions."" Overnight on Sunday U.S. oil prices hit their highest level since 2008 amid an ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. West Texas Intermediate crude futures  the U.S. oil benchmark hit $130 per barrel at one point before pulling back. WTI oil settled up 3.2% at $119.40. The international benchmark Brent crude  spiked to to $139.13 per barrel — its highest since July 2008 — before pulling back to to settle at $123.21. Energy stocks rose alongside the price of oil. Baker Hughes added 4.7%. Chevron added 2.1%. Exxon Mobil rose 3.6%.

Meanwhile bank stocks were among the biggest losers on Monday with Citigroup down 1.8% and U.S. Bancorp down about 3.9% as investors grew concerned about slowing economic growth. McDonald's  Starbucks and Nike fell on Monday on concern about $4 gas prices hitting consumers' wallets. On Sunday gas prices surged to their highest level since 2008 with the national average hitting $4.06 a gallon according to AAA. Airlines cruise lines and travel stocks declined for the same reason. Bed Bath & Beyond soared 34.2% after GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen revealed he had a nearly 10% stake in the retailer through his investment company RC Ventures.

“Congratulations to Zoom and Terrilyn on this excellent achievement and to the crew members for their commitment to service” said Water Board Chairperson Julie Simonton. “We thank you all for your hard work and significant contributions to the department.”

“He accepts the greater responsibility and goes above and beyond his job duties to keep the water flowing” said an excerpt from Bukoski’s acknowledgement and Water Board Resolution No. 22-12. “Zoom was one of two personnel that dropped everything over the weekend and hiked through muddy terrain to replenish dwindling water disinfection chemicals and perform electro-mechanical repairs in Hanalei Wainiha Hā‘ena after the areas were isolated due to a landslide on Kūhi‘ō Highway.”

Amorin is described by her DOW colleagues in Water Board Resolution No. 22-13 as a “dependable and reliable employee that always goes above and beyond in assisting both billing and accounting sections and other divisions when needed.” She has also spearheaded the Department’s annual participation in the Kaua‘i United Way fundraiser food drive collections and the Salvation Army’s Angel Tree.

Unlike Mayzie the lazy bird in Dr. Seuss’s “Horton Hatches an Egg” students at local schools were far from “tired and bored” as school districts celebrated Read Across America Week with a variety of fun themes and activities and guest readers.

The National Education Association initiated Read Across America in 1998 to instill a love of reading in students.

“It helps ignite their love of reading and learning” said Dr. Sam Damien principal at Trinity North Elementary School. “It’s a fun and entertaining way to encourage reading and to celebrate and emphasize the importance of being a reader.”

Throughout last week guest readers read aloud to students in Trinity elementary schools with a celebrity reader Craig Wolfley retired Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman and color analyst for the team reading at Trinity North on Thursday.

At Fort Cherry Elementary Center students were delighted with theme days that included mismatched shoes and socks day crazy hat and hair day and wear your favorite pajamas and cozy up with a good book day.

Jefferson-Morgan Elementary School students also celebrated with activities such as eating green eggs and ham creating Dr. Seuss hats and making nests – an homage to Horton the kind and loyal elephant whose patience is rewarded at the end of the beloved children’s book.

Educators said children who are enthused about school often perform better overall and motivating children to read is an essential part of student achievement and creating lifelong successful readers.

“That’s the importance of ‘Reading Across America’ to foster that love for reading” said Brandon Robinson assistant superintendent at Jefferson-Morgan School District. “It’s important to celebrate reading at all age levels. Kids this week have been paying attention they’re interested and enthusiastic. They love to hear someone read to them.”

At elementary schools in the Uniontown Area School District students dressed as their favorite book characters and marched in a book parade.

Bonita Nesser literacy coach for Uniontown’s Benjamin Franklin Wharton and Marclay elementary schools said one of the popular events was “book buddies” where middle school students read books to elementary students.

Students in kindergarten through third grade also enjoyed reading the engaging and funny “The Book with No Pictures” written by B.J. Novak of “The Office” fame and filled with silly words like Boo Boo Butt and and Glurr Ga-Wocko. Children then picked four words and drew pictures of them.

“They really liked doing that. It was so fun for those little ones. It’s a book that makes them laugh and gets them involved” said Nesser.

Educators encouraged parents to help spark a love of books by beginning to read to children at an early age.

It’s important too for children to read about topics they are interested in and to see their parents reading books.

“Reading is a fundamental part of learning and it stimulates kids’ imagination. It’s important too for them to read for pleasure as an escape not because it’s part of an assignment” said Damien. “They’ve been excited all week and they’re having a lot of fun.”",,,,,,

Public Service Commission approves two of the utility's recent requests.

Customers could see their rates climb after a review of fuel expenses showed the utility under collected about $142 million in fuel costs.

Dominion notified customers in this month's billing that it filed for a rate increase. If approved residential customers using 1000 kilowatt-hours of electricity could see an increase in the monthly bill of about 51.9% which is $6.53 beginning in May according to reports.

The Huffmans are serious collectors and they’re faithful supporters of all things pottery in the Catawba Valley. They like the festival itself celebrate the area’s and state’s impressive pottery heritage and want people to know about it see it and cherish it as they do.

A while back I got an email from Kay Gregory retired educator and editor of “Isma” the memoirs of Kay’s Catawba Valley grandmother Isma Salome Moretz Huffman and recollections of many of her descendants. Kay wrote “My cousin’s wife Barry Gurley Huffman published a book in 2021. She is a painter and this book is a retrospective of her life ... ‘Blue Voice Bright Life: Visual Diary of a Self-Taught Artist’ ... tells the story of her life by sharing seventy paintings ... Quite frankly I was blown away. I always knew that Barry painted but I had no idea of the extensive nature of her work. Furthermore she had another book published in 2018 titled ‘Steeples and Stones of Fair Color.’ It is a gorgeous volume that features paintings of historic churches located all over western North Carolina.”

Kay also pointed out “Barry and her husband Allen Huffman have been a quiet but significant force in the Catawba County arts scene for many years. They have contributed an extensive collection of contemporary folk objects to the [Hickory Museum of Art].”

Off to Barry’s home I went happy to talk to her for the second time having interviewed her in 2017 about another of her books “A Lady Goes to Sea with Essays for Her Children” created while Barry traveled to Europe by herself on a cargo freighter.

I must stop here and say with complete honesty that I love love love Barry’s style. I’ve been to many museums around the world: in Paris the Louvre and the Musee d’Orsay; in New York City the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth Texas where a traveling collection of Monets cost me an extra $18 to have a look-see; and so on. But I’d rather study a Barry Huffman any day. She’s an untrained self-taught gifted portrayer of everyday things everyday life. Her work perspective color choices faces settings trees way of creating an image that speaks to the onlooker — all unique and intriguing.

It’s folk art yes but it’s exceptional. At times Barry’s work is childlike simplistic. At others it’s brilliant and detailed full of testimony. One minute I want to show her paintings to my preschool-aged grandchildren; the next I want to share them with my 80-something mother and mother-in-law. Barry’s approach puts me in mind of singers. Give a bunch the same song to perform and some you’ll like some will bore you and one will sing with such an uncommon ear-pleasing flair that you’ll ask to hear her version of another song and then another. Barry’s paintings sing.

“It’s been my life’s work” she said calculating that she has about 400 pieces now. “I had a great amount of fun doing it.”

Using acrylics or oils Barry paints at her kitchen table with the canvas lying flat. “I paint down” she explained.

So many Barry Huffmans include weeping willows. “It’s become sort of a signature” said Barry. “It’s because willows bend in strong wind. They don’t break.”

“Sometimes God is in the tree” Barry pointed out. “His light.”

Barry’s life loves and challenges are in her work. Consider the death of her beloved mother Louise McLaughlin Gurley of Robeson County. Barry painted Louise’s 1985 death at home her transition to Heaven and Jesus welcoming her the funeral service. “I paint what I am living and feeling and what interests me” said Barry. “There’s a story in everything.”

One painting is titled “Housewife.” A very small Allen is napping on Barry’s necklace.

The 179-page “Blue Voice Bright Life” is arranged chronologically and by subject. “I did the book as recognition of the fact that I’d been painting 50 years” Barry reported. “[My paintings] represent the life of a middle-class woman who paints in this period of time that my life has been.”

In words and paintings the book also offers history lessons such as the settlement of Catawba County and cultural comments. Said Barry in “Blue Voice Bright Life” “Keeping up with current events was an important part of our family life; at the dinner table there were daily discussions of the world around us and the world far away.” Her 1991 painting “Gulf Showdown” concerns Saddam Hussein and the U.S.’s Operation Desert Storm.

Barry admitted that she’s always questioned whether she’s a housewife or an artist. On the outside she appears to be a comfortable kind keeper of the home a wife and mother. On the inside she is a gatherer of impressions events feelings and points of view. Also within her is a voice that wants to speak. The voice becomes paint; the message the image. Toward the end of the book is a letter from Barry’s mentor and friend Hickory artist Joe Robert LaFone with whom Barry authored “LaFone Living Art” in 2015. Joe wrote “In another work we see a snake slithering through tall grass — an actual snake-in-the-grass. Barry has in her mind a human name for that snake; that name belongs to a distant cousin known for being a wife beater.”

Reading Joe’s description put me on alert the next time I examined a Barry Huffman. Like poets she offers imagery for us to decipher — or at least try to.

Barry said she didn’t choose to be a folk artist. Nor did she draw or paint as a child. “The style selected me” she shared. “It’s from true raw creativity.”

It is a language for her. In her book she stated “Using paint on canvas Masonite or panel board I recorded the passages of a woman’s life: my life. For five decades I painted scenes from my and my family’s daily living current events religious inquiry my questioning and grief contemplation and acceptance.”

And it all started with a much-loved house and garden in Chapel Hill. “Allen was in residency” said Barry. “He had a military obligation. We were moving to Germany.” Barry had installed many plants in her garden. She wanted a keepsake but a photo wouldn’t do; not everything was blooming so she decided to paint what the garden looked like at its glorious peak. It’s painting number one 616 Tinkerbell in “Blue Voice Bright Life.”

“Blue Voice Bright Life: A Visual Diary of a Self-Taught Artist” is available in the gift shop of the Hickory Museum of Art and on Amazon.

(June 1 2022) – A new Buffalo Soldier exhibit commemorating the 1904 Ninth Cavalry encampment was formally dedicated at the DuPont Historical Museum located near Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) Wash. with a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by service members veterans and community residents.



The DuPont Historical Society and Friends of DuPont Buffalo Soldier History invited Lt. Gen. Xavier Brunson commanding general of America’s First Corps as a guest speaker to mark the occasion.



“This exhibit serves as a reminder about the power of hope” said Lt. Gen. Brunson. “I think about how difficult life was for the Buffalo Soldiers. Hope drives us. Hope moves us. The necessary component of life is hope. If you have hope there’s nothing you can’t do.”



The Buffalo Soldiers were six all-black regiments formed in 1866 after the Civil War. They were later consolidated into the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 23rd and 24th Infantry being stationed throughout Washington State at the turn-of-the-century.



In 1904 the Buffalo Soldiers came to DuPont for a nationally significant military exercise that led to the creation of Camp Lewis now known as JBLM. They practiced tactical problems including attacks and defense amphibious invasions and cavalry and artillery actions.



Buffalo Soldier re-enactors bearing replica firearms a live horse uniforms and authentic frames of mind attended the dedication ceremony.



“We like to think of ourselves as living historians” said Geordan Newbill president of Buffalo Soldiers of Seattle. “Our job really is to play the part of the Buffalo Soldiers. When we’re in uniform our year is 1904.”



In July 1904 the 9th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers crossed Stampede Pass on horseback to participate in the first joint integrated exercises in US history at the American Lake Maneuvers in what is now DuPont Steilacoom Lakewood and Camp Murray. Still facing prejudice lower pay and violent protests they served with distinction and remarkable courage both domestically and overseas.



“This is our history” said Brunson. “This is not just a Buffalo Soldier story; it’s an American story.”



Additional guest speakers included Carol Estep president of DuPont Historical Society Ron Frederick mayor of DuPont Maria Gudaitis Friends of DuPont Buffalo Soldier History and Lt. Col. Victor McGee Steilacoom High School JROTC.



The DuPont Historical Society’s mission is to preserve interpret and promote the historical heritage of the City of DuPont and surrounding areas for present and future generations. The DuPont Historical Museum tells the story of the unique role that DuPont played in the development of Washington State and the Puget Sound Region.

In December just before the CES 2022 consumer electronics show in Las Vegas LG Display unveiled next-generation technology called OLED.EX for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) televisions.

At first glance the advance looked typically prosaic for a trade show rollout of new TV display technology. The company said the technology boosts the “display’s overall picture quality by enhancing brightness up to 30 percent compared to conventional OLED displays.”

But what helped LG achieve that 30% gain is actually something of a chemistry breakthrough. LG for the first time acknowledged using a deuterated compound supplied by DuPont in the televisions which will go into mass production in South Korea and China later this year. It’s an advance not only for displays but for the use of deuteration as a way to improve molecules of all kinds.

A deuterated compound is one in which at least one hydrogen has been replaced with its heavier isotope deuterium. One might not think an extra neutron would significantly change the chemistry of a molecule. But the so-called kinetic isotope effect makes the bonds forged between carbon and deuterium tougher to break than those that bind carbon and mere hydrogen.

For decades chemists have been trying to exploit the kinetic isotope effect in practical applications. For example they have been exploring deuterated pharmaceuticals with the aim of slowing metabolic reactions that degrade compounds while leaving efficacy against their targets intact. The result could be lower dosages and fewer side effects.

In 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first deuterated drug Teva Pharmaceutical Industries’ Austedo (deutetrabenazine) a treatment for chorea associated with Huntington’s disease.

DuPont researchers wanted to take the idea further. “The extension of the idea that was applied in pharmaceuticals is exactly what we are doing here” says Norman Herron a DuPont technical fellow. “We’re keeping the material around longer by changing C-H to C-D.”

Lifetime Herron explains is a top consideration for OLED materials. Every pixel in an OLED display is made up of about eight materials stacked in emissive and charge-transport layers. The deterioration of just one of these materials can cause image-sticking problems ruining the entire display. “What we ultimately do is make sure that we address the weakest material or the slowest dog on the team and make sure that it comes up to speed” Herron says.

The extension of the idea that was applied in pharmaceuticals is exactly what we are doing here. We’re keeping the material around longer by changing C-H to C-D. Norman Herron technical fellow DuPont

For LG’s OLED.EX technology DuPont deuterated an existing molecule used to carry electrons in the blue-emissive substack. DuPont won’t say what the molecule is other than to classify it as a polyfused aromatic compound. A big synthetic challenge for the DuPont team which has been working on deuterated OLED compounds for 15 years was replacing hydrogen with deuterium while maintaining high purity.

“There are multiple carbon-hydrogen bonds in that molecule and we are substituting some of them but not all of them” Herron says. “And the net effect is we apparently increased the lifetime. So we must be addressing some of the weaker carbon-hydrogen bonds that were leading to the degradation behavior.”

LG is advertising brighter displays not televisions that last a long time. That’s because with OLEDs longevity and brightness have an inverse relationship.

“What you’re doing when you make something run brighter is you’re stressing it harder. You’re running more current through” Herron says noting that OLED displays could operate indefinitely if they’re dim enough. By using a more robust material LG can produce displays that are brighter than the previous generation while lasting just as long.

The OLED.EX technology isn’t the first use of deuteration in LG televisions Herron says. The electronics maker has dabbled in it before but OLED.EX is LG’s biggest use of deuterated compounds thus far and it is the first time the firm has disclosed the compounds’ application.

The use of deuterated compounds isn’t yet widespread in the display industry. “Currently LG is the only one” says Jimmy Kim a senior principal analyst for OLED materials at the technology consulting firm Omdia. Kim notes that DuPont and LG have filed most of the patents for deuterated OLED compounds.

Other groups however have investigated deuterium for OLEDs. For example in 2014 scientists from the University of Tokyo deuterated benzylic methyl groups in a green phosphorescent material. The scientists noted a fivefold increase in material lifetime while all other properties remained unchanged. The group was also able to achieve higher luminescence from the deuterated compound because it degraded more slowly.

Display firms are pursuing other strategies for maximizing device lifetime Kim says. For instance they use tandem structures in which OLED stacks are placed on top of one another minimizing current density while achieving high light output and long lifetime. Manufacturers have also rolled out materials based on longer-lasting boron dopants he says.

A bottleneck in the broader use of deuterated compounds in OLEDs is their cost Kim says. “Due to limited supply chain its selling price is very high now” he notes.

Hjalti Skulason technical manager of the emerging applications group at DuPont Industrial Solutions acknowledges the issue which he attributes largely to the additional synthesis steps that are necessary. “Because it is an extra step it is more expensive than the nondeuterated analogs” he says.

On top of that the heavy water (D 2 O) from which deuterium is derived is quite rare. Deuterium is present in natural water but at a ratio of 1 deuterium atom for every 6400 hydrogens. The main commercial application for heavy water is slowing down neutrons in Canada deuterium uranium nuclear reactors. Most heavy water production facilities—which concentrate the water with energy-intensive routes like the Girdler sulfide process—were shut down long ago. Supplies are drawn largely from government stockpiles.

“The deuterium source is certainly going to be a problem we have to solve if it grows really large but even at full scale—LG TVs being produced with this—it is still not an enormous amount of actual material” Skulason says. DuPont’s shipments of the deuterated compound now fall in the range of tens to hundreds of kilograms.

Deuterium has the potential to expand the OLED market by making the displays more competitive in the high-performance TV sector according to Omdia’s Kim. OLED displays have only a 3% share of the television sector he says compared with a 30–40% share of the smartphone market. In both cases liquid crystal displays dominate.

Skulason says the technology could also help OLEDs penetrate into display markets that have thus far been elusive. “I think it’s going to expand into other kinds of more demanding display applications where there’s more of a static image and displays that are on for a longer period of time.” Examples include computer monitors and signs. Deuteration he notes could also help in automotive displays which currently have short life spans because of hot summer conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaGF2YW5hdGltZXMub3JnL3Bob3RvLW9mLXRoZS1kYXkvZHVwb250LXdhdGVyLWNhc3RsZS12YXJhZGVyby1jdWJhLXBob3RvLW9mLXRoZS1kYXkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9oYXZhbmF0aW1lcy5vcmcvcGhvdG8tb2YtdGhlLWRheS9kdXBvbnQtd2F0ZXItY2FzdGxlLXZhcmFkZXJvLWN1YmEtcGhvdG8tb2YtdGhlLWRheS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dupont Water Castle Varadero Cuba – Photo of the Day,"Dupont Water Castle Varadero Cuba.

Ex-Stormers and Bulls kicking guru Cilliers who played his one and only Test for the Springboks against the All Blacks in 1996 was speaking to Sport24 in a wide-ranging interview which also touched on Kolbe’s meteoric rise for club and country.

The 28-year-old has been mainly utilised as a wing with the Boks while also playing at flyhalf and fullback in the Top 14. Kolbe and Dupont were teammates at Toulouse before the former’s big-money move to Toulon.

“I had the privilege of coaching Cheslin when he was still playing for the Stormers” Cilliers said. “Based on his size many thought that opponents would just kill him but I was just looking at the progress he was making.

“The type of tries he scored in the World Cup final and the Top 14 were unbelievable. He has speed a good kicking game and can defend well. He’s similar to Antoine Dupont in that they can both do something special.”

He added: “In France Cheslin plays at fullback or flyhalf but the world knows him as a Springbok winger. He has scored many tries and plays most of his rugby on the wing for South Africa.

“He is quick and also suited to fullback so I don’t think there is one position that would be more important than the other.”

Image Source

A director at a major media outlet generated more than $84000 in revenue as a reseller last year.

By buying many items in bulk he spends only a few hours reselling during the workweek.

He said new taxes would make life difficult for smaller sellers who previously didn't pay them.

Max Clayton started browsing garage sales during the pandemic.

""I needed something to do that wasn't sitting around all day doing my job or watching the news"" the 40-year-old told Insider. ""During that first spring garage sales started popping up and it seemed like good timing.""

And it was good timing to start a reselling business. Clayton had never done it seriously he said but joined eBay as a teenager in the 1990s selling vintage T-shirts and antiques he found at thrift stores with his family.

""I would go to garage sales on a Saturday and come home with a variety of items I never would have thought of"" he said.

Nearly three decades later he revived the hobby as a side hustle — and grossed more than $84000 in sales last year on eBay alone according to tax documents viewed by Insider. Clayton also said he generated additional sales through other platforms. All that is on top of Clayton's salary as a media director a role has had for nearly 20 years at a popular media company where he makes about $295000 annually before taxes.

Clayton requested that both his real name and employer be kept anonymous for privacy reasons. His identity is known to Insider.

According to ZipRecruiter resellers in St. Louis — where Clayton is — make about $87546 in revenue annually before expenses and taxes. Nationwide that average is $95190 a year a figure that likely reflects gross revenue before profits for full-time resellers ZipRecruiter told Insider. Clayton's resale profits for 2021 were about $45000 according to a personal tracking spreadsheet viewed by Insider. Those proceeds are made primarily from he and his wife selling shopping and shipping on weekends.

Clayton said he liked that reselling accommodated his schedule as a full-time media director. But he said that customers could be hard to deal with and that changing tax laws in the US were raising tensions for many others in the reselling industry.

""I can wake up in the morning and have made $600 overnight"" he said. ""It's all about time flexibility.""

Buying is a time-consuming hobby but reselling can be profitable if you're strategic

Clayton doesn't have a niche as a seller: He and his wife are in the business of everything.

They have categories in which they sell more frequently because they're more knowledgeable in it he said. For instance he knows more about electronics men's clothing and activewear while she has an eye for women's clothing and ceramics.

""When we both go sourcing together we take home twice as much stuff"" he said.







Clayton said one of the benefits of the business being so time-flexible was that he and his wife could trade off tasks more easily. He can post listings and buy inventory on weekends or before work and she can ship stuff out whenever it needs to go. That's compatible with her work as a full-time homemaker Clayton said.

Clayton added that they were sourcing items in person less and less.

""I'm operating in a situation where I have a limited amount of time. I have a full-time job. I can't bleed into that full-time job very easily so I'm consistently looking for ways to source more inventory in less time"" he said. He often buys wholesale from sellers he's built personal relationships with.

He bought over 100 pairs of Converse sneakers at a discount from one retailer he said and acquired them at a discount.

""If I were only sourcing from garage sales and thrift stores it would take two weeks to get that much inventory"" he said. ""As much as our bandwidth allows we buy in bulk and supplement with thrift stores and garage sales because we like doing that.""

The government is cracking down on a once invisible marketplace

Clayton pointed out that businesses like his were about to face a new challenge. Tax laws are changing this year in a way that makes it difficult for resellers to avoid paying them.

Anyone who makes over $600 a year for goods or services through money-transfer platforms such as Cash App Venmo and PayPal — or retailers like eBay and Etsy — will need to report their income to the IRS. Until this year that threshold was $20000 a year.

It was always illegal to avoid reporting your income to the IRS no matter how low unless you were explicitly exempted. But now websites like eBay will automatically request a seller's Social Security number or Individual Tax Identification Number once they reach $600 in sales.

""I'm a big-time seller. I pay my taxes and I run it like a business"" Clayton said. ""But this would definitely draw small-time sellers away … who don't usually self-report.""

That has the potential to affect a lot of people: In a 2016 survey of American adults by the Pew Research Center nearly one in five respondents said they earned money selling something online.

For someone like Clayton who has always reported his income as a seller the new rules don't make a difference. His biggest challenge he said is customers who can be ""hard to deal with"" at times.

""When people are buying merchandise online they don't know who you are"" he said. ""They perceive you to be a faceless corporation so they have the same expectation as if they were buying something off Amazon. That has made it more difficult to meet their expectations.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9lbGRlbi1yaW5nLXBsYXllcnMtc2VsbGluZy1ydW5lcy1lYmF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elden Ring Players Are Selling Runes On Ebay,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9lbGRlbi1yaW5nLXBsYXllcnMtc2VsbGluZy1ydW5lcy1lYmF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9lbGRlbi1yaW5nLWluLWdhbWUtY3VycmVuY3ktaXMtYmVpbmctc29sZC1vbi1lYmF5LTMxNzYwNzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Elden Ring' in-game currency is being sold on eBay,"Elden Ring players can buy an in-game currency boost for real-world money but doing so could also come with a ban.

FromSoftware’s Elden Ring uses an experience system seen in all of FromSoftware’s Souls-like games as each enemy you defeat drops currency players spend to level up and on items. In Elden Ring these are called runes. However any death causes all runes to be dropped at the location the player was felled.

Now those runes are being sold for real money on eBay. Players can purchase the runes in the millions then head to the seller’s in-game world to collect. Eurogamer tested the service and came away with 2million runes for the cost of £11. However there is a chance that any sale could be a scam.

Eurogamer also found that spending the runes gained them a lot of levels but didn’t help them make progress as their weapons and armour were still massively underdeveloped and didn’t have good scaling for the newly boosted stats. They also reached a point where they could’t afford another level but still had many runes left over that could be lost at any time.

According to FromSoftware’s terms of service (as spotted by IGN) any player caught buying or selling runes for real money could have their rune wallet wiped and their account suspended or banned.

Elsewhere in Elden Ring news an interactive map has been released to help players navigate The Lands Between. The in-browser tool allows players to track down items quests and Sites of Grace within the game world. As the map is an ongoing project some locations may not be accurate and others may be missing.

Or so the saying goes. For gamers there are ways to get cheat codes or pick up some accessories to skip the challenge. Elden Ring is just a week old and already some ‘enterprising’ souls are already finding ways to unlock shortcuts… to your wallet.

A search on eBay for ‘Elden Ring runes’ shows multiple listings of Elden Ring’s in-game runes being sold starting from as low as US$10. Runes are the currency in Elden Ring used to level up your character and buy equipment.

The process seems simple enough. You pay the seller wait to be contacted set up a meeting and put down your summoning sign (so you can be summoned into the seller’s game). There they’ll drop Golden Runes so that you can pick them up.

Sounds easy. What could go wrong?

Other than getting scammed by a no-show seller you risk getting banned by FromSoftware (assuming the developers want to or are able to detect these forms of transactions). Like many other games it is against Elden Ring’s Terms of Service to conduct ‘real money trading’.

Is it worth it?

Probably not. The power boost doesn’t do enough when you are just starting. In souls-like games like Elden Ring you will still need to learn and actually play the game to get ahead.

But for those who can’t or won’t play fair why cheat with real money when you can just cheat for free? We won’t share the link here but if you are that interested just search for CheatEngine. Alternatively why not just work a little and use one of the tips offered by YouTubers on the best way to farm runes on your own.

At the end of the day cheat all you want in your own Lands Between but don’t bring it online to another person’s game. And certainly don’t pretend you’ve ‘beaten’ the game; you’ve just cheated yourself of the authentic experience.

And if you don't know him by name you might recognise his face - or by his viral 'Trousing' selling posts.

Mario moved to the UK when he was 17 from his native Italy and lived in Plymouth for more than 30 years before moving to Liskeard in Cornwall.

In 2020 we met Mario and he explained he had numerous requests for advertising interviews and friendships due to the popularity of his quirky Facebook marketplace adverts to sell jeans plants and DVDs.

The unconventional entrepreneur who used to work on a £1 stall in Plymouth Market rose to internet fame by posing in unusual ways to flog his trousers.

Now Mario has grown his Facebook following to 3568 and turned his attention to selling his own merchandise.

He regularly posts on his page advertising his £2.99 eBay listings for nude keyrings.

Mario wrote: ""Fridge Magnet is available on eBay follow the link below if you want to look at other fridge magnets search Mario Graziano fridge magnet on eBay.""

He also offers sets of four coasters with his photographs on as well as pen and keyring sets.

There is even a gift bundle which includes a fridge magnet keyring pen and calendar.

Speaking to PlymouthLive previously Mario explained that he has fans all around the world and receives around a thousand messages or comments a day. But it all started with a pair of Strictly Come Dancing-style jeans.

He said: ""Everything started with one pair of jeans it was a beautiful pair of jeans I bought like Strictly Come Dancing.

""I was wearing it in the street while I was working lots of people were looking at me with this pair of jeans and had a laugh.

""So I decided it was best to put them in the wardrobe and keep them safe.

""One day I was working for the clothes and I decided to put it on eBay and I had 1000 2000 people watching it.

""That’s how I started my procedure on marketstore.""

He added: ""You’ve got to keep occupied and got to keep your brain going you know what I mean? The posts are very good you’ve got to convince the people to buy the stuff.

""A lot of people on eBay want to sell their stuff but they just put it up in the package they put it on the table and they take a photo.

""From my point of view it’s the way you wear it and if the people like it they’re going to buy it.""

Mario said that his ""favourite love and affection"" were the plants which he has filled his home and back garden with after retiring from his job at Kawasaki in Ernesettle.

He said he gets up to 1000 friend requests a day but 'unfortunately can't add everyone'.

He said: ""I have got massive big fans every day I get 1000 2000 people and they are all friends and unfortunately I can’t add everyone at the same time.

""Without Facebook I don’t think I would achieve this beautiful goal we have achieved. It’s very wonderful what has happened in these past couple of months to sell my trousing.""

Polaris the Medina-based vehicle maker is among the U.S. companies that last week halted sales or exports to Russia in response to that country's invasion of Ukraine.

Apple said last week it stopped selling iPhones and other products in Russia and Nike temporarily closed its stores in Russia. Other companies such as Microsoft Ford and Exxon have suspended products or operations there.

Companies are navigating trade restrictions and political pressure as well as the logistical and financial challenges of continuing to operate in Russia with its economy in turmoil.

A Polaris spokeswoman didn't share how much of the company's sales come from Russia and added that its decision was not related to sanctions. The company's primary markets are the U.S. and Canada with other countries including Russia accounting for the remaining 14% of its sales according to company filings.

But for the most part Russia is not a big business partner for Minnesota.

It was the state's 33rd largest market abroad for goods in 2021 with $65 million in exports. That accounted for a tiny fraction of Minnesota's $24 billion in total exports last year according to an analysis of trade data by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED).

On the flip side Minnesota imports far less from Russia — about $7 million last year for items such as fertilizer books and plastics according to DEED. That number has also been rapidly declining in the last couple of years.

Minnesota's largest export markets with annual total sales in the billions of dollars are Canada China and Mexico. Other countries high up on the list are Japan South Korea and Germany.

Indeed the state's exports to Russia declined in the last couple of years. They're down 38% since 2019 while the state's exports overall have otherwise risen 6%.

The largest categories of state exports to Russia last year were medical devices ($16 million) and machinery ($16 million) the latter of which includes computers and lifting machines. Other areas were electrical equipment ($14 million) such as integrated circuits and switches and vehicles ($7 million) which includes snowmobiles.

Medical device maker Medtronic whose operational headquarters are in the Twin Cities has a presence in both Russia and Ukraine where it has nearly 300 employees.

Russia accounts for less than 1% of the company's total sales Karen Parkhill Medtronic's chief financial officer told the Star Tribune shortly before the fighting began Feb. 24.

After the war began Medtronic said in a statement that it was evaluating the effects of the sanctions closely and would follow legal requirements ""while doing our best to mitigate impacts on patients.""

Ukraine is a smaller trading partner for Minnesota ranking 54th as an export market with $18 million in goods sent there last year. The largest categories for exports were vehicles aircraft (engines and parts) machinery and electrical machinery.

And Ukraine came in 69th in terms of goods imported to Minnesota with $5 million in goods mostly plastics honey machinery and milling products.

There are several Minnesota companies that have offices in Russia or Ukraine including 3M Cargill Medtronic and Ecolab.

There are no known Russian companies operating in Minnesota according to state officials.

Following Microsoft's announcement about suspending all new sales of Microsoft products and services in Russia the popular sandbox-type game Minecraft has disappeared from the mobile apps store in Russia. According to several reports Minecraft is no longer available on Apple's App Store and Google Play Store in Russia. This development took place yesterday March 5 2022. Keep reading to know the developments related to the gaming industry during the Russia Ukraine war.

One of the earliest reports about the removal of Minecraft from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store comes from a publication called iMore. The publication cites reports from other sources like Gazeta.ru and iPhones.ru while stating that video games in no longer available in Russia. A comparison between Apple's US website and Russian website indicates that Minecraft is no longer available on the latter.

Minecraft удалили из российских Google Play и Apple App Store — Газета.Ru (@GazetaRu)

Minecraft is not available on Google Play Store or Apple App Store in Russia

It is worth mentioning that these reports started to surface after Microsoft's announcement of halting all new sales of its products and services in Russia. ""We are announcing today that we will suspend all new sales of Microsoft products and services in Russia"" says Microsoft in an official blog post published on March 4 2022. However it is not clear whether Minecraft has intentionally been removed from the app stores in Russia or not.

Other popular video game development companies including CD PROJEKT and Electronic Arts have also reacted to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. While CD Projekt has halted the sales of all its video games in Russia Electronic Arts has removed all the Russian Teams from the titles of FIFA and NHL. Popular video game Battlefield 2042 removed a Russian helicopter's skin from the game last week.

As the Russian forces are invading Ukraine technology leaders in the world are reacting to the situation. The Ukrainian leaders have reached out to top tech companies of the world including Google and Apple to restrain their services in the Russian mainland. Apart from this there are several companies that have been operational in Ukraine and have either stopped operations or are preparing for future scenarios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGVuaW5zdWxhcWF0YXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMDYvMDMvMjAyMi9saWZlLWFmdGVyLWlrZWEtYS1ydW5uaW5nLWxpc3Qtb2YtcmV0YWlsLWNsb3N1cmVzLWluLXJ1c3NpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Life after Ikea: A running list of retail closures in Russia,"File photo

Bloomberg

As the world continues to isolate Russia for its invasion of Ukraine US and European retailers have been rapidly shutting down operations across Russia. This has sent scores of Russians racing to buy imported consumer goods over fears of a plunging ruble and sanctions.

We have both taught each other so much and have learned so much about ourselves throughout our relationship.

""As the news has come out it may seem sudden to most of you but Josh and I have been spending the last couple of months figuring this out together. We wanted this to be private between us and not involve most of our friends and family. If there is one thing I can say about both of us it's that we both gave everything we absolutely could to make this work.""

Look at that thing go!

Normally we don’t cover boats on Motorious since we’re all about collector cars both of the classic and modern variety. However when we ran across this 2700-horsepower ZR48 Corvette Boat we had to make an exception. It’s long sleek and probably what Batman would use on the open water especially considering as you’ll see in the video it can get away from the police with ease.

Listen to the Motorious Podcast here.

In the included video the owner of this boat is hot dogging around until apparently the US Coast Guard decides he’s being reckless. They give chase as he hits it the Corvette Boat speeding off and easily gapping them by an embarrassing distance.

The secret to the amazing performance of this ZR48 Corvette Boat is the twin Mercury Racing Twin Turbo Marine Engines it houses. Each one of those engines produces 1350-hp which alone would be amazing. However when you put them together they can really make a boat move.

Helping further is the fact this Corvette Boat doesn’t weigh much. The hull is made of carbon fiber a material known for its lightweight nature but which can also be incredibly strong. With how this vessel moves on the water it likely needs all the rigidity it can get.

As if that’s not cool enough the boat apparently has quite the interior. There’s an 800-watt stereo system onboard for partying on the open waters air conditioning TV screen with Apple TV connection and even a mobile WiFi hotspot so you can stream whatever you want.

Some people say this Corvette Boat looks like it’s inspired by Darth Vader. We can kind of see that in the front of the cockpit. However the tail end definitely is a callout to the ‘Vette with 4 round taillights and the crossed flags badge.

Check out the video but beware it’s super shaky so that’s pretty annoying (Warning: language).

More recently the Kimberly-Clark plant was torn down and along with it one of the last remaining orange groves in Orange County. However the Beckman Instruments building located at 4300 North Harbor Boulevard is still standing and was just selected to receive a 2021 Governor’s Historic Preservation Award. This award is the only official preservation award presented by the State of California to recognize exceptional achievements in the field of historic preservation. While the awards ceremony won’t occur until April I wanted to take a deeper look at the history of the Beckman Instruments Administrative Building.

According to Bob Ziebell’s Fullerton: A Pictorial History “The company dates back to 1935 when a young chemistry professor at the California Institute of Technology used his skill and inventiveness to build a simple pH meter for a scientist friend.” This professor was Dr. Arnold O. Beckman and he worked with two students in a metal shed to develop a pH meter or acidimeter a device that could precisely determine the acidity or alkalinity of any solution. The pH meter became such a huge success within the scientific community that Beckman was able to resign from his teaching job at CalTech and take on the full-time role as President of National Technical Laboratories.

With World War II underway there was a greater demand for scientific instruments. According to the Fullerton Heritage webpage for Beckman Instruments Beckman realized there was a “great need for new spectroscopic instrumentation. In the 1940s he invented the first quartz spectrophometer the commercial infrared spectrophometer the precision helical potentiometer the analytical ultracentrifuge the direct-writing oscillographic recorder and the automatic amino acid analyzer.” The DU Spectrophometer helped revolutionize chemical measurement to the point where many scientists divide the history of biochemistry into periods pre-DU and post-DU. All these ground-breaking scientific inventions led to the growth of National Technical Laboratories which was renamed Beckman Instruments Inc. in 1950.

In 1953 the company needed additional space so they started construction on an expensive factory and headquarters here in Fullerton which cost $2.5 million to build. Beckman Instruments’ headquarters and plant were established on a forty-acre orange grove in unincorporated land between La Habra and Fullerton “at a time when Fullerton was just beginning to industrialize” leading to an economic boom “for the still mostly rural city” according to Fullerton Heritage.

The 43000-square-foot structure was the first large high-tech industrial “campus” to be developed in Fullerton and one of the earliest in Orange County. According to historian Arnold Thackray in the book Arnold O. Beckman: One Hundred Years of Excellence “The design was highly modern centered on the concept of flexibility for further expansion. Additional space could be easily constructed and integrated and any interior spaces could be reconfigured quickly and efficiently. Such a flexible design befitted a firm dedicated to new instrumentation in a growing array of technologies.” The buildings were interconnected and there was extensive landscaping. Its Mid-Century Modern architecture was the precursor to many other major manufacturing companies in Fullerton in the 1950s and 60s.

Most of the plants and factories constructed in Fullerton during the postwar era were box-like structures. Some companies hired notable architects such as Kimberly-Clark employing Skidmore Owing and Merrill and the American Electronics Plant hiring Eugene Choy according to American Architects Directory. However most of the architectural designs coming out of the postwar era weren’t remarkable. Beckman Instruments hired architect Lawrence Whitney Davidson to design their new facility according to Fullerton Heritage. Davidson whose early work was done in the Mid-Century Modern style went on to design golf clubhouses industrial plants movie studios school classrooms and municipal buildings transitioning easily between private military and public works projects. He had a strong background in both architecture and engineering and had designed other manufacturing plants before his Fullerton project. In the 1950s and 1960s the Beckman administrative office building became a recognized architectural symbol of the scientific instruments company.

In an article in the February 20 1953 issue of the Fullerton News Tribune Beckman acknowledged that he had selected Fullerton because of its low tax rate and ample supply of water to run his operations. He also thought that Fullerton’s residential areas would be a good fit for his present and future employees. In November 1954 when the Beckman facility officially opened 8000 people toured the building which was an impressive number of visitors given that Fullerton’s population at the time was only 13958. In 1955 Beckman was chosen from a pool of 500 plant-of-the-year candidates to be honored with the Significant Plant Award from the national magazine Factory Management & Maintenance. “Faced with extraordinary requirements for flexibility and expandability Beckman meets both demands to a remarkable degree with a plant that is also a pacesetter in appearance and employee services” noted the magazine.

Beginning with this Fullerton location Beckman Instruments would grow from scattered locations into a unified cohesive multinational corporation and in the next 30 years would become one of the most recognizable firms in the world.

Nine hundred workers were hired at the Beckman facility many of whom relocated from Pasadena and South Pasadena. Beckman Instruments required “a multitude of scientific professions crafts and skilled workers” according to Fullerton Heritage. Over the decades the company would go on to employ thousands of Fullerton residents many of whom spent a large part of their lives at the Harbor Boulevard facility. The firm also hired a lot of Fullerton College and Cal State Fullerton graduates. Several former employees and company executives eventually left Beckman Instruments to form new companies such as the International Biotronics Corporation and an active group of Beckman retirees still meet in Fullerton.

By the time it closed its doors in 2010 Beckman Instruments had become a world leader in the development and manufacturing of products for scientific industries medicine education space exploration and defense with its products helping scientific communities all over the world. Interestingly scientists working on the Human Genome Project used Beckman’s Biomek 1000 robotic workstation in their study of DNA structure. Beckman Instruments had become a source of pride to local residents and a business hallmark for the City. The company built its reputation by making generous donations to local Fullerton groups including St. Jude Hospital the Boys Club the United Fullerton Fund and the Children’s League of Fullerton. Beckman gave away dozens of scholarships to local high school and college students; donated instruments to Fullerton College and CSUF; and provided funding for science and technology exhibits programs and field trips.

Today the building is the home of A.J. Kirkwood Electric a company involved in construction electrical engineering and systems technologies and is located in the Beckman Business Center. Fullerton Heritage has helped preserve the building with few alterations. The city of Fullerton recently received a letter from the California Office of Historic Preservation notifying them that the Beckman Instruments Administrative Building is among the projects selected to receive a 2021 Governor’s Historic Preservation Award. The letter was signed by Julianne Polanco State Historic Preservation Officer and was sent on behalf of Governor Gavin Newsom. The ceremony for the Governor’s Awards will be held Thursday April 28 in Sacramento.

Despite Russian officials denying civilian bombing the occupiers have continued to commit cruel crimes against humanity since the start of hostilities.

Global brands begun to leave the Russian market en masse but not all of them.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on the morning of February 24 2022. The aggressor did not directly declare the war but instead cowardly called it a military operation. The Russian occupiers insidiously did not give the time to Ukrainian authorities to evacuate civilians. Instead the enemy brazenly continues to claim that it does not commit crimes against civilians but rather protects them from nationalists. But the world is not to be fooled. All civilized politicians and celebrities are actively expressing their support for Ukraine. World brands began refusing to do business with Russia. However not all of them.

Zaborona has blacklisted companies that that did not leave the Russian market immediately but waited a long time for public reaction. Moreover most of them claimed that they planned to leave Russia but did not specify terms conditions plans etc. Conventionally we called it the Coca-Cola’s Black List because it was the first global brand to express its official position.

The list is constantly updated.

The list of companies that continue to operate in Russia

It is worth noting that there are many reasons why so many international companies have decided to commit a mass exodus from Russia:

sanctions provided for blocking the operational work of banks and accordingly cards;

threat of complete disconnection from SWIFT;

troubles with logistics due to Europe’s closure of airspace for Russian aircraft;

herd instinct;

Ukrainian origin;

a sense of justice;

hate for war and terrorism;

love and support for Ukraine.

The official operating activity of an international company in any country means the payment of all relevant taxes. And this in turn means that the money of companies paid in taxes is distributed by governments for various state sectors including weapons (in the case of Russia — for sure). Therefore those global brands that decided to continue their operations in a country that has invaded another independent state have to realize that people’s blood is on their hands as well.

If you are deliberately financing terrorism you have to bear all the responsibility. So let’s move on to the list.

Coca-Cola — the first company that officially declare that they are not going to stop doing business in Russia.

“All of Coca-Cola’s operational production and logistics facilities in Russia continue to operate. We are fully responsible to our partners society and thousands of our employees in Russia. Our unconditional priority is the safety of our employees” claimed in the company’s press-release to Russians.

On March 8 the 13th day of the war after considering all the reputational risks and consequences that mass boycotts of Coca-Cola products could lead to the company decided to suspend its business in Russia.

“The Coca-Cola Company announced today that it is suspending its business in Russia. Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve” said in the statement.

However it is not specified what measures will be taken to suspend the business. The Coca-Cola Company has as many as 10 facilities for the production of soft drinks in Russia.

On March 30 it became known that the German Ritter Sport will not leave the Russian market: it accounts for 7% of the company’s turnover.

Nestlé — a large Swiss company which has three factories in Ukraine/ After the beginning of Russian invasion they announced that temporarily shutting down Ukrainian facilities due to the danger to workers. Instead they do not want to sever ties with the enemy.

“Our factories and offices in Russia continue to operate. Our goal is to provide consumers with high quality food and beverages in all regions where we are present. We continue to provide a wide range of food products on the market” said the company representatives to Russian media.

On March 9 the company’s spokesperson told Reuters that Nestle was suspending all capital investments in Russia. On March 11 one of the largest food-producing companies announced restrictions on trade with the aggressor but not completely.

It was reported that Nestle has stopped exporting and importing non-essential food items like coffee (eg Nespresso) and water (eg S. Pellegrino). That is all other Nestle products (baby food confectionery breakfast cereals etc.) will continue to appear on the shelves of Russian stores.

On March 17 the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmygal posted on Twitter that he had contacted the CEO of Nestlé about the side effect of its work in Russia. We have to point out that there is no official confirmation or comment from the company in this regard.

On March 23 Nestlé issued a new statement on its work in Russia. The company will remove several more of its brands from the Russian market including KitKat and Nesquik and will provide to Russians only essential food such as infant food and medical/hospital nutrition.

“While we do not expect to make a profit in the country or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future in Russia any profit will be donated to humanitarian relief organizations” said in a press release.

Danone — despite the fact that this international company has publicly condemned the Russian invasion and declared its readiness to provide any assistance to Ukrainians one of the world’s leading food giants is deliberately refusing to leave the aggressor’s market.

“We do not plan to suspend our activities in Russia and leave the market. For now the company’s key systems infrastructure and logistics in Russia operate in a regular mode” Russian propagandists reported.

On March 6 the company announced that it would stop making new investments in Russia but stays in the Russian market.

METRO is one of the world’s largest cash and carry companies which has a huge number of stores in Ukraine. Like other multinational giants from our blacklist this one also refused to sever trade ties with Russia.

“METRO continues to operate in Russia. We do not plan to close our shopping centers. All METRO stores operate in regular mode. We have provided the necessary stock of goods and are setting up supply chains” claimed in the company statement on March 3.

Auchan — another global chain of hypermarkets and supermarkets that does not want to leave Russia. Moreover the Russian department of Auchan did not make any statements or comments on the withdrawal.

In early March Auchan imposed restrictions for Russians on the purchase of socially important products. So the conditional Russian Ivan is unable to buy more than 10 kg of sugar 10 bottles of sunflower oil five packs of flour of 2 kg three packs of salt 10 packs of pasta rice buckwheat and other cereals.

Leroy Merlin is a French network of supermarkets selling building materials and furniture that has at least 107 stores in Russia.

The company has no plans to leave the Russian market and even wants to take advantage of the fact that many competitors have stopped their cooperation with the aggressor. In a letter to partners on March 11 the management of the Russian department of Leroy Merlin stated that the company is ready for new proposals to increase supplies and expand the product range

Mars and Mondelez International — both American food companies expressed virtually the same position two weeks after Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine.

The management of Mondelez International one of the largest food corporations in the world primarily known for the Oreo and Milka brands has decided to reduce its activities in Russia but not to stop production at Russian facilities. The reduction of activity means the cessation of all investments in Russia as well as the curtailment of all advertising activities.

Mars which owns brands such as Snickers Twix M&M’s Milky Way Whiskas has announced similar approach:

cessation of all activities in social networks;

termination of all advertising activities;

curtailment of all investments in the Russian market.

That is the American confectionery giants are not currently considering the option of a full exodus from Russia.

Pirelli — unlike its concurrents an Italian tire manufacturer does not want to leave Russia.

“Pirelli is constantly monitoring the development and consequences of the situation [in Ukraine] with the help of a specially created crisis committee. At the moment we have no plans to stop production at any of our facilities [in Russia]” ANSA reported.

Probably in the near future they will have to make a choice between Russia and the support of motorsport fans. The fact is that Pirelli is one of the members of the F1 sponsorship team. Formula 1 has already condemned the war and terminated the contract with the Russian GP which was held in Sochi. What is more the Haas F1 team the main sponsor of which was the Russian company Uralkali refused to cooperate with them and said goodbye to the Russian pilot Nikita Mazepin.

On March 17 2022 the company published a press release entitled ‘The Board of Directors approves the results to 31 December 2021’ the last two lines indicate the issues of work in the aggressor country.

“Investments halted in Russia excluding those linked to security. The activities of the factories will be progressively limited to finance salaries and services for employees” the document claims.

Huawei the Chinese telecommunications giant not only stays in the Russian market but is also suspected of helping the Putin regime to fight against cyberattacks on government and propaganda resources.

According to Daily Mail this was even reported by the Chinese media but later all such messages were deleted. It was noted that Huawei intends to use its research centers in Russia (there are five of them) to train 50000 technical experts to protect Russian Internet network in the face of cyber threats.

Obviously Huawei denies all the accusations but few believe the claims of Chinese monopolists. In particular on March 7 one of the best footballers of the XXI century the forward of Bayern Munich Robert Lewandowski terminated a multimillion-dollar sponsorship contract with Huawei amid reports of the Chinese giant’s cooperation with Russia.

Tetra Pak — a Swedish-Swiss company the largest manufacturer of food packaging in Russia. A striking example of a company that tries to sit on two chairs at once.

Initially the management of Tetra Pak was keeping silent about the war and only on March 12 released a statement condemning Russia’s actions. It was said that company are going to refuse to invest in Russian economy and restrict on its activity in the aggressor state to essential food products such as milk and children’s food.

However on March 28 the Russian media reported that Tetra Pak was temporarily suspending the production of packaging for wine and beverages with a capacity of two liters (except juices). Moreover the reason is not that Russian missiles are destroying Ukrainian cities and killing peaceful Ukrainians but simply a lack of raw materials for packaging.

It’s unclear how wine can be considered as a socially important product for Russian children but Kremlin propagandists noted that Tetra Pak has enough raw materials for only one month and has not yet agreed on new supplies from China.

It is worth mentioning the work of catering services in Russia. As of March 7 the following companies continued to operate with the aggressor:

Yum! Brands (the owner of KFC  Pizza Hut  Taco Bell )*;

(the owner of   )*; McDonald’s **;

**; Starbucks ***;

***; Burger King ****;

****; Papa John’s.

*Yum! Brands. On March 8 the company announced the suspension of investments and the development of restaurants in Russia. In fact this means that Russian franchisees have been left without external funding but will continue to operate at their own expense. Yum! Brands has promised to redirect all the profit taken from Russian outlets to humanitarian efforts.

**McDonald’s. On the same day as a direct competitor in the face of KFC the company officially announced the temporary closure of all 850 restaurants in Russia. “McDonald’s has decided to temporarily close all our restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market. We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners” said in the statement.

However the company will continue to pay full salaries to its employees in Russia. And there are about 62000 of them!

***Starbucks. Immediately after McDonald’s the official position of one of the world’s largest coffee chains has appeared. After 13 days of war Starbucks decided not to sponsor the murderers and announced the suspension of business in Russia.

“We condemn the unprovoked unjust and horrific attacks on Ukraine by Russia and our hearts go out to all those affected… We continue to watch the tragic events unfold and today we have decided to suspend all business activity in Russia including shipment of all Starbucks products” said in the letter sent by CEO Kevin Johnson.

****Burger King — Restaurant Brands International which owns the Burger King chain finally made a statement on Ukraine on March 10. It turns out that in Russia the company does not own any Burger King restaurants in Russia because the business is fully franchised and managed by a local master franchisee.

In the end the company made a choice and announced a number of steps to sever operational ties to Russia namely:

refusal of new investments in Russia and expansion of the network;

suspension of all the corporate support for the Russian franchisees including at the level of operations marketing and supply chain;

any profits from franchised operations will be redirected to humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees.

In addition there were large corporations that had been keeping silent for a long time haven’t made any statements about leaving the Russian market and had continued to work with the aggressor as if nothing was happening. These included PepsiCO P&G and Unilever. However after some time weighing all the reputational risks they declared their positions:

PepsiCO — partial suspension of sales of goods in Russia (this applies to soft drinks under the brands Pepsi Sprite Mirinda; sales of goods in the categories of baby food and dairy products will continue);

— partial suspension of sales of goods in Russia (this applies to soft drinks under the brands Pepsi Sprite Mirinda; sales of goods in the categories of baby food and dairy products will continue); P&G — suspension of new investments in Russia cessation of advertising activity and reduction of the range of goods in stores (only health hygiene and personal care products will be left on the shelves);

— suspension of new investments in Russia cessation of advertising activity and reduction of the range of goods in stores (only health hygiene and personal care products will be left on the shelves); Unilever — suspension of exports of its products to Russia cessation of advertising activity refusal of new investments and profits from the Russian Federation (basic foodstuffs and hygiene products manufactured at the company’s Russian enterprises will remain on the market).

Raiffeisen Bank — In early March Reuters reported that one of the largest banks in Central and Eastern Europe Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) was looking into leaving Russia. Subsequently the RBI denied this information and its Russian department still continues to cooperate with the aggressor.

On March 9 they went even further. The Raiffeisen’s press-center reported that the bank has made Visa and Mastercard cards termless for Russian individuals and small businesses.

“Raiffeisen Bank’s Visa and Mastercard cards have become termless. Now individuals entrepreneurs and owners of small and micro businesses can use them in Russia without limitation. It is not necessary to reissue the cards — the validity of current cards has been extended automatically” the bank reports.

Deutsche Bank — Germany’s largest bank also does not want to leave Russia completely.

«We are often asked why we are not withdrawing completely from Russia. The answer is that this would go against our values. We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight. And as far as we can we will continue to also support them too at this difficult time» — Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing wrote on March 10.

However the German bank has declared its readiness to cease some types of businesses in Russia (not specified) and added that over the past few years DB has significantly reduced its presence in the Russian market. In addition the bank’s management assured that it would closely monitor the sanctions policy of the EU and if necessary they would adapt to the new approach to cooperation [or exodus from Russia].

Finally on March 11 the management of Deutsche Bank dared to announce that the largest German financial institution is eager to leave Russia. “We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations. There won’t be any new business in Russia” the bank said in a statement.

Crédit Agricole — French banking group has been keeping silent about its work in Russia for a long time. And only on March 22 almost a month after the beginning of invasion the company decided to sever all ties with the aggressor.

It is noted that one of the largest French banks has already suspended new financing of Russian companies and in a few weeks it will completely suspend all its activities in Russia.

“The group has contacted its international corporate clients to establish the terms of the cessation of services provided locally by Crédit Agricole CIB which will take effect in the coming weeks” noticed in the bank statement.

Hyatt and Hilton — the largest chains of luxury hotels were silent for two weeks waiting for what the public would say about them Finally they made statements about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On March 9 both companies announced that they will stop advertising campaigns in Russian market refuse to open new hotels in Russia but are not going to close existing ones.

They also expressed the full support and the readiness to promote the humanitarian efforts to Ukrainian refugees. “The Hilton network is ready to donate up to 1 million hotel room nights in hotels across Europe to support Ukrainian refugees fleeing horrific violence in their country” said in the statement.

A similar offer was made by Hyatt. Both companies also promised to direct all profits from activities in Russia to humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Nonetheless there are some hotel networks that continue to operate in Russia and do not comment on the situation in Ukraine:

Accor ;

; Intercontinental Hotels ;

; Marriott.

Renault — a French automotive company that stopped production at its facilities in Russia on February 28. As it turned out the reason was not the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the genocide of the Ukrainian people organized by Putin but the problems with logistics and lack of spare parts.

Renault was not going to completely refuse to sponsor Putin’s bloody regime and on March 21 even restore production at its Moscow plant.

However just two days later after heavy criticism of the company on the Internet Renault again announced the closure of its plant in Moscow.

“The Board of Directors of Renault Group met today and approved the following items: Renault Group activities in its manufacturing plant in Moscow are suspended as of today. Regarding its stake in AVTOVAZ Renault Group is assessing the available options taking into account the current environment while acting responsibly towards its 45000 employees in Russia” the company said in an official statement.

In addition the following companies are still fully or partially presented on the Russian market (as of March 23):

pharmaceutical: Pfizer  Bayer  Johnson & Johnson  Abbot Labs  AmerisourceBergen  Novartis ;

     ; tobacco: Phillip Morris  JTI ;

 ; banks: Citi  UniCredit Group Société Générale Credit Suisse;

Oil shot above $100 per barrel for the first time in years the day Russia invaded Ukraine and has climbed sharply higher since. On Thursday Brent crude  the international oil benchmark hit $119.84 per barrel  while the U.S. benchmark topped $116. ""The move higher in global natural gas and power prices is potentially a longer-term catalyst for acceleration of development of renewable energy capacity globally across a variety of technologies including solar wind and green hydrogen"" said Ameet Thakkar energy transition and infrastructure analyst at BMO. ""These energy sources will be viewed as more price competitive in a higher for longer scenario for energy prices"" he added. In an otherwise weak month for stocks – the S & P 500 is down 3.8% while the Nasdaq Composite has shed 5.5% – some clean energy stocks are posting solid gains. The iShares Global Clean Energy fund is up about 6% while the Invesco Solar fund has added 7%. The fund is coming off a 9% gain in February which snapped three straight months of losses. Some of the top performers over the last month include Daqo New Energy  SolarEdge Technologies and Hannon Armstrong  which have all risen more than 20%. Within the renewable energy ecosystem nuclear-power related stocks have outperformed over the last month. The North Shore Global Uranium Mining fund and the Global X Uranium fund are both up more than 13%. The surge in oil and gas prices is hitting Europe especially hard given that the E.U. imports about one third of its natural gas from Russia. The country's war on Ukraine is forcing Europe to look elsewhere for fuel — including importing record amounts of U.S. liquified natural gas — as Europe rethinks its long-term energy strategy. ""Owing to their cost competitiveness as well as relatively quick deployment capability renewables could potentially see increased investment as an option to increase the region's energy security"" JPMorgan said in a Feb. 28 note to clients. With that in mind the firm scanned its coverage universe of U.S. clean energy stocks with the most exposure to Europe to see who stands to benefit most from an accelerated transition. Enviva tops the list with 96% of its revenue exposed to the region according to the firm's estimates. Next are SolarEdge and Canadian Solar at 45% and 35% respectively. TPI Composites and Itron round out the top five at 30% and 27%. The firm said that SolarEdge and Enphase could be the biggest winners due to their ""demonstrated ability to rapidly scale manufacturing capacity (outsourced) could lead to relative outperformance."" Enphase's exposure to Europe is around 15% based on JPMorgan's estimates. Fossil fuel prices are not the only thing that impacts renewable energy buildout. After all crude prices have been climbing since U.S. oil plunged into negative territory in April 2020 for the first time on record. In 2020 the Invesco solar fund surged 233% but then posted a 25% decline in 2021 and is in the red for 2022 too. The group is also highly sensitive to interest rates. And as a speculative area of the market the group will also face pressure if investors flee growth-oriented areas – and the promise of future profits – in favor of safe-haven assets and value stocks. Still Guggenheim said that hydrocarbon pricing is an important factor. ""Absent any additional shocks high fossil fuel prices are likely to drive additional outperformance in decarbonization stocks from current levels"" the firm said in a Feb. 28 note to clients. The firm looked at a number of variables including interest rates in relation to clean energy stocks' performance finding that fossil fuel pricing was the ""one that explained decarbonization stock movements most effectively."" But the sector is also suffering from headwinds playing out broadly in the economy including supply chain bottlenecks and rising raw material costs. First Solar recently reported a mixed quarter and issued disappointing guidance as factors including a surge in freight costs eat into the company's profits. On the raw materials front polysilicon prices are up 300% according to Rystad Energy. Silver copper aluminum and glass prices are also jumping. The firm said this poses an elevated risk for utility scale solar and wind projects and forecasts that some projects projected to break ground in the first half of 2022 are in danger of becoming stalled. There are others who say that the jump in oil and gas prices which is contributing to inflationary fears across the country mean the U.S. and others should ramp up hydrocarbon production. Oil and gas rigs can come online faster than renewable alternatives and are also a baseload source of power. Wind and solar on the other hand are intermittent since they cannot just be ramped up at will. Batteries powerful enough to store energy for weeks and months have not yet reached commercial production. But as Europe especially re-thinks its energy policy shifting away from dependency on Russia will include accelerating the pace of renewables' buildout. ""Renewable electricity also affords countries with large deployment of projects greater energy independence"" said Matt Breidert senior portfolio manager at Ecofin. ""In general the more expensive fossil fuels become the greater the arbitrage of relative cost to cheaper renewable electricity. …We would expect the current energy cycle becomes parasitic to demand eventually"" he added. - CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

Tiah in fact should be automatically disqualified from sitting on any Committee that is supposed to determine where the faults lie in the preventable deaths of the four divers.

Tiah already faced charges laid by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for mismanaging millions of dollars in eTeck. In that matter he was represented by Stuart Young now Minister of Energy and Michael Quamina now Chairman of the Board of Trinidad Petroleum Holdings Limited the parent company to Paria Fuel Trading Company Limited and the personal attorney of Keith Rowley.

It would be hard to find a more conflicted person than Eugene Tiah and the Leader of Opposition rightly pointed this out in her press release of 5th March 2022.

Remarkably the Energy Chamber was silent while the entire nation was wringing its hands reeling from the horrific information about our trapped divers.

Yet within hours of the Opposition’s Leaders calling out the inappropriateness of Tiah’s appointment they issued their release to defend Young and Tiah.

This begs the question: Whom does the Energy Chamber represent?

The country should learn the lessons it did with the President’s Senators — mislabelled as “independent.” There is a mistaken notion somehow that the Energy Chamber represents the well-being of the Trinidad and Tobago energy sector for the benefit of citizens.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

Let us start by looking at the Executive Committee and their industry affiliations:

– Dwight Mahabir Chairman (Chief Executive Officer Damus Ltd.)

– Dr Thackwray Driver President and Chief Executive Officer

– George Vieira Vice-Chair (Upstream) (President EOG Resources)

– Jerome Dookie Vice-Chair (Downstream) (Chief Executive Officer Caribbean Nitrogen)

– Ricardo Mahadeo Vice-Chair (Energy Services) (Chief Executive Officer TOSL Engineering)

– Claire Fitzpatrick Secretary (Regional President BP Trinidad and Tobago)

– Hafiz Ali Treasurer (Chief Executive Officer Weldfab)

Here are the Ordinary Board Members with their industry affiliations:

– Ronald Adams (CEO Atlantic)

– Colin Bain (Managing Director & President Methanex)

– Mala Baliraj-Dass (Chief Executive Officer Massy Wood)

– Arlene Chow (Chief Executive Officer Heritage Petroleum Company)

– Mark Loquan (President National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Ltd.)

– Eugene Okpere (Vice President & Country Chair Shell Trinidad and Tobago)

– Pria Narinesingh (Country Managing Partner EY)

– Dr Vernon Paltoo (President National Energy Corporation of Trinidad and Tobago Ltd.)

– Shaun Rampersad (Chief Operating Officer Ramps Logistics)

The first question we ask is was this rapid show of support for Stuart Young and the Government their refusal to address the Leader of Opposition’s concerns about Tiah’s serious conflicts of interest — indeed their casual dismissal of these concerns — and their irrational expression of “full confidence” in Tiah approved by all board and executive members?

If so then bpTT Massy Wood Atlantic LNG EOG Methanex Shell Ernst and Young and other national and international corporate citizens have consciously entered into the political gayelle. This would be unfortunate but it would make them fair political game.

How can the Energy Chamber have full confidence that a man like Tiah who is so closely connected to the PNM party and Government can hold the Government firmly to account when necessary?

They can only have that “confidence” because the Energy Chamber does NOT represent the interest of the energy sector for the benefit of the country. They only represent the commercial interests of their individual members whether or not this aligns with the national or sectoral interest.

The Energy Chamber’s function is to help members hobnob with Government officials and get lucrative contracts thereby. Every single one of these Energy Chamber members represents companies that depend on state contracts licenses etc.

Four dead divers under troubling circumstances are not a major concern to them. There was no press release on that. Eugene Tiah being on the investigation committee however is worthy of a rapid press release to contradict the Leader of Opposition.

The Energy Chamber has long been a pro-PNM party group but clearly with the government under immense pressure they have now come out to openly defend their party.

The Energy Chamber needs to become a vehicle to stand for the energy sector in the national interest as opposed to an echo chamber of apologies for the Government in order for their companies to win contracts.

The Energy Chamber instead should be calling on Government to explain why Natural Gas production is at a 15-year low why LNG production fell 48 percent in the third quarter of 2021 and most of all why despite a seven-year high of energy prices this nation is not benefiting because production has collapsed under the PNM.

If the Energy Chamber wants to enter the national political gayelle it must be to stand up for the sector they say they represent which has been under attack and decimated by this Government.

That would have included standing up for the safety and the lives of the four divers who like thousands of other workers are the lifeline in the energy sector.

But this would be too much to ask of these obvious “eat ah fooders” who are mainly concerned about their own well-being and feeding at the energy sector trough that this nation generously provides them.

Once again we call on the families of the victims to be allowed a professional representative on the Government’s investigation committee. The politically-biased Energy Chamber does not represent the interests of the citizens the country or the families of the deceased.

Justice must be done for the divers.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine risks it all,"Male and female software developers work at their desks in the Luxoft Holding Inc. offices in Kiev Ukraine on Tuesday Oct. 31 2017. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Technology has been at the center of national security and global economic concerns for years. U.S. President Joe Biden used his State of the Union address this week to again focus on competition with China and competitiveness in technology manufacturing. But that speech was overwhelmed by the more immediate concern of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and there is another key link in the technology sector that the first land war in Europe since WWII has highlighted: the booming hub of tech workers in Eastern Europe. Ukraine Belarus and Russia – three countries now intertwined in war – have grown into essential growth areas for tech talent in a world more reliant on digital than ever before. From start-ups sourcing the developers and engineers they need to get to the next level to already established corporations relying on software partners for digital transformation hundreds of thousands of tech workers in the region have become critical to the global economy. Gartner estimates there are over one million IT professionals in the three countries with one-quarter (250000) working for consulting or outsourcing firms. There were 200000 Ukrainian developers in the country in 2020 according to Amsterdam-based software development outsourcing company Daxx which says that 20% of Fortune 500 companies have their remote development teams in Ukraine. Software vendors working on behalf of big corporations from financials to retail rely on the talent that the region has cultivated. Take EPAM Systems  as an example. More than 50% of its tech staff are across the three nations – over 30000 employees. It is an example of just how quickly war can disrupt the functioning of organizations in ways impossible to imagine with internal dissension now an issue for EPAM leadership as workers in Ukraine call for its CEO to take a much harder anti-Putin line according to a Bloomberg report even though it has so many workers in Russia and Belarus.

For many following the rapidly unfolding events on social media Aleksandr Volodarsky the Ukrainian founder and CEO of developer outsourcing company Lemon.io has helped to make the human dimensions and tech worker dimensions of the war real through tweets such as one in which he showed a picture of his chief marketing officer in military gear. He had announced back in mid-February that his company was providing two months of pay in advance to employees and he has since posted that clients are stepping up and ""even though developers are mobilized unavailable can't work or volunteered to help the army they will keep paying them regular salaries."" For analysts who have covered companies like EPAM Systems associated with the rise of talent in the region immediate concerns are with the contacts they have made and the individuals they have come to know from the ranks of company leadership and the broader tech communities in Eastern Europe and the scope of the humanitarian crisis in the region is greater than any company or sector outlook. ""Yes our teams are sending deliverables from a f—ing parking garage in Kharkiv under heavy shelling and gunfire in the area. Amazing humans"" Logan Bender chief financial officer at a San Francisco-based software licensing company said in a story posted to Instagram on Tuesday by venture capital meme account PrayingforExits. Longer-term though there is significant risk of a ripple effect across technology and other sectors. ""We've seen a lot of Eastern European countries become hotbeds for development"" said Scott Berg software analyst at Needham. ""Whether it is the right individuals or the right individuals at the right price across all of the companies I cover a solid third if not half have resources in that area."" ""These public companies the headline companies like EPAM are just the tip of the iceberg"" said another analyst.

The dawn of digital geopolitics

The ubiquity of digital technology is intersecting with the geopolitical aspirations of countries in what Gartner now refers to as ""digital geopolitics."" This competition in the digital realm between countries ""is now one of the most disruptive trends"" wrote David Groombridge Gartner Research VP and his colleagues in a report this week. The Gartner team says executives were worried about their enterprise location strategy even before the Russia-Ukraine War with 43% of boards of directors telling Gartner deglobalization was a major concern. The answer isn't to pull out of the region or necessarily pull existing accounts from vendors though this is a risk for any companies with significant talent pools in the region. Analysts say clients will be reluctant to pull work as long as operations can continue but may be less inclined to give expanded work to companies with this geographic risk especially when they have to take into account issues including cybersecurity and that could limit the growth trajectory for the Eastern Europe tech hub and companies reliant on it. For companies in the region they are just trying to understand basic operational issues such as how long they will access to funds to pay workers based in Russia where financial restrictions imposed by the West could limit their payroll abilities and making sure workers have the internet access needed. And the longer the conflict goes on the more tech firms in the region and their clients will worry about technology restrictions and implications for new product development. ""The current impacts to software development centers in Ukraine and surrounding countries have brought this into sharper focus forcing organizations to rapidly reconsider which countries their IT services and supply chains should be sourced from"" Groombridge told CNBC via email. ""The answer should not be a reactive onshoring of capabilities especially in a world where the current crisis will increase existing shortages of digital skills. Instead executives need to navigate a complex balance of competitive advantage geographic concentration risks skills availability legal and regulatory issues and country risk factors to relocate their IT services."" There was already an acute shortage of labor in the technology sector where on average it can take up to 70 days to hire a skilled worker. ""The best talent is in Silicon Valley and the U.S. but the second-biggest hub is Eastern Europe"" said one Wall Street analyst who has traveled throughout the region. Developing tech talent isn't easy and it isn't a problem as simple to fix as moving a factory from one location to another. ""The people problem takes a long time. These hubs take a long time to develop"" the analyst said. Unlike the economic hubs that have developed across the globe based on natural resource riches precious minerals or commodities for fuel intellectual concentration of resources doesn't happen often. Before Eastern Europe it had been decades since a significant new software and technology talent pool had been developed. So far the companies most exposed are managing — building up a cash reserve in advance relying on data centers outside the region to begin with building redundancies into processes in the event that systems aren't functioning. But the longer the conflict persists the more stability is at risk. The worst fears about cybersecurity and access to the technology needed to perform core tasks have not played out on a widespread basis though there have been internet outages in Ukraine and Russian missiles targeting key infrastructure and Russia's invasion is intensifying and expected to target more population centers. If there is a potential silver lining according to experts who have studied the region while other global tech hubs such as Israel and some South American nations are growing in the same way that European nations are committing to defense budgets that are much larger now than just a month ago Eastern European nations such as Poland Romania and Ukraine may see further investment and support in their economies in the future even if Russia remains shunned by the global economy. Volodarsky recently laid out a business plan with an end date that isn't typical for a CEO not measured in a quarter or year but rather ""until the end of the war."" • Keep it running with those who can work.

• Support and pay the team even if they are not available.

• Donate profits to army. Among all the other global implications of a war that is still for many in the stun phase one tech lesson that has the potential to be significant for both consumers and businesses is becoming clear: the global economy can't build a talent pool the size of the one that now exists in Eastern Europe quickly but it's hyper-real now that events within a few weeks can suddenly run the risk of seriously damaging it. —CNBC's Natasha Turak contributed to this report",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvaW5zaWRlLXRyYWNrLW1haGVycy1tb3Njb3ctZmlybS1oYW1tZXJlZC1vbi10aGUtbWFya2V0cy1rZ2s5eHg1d2zSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Track: Maher's Moscow firm hammered on the markets,"Kerry man Tony Maher must be watching through his fingers as Russia’s economy heads for the bunker.

They start with a loan from a bank or mortgage company institutions that are subject to state and federal regulations. When buyers close on the home they want the agreement is registered with the government usually at county offices.

Americans who do not qualify for a conventional mortgage but still want a house to call their own sometimes opt for a thinly regulated financial arrangement called a contract for deed. In these deals the sellers function like lenders. They collect an initial down payment and then monthly payments.

The buyers in contract for deed agreements usually pay for taxes and insurance and they often pick up the tab for improvements and repairs on the property even before they have title to it.

Often it’s only when the buyer makes the final payment that the title of the property shifts from the seller to the buyer.

Real estate experts lawyers and consumer watchdog groups say these arrangements — as well as similarly structured rent-to-own contracts — rarely end with the buyer owning the home. What tends to happen instead is the buyer loses out through a process called forfeiture — often for falling behind on payments — while recouping none of the equity they would have built up in a traditional mortgage.

For example when the Pennsylvania Attorney General sued a company that did hundreds of rent-to-own contracts in that state it discovered that only 2% of buyers succeeded in obtaining the deed for the property — signifying that they were now homeowners.

“(Contracts) can be drawn up in a way that makes it almost impossible to succeed” said Alex Kornya general counsel for Iowa Legal Aid. “You lose every dollar that you’ve put into that house and the contract seller walks away with a total windfall.”

In Iowa there have been nearly 3700 contracts for deed recorded at county offices since 2008 according to figures furnished to the Midwest Newsroom by ATTOM a provider of mortgage data.

The numbers were lower in Kansas Nebraska and Missouri but figures likely underreport how many of the deals happen in those states because they have few to no laws requiring that these deals be registered at county offices.

Lance Lowenstein an attorney in Kansas City Missouri says he sees cases involving these contracts about once a week.

“Contracts for deed are kind of like the ‘buy here pay here’ car lots of the real estate business” he said in an interview in his office in northeast Kansas City home to many immigrants and economically struggling communities.

Contracts for deed — also known as land contracts installment sales or bond for deed — proliferated nationally and particularly in the Midwest in the wake of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Rent-to-own — sometimes called leases with an option to purchase — have similar characteristics that often shift the advantage of such transactions to sellers.

Investors ranging from small-time buyers with just a few houses to Wall Street hedge funds swooped in after the housing crisis and bought properties in bulk out of foreclosure or from government-sponsored mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The houses often uninhabitable or in poor condition and in low-income communities are typically marketed at those most at risk for exploitation: Black Latino or immigrant residents.

And while attorneys general in states in the Northeast and Great Lakes region have gone after large-scale contract for deed or rent-to-own sellers who use deceptive tactics attorneys general in the Midwest do not often take enforcement action.

Tiffany Martino

All Tiffany Martino wanted was to buy a home.

“Something my grandkids could come in that was always the same house” she said.

About seven years ago she moved from Gold Beach Oregon where she said housing prices were “outlandish” to North Platte Nebraska. She spotted a house she could buy for $78000.

Martino could see the place needed some work. The bathroom needed an overhaul. The floor was mostly missing in one room and had to be replaced. The paint was in bad shape. And she would have to do some landscaping.

But Martino needed a place to live.

“At the time when you’re in need and you don’t got a lot of down payment and somebody is willing to work with you you’re just like ‘Yeah that sounds good let’s do that’” she said.

Martino made a $1400 down payment to the owner. He agreed she would make $500 monthly payments until the house was paid off. She understood that she was renting to own. When repairs came up she would call the owner.

“He says ‘You’re buying this place you’re responsible for any repairs that occur you’re responsible for any of that’ ” Martino said.

Martino said she put some $10000 into the property which included removing trees and doing landscape work. And she made about $30000 in rent payments over those five years.

But she fell behind — she says about $3000 in arrears — and her landlord took her to court to have Martino evicted.

She eventually got in touch with Jeff Eastman the managing attorney for Legal Aid of Nebraska who represented her.

Eastman told Martino that she risked having a judge order her to pay the owner if the case went to trial. So they settled: Martino walked away from the house and the owner did not pursue her back rent.

“When they (buyers) leave they left their investment in the property and they don’t have anything to show for it” Eastman said. “Of course they’re quite angry about it.”

Including Martino who thought she was building toward home ownership.

“It was actually pretty much a letdown you know?” Martino said. “It wasn’t a good feeling to know that wasn’t the case and all the money I dumped in there I don’t get that back. It pretty much devastated me really.”

‘Equity stripping’

A 2019 study by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University outlines an earlier era of contracts for deed in Chicago where blockbusting and redlining depressed home prices in the 1960s and 1970s. Investors used contract sales to sell properties at inflated prices with high interest rates to people who could not get a conventional mortgage.

“These contracts were designed to fail” the Harvard study said “Allowing the seller to reclaim the property a form of equity stripping.”

Taz George a senior research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said that access to mortgages is an important way for families to build wealth.

George who co-authored the Harvard study said lenders rarely underwrite loans in low-income communities where homes are priced at less than $100000 and often need repairs. So contracts for deed sometimes fill the void.

“Really what we found is that communities that have a high number of land contract sales have a host of other housing and economic challenges” George said.

Contracts for deed are marketed as a way for people who can’t get a conventional mortgage to realize the dream of owning a home. To Kornya the Iowa Legal Aid lawyer such a pitch echoes that of another enterprise that targets low-income borrowers.

“That’s the exact same argument that payday lenders use. It’s nothing new: ‘We need to exploit low-income people because otherwise their lives would be worse’” Kornya said.

While never ideal lawyers and experts say contracts for deed can be one of few options for some real estate transactions. Buyers who lack credit history have damaged credit or who cannot make a down payment often do not qualify for a loan from banks or mortgage companies.

Echoing the Harvard findings the Joint Center for Housing Studies says traditional mortgage companies are reluctant to make loans in distressed neighborhoods leaving seller-financed loans or a contract for deed the instrument of last resort.

“We find that the ratio of new mortgage originations to households is one of the strongest predictors of contract for deed activity” the study says.

A lack of financial services in low income communities and — increasingly — in rural communities influences the demand for non-traditional lending agreements.

Michael Duffy a semi-retired attorney who has handled dozens of cases involving abuses of real estate contracts said in spite of the risks contracts for deed can be useful with responsible sellers.

“I don’t think (contracts for deed) should be illegal” Duffy said. “They just need to be more tightly regulated. It’s kind of a wild west out there.”

Enforcement efforts

Iowa tightened some of its land contract laws after a 2003 scandal involving the Wolford Group a family enterprise accused by the Iowa Attorney General of committing fraud when it bought and sold homes under risky land contracts.

Iowa sellers cannot enforce a land contract that is not recorded at a county office. And sellers who don’t record land contracts after 90 days are subject to daily fines.

Ashlee Kieler a spokeswoman for the Iowa Attorney General said the office still receives complaints about land contracts since the Wolford scandal and the office handles them as they arise.

“We have not had any recent litigation” Kieler said in an email.

A spokesperson for the Nebraska Attorney General declined to say if the office has brought any enforcement action on contract for deed or rent-to-own sellers.

Asked if the Missouri attorney general has pursued such sellers a spokesman pointed to a 2014 case in Jackson County where it sued Tri-State Holdings for a contract for deed scam in Kansas City’s predominantly Black communities.

The Kansas attorney general did not respond to a request for comment.

Attorneys general in other states have pursued large-scale contract for deed operators that have done business in Kansas Iowa Nebraska and Missouri.

Vision Property Management a hedge-fund backed enterprise in South Carolina at one point owned 10000 properties nationally including the Midwest according to a court filing.

In 2019 the New York Attorney General sued Vision and its affiliates portraying its business model as one built on deceptive and abusive practices that gave Vision “all the benefits and advantages of being both a mortgagee and landlord without any of the associated risks or responsibilities of those roles.”

New York buyers lived in homes that the lawsuit said were uninhabitable: There were pest infestations bad electric wiring rotted floors and roofs and mold and asbestos among other hazards.

Attorneys general in Wisconsin Maryland and Pennsylvania have pursued claims against Vision.

In 2019 FTE Networks acquired Vision. FTE said it was beginning to transition away from Vision’s rent-to-own business model according to a filing with the SEC.

FTE still faces litigation related to Vision’s business. Vision also faces a class-action lawsuit in Michigan where plaintiffs accuse the business of systematic deception.

The company said in an SEC filing in 2020 that it may not have enough liquidity to fund a legal defense and an adverse outcome in those cases could have a material effect on its finances.

A seller disappears

It was May 9 2014 when Maricela Orozco signed her name alongside that of Mauro Lopez to buy his home on the east side of Kansas City Missouri for $22000.

A friend told her he worked construction with Lopez who wanted to sell his house to keep it out of foreclosure. Orozco agreed to pay Lopez $1800 as a down payment clearing him of back property taxes before she moved in according to the paper contract she kept folded in a white envelope. The contract further outlines she would submit $500 in cash every month for 44 months. After a five-day grace period there would be a $50-dollar late fee with an additional $5 dollars for every additional day.

Orozco had seen the inside and knew it was still in rough shape.

“Walls not done. Little bit of the bathroom finished. No good plumbing” she said. “But I say ‘OK’ we fix it up’. And I move in with my kids fixing things little by little when I have the money.”

In keeping with the contract for deed model the tenant is responsible for improvements and repairs to the property.

“A contract for deed transaction has this fundamental problem that the buyer is being told they have all duties of homeownership and burdens of homeownership but they don’t get the protections of the right of foreclosure and they don’t have a deed and they don’t have a right to sell the home and realize the equity” said Sarah Mancini an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center. “So there really is a structural unfairness.”

At the time Orozco didn’t have authorization to live in the United States and spoke little English. She did not know what a property title was or how it was transferred. It never occurred to her to have a lawyer look over the contract find out if the title was clear of prior debt or do a background check on Lopez.

She never thought someone from her own community would cheat her.

“In the Latino community we try to help each other” she said. “We deal with the same issues like language. We don’t understand the laws…He believed in me. I wanted to believe in him.”

After 44 months of regular payments and more than $10000 in home improvements Lopez disappeared never giving Orozco title to the house.

Family and friends say he’s in Mexico but they don’t know where.

Other risks

Getting a clear title is a frequent problem with contracts for deed. Real estate lawyer Lowenstein said he has a current client who paid off a five-year contract only to learn the title she received is burdened with a mortgage worth $17000. She had no idea until she tried to sell the house. Lowenstein says if the seller doesn’t pay off the mortgage he and his client will go after him in court. But even if this client wins Lowenstein probably will not be successful in collecting a judgment.

“If he’s not credit-worthy and has no assets it’s uncollectable” Lowenstein said.

Contracts for deed often mask the true cost of a property. Like Orozco buyers typically don’t ask for an inspection or home appraisal. Orozco was relieved that Lopez accepted a $500 monthly payment all she could afford with her income. She had not considered the cost of making the place habitable — replacing the drywall buying appliances for the kitchen and repairing the plumbing and electrical systems.

“It was definitely in the thousands” she said “Probably more.”

Some people who sign contracts for deed end up in troubling situations like the case of Sylvia Juarez.

In the mid-2000s Juarez got divorced in Kansas City Missouri and needed a home for herself and her three young children.

Driving around one Sunday she saw a house with a sign in the yard: “For Sale by Owner.” She called the number and soon met with Travis Overs who claimed to be the owner of the home.

“We made an appointment to meet at Denny’s downtown” Juarez said. “He was very nice and dressed up” she said. He’d brought along a Spanish-speaking interpreter.

She’d only walked around the house one time from the outside peering in at the windows. When she asked Overs if she could see the inside he told her no saying there were others interested in the property and he’d need a decision right away.

He said he needed $8000 for a down payment immediately or he’d offer the house to someone else.

Juarez wanted to get a cashier’s check from a bank but Overs insisted on cash. When she asked to see the title he said he’d bring it over later.

“We needed the house so we gave him the money: Fives tens twenties fifties. And he gave us the key” she said.

A few months later there was a knock at the door. Law enforcement officers told her she was being evicted for non-payment of rent.

“I told them ‘No we signed the paper. We gave him the money and he gave us the key. We went over cleaned up and put our stuff in.’ ” she said.

The next day sheriffs’ deputies came and put all the Juarez family’s belongings out on the street. It turned out Overs never owned the property at all.

Attorney Michael Duffy was able to find Overs and get Juarez’s $8000 down payment back but she lost all the money she’d paid in repairs and maintenance.

Attempts to reach Overs were not successful.

Maricela Orozco who lost thousands of dollars is still without title to her house seven years later. Her sister is living there maintaining it and paying the taxes.

Lawyers say Orozco won’t get a judgment that mortgage or title company will accept unless Lopez the seller can be contacted and notified. Meanwhile he could reappear at any time and take the property back.

“So even though nobody has come back to say it’s not mine I don’t have the papers” Orozco said. “So it’s not. All I wanted is to own a home but this is still not really my house.”

A St. Louis case

In 2018 Justine wanted to move back to St. Louis.

She logged onto Zillow and spotted a house she liked in north St. Louis. It was on an acre of land. It had four bedrooms. It was on the bus line.

“I fell in love with the house” says Justine who asked that the Midwest Newsroom not use her real name because she is in a program to protect victims of domestic abuse.

The listing took her to a company called Joint Ops which advertised the home.When Justine called a Joint Ops employee gave her a code to go inside and check out the house. Justine who is visually impaired relied on her then-boyfriend to assess the property.

Her boyfriend thought it needed some fixing up but described the house’s needs as mostly cosmetic: A fresh coat of paint would help some windows needed replacing.

Justine lived on social security disability and had children to care for. Her total income was about $1300 a month. Her credit score was low and that made the prospect of buying a house difficult.

A Joint Ops employee according to court records said it had a program that could help her. She would give Joint Ops a $3000 down payment and then make $500 payments each month afterwards. After two years she could exercise an option to buy the home for $65000.

“They were in a hurry to get me to accept the contract with them” Justine said.

She couldn’t move in until she had an occupancy permit. When an inspector visited the house things took a turn for the worse.

“It was one of those things that as you go more damage unfolds” she said.

The roof sprung major leaks. There was mold mildew and termite damage throughout the house. The paint in the house had dangerous levels of lead.

Justine set out to start making repairs while making payments on a house she couldn’t live in for 18 months. Joint Ops in January 2020 took Justine to court in St. Louis County Associate Court when she was $500 — one month — behind on her payments.

“I felt really sad” Justine said. “This was something my children were all looking forward to moving into this house. I put all our hopes and dreams into this.”

Rob Swearingen an attorney with Legal Aid of Eastern Missouri took Justine’s case. He said the terms of the Joint Ops deal set his client up to fail.

“What does failure mean?” he said. “Failure meant (Joint Ops) got to keep all the money and the house. That’s kind of a nice deal: You can’t lose either way can you?”

Swearingen fought Joint Ops’ lawsuit and the two sides eventually settled with Justine getting back $9200. Jimmy Vreeland who started Joint Ops in 2014 acknowledged the situation with Justine was his company’s mistake.

“We would never do that deal again” he said in an interview.

Vreeland said his company rarely does lease with purchase options anymore and that he prefers standard leases because they involve more regulations and legal codes.

“That’s why I like doing regular leases now because it’s so black and white” Vreeland said.

Vreeland said lease with purchase options can work in the right situations. When he does do a lease with a purchase option the buyer is typically a contractor who can do the work of fixing up a house.

“If you‘re on the consumer side I would enter into it with care for sure” Vreeland said.

He noted that the next tenant who took up the house Justine tried to buy was able to do work on the house and is happy with the arrangement.

Meanwhile Justine said her story has a happy ending. After settling her case with Joint Ops she was able to get herself into another house in St. Louis County one she calls “a nice place to live.”

The Estée Lauder Companies Experiences Growth in Q3 2022 Despite Headwinds

Net sales grew in every product category even as the company suspended all commercial activity in Russia and Ukraine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy9wZXJmdW1lLXByaWNlcy1zdXJnZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMy8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy9wZXJmdW1lLXByaWNlcy1zdXJnZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The surprising reason perfume prices are skyrocketing,"New York CNN Business —

The price of premium perfumes recently soared by levels typically never seen for luxury fragrances. But don’t blame rising inflation — the reasons have more to do with consumer behavior in times of stress and uncertainty.

The average retail price for fragrances rose by 15% in 2021 compared to 2020 triple the average 5% increase during the prior two year according to the latest data from market research firm NPD.

“General inflation is not necessarily the story here. We started to see this swell of growth during the pandemic where consumers were willing to trade up to more premium fragrances” said Larissa Jensen NPD vice president and beauty industry advisor.

“We theorized that people were looking to treat themselves with little luxuries during these difficult times” she said. “Scents allow us to escape even momentarily and experience a different emotion.”

Fragrance sales have boomed through the pandemic fueled by robust demand for higher-priced eau de parfums –— perfumes with a higher percentage of fragrance oils that make the scent last longer once applied. Looking at perfumes alone (excluding home scents) sales last year surged 52% over 2020.

In the category fragrances priced over $175 more than doubled in the number of units sold 2021 the report said.

An air of refinement

Prestige fragrances maker Estée Lauder Companies is seeing that trend reflected in its sales said Stephane de La Faverie the company’s group president.

Also serving as global brand president of Estée Lauder and AERIN De La Faverie oversees the company’s portfolio of prestige fragrances including Jo Malone London Le Labo and By Kilian as well as Estée Lauder fragrances and AERIN fragrances. Demand for luxury perfumes is being driven by consumers who want a scent that is unique and made with more refined ingredients.

“We are very optimistic that the interest in luxury fragrances will continue thanks to exciting innovations new fragrance markets embracing this sub-category and consumers always wanting a little piece of luxury in their lives” said La Faverie.

As consumers increasingly gravitate to more upscale fragrances he said the company is trying to encourage purchases by offering incentives such as trial via sampling gifting and engaging with them in a personalized way through virtual consultations.

It’s a strategy leveraged by perfume subscription service Scentbird which sends its 450000 subscribers trial-size spray vials of luxury fragrances for $15.95 month. The idea is to help shoppers find their perfect fragrance match before they commit to buying a full-size bottle.

Scentbird’s subscribers jumped 50% in 2020 — the first year of the pandemic — over 2019 said Bettina O’Neill the company’s senior vice president of business development merchandising and wholesale.

“We learned that as more people were homebound because of the pandemic restrictions they were finding ways to still feel good” said O’Neill “They were buying fragrances for themselves and scented candles and fragrances for their homes.”

Prestige perfumes typically have a higher concentration of oils and use more expensive raw ingredients she explained so as demand soars so can production costs.

“Chanel No. 5 is one of the best known examples of this. One of the ingredients is a rare flower” said O’Neill. “Another popular prestige fragrance is Baccarat Rouge 540” by Maison Francis Kurkdjian originally for Baccarat.

The fragrance which costs upward of $300 for a 2.4 ounce bottle to more than $600 for an 6.8 ounce bottlle includes a blend of expensive ingredients like jasmine and saffron. If Tiktok is an indicator of its popularity #baccaratrouge540 has 124.1 million views on the platform.

NPD’s Jensen said it remains to be seen if demand for higher-priced perfumes will hold up as consumers are now paying even more on everyday necessities.

“We don’t expect it will keep growing at such a robust rate” she said adding that NPD could see the luxe fragrance category leveling off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLXBlcHNpY28tZmFjZS1ib3ljb3R0LWhhbHQtYnVzaW5lc3MtcnVzc2lhLXVrcmFpbmUtaW52YXNpb24tMjAyMi0z0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9tY2RvbmFsZHMtcGVwc2ljby1mYWNlLWJveWNvdHQtaGFsdC1idXNpbmVzcy1ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS1pbnZhc2lvbi0yMDIyLTM_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's PepsiCo face calls to halt business in Russia,"McDonald's is facing scrutiny over its business dealings in Russia. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson

McDonald's and PepsiCo along with many others are being urged to end their business in Russia.

New York state's comptroller wrote to several companies calling for action per Reuters.

British politician John Mann has made similar requests.

McDonald's and PepsiCo are among the food and drink companies facing calls from political figures to cut business ties with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

In a letter Friday Thomas DiNapoli New York state comptroller urged companies to rethink their Russian business operations because they face ""significant and growing legal compliance operational human rights and personnel and reputational risks"" Reuters reported.

He added that suspending or ending business in Russia ""would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market"" and play a key role in ""condemning Russia's role in fundamentally undermining the international order.""

McDonald's and PepsiCo did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

Other companies including Estee Lauder Kimberly-Clark Corp Coty Inc Mondelez International Inc Fortinet Inc Bunge Ltd Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and Trimble Inc were also asked in the letter to boycott business in Russia per Reuters.

Since Russian President Vladamir Putin invaded Ukraine in an unprovoked attack scores of companies have taken action by ending or limiting their commercial dealings with Russia.

Ikea Spotify and Nike were among the major companies that recently severed business ties with Russia. Some retail brands including Publix and Kroger also showed their solidarity with Ukraine by removing Russian vodka from store shelves.

British politician John Mann called for similar action to DiNapoli. In a tweet he said: ""If Mcdonalds and Starbucks continue to sell in Russia then an international boycott of their products should be instigated.""

Social media users have also called for company boycotts with McDonald's facing particular scrutiny.

One user who posted a photo of open McDonald's stores in Russia said: ""Guess who is doing business as normal in #Russia no surprise #BoycottMcDonalds.""

Another said: ""@McDonalds Leave #Russia or lose loyal customers the choice is yours. #BoycottMcDonalds.""

Now she makes camouflage nets for troops,"CNN —

Weaver Olena Shevtsova sells handmade Slavic and Ukrainian patterned belts sashes scarves and even guitar straps online to support her family but since Russian forces moved into her country she’s used her skills to help make camouflage webbing to protect Ukrainian troops.

“I call us the spider women” she said of her fellow volunteers in an email to CNN.

She said some people cut out fabric some hang up the webbing others make the braiding and children also come to help.

“The process reminds me of rug weaving” Shevtsova. “The hands are busy and it feels better. Last time when I was there we also sang Ukrainian songs and it was so cool to uplift the spirit!”

She lives in a small town in the Dnipropetrovsk region in southeastern Ukraine with her 10-year-old son and her dog and cat.

Shevtsova has been selling her woven goods on the Etsy marketplace since 2015 and said weaving is her primary source of income.

She cannot ship orders right now because of the fighting but she is still getting support from international buyers who’ve purchased her digital patterns and gift certificates. Some people have also ordered physical products but told her not to worry about shipping them.

“I never thought so many people who don’t know me would like to help me and my family” Shevtsova said.

Etsy buyers purchase digital goods to help

Posts urging people to help Ukrainians by buying digital items such as fonts patterns downloadable photographs and artwork are circulating widely on social media.

A search for Ukraine on Etsy turns up more than 90000 results and pages of T-shirts bracelets buttons and other items in the blue and yellow of the country’s flag. Many sellers have promised to donate the proceeds from the products to Ukrainian relief groups.

People from all over the world are also booking stays at Airbnb properties in Ukraine they don’t plan to use to get money to hosts.

An Etsy seller named Christie who sells baby clothes from her home in Arizona asked Ukrainians to post links to their shops in a post in one Facebook group so members could show their support.

She said her original goal was to help send “thoughts and prayers” to Ukrainian members of the Etsy community but she has bought some items directly from them.

“I want them to feel supported because I watch the news every day” Christie said. “Oh my gosh I can’t even imagine what they are going through.”

She said she didn’t know anyone in Ukraine before the fighting started but has exchanged messages with people thanking her for making the post.

Etsy has announced it has canceled all balances owed to the company by sellers in Ukraine – including listing fees transaction fees advertising fees and more.

Shevtsova said there has not been any fighting in her area yet but air raid alarms go off several times a day and neighbors are cleaning out their basements in case they need to take shelter.

“We live in a constant state of anxiety and uncertainty about what will happen next hour night morning day” she said.

Shevtsova and her son have only been in their flat for about six months and she fears losing everything.

Sitting down at night to read messages she has received has been calming she said.

“It is so helpful to share overwhelming feelings and emotions” she said. “It’s easier together it’s easier to feel someone’s support.”

The Etsy app makes a “cha-ching” sound every time there is an order and Shevtsova said it’s been reassuring to hear it throughout the day.

“To be honest these sounds warm my heart” she said. “Hearing ‘cha-ching’ I remember someone helps me I am not alone someone sends me love and power to live through this horror having food for my family and being even able to help other people in need I feel this support of many people worldwide.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGF4ZXMtb24tcmVzZWxsaW5nLXNpZGUtaHVzdGxlLWluY29tZS1lYmF5LXBvc2htYXJrLWV0c3ktZmFjZWJvb2stMjAyMi0y0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS90YXhlcy1vbi1yZXNlbGxpbmctc2lkZS1odXN0bGUtaW5jb21lLWViYXktcG9zaG1hcmstZXRzeS1mYWNlYm9vay0yMDIyLTI_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New taxes make reselling side hustles more complicated: eBay seller,"Anyone who makes over $600 a year for goods or services through eBay will now need to report their income to the IRS. Image Source

A director at a major media outlet generated more than $84000 in revenue as a reseller last year.

By buying many items in bulk he spends only a few hours reselling during the workweek.

He said new taxes would make life difficult for smaller sellers who previously didn't pay them.

Max Clayton started browsing garage sales during the pandemic.

""I needed something to do that wasn't sitting around all day doing my job or watching the news"" the 40-year-old told Insider. ""During that first spring garage sales started popping up and it seemed like good timing.""

And it was good timing to start a reselling business. Clayton had never done it seriously he said but joined eBay as a teenager in the 1990s selling vintage T-shirts and antiques he found at thrift stores with his family.

""I would go to garage sales on a Saturday and come home with a variety of items I never would have thought of"" he said.

Nearly three decades later he revived the hobby as a side hustle — and grossed more than $84000 in sales last year on eBay alone according to tax documents viewed by Insider. Clayton also said he generated additional sales through other platforms. All that is on top of Clayton's salary as a media director a role has had for nearly 20 years at a popular media company where he makes about $295000 annually before taxes.

Clayton requested that both his real name and employer be kept anonymous for privacy reasons. His identity is known to Insider.

According to ZipRecruiter resellers in St. Louis — where Clayton is — make about $87546 in revenue annually before expenses and taxes. Nationwide that average is $95190 a year a figure that likely reflects gross revenue before profits for full-time resellers ZipRecruiter told Insider. Clayton's resale profits for 2021 were about $45000 according to a personal tracking spreadsheet viewed by Insider. Those proceeds are made primarily from he and his wife selling shopping and shipping on weekends.

Clayton said he liked that reselling accommodated his schedule as a full-time media director. But he said that customers could be hard to deal with and that changing tax laws in the US were raising tensions for many others in the reselling industry.

""I can wake up in the morning and have made $600 overnight"" he said. ""It's all about time flexibility.""

Buying is a time-consuming hobby but reselling can be profitable if you're strategic

Clayton doesn't have a niche as a seller: He and his wife are in the business of everything.

They have categories in which they sell more frequently because they're more knowledgeable in it he said. For instance he knows more about electronics men's clothing and activewear while she has an eye for women's clothing and ceramics.

""When we both go sourcing together we take home twice as much stuff"" he said.







Clayton said one of the benefits of the business being so time-flexible was that he and his wife could trade off tasks more easily. He can post listings and buy inventory on weekends or before work and she can ship stuff out whenever it needs to go. That's compatible with her work as a full-time homemaker Clayton said.

Clayton added that they were sourcing items in person less and less.

""I'm operating in a situation where I have a limited amount of time. I have a full-time job. I can't bleed into that full-time job very easily so I'm consistently looking for ways to source more inventory in less time"" he said. He often buys wholesale from sellers he's built personal relationships with.

He bought over 100 pairs of Converse sneakers at a discount from one retailer he said and acquired them at a discount.

""If I were only sourcing from garage sales and thrift stores it would take two weeks to get that much inventory"" he said. ""As much as our bandwidth allows we buy in bulk and supplement with thrift stores and garage sales because we like doing that.""

The government is cracking down on a once invisible marketplace

Clayton pointed out that businesses like his were about to face a new challenge. Tax laws are changing this year in a way that makes it difficult for resellers to avoid paying them.

Anyone who makes over $600 a year for goods or services through money-transfer platforms such as Cash App Venmo and PayPal — or retailers like eBay and Etsy — will need to report their income to the IRS. Until this year that threshold was $20000 a year.

It was always illegal to avoid reporting your income to the IRS no matter how low unless you were explicitly exempted. But now websites like eBay will automatically request a seller's Social Security number or Individual Tax Identification Number once they reach $600 in sales.

""I'm a big-time seller. I pay my taxes and I run it like a business"" Clayton said. ""But this would definitely draw small-time sellers away … who don't usually self-report.""

That has the potential to affect a lot of people: In a 2016 survey of American adults by the Pew Research Center nearly one in five respondents said they earned money selling something online.

For someone like Clayton who has always reported his income as a seller the new rules don't make a difference. His biggest challenge he said is customers who can be ""hard to deal with"" at times.

""When people are buying merchandise online they don't know who you are"" he said. ""They perceive you to be a faceless corporation so they have the same expectation as if they were buying something off Amazon. That has made it more difficult to meet their expectations.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NtaW5lci5jb20vaW50ZXJpb3ItYWxhc2thLWNoZW5hLWhvdC1zcHJpbmdzLWZhaXJiYW5rcy1pY2UtYXJ0L3ZpZGVvXzkzNzE1NDA1LTljZTQtNTczMS05ZjVlLTc4ZTg0MGNhYjY1Yy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interior Alaska | Chena Hot Springs & Fairbanks Ice Art,"Support Local Journalism

While you should definitely be scoping out and investing in transitional jackets and cargo pants there are more subtle ways to reinvent your style — enter: the silk headband. “They were a strong trend at fashion week in New York Milan and Paris and we’ll definitely be seeing them more this season” celebrity hairstylist Suzie Kim tells TZR.

Kim says to think of them as a seasonal update on hats and beanies. You can wear them with your hair up or down. “They’re an incredibly cool way to disguise dirty hair in between washes” she adds. The stylish accessory has already been making the rounds on Instagram — and as you can see the small addition elevates and ties together an otherwise casual look.

International It girls are teaming the accessory with spring wardrobe staples from cropped sweaters to oversized blouses and lacy bodysuits. The silky material in particular that makes the look feel on trend giving it a luxe and almost regal vibe. — not to mention the silk material also helps protect your hair from friction other materials may cause (it’s why silk pillowcases are so beloved)

Ahead a few silk headband hairstyles you’re going to want to test drive this season.

We only include products that have been independently selected by TZR's editorial team. However we may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.

Simple Silk Headband

If your outfit is on the busier side (like this multi-color sweater above) opt for a clean and simple band that compliments the look. A solid-colored headband will go with just about anything and opting for a color that matches your outfit adds an extra “put together” effect.

Padded Silk Headband

Padded headbands make an impression all on their own. “It’s a cool statement accessory to add to a more minimal look” explains Kim. She suggests teaming it with a more casual look like jeans and simple blow dried hair.

Silk Scarf Headband

You can take your hair from drab to fab with a scarf headband. “I love a pairing it with fuller hair for a retro look or super straight hair for a sleeker more modern look” says Kim.

Knotted Silk Headband

Kim calls this style one of her favorites because it’s the most versatile. “The knotted headband is a new way to do boho — it looks good with beachy looks or festival looks” she says. Don’t be afraid to try patterns; style your hair in beachy waves or air dried strands to lean into the vibe."

Pictured is a facility on Leverington Avenue in Manayunk. Read more

Combining households renovating your living room or turning that spare bedroom into an office often means clearing out your possessions. But not all home projects have to involve a Marie Kondo-style purge. What about items that are still a part of your life but that just need a temporary home? That’s where self-storage comes in.

You don’t have to look far to find a storage facility these days: In 2021 there were 50523 in the United States up from 44149 in 2017 according to the 2022 Self-Storage Almanac which tracks industry statistics. And self-storage is popular with record occupancies of 94.5% last year.

“People turn to self-storage usually because of some sort of life transition such as moving or downsizing. It’s not just that you have too much stuff” says McKall Morris spokesperson for Extra Space Storage one of the largest self-storage companies with more than 2000 properties nationwide. “Our typical customer is new to self-storage renting for two years or less — usually about three months — and storing personal belongings. We’re also seeing small businesses rent space for extra storage of inventory or equipment.”

Here’s what to consider when selecting a self-storage facility.

Interior vs. exterior storage. An interior unit is like a supersized walk-in closet. You’ll typically bring your items to a load-in area transfer them to a dolly and move them to your unit. Many facilities have multiple stories so you may need to take an elevator. Some locations are designed so you can drive up to your unit. Interior spaces are protected from the elements but there can be drawbacks.

“Self-storage facilities typically have nice wide hallways and large individual unit doors but you still may have to squeeze through one or more standard-size doors to access the hallway to your unit” says Mark Aselstine who used several storage units for his former business Uncorked Ventures in California.

An exterior unit is akin to a garage. You can drive up to the door and load items directly into your unit. “While it is often more convenient and accessible for loading I often found my unit blocked by trucks” Aselstine said “and it seems like people are always milling outside exterior units.”

Customer service. Store managers should be professional knowledgeable and familiar with the property. If they can’t answer your questions keep looking Morris says. Take note that some independent facilities are not staffed. With these you can rent a unit online or contact a call center and work with an agent to choose and lease space. There should be a property manager on-call in case an issue arises but the person doesn’t work on-site.

Size. The biggest mistakes renters make are either overestimating or underestimating the space they need so they either pay too much or have to rent two units Morris says. “Know what you are going to store” she says. “Create an informal list and take some pictures you can show to the facility manager.” Look online for size guides to get an idea of what a unit will hold. For example a 10-by-10-foot unit can generally store the contents of two bedrooms or a full living room.

The unit itself. Do your research and tour the facility advises real estate agent Ken Pozek who rented space for a year while waiting for his house to be built in Orlando. “You need to see the exact unit you intend to rent: what it looks like what it smells like does it live up to your standards” he says. Assuming there is more than one option in your area it can also pay to compare prices.

Access. Assess your schedule to determine how often you will need to access the unit — and when. Is the facility open 24/7 or does it have limited hours? A place that is open only 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. may not fit your schedule.

Climate control. A number of self-storage properties do not have air-conditioning or heating. If your location gets extremely hot cold humid or dry you should consider upgrading to a climate-controlled facility. By moderating temperature climate control can keep your items from growing mold rusting freezing or disintegrating. Some self-storage brands also offer specialty climate-controlled options for art electronics and wine.

Security. A facility should be equipped with 24-hour video surveillance door alarms. and keypad entry gates. Is there someone on-site most of the time or is the facility unprotected? Look for ample lighting and perimeter fencing. High-tech locations may use an app for opening gates and doors. Also check the type of locks used on units. The best is a cylinder lock that is fully embedded in the door so it can’t be cut.

Price. Self-storage pricing is location-specific and based on the number of available units the size whether it’s climate-controlled and whether it’s a drive-up facility. According to the Self-Storage Almanac in 2021 a 10-by-10-foot unit without climate control rented for $111.67 a month on average; a unit with climate control was $146.72. With few exceptions contracts are month to month. Although you may get an enticing introductory offer brace yourself for a rate increase every few months. Be sure to ask about the company’s rent-increase practices. To save a few bucks switch to a smaller unit once you start moving out items.

Insurance. Although the contents of your unit may be covered by your homeowners policy it’s a good idea to buy self-storage insurance. That way if anything happens to your belongings — a fire or burglary for example — you receive money to replace what’s damaged or lost. The easiest way to buy this insurance is to do so when you rent your unit because self-storage companies usually sell it as an add-on to your lease. Pricing can be as little as $9 a month for $2500 of coverage says James Appleton of MiniCo Insurance Agency one of the largest self-storage insurers. Because customer storage (sometimes called “tenant”) insurance is a temporary policy anyone can buy it regardless of credit score; there is usually no deductible; and losses aren’t reported to your regular insurance carrier so you don’t incur a rate increase.

Restrictions. For the most part self-storage companies prohibit food perishable goods nonworking vehicles and anything flammable or combustible such as car batteries propane tanks or gasoline. And said Morris: “You can’t store yourself. You can’t live in a unit or use it as a recreational facility.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2Jlc3QtY2l0aWVzLW9yZ2FuaXplZC1ob21lLTIwMjItMzcwMzg5NznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want An Organized Home?

“We were so excited to move to Memphis and start our life and future family here” Hannah said. “We love the New Orleans' influence on a lot of the food here and the live music is always great.”

Hannah continued “We were both pretty open-minded throughout the house-hunting process as we knew how competitive the market was currently. However I stood firm on wanting a large kitchen and a friendly neighborhood.”

Holden and Hannah connected with Pam Beall a real estate agent with Crye-Leike through referrals of some of her previous clients.

“We looked at around 20 properties in total” said Holden. “The market right now is very stressful and Pam was the best resource for navigating us through buying our first house. And when they started looking we just fell in love with the Germantown area.”

The couple found just what they were looking for in a traditional brick home built in 1984 located in The Oaks of Germantown. They paid $437000 for 3200 square feet of living space which included five bedrooms and three bathrooms. Additionally the open floor plan meant the kitchen was just steps away from the dining room the sunroom and the Great Room. The master bedroom is downstairs and there are three bedrooms plus a bonus room upstairs.

“Prior to this home we lived in an apartment with only about 600 square feet of living space so you can imagine how much extra space we now have” Hannah explained. ""The double vanity in the primary bathroom was a huge upgrade. The bathroom was renovated by the previous owners and featured custom cabinets and granite countertops. We knew we would have plenty of storage with walk-in closets. Also we loved the open floor plan something we found to be a very uncommon feature throughout older Germantown homes. The Great Room was cozy because it had a fireplace with gas logs. And I loved the kitchen because it had ample countertop space and Holden's favorite feature was the laundry chute. Also we had floor-to-ceiling windows that framed beautiful views of our wooded lot. We loved the mature trees. Additionally we knew we would enjoy the wooden deck and a fenced backyard. The overall feel is one of being secluded.”

“The house is beautiful and has been well maintained” said Holden. “The only thing we plan to change soon is some of the wall colors.”

As for their neighborhood the couple said they had found it to be a very family-friendly area and that they like that they live near a park.

“We're within walking distance to Howard McVay Park and have seen lots of people walking in our neighborhood — even in cold weather” Hannah said.

Tough on the outside and comfortable on the inside these vehicles can tackle just about anything nature has to throw at them. Case in point: the XPro One a monster-of-a-vehicle with a unique design that goes beyond looks.

The XPro One is Xpedition Pro's first-ever creation. And although it's the first such model designed by the Poland-based motorhome manufacturer the Xpedition Pro is a brand that grew out of 30 years of experience of the LAMAR Group having created several campers food trucks cross-country vehicles and truck bodies.Recently the company used the accumulated experience to make the XPro One an overland camper with a tough exterior inspired by military vehicles and fighter jets. It's based on the Iveco Daily 4X4 truck and customers can choose from three wheelbase options: 3400 3480 4175 mm (133.9 148.8 and 164.4 in).The container's width will be 2300 mm (90.5 in) and on the new chassis the total height will be 3520 mm (138.5). The angled rear has a 27-degree departure angle which is ideal for rugged terrain. In the front a 37-degree approach angle helps the vehicle tackle steep inclines. To that 37-inch off-road tires wrapped around 17-inch wheels ensure that the XPro One has enough traction and grip over uneven muddy or rocky terrain.Despite its apocalyptic design which has harsh lines and laser-cut details the inside promises to be ""surprisingly comfortable."" The company says that its goal was to merge two different worlds in one body. So it made a living space that's the opposite of what you see on the outside.Travelers can access the vehicle via a set of folding stairs. Right as they step inside they'll be welcomed by a small but functional living area with a kitchen and a bathroom. The kitchen will have a two-burner stove a sink generous countertops and a built-in 135-liter (35-gallon) refrigerator. There's also a table placed in the front of a U-shaped sofa.Next to the kitchen area there's the bathroom which was separated into two spaces: one includes a toilet and a sink and the other has the shower. The vehicle can accommodate up to three people in a spacious sleeping alcove positioned at the front. It also has a bed that can be converted to fit two adults and an extra room for storage.The XPro One is also suitable for off-grid living being able to sustain life for 10 days without the use of any external resources. That's because the RV comes with two water tanks (fresh and gray) capable of holding 200 liters (53 gallons) each. Moreover it can be outfitted with solar panels to allow travelers to enjoy the comfort of a home-away-from-home.To make its camper capable of withstanding the cold Xpedition Pro used a structure made of 54 mm (2.1 in) thick sandwich panels. To that an insulated lower floor along with the diesel heating system will make the inside a cozy comfortable space.Other features included on this off-road off-grid tiny house on wheels are tilt windows with roller shutters side and rear work lamps a pull-out gas grill and an awning that should come in handy during the hot summer days. A three-bolt lock is installed on each door for extra protection.The manufacturer hasn't listed a price for the XPro One yet. That's because the RV can be customized according to the customers' requirements. You have the option to equip the camper however you desire choose the base container or have a fully loaded motorhome. Those interested in placing an order can check the official site of Xpedition Pro for additional information.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL291dGRvb3Ita2l0Y2hlbi1pZGVhcy1pbnNwaXJhdGlvbnMtMjU3Njk10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,21 Outdoor Kitchen Ideas (With Photos of Inspiring Spaces),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/outdoor-kitchen-ideas-inspirations-257695 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL291dGRvb3Ita2l0Y2hlbi1pZGVhcy1pbnNwaXJhdGlvbnMtMjU3Njk10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Since refining operations began in 1903 the people of ExxonMobil have been part of this history working to deliver the products society needs while contributing to the local economic and social landscape.

Expand Each day ExxonMobil’s Beaumont Chemical Plant produces up to 5.6 million pounds of ethylene 7000 barrels of paraxylene and 800000 pounds of synthetic fluids.

As the industry looks to the future many challenges exist - from building the future workforce to addressing society's dual challenge of balancing growing energy demand while managing environmental impacts. Three ExxonMobil leaders all history-makers themselves are working to take on both these challenges locally in Beaumont to initiate positive change throughout the industry.

In 2020 Jennifer Dunphy made ExxonMobil history as the first woman to ever lead the Beaumont Chemical Plant (BMCP). Later that year the company named Rozena Dendy as Beaumont Refinery (BMRF) manager the first African American woman to hold the position. Together both made company history as the first two women to hold their leadership roles concurrently. In April 2021 the company named Ann Colwell as venture executive for the refinery's expansion project who became the first woman to lead a major expansion in Beaumont history.

""Despite what those outside our industry may say this is an exciting time to explore a career in energy"" Dunphy BMCP manager said. ""If you look back 100 years the entire world was a much different place and our industry has helped improve societal conditions and living standards globally. The people entering our industry today will help us prepare for the next 100 years.""

In her role as plant manager Dunphy oversees safe and reliable operations at the BMCP which produces building-block chemicals such as ethylene and propylene synthetic fluids and lubricant base-stocks as well as more than 25 different types of zeolite catalyst. Each day BMCP produces up to 5.6 million pounds of ethylene 7000 barrels of paraxylene and 800000 pounds of synthetic fluids. BMCP products are used to make plastics synthetic rubber Styrofoam products nylon and other components of consumer products.

Expand ExxonMobil’s Beaumont Light Atmospheric Distillation Expansion (BLADE) project will create a third crude unit within the refinery’s existing footprint increasing light crude refining capacity by more than 65 percent or 250000 barrels per day. Once fully operational the expansion will enhance the refinery’s position as a leader in the U.S.

""Modern life doesn't exist without carbon- based products so our industry has two key messages"" Dunphy said. ""First we maintain the highest standards of safety health and environmental care. Second because engineers by nature solve problems we need a strong diverse STEM workforce to help us address the need for low-carbon solutions.""

AFPM has recognized BMCP with 2019 and 2020 Safety Achievement Awards and the 2020 Elite Gold Safety Award a special recognition for sites that have attained top industry safety performance and demonstrated excellence in program innovation and leadership over time. AFPM also recognized the BMRF with 2019 and 2020 Safety Achievement Awards for outstanding performance.

Both BMRF and BMCP are two parts of ExxonMobil's integrated petrochemical complex in Southeast Texas. BMRF processes 366000 barrels of crude per day and produces 2.8 billion gallons of gasoline annually. Refinery distillation and conversion units process the crude into finished products such as gasoline diesel or jet fuel or transfer it for further processing at the BMCP to produce base-stocks for future destinations including ExxonMobil's Beaumont Polyethylene Plant and Blending and Packaging (Lubricants) Plant.

""Our Beaumont Complex shares utility systems infrastructure and integrated logistics between our four sites"" Dendy said. ""These shared management systems and practices improve our cost competitiveness and strengthen our ability to effectively serve our customers.""

In her current role Dendy oversees safe reliable operations and environmental performance improvements made possible through over $1 billion invested in multiple projects and technologies to reduce emissions over the past 16 years. These projects include the 2005 installations of a wet gas scrubber to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions and three cogeneration units to more efficiently generate power while reducing nitrogen oxide emissions.

""Access to reliable affordable energy has completely transformed how people live today and in the coming decades even more people will need access to the transformative power of energy"" Dendy said. ""I firmly and optimistically believe in the ingenuity of our team in helping to satisfy this growing demand for our community and broader societal needs.""

Jennifer Dunphy Rozena Dendy Ann Colwell

To nurture future ingenuity both Dendy and Dunphy are committed to advancing professional development activities that empower women and those from other underrepresented groups to pursue careers in STEM. Outside their roles both Dendy and Dunphy support STEM programs at Lamar University Lamar Institute of Technology and ExxonMobil's annual ""Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day"" collaboration with Beaumont Independent School District.

Joining Dendy and Dunphy Colwell also stands at a significant position to both address growing energy demand and support future engineers. In her role as venture executive for ExxonMobil's Beaumont Light Atmospheric Distillation Expansion (BLADE) project Colwell oversees the project's goal of creating a third crude unit within the refinery's existing footprint increasing light crude refining capacity by more than 65 percent or 250000 barrels per day. Once fully operational the expansion will enhance the refinery's position as a leader in the U.S.

Expand ExxonMobil’s Beaumont Refinery processes 366000 barrels of crude per day and produces 2.8 billion gallons of gasoline annually.

""The ongoing success of our BLADE project brings to life many of the reasons for optimism for the future of our industry"" Colwell said. ""With this project we see the incredible attention to detail of engineers for transporting equipment the cutting-edge abilities of advanced technology for valuable insight and exceptional value driven by a workplace culture based on respect and inclusion.""

Since construction activities began in 2019 BLADE has transported more than 25000 metric tons for the project and achieved a world-class safety culture. The project's safety performance has gained recognition within the company including ExxonMobil's Global Projects President's Safety Security Health and Environment (SSHE) Award for 2019 and 2020.

To help inspire future engineers Colwell joined a special panel on resiliency as part of the Society of Women Engineers' 2021 annual conference. Colwell shared about leveraging her past experiences and challenges to help achieve progress in a virtual environment tied to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Before her current role Colwell served as venture executive for another chemical and refining integration project in Singapore - a position she continued to manage throughout the first year of the pandemic.

""I'll always be a student and committed to learning and that's a winning approach for future engineers"" Colwell said. ""In school we learn the principles of the work and then it takes dedication teamwork and resiliency to apply these principles to create future solutions for our entire industry.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8va2V5dC5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L2V4eG9ubW9iaWxzLW9pbC10cnVja2luZy1wcm9wb3NhbC1leHBlY3RzLWZpbmFsLWRlY2lzaW9uLW5leHQtd2Vlay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ExxonMobil's Oil Trucking Proposal expects final decision this week,"SANTA BARBARA COUNTY Calif. – A final decision is expected this week on ExxonMobil's Oil Trucking Proposal and there will likely be a strong public turnout.

Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors will hear arguments from both sides of the controversial project on Tuesday at the Joseph Centeno Betteravia Government Administration Building in Santa Maria.

The oil giant is seeking permission to restart three offshore platforms: Harmony Heritage and Hondo.

All three shut down in 2015 following the devastating Plains Pipeline oil spill off the Gaviota Coast.

Local environmentalists say the timing is critical. Restarting those platforms would ""exacerbate the current climate crisis"" and put the coastline and marine wildlife at risk.

They say trucking is the most dangerous form of transporting crude oil.

""If this project is approved ExxonMobil would be able to truck up to 70 trucks per day carrying 460000 gallons of oil along our Coastline and along incredibly dangerous inland highways"" said Maggie Hall Senior Attorney with Environmental Defense Center (EDC). ""And this could last for up to seven years.""

Hall said there is no benefit at this point to getting the last bits of oil out of those three aging platforms.

She also said that over the past two decades California has logged 87 tanker truck accidents involving transporting crude; 14 of those accidents happened in Santa Barbara County.

Hall also said that the Russia and Ukraine crisis does not impact the local oil project as “it amounts to such a small fraction of California's oil production.”

ExxonMobil Operations Media Manager Julie L. King responded to News Channel 3-12 with the following statement:

ExxonMobil is committed to trucking safely and will operate in a manner that is protective of the environment. Our trucking routes must be approved by the county and we must follow more than 100 laws rules regulations and policies at county state and federal levels governing our operation which are among the strictest in the world.

Approval of our temporary trucking permit will allow us to resume safe environmentally responsible operations that will bring a number of benefits to Santa Barbara including local jobs and millions in vital tax revenues for county schools public safety and healthcare services.

Tuesday's March 8 Board of Supervisors meeting starts at 9 a.m.

My two immediately preceding columns have been dedicated to exploring for reader’s benefit the thesis advanced by Envision Research which argues that ExxonMobil an iconic Global 500 corporation can successfully turnaround its fortunes away from its heavy indebtedness and ongoing zombification – if it could arrive at a financial position where it is able to generate sufficient revenues to be able to invest in its own self-driven or organic growth. As has been revealed in previous columns that circumstance is established through determining whether ExxonMobil’s rate of return on capital employed ROCE and the company’s reinvestment rate RR. Therefore:

Long-term Growth Rate = ROCE* RR

ExxonMobil’s financial data for the period Q2 2021 to Q4 2021 [the most recently available] suggest something like a turnaround might be in the making as was indeed hinted at in last week’s column.

Unfortunately the elapsed time so far this year < 3 months is much too limited for making confident forecasts. Surveys of stock research and rating analysts however reveal a strong consensus in favour of hold for ExxonMobil stock; in preference to any other option for example to buy strongly buy sell or strongly sell. [See Wall Street Journal and New York Times] Indeed CNN Business also reports that a survey of 31 investment analysts [February 16 2022] recommended “hold” for ExxonMobil stock. This rating remains unchanged since the corporation’s Q4 report released on February 1 2022.

CNN Business further reports that 25 analysts offering 12-month forecasts of Exxon Mobil stock have revealed the following:

Median value = US$81.00

High value = US$105.00

Low value = US$62. 00

Stock price forecasting over a 12-month period is extraordinarily hazardous; due to market [demand: income energy preference – mix as well as supply: cost discoveries] and non-market [geopolitical national conflicts and war] uncertainty and risks. Such uncertainty and risks grow exponentially when dealing with 1] the oil and gas sector and 2] when forecasting for long time periods. Considering this caution I cite here a forecast by Coinbase of ExxonMobil stock price [US$] for the years 2022 to 2033. Schedule 1 reveals that: 1) the 2022 projected stock price [106.58] doubles by 2025; and 2) further grows by about 80 percent to 2033!

Coinbase: XOM Stock Price Forecast 2022- 2025 -2033

Takeaways Q4 2021 Results

For any of the gains in ExxonMobil’s stock prices as projected above to be realized over the near-term to the long-term several of the key takeaways based on the corporation’s Q4 2021 results will have to be substantively realized. Among these are firstly the headlined company achievements of attaining US$23 billion in earnings for 2021 [with the Q4 share at just under US$9 billion] together with capital and exploration spending of US$17 billion in 2021 [with the Q4 share of this at around US$6 billion; alongside a big push objective by ExxonMobil to reduce its indebtedness [through a share repurchase of US$10 billion]. These are required in order to assure anything resembling a return of shareholders’ confidence.

Secondly the firm hopes the above will be further reinforced through significantly increased cash flows generated from its operating activities of about US$48 billion. This is indeed the highest level in the last ten years [2012]. Alongside this ExxonMobil has signaled it needs to zero in on reducing structural costs in the immediate term through spending of around US$2 billion. These measures are designed to improve the firm’s balance sheet to the pre-Covid 19 pandemic level; and will be supplemented with paying down US$20 billion in debt.

Thirdly ExxonMobil has been justifiably quite brutally chastised in the social and mainstream media as representing possibly the worst and ugliest of ‘big oil global robber barons” when that grouping of firms constituted the dominant players in the world’s oil and gas [energy] market whether considered separately or taken collectively as the infamous big oil grouping of oil multinationals.

While nowhere as commanding today the decades-long legacies of that big oil ignominy continues to haunt ExxonMobil going forward and the detrimental roles ExxonMobil has played in global struggles to constrain the exponentially rising negative impacts of man-made global warming perhaps best illustrates this negativism. I’ll discuss these issues in coming columns where I propose to treat with ExxonMobil as a zombie plus corporation. Not surprisingly I hope at that stage to deal with ExxonMobil’s Q4 2021 Report and its declared targets for carbon emissions carbon capture green energy bio-fuels and renewables more broadly.

Finally in the same ExxonMobil Q4 2021 Report referenced above its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has stressed the company’s strong focus on a new streamlined business structure aimed at maintaining shareholder value and preservation of the competitive advantages of the firm. In this regard he claimed: “our effective pandemic response focused investments during the down cycle and structured cost savings positioned us to realize the full benefits of the market recovery in 2021.”

Conclusion

I believe the above presentation supports the view that ExxonMobil may well be on the cusp of a possible turnaround. Next week I shall delve into the contentious issue as to whether Guyana’s emerging petroleum sector is a major contributor to this outcome.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8wNC9vcGluaW9ucy9wdXRpbnMtd2FyLXVrcmFpbmUta3JlbWxpbi1wb3dlci1sb25kb24vaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDMvMDQvb3BpbmlvbnMvcHV0aW5zLXdhci11a3JhaW5lLWtyZW1saW4tcG93ZXItbG9uZG9u?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Putin the emperor with no clothes,"Editor’s Note: Douglas London is the author of “The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence.” He teaches intelligence studies at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service and is a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute.

CNN —

Has Vladimir Putin gone mad? How else could the Russian President have so recklessly placed the world on the precipice of the unthinkable with what outside the Kremlin is seen as an unjustified and unwinnable war in Ukraine?

Douglas London London family

Yes unwinnable in that even should Russian troops replace Ukraine’s democratic government at bayonet point with a Russian puppet and occupy the country the Kremlin faces a bloody insurgency and crushing economic consequences.

Putin might yet realize his greatest fear of a grassroots movement that deposes him – and it could come from what he has set in motion with his own hand. But as a longtime watcher of Russia I doubt Putin has lost his mind but rather is so ill informed as to be basing his calculus on intelligence that bears little resemblance to reality.

The caution voiced by many including Gabriel Garcia Marquez that “it is easier to start a war than to end it” should not have been lost on Putin.

He is a student of history warped as his understanding of the past might be. If it is Putin’s perception of Russia’s humiliations that is driving him to rewrite history that motivation might actually be less compelled by ego and more by his practical concern about the existential threat he believes will destroy him if left unchecked.

Putin’s intentions

Putin could not sustain power nor his allegedly ill-gotten riches in a genuinely democratic Russian state. Well in advance of temporarily leaving the presidency in 2008 turning over the post to de facto caretaker and titular head Dmitry Medvedev the Russian leader made his intentions clear.

In 2005 Putin declared in his annual state of the union address to parliament that the collapse of the Soviet empire “was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century” and was an “epidemic” fostering separatist movements that had “spilled over to Russia itself.”

His December 2021 comments on historical Russia’s demise were the natural follow-up to his March 2018 statement to reporters that he would reverse the Soviet Union’s collapse if he could.

Putin formerly of the KGB is a trained intelligence officer. He is obsessed with control. An intelligence officer strives to establish power over everyone and everything including the narratives by which they are perceived so as to control the ensuing actions of others.

There is much theater to this trade as reflected in Putin’s fiery speeches and the public portrayal of his virility the absolute subordination of Russia’s most senior officials and the country’s feeding a mystique of overwhelming military power.

Putin’s theatrical direction of placing Russian nuclear forces on alert was aimed at domestic audiences – his and those in the West. It was choreographed to provoke a reciprocal response and support his narrative.

Russia he contends is the victim of an aggressor’s attack and striking first and strongest is an act of preemption and self-defense. If it was designed to push back against a credible US military threat he need not have made the order public.

Were Russian forces put on such alert US intelligence agencies would have immediately detected indications. When the US placed its own nuclear forces on alert in response to Russian military actions during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war the Nixon White House made no public announcement. But the US did deliberately relay orders across its military and security structure in the open so that Russia’s leadership would quickly get the message.

Putin’s is an activist philosophy that seeks to leave nothing to chance and seizes the initiative so as to force his foes to react to circumstances he aims to dictate. But all of that depends on good intelligence. You build a house of cards when a plan is constructed without awareness of its potential flaws and vulnerabilities.

Not what he expected

While it’s too early to judge how things will turn out in the end in Ukraine there’s little debate that Putin’s war has not gone the way he may have expected or as well as he would have liked.

No one can read Putin’s mind but the narrow prism we’re allowed paints the picture of a leader who has created a royal court of sycophants unwilling to provide news he does not want to entertain. He has filled the country’s key posts with siloviki powerful politicians with backgrounds in Russia’s intelligence services largely the former KGB.

But there’s no honor among thieves or in this case the former spies whom Putin relies on owing to confidence in his ability to manipulate and control them. They are indulged to plunder the country’s resources and swell their wallets with incentives to secure loyalty rather than intrinsic trust.

Putin’s recent and possibly staged national security council meeting likely scripted taped and perhaps edited as it was offered a revealing glimpse. And bureaucracies which Putin’s intelligence security and defense agencies ultimately are reflect the direction and example of their own leaders.

Seemingly paranoid over his own security it’s evident Putin’s self-isolation and mercurial manner has fostered a degree of self-censorship and spin across those on whom he depends to provide an accurate depiction of the world outside.

In this atmosphere how transparent would Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Army Staff Valery Gerasimov be concerning the armed forces’ combat and logistical capabilities? If the Russian losses are even a fraction of that being depicted in the media it would still be on a pace severalfold of that the US incurred over 20 years in Afghanistan Iraq and Syria.

Little is heard publicly from Russian Main Intelligence Directorate Chief (GRU) Admiral Igor Olegovich Kostyukov. A noted hardliner who ostensibly shares Putin’s vision and whose organization specifically Unit 29155 has been linked to assassinations sabotage and support to insurgencies overseas he might be heard from even less.

If Russia’s strategy in the first days of the war reflected GRU assessments suggesting the Russian army would sweep across Ukraine with little resistance from an indifferent if not sympathetic pro-Russia population Kostyukov’s star could be on the decline.

Having watched the Director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Sergey Naryshkin and his Federal Security Service (FSB) counterpart Alexander Bortnikov cower and fumble in Putin’s presence on television I think it’s unlikely they would have cautioned him over the Ukrainian resolve to fight and the potentially crushing economic response of the world’s most powerful liberal democracies.

Watching Putin

As the world breathlessly watches Putin’s actions are undermining assumptions that long defined great power competition. “Mutual Assured Destruction” for example might no longer offer the reliable guardrail once thought.

Putin publicly endorsed a revised Russian nuclear deterrent policy that allows him to use atomic weapons in response to a conventional strike targeting the nation’s critical government and military infrastructure. And Belarus just announced a referendum changing its law to allow the country to host nuclear weapons a probable precursor to Putin’s deployment of mobile intermediate range nuclear missiles closer to NATO borders.

Notwithstanding my possible bias as a 34-year CIA Clandestine Service veteran who long pursued the Russian target better insight into Putin’s aspirations intentions and the intelligence upon which he is making decisions will depend more on people than on our vaunted technological prowess.

High resolution spy satellites enable us to count the Russian troops see their formations and assess their weaponry. And listening posts monitor the volume of communication and perhaps even some of its content.

But technology cannot answer the most important questions for Ukraine. What is Vladimir Putin thinking? His intent? His endgame? And how can we help the public discern truth from disinformation on the ground?

Some of what insight the US and its allies had into the Kremlin’s thinking reportedly was lost when a CIA agent with access to Putin was endangered by a leak five years ago. The compromise was former President Donald Trump’s who discussed classified information in a May 2017 Oval office meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.

Addressing such gaps CIA Director William Burns declared his commitment to realign the agency from counterterrorism to traditional intelligence collection against strategic adversaries. His stated priorities have been China technology Russia and strengthening the agency’s workforce.

The CIA has its work cut out for it in overcoming the last 20 years of underinvestment in traditional foreign espionage in a much tougher environment than James Bond ever faced and nurturing well-placed agents takes time. Despite former President Trump’s personal sentiments though I expect the CIA never really stopped working Russia.

Russia’s initial relative restraint in guarding against civilian casualties was certainly predicated on the complications Putin hoped to avoid in ruling Ukraine and suppressing an insurgency after seizing the capital and replacing its government. But he will likely grow desperate to reestablish control and achieve military victory.

Justifiably concerned at how the prolonged conflagration and resulting Russian casualties will play at home Putin could increasingly apply the brutal tactics seen in the Syria war by levelling urban centers and wielding thermobaric weapons and cluster munitions in indiscriminate targeting.

Countering Putin and his siloviki requires understanding them with intelligence from insiders and resistance to an emotional component that suggests recklessness on the Russian leader’s part.

It’s brutal illogical to us and therefore unpredictable. But US intelligence succeeded in anticipating his move on Ukraine not by judging Putin irrational but rather by examining his calculus ill-informed as it has been and the circle of advisers incapable as they seem to be on which he is relying to make his decisions.

Putin is likely to continue to escalate his war in Ukraine fearing most of all that he could lose control of Russia.

At the Mar-a-Lago-hosted “Fox News Ukrainian Invasion Celebration” Kate McKinnon played Laura Ingraham smirking in a viper-red sheath alongside Alex Moffat giving blisteringly good Tucker Carlson. Sure she may have called the embattled president of Ukraine “pathetic” and he wanted his viewers to consider that American liberals were an enemy more more dastardly than Putin. But they’d come together for a night of fundraising for the true victims of the war: the oligarchs. “We need to think about the babies” beseeched a dead-eyed McKinnon “their sugar babies. Who will pour vodka in their mouths?” Cecily Strong and Mikey Day as a shrill Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr. “the real Prince Harry and Meghan Markle” yelled a few bars of “Shallow.” James Austin Johnson—let this man graduate from his audition tape!—gave a lounge-y rendition of “My Funny Valentine” in honor of his genius buddy Putin. One song would have sufficed but this week’s target was a solid hit.

Host Oscar Isaac was perfectly lovely company for the evening. His monologue was his high point. “I’m half-Guatemalan half-Cuban” he said proudly. “Casting directors call that ethnically ambiguous. According to them I can play anything from a pharaoh to Timothée Chalamet’s daddy.” He was a boy from Miami who just wanted to be in pictures. And this new Marvel star got his start on The Avenger a movie he made as a 10-year-old in his buddy Bruce’s backyard. The footage was excellent if not just for his incredibly time-specific bathing suit and the shot of his friend’s father cleaning out the pool in the background. Go 10-year-old weirdos! Make your movies and play both the hero and villain and lap up the fake blood and hold onto the Bruces in your life for as long as you can.

Speaking of weird “Eleven Meatballs” was a perfect stupid delight. Chris Redd wondered why his charming new girlfriend always wore a lime green satin ribbon around her neck. When she went to confess I waited for her head to lop off but instead her freed neck revealed a skin tag singing meatball with Isaac’s cute mug. And there was an Aidy Bryant meatball poking out from the top of her shirt. And a Bowen Yang meatball cyst munching on a block of cheese to the beat of all the other little meatballs’s ear worm of a song. “We are little meatball men made of little balls of human meat!” Even Charli XCX appeared as a sexy meatball pustule with pipes under Sherman’s armpit begging Redd not to give up on love.

Another highlight of the night was Chloe Fineman’s terrific riff on Inventing Anna. If she could finagle cutie pie Andrew Dismukes’ sandwich out of his mitts with some of that gumption then she would turn her marbled accent to an eleven. “Chips are broke-ass we need something more exclusive” she demanded of the page telling him to order in Nobu and put it on her Metro card. “Hey little boy Lorne said that’s my couch now” she told Kyle Mooney. “Lorne says I do Biden now” she told Johnson. (And I say why not?!) She chastised Isaac for looking “purr” or “paurv” or “pure” whatever she was still figuring out her Rs. The best gag of the bit was when she instructed Michael Che that she’d be taking over his Weekend Update post. The way he pulled up the handle of the roller bag he kept under the desk and bounced was chef’s kiss.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Simple tasks like needing fewer than three attempts to sink a putt from one yard away were suddenly impossible. Greenside chips were no less wayward usually long or short but rarely in between. The players one after another were left scratching their heads stomping their feet in anger or smiling sardonically.

One tour veteran Matt Jones simply flung his putter into a pond after one such vexing experience. That was on Saturday but it set the stage.

Special to The Commercial Appeal

Holden Aven and Hannah Dressen are getting married this month. They moved from Austin Texas to be closer to Holden's job. He is a pilot for FedEx. She is a logistics advisor for Dell.

“We were so excited to move to Memphis and start our life and future family here” Hannah said. “We love the New Orleans' influence on a lot of the food here and the live music is always great.”

Hannah continued “We were both pretty open-minded throughout the house-hunting process as we knew how competitive the market was currently. However I stood firm on wanting a large kitchen and a friendly neighborhood.”

Holden and Hannah connected with Pam Beall a real estate agent with Crye-Leike through referrals of some of her previous clients.

“We looked at around 20 properties in total” said Holden. “The market right now is very stressful and Pam was the best resource for navigating us through buying our first house. And when they started looking we just fell in love with the Germantown area.”

The couple found just what they were looking for in a traditional brick home built in 1984 located in The Oaks of Germantown. They paid $437000 for 3200 square feet of living space which included five bedrooms and three bathrooms. Additionally the open floor plan meant the kitchen was just steps away from the dining room the sunroom and the Great Room. The master bedroom is downstairs and there are three bedrooms plus a bonus room upstairs.

“Prior to this home we lived in an apartment with only about 600 square feet of living space so you can imagine how much extra space we now have” Hannah explained. ""The double vanity in the primary bathroom was a huge upgrade. The bathroom was renovated by the previous owners and featured custom cabinets and granite countertops. We knew we would have plenty of storage with walk-in closets. Also we loved the open floor plan something we found to be a very uncommon feature throughout older Germantown homes. The Great Room was cozy because it had a fireplace with gas logs. And I loved the kitchen because it had ample countertop space and Holden's favorite feature was the laundry chute. Also we had floor-to-ceiling windows that framed beautiful views of our wooded lot. We loved the mature trees. Additionally we knew we would enjoy the wooden deck and a fenced backyard. The overall feel is one of being secluded.”

“The house is beautiful and has been well maintained” said Holden. “The only thing we plan to change soon is some of the wall colors.”

As for their neighborhood the couple said they had found it to be a very family-friendly area and that they like that they live near a park.

“We're within walking distance to Howard McVay Park and have seen lots of people walking in our neighborhood — even in cold weather” Hannah said.

When it comes to formal entrepreneurship and the kind of investments that get investors into business schools as teachers Nigerians generally lag a bit. But no more! And that is due to the achievements of people like Aina.

Aina is one of Nigeria’s foremost tech entrepreneurs a category of individuals who are as committed to growth and expansion in the tech industry as they are to growing the Nigerian economy. However Aina’s contributions so far are peerless and reaching a level where he may be named one of the paragons responsible for bringing so much attention to the tech industry.

Aina’s pit-to-palace story is oddly common. He was an excellent student of Electronics Engineering Technology at Savannah State University. He concluded his programme in 2004 and basically handed over his degree certificate to his father. Afterwards he focused on his own thing.

As Aina preferred business to screws engines and electricity his exit from Savannah was almost immediately followed up with an MBA programme at Bowling Green State University. There Aina was a blazing sun brilliant enough to become the President of the MBA Students Association take over several other prestigious positions.

All of these—and more—polished Aina with enough experience to make his foray into the world of business starting with being a financial analyst at Fifth Third Bank in Ohio USA in 2005 and going on to raise funds for business he believed in.

Aina has long transcended these positions. Today his marks are noticeably visible in industries and sectors of national repute including capital technology media agriculture infrastructure publishing and real estate.

Indeed Aina is a patron saint of determining success and accomplishments. His is a path worth emulating.",,,,,,,,,

First Solar’s sales for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $0.9 billion an increase of $0.3 billion from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily a result of international project sales and increased module sales in the fourth quarter.

First Solar CEO Mark Widmar believes that the company’s financial performance during the last 12 months was impressive as the solar PV manufacturing industry faced supply chain logistics cost and pandemic-related challenges.

The company reported fourth quarter net income per diluted share of $1.23 and full year net income per diluted share of $4.38.

“This year will revolve around continued significant investment in R&D new products manufacturing expansion and employing new contracting strategies all of which we believe set the stage for sustained growth in 2023 and beyond” Mark Widmar said.

PHOTO: Supplied by the University of Victoria

In April 2011  the Rainbow Pipeline in northwest Alberta ruptured leaking 28000 barrels of oil into the forest and muskeg.

It was the largest spill in Alberta in more than three decades and located just 30 kilometres outside of the Lubicon Cree community of Little Buffalo.

Melina Laboucan-Massimo says the spill contaminated the air leaving her family and community “feeling extremely sick and …very nauseous.”

The school closed for more than a week as a precaution and people were not able to hunt and gather on their traditional lands.

After witnessing the detrimental impact the oil spill had on her home community Laboucan-Massimo knew she had to do something. The land within the community of Little Buffalo had always been dependent on oil and gas. But she and a team of changemakers wrote history in the summer of 2015 turning toward solar energy.

“Indigenous communities have always borne the brunt of environmental degradation climate change and it’s because our communities are more remote.” Melina Laboucan-Massimo

That year 80 solar panels were hoisted up on pillars and pointed toward the sun. As the light glistened off the blue and silver bricks in the sky Laboucan-Massimo cried “tears of joy for the first time.”

A paper on pipeline infrastructure and spills by Ranjan Datta and Margot A. Hurlbert reports more than half of Indigenous communities in Canada are at “high risk” of being heavily impacted by pipeline spills compared to the national average. In addition they write these spills cause a greater impact on those communities than non-Indigenous urban ones affecting “drinking water agriculture and traditional cultural practice with land.”

Laboucan-Massimo a Lubicon Cree and founder of Sacred Earth Solar experienced first hand the impact the oil industry has on isolated communities.

“Indigenous communities have always borne the brunt of environmental degradation climate change and it’s because our communities are more remote.”

Laboucan-Massimo is focused on openly opposing fossil fuel projects and protecting Indigneous homelands through solar energy installing solar panels in her home community of Little Buffalo. The 20.8 KW project is connected to the community’s health and wellness centre and powers the entire community.

She believes in “utilizing solar as a transition technology to help communities know that there’s other ways of producing energy.”

Many other Alberta Indigenous communities are participating in the transition to solar energy including Louis Bull Tribe Fort McKay First Nation and Beaver Lake Cree Nation according to Kuby Renewable Energy Ltd. an Edmonton-based installer of solar panels.

Multiple other nations that are currently developing their solar energy projects are Cold Lake First Nation and Montana First Nation. According to Kuby Renewable Energy Ltd. these communities are “drastically reducing their energy bills and carbon footprint.”

Solar energy is “decentralized” making it the most readily available source of sustainable energy easily accessible for individuals on every end of the scale said owner and CEO Jake Kubiski.

After working in the oil and gas industry Kubiski had his eyes opened to sustainable energy. Wanting to make a change and have a positive impact on the environment he started his own renewable energy company.

“By producing clean solar energy you’re saving GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions” he said.

The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is vital because they are the cause of global temperature rising. By turning toward renewable energies such as solar which is so readily available the chances of saving the planet are heightened.

Angela Hocken band council member of Kwadacha First Nation and language teacher at Aatse Davie School in Fort Ware B.C. understands the significance of solar energy and the importance of teaching it.

The B.C. government granted the school nearly $500000 to fund a solar project to reduce fuel dependency. Hocken said students will monitor energy levels being produced and used by the school as well as how solar energy limits the amount of CO2 pollution.

“Having this solar power installed at school will allow the students to further their knowledge in energy efficiency” said Hocken.

Indigneous voices are essential to a healthy planet because sustainability is “embedded in our ways of living” said Hocken.

“Our ancestors took off the land and everything that was provided for them came off the land water [and] air.”

Hocken said educating the next generation will ultimately raise climate-literate people who can continue the good work that has begun.

Laboucan-Massimo understands that numerous Indigenous communities within Alberta depend on diesel and propane in their daily lives but she finds hope in solar energy.

She also feels a weight of responsibility to continue moving forward with climate justice.

“I think that’s a part of why we are facing climate change is because there’s such a lack of energy and climate literacy in our communities” said Laboucan-Massimo.

She believes in training the next generation in order to equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to fight the battle against climate change.

“The time has come for communities to reintegrate the wisdom of our ancestors by implementing renewable energy transition technologies” she said. “And inspire the world over to join us in our call to create a healthy planet which will sustain all generations to come.”

That is why cleaning them on a regular basis is essential to keep them working at full capacity. And this high-tech automated system from ART Robotics is great at doing just that deploying a drone and a robot to do the dirty work.

Photovoltaic arrays are usually installed in high places which is why climbing on the roof of your house armed with a sponge soap and water is not exactly a safe or fun way to spend your day.ART Robotics is based in Belgium and its field of expertise is right there in its name. Its Helios product is a system consisting of two components: a drone and a cleaning bot. While the former has the purpose of transporting the robot to the needed location the latter will autonomously clean the solar panels.The bot is lightweight small and comes with a clever traction system that allows it to easily move on the steep slopes from one panel to the other thoroughly cleaning them using a brush and vacuum combination.What ART Robotics is offering with its Helios is a solar panel cleaning service using the Helios system with the company’s employees being the operators of the device. Customers order the drone/robot online.So how does it all work? The cleaning robot is attached as the drone’s payload and the copter takes off in search of the solar array. It uses its computer vision to detect it and flies the bot to the exact location. Once it reaches it it deploys the robot and then returns to the launch site letting the bot do its thing.After the solar panels are all clean and shiny the bot signals the drone to come pick it up. It’s a fully automated process from start to finish but an operator would be at the location just in case human intervention is needed.The only bummer is that right now the cleaning service is only offered in Belgium. ART Robotics is now seeking funding for Helios on Kickstarter and for a pledge of at least €120 (around $132) Belgium-based customers can benefit from the company’s Home Pack at a discounted price. What that includes is a cleaning of up to 20 solar panels with the Helios system a service that ART Robotics estimates it will deliver in June 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3dlcmZ1bC10ZWxlc2NvcGVzLXRyYWluZWQtb24tcGFya2VyLXNvbGFyLXByb2Jlcy1sYXRlc3Qtc3dpbmctYXJvdW5kLXRoZS1zdW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Powerful Telescopes Trained on Parker Solar Probe's Latest Swing Around the Sun,"As NASA’s Parker Solar Probe completes its latest swing around the Sun it’s doing so in full view of dozens of other spacecraft and ground-based telescopes.

These powerful instruments can’t actually see Parker itself – the van-sized spacecraft is far too small for visible detection – but they offer from a distance what the probe is sensing close-up as it samples and analyzes the solar wind and magnetic fields from as close as 5.3 million miles (8.5 million kilometers) from the Sun’s surface.

Occurring at 10:36 a.m. EST (15:36 UTC) on February 25 this was the 11th close approach – or perihelion in the spacecraft’s orbit around the Sun – of 24 planned for Parker Solar Probe’s primary mission. Most of these passes occur while the Sun is between the spacecraft and Earth blocking any direct lines of sight from home. But every few orbits the dynamics work out to put the spacecraft in Earth’s view – and the Parker mission team seizes these opportunities to organize broad observation campaigns that not only include telescopes on Earth but several spacecraft as well.

More than 40 observatories around the globe including the recently commissioned Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii among other major installations in the southwestern United States Europe and Asia are training their visible infrared and radio telescopes on the Sun over the several weeks around the perihelion. About a dozen spacecraft including NASA’s STEREO Solar Dynamics Observatory TIMED and Magnetospheric Multiscale missions ESA’s and NASA’s Solar Orbiter ESA’s BepiColombo the JAXA-led Hinode and even NASA’s MAVEN at Mars are making simultaneous observations of activity stretching from the Sun to Earth and beyond.

The pass also marked the midway point in the mission’s 11th solar encounter which began February 20 and continues through March 2. The spacecraft checked in with mission operators at APL – where Parker Solar Probe was designed and built – on February 28 to report that it was healthy and operating as expected.

Most of the data from this encounter will stream back to Earth from March 30 through May 1 though the team will get a glimpse of some readings when the spacecraft sends a limited amount of data this week.

Solar Activity Picks Up

Parker Solar Probe is expected to dip back into the Sun’s outer atmosphere – the corona – continuing the solar wind and magnetic field readings it has taken since before it first “touched the Sun” last year.

Along with that data scientists eagerly anticipate a look at what Parker Solar Probe recorded from the large solar prominence on February 15 2022 that blasted tons of charged particles in the spacecraft’s direction. Project Scientist Nour Raouafi of the Space Exploration Sector said it was the largest event Parker Solar Probe has experienced during its first three-and-a-half years in flight.

“The shock from the event hit Parker Solar Probe head-on but the spacecraft was built to withstand activity just like this – to get data in the most extreme conditions” he said. “And with the Sun getting more and more active we can’t wait to see the data that Parker Solar Probe gathers as it gets closer and closer.”

Assisted by a pair of orbit-shaping Venus flybys in August 2023 and November 2024 Parker Solar Probe will eventually come within 4 million miles (6.2 million kilometers) of the solar surface in December 2024 at speeds topping 430000 miles per hour.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDYvb2lsLWFuZC1nYXMtcHJpY2VzLWFyZS1zdXJnaW5nLWhlcmVzLXdoYXQtdGhhdC1tZWFucy1mb3ItcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS1zdG9ja3MuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil and gas prices are surging — Here's what that means for renewable energy stocks,"Renewable energy stocks are outperforming as the rapid surge in oil and gas prices — prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine — makes the case for alternative energy sources more compelling. Oil shot above $100 per barrel for the first time in years the day Russia invaded Ukraine and has climbed sharply higher since. On Thursday Brent crude  the international oil benchmark hit $119.84 per barrel  while the U.S. benchmark topped $116. ""The move higher in global natural gas and power prices is potentially a longer-term catalyst for acceleration of development of renewable energy capacity globally across a variety of technologies including solar wind and green hydrogen"" said Ameet Thakkar energy transition and infrastructure analyst at BMO. ""These energy sources will be viewed as more price competitive in a higher for longer scenario for energy prices"" he added. In an otherwise weak month for stocks – the S & P 500 is down 3.8% while the Nasdaq Composite has shed 5.5% – some clean energy stocks are posting solid gains. The iShares Global Clean Energy fund is up about 6% while the Invesco Solar fund has added 7%. The fund is coming off a 9% gain in February which snapped three straight months of losses. Some of the top performers over the last month include Daqo New Energy  SolarEdge Technologies and Hannon Armstrong  which have all risen more than 20%. Within the renewable energy ecosystem nuclear-power related stocks have outperformed over the last month. The North Shore Global Uranium Mining fund and the Global X Uranium fund are both up more than 13%. The surge in oil and gas prices is hitting Europe especially hard given that the E.U. imports about one third of its natural gas from Russia. The country's war on Ukraine is forcing Europe to look elsewhere for fuel — including importing record amounts of U.S. liquified natural gas — as Europe rethinks its long-term energy strategy. ""Owing to their cost competitiveness as well as relatively quick deployment capability renewables could potentially see increased investment as an option to increase the region's energy security"" JPMorgan said in a Feb. 28 note to clients. With that in mind the firm scanned its coverage universe of U.S. clean energy stocks with the most exposure to Europe to see who stands to benefit most from an accelerated transition. Enviva tops the list with 96% of its revenue exposed to the region according to the firm's estimates. Next are SolarEdge and Canadian Solar at 45% and 35% respectively. TPI Composites and Itron round out the top five at 30% and 27%. The firm said that SolarEdge and Enphase could be the biggest winners due to their ""demonstrated ability to rapidly scale manufacturing capacity (outsourced) could lead to relative outperformance."" Enphase's exposure to Europe is around 15% based on JPMorgan's estimates. Fossil fuel prices are not the only thing that impacts renewable energy buildout. After all crude prices have been climbing since U.S. oil plunged into negative territory in April 2020 for the first time on record. In 2020 the Invesco solar fund surged 233% but then posted a 25% decline in 2021 and is in the red for 2022 too. The group is also highly sensitive to interest rates. And as a speculative area of the market the group will also face pressure if investors flee growth-oriented areas – and the promise of future profits – in favor of safe-haven assets and value stocks. Still Guggenheim said that hydrocarbon pricing is an important factor. ""Absent any additional shocks high fossil fuel prices are likely to drive additional outperformance in decarbonization stocks from current levels"" the firm said in a Feb. 28 note to clients. The firm looked at a number of variables including interest rates in relation to clean energy stocks' performance finding that fossil fuel pricing was the ""one that explained decarbonization stock movements most effectively."" But the sector is also suffering from headwinds playing out broadly in the economy including supply chain bottlenecks and rising raw material costs. First Solar recently reported a mixed quarter and issued disappointing guidance as factors including a surge in freight costs eat into the company's profits. On the raw materials front polysilicon prices are up 300% according to Rystad Energy. Silver copper aluminum and glass prices are also jumping. The firm said this poses an elevated risk for utility scale solar and wind projects and forecasts that some projects projected to break ground in the first half of 2022 are in danger of becoming stalled. There are others who say that the jump in oil and gas prices which is contributing to inflationary fears across the country mean the U.S. and others should ramp up hydrocarbon production. Oil and gas rigs can come online faster than renewable alternatives and are also a baseload source of power. Wind and solar on the other hand are intermittent since they cannot just be ramped up at will. Batteries powerful enough to store energy for weeks and months have not yet reached commercial production. But as Europe especially re-thinks its energy policy shifting away from dependency on Russia will include accelerating the pace of renewables' buildout. ""Renewable electricity also affords countries with large deployment of projects greater energy independence"" said Matt Breidert senior portfolio manager at Ecofin. ""In general the more expensive fossil fuels become the greater the arbitrage of relative cost to cheaper renewable electricity. …We would expect the current energy cycle becomes parasitic to demand eventually"" he added. - CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

Mumbai-based UPL valued at around ₹55000 crore is one of the largest agrochemicals companies in the world. The company produces industrial chemicals chemical intermediates and speciality chemicals and offers crop protection solutions.

View Full Image UPL in merger talks with 2 American cos

The promoters of UPL are considering several options but leaning towards a merger because it may fetch much better value for their 28.24% stake and public shareholders one of the two people cited above said seeking anonymity.

“A merger at this stage is likely to fetch at least a 15% premium to UPL’s current worth which translates to around $8.9 billion or ₹63000 crore—the largest deal in the agrochemicals space in Asia if formalized"" said the first person.

A spokesperson for UPL denied talks of a potential merger with FMC Corp. or CF Industries.

UPL has hired investment bank Evercore Group LLC to advise the promoters on the best option and whether a merger deal would benefit members of the promoter family and public shareholders.

Goldman Sachs too has been hired by one of the two American firms to explore a merger or takeover in India. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment.

UPL is currently overseen by octogenarian chairman and founder Rajnikant Devidas Shroff. He started the business as a manufacturer of mercury salts at a British plant. The chairman’s elder son Jai is the CEO of UPL while his younger brother Vikram serves as a member on the company’s board.

The two American firms are keen on expanding their footprint and all the three companies are laying stress on ESG (environmental social and corporate governance) clean energy and sustainability-oriented business processes the two people said.

CF Industries Holdings is a leading manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen products.

Responding to an email from Mint Chris Close a US-based spokesperson at CF Industries said “CF Industries does not comment on market speculation.""

Philadelphia-based FMC Corp. is a global agricultural sciences firm that helps growers produce food fibre and fuel apart from providing crop protection solutions.

Replying to an email on a potential deal with UPL FMC spokesperson Lars Weborg said “FMC does not comment on industry rumours or speculation.""

If the merger plan goes through “the shortlisted entity (CF Industries or FMC) may own a majority stake in the merged entity while the Shroff family may hold a minority stake. Since a large number of shares are held by public shareholders UPL promoters may look for buyback of shares from the market to make any potential merger process easier"" said the first person.

The board of UPL on Thursday approved a buyback proposal. On Friday while the benchmark Sensex closed down by 1.4% UPL’s stock was only marginally down by 0.17% to ₹713.5. The stock has gained about 3% since the buyback was announced.

An email to Evercore Group remained unanswered.

UPL offers a range of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals including herbicides insecticides and seed treatments. It also sells other products used to stimulate plant growth store crops conserve water and a line of disease-resistant seed varieties.

In 2018 UPL acquired Arysta LifeScience Inc. for $4.2 billion in a deal that transformed the company into one of the world’s largest generic agrochemicals firms.

In the biggest deal it has done in a long time Ford Motor Co. decided to split its electric-vehicle business from its traditional auto business last week – but notably not spin off the EV business in pursuit of the white-hot stock valuations that have followed EV leader Tesla and intermittently fast followers like Rivian and Lucid Group  whose stock prices have suffered recently. The company met Wall Street halfway in its restructuring plan which is still significant and analysts were roundly positive on the decision. DataTrek co-founder Nick Colas a former Wall Street autos banker who has been saying for a while that the auto companies will need to convince the street that these spinoffs shouldn't be done sooner rather than later called Ford's move ""an interesting reorganization."" ""Auto companies don't often shuffle their reporting/org charts in such a dramatic manner and such moves are always risky in terms of productivity. Still it does allow for clearer management accountability and that's always good in the long run"" he said. The message from Ford management is that the EV business despite solid sales of the well-received Mustang Mach-E isn't ready for prime time. Ford chose the safer course of keeping its promising emerging business tied to the profitable mother ship for longer. That lets the EV unit to be dubbed Ford Model e and other tech efforts invest up to $50 billion mostly out of the cash flow from the existing Ford to be called Ford Blue. That cash flow was $40 billion over the last two years meaning Model e won't have to turn to bond or stock markets to fund expansion. At the same time Ford may be able to undo part of the significant discount its shares trade at compared to the EV pure plays. The compromise Ford chose was to keep its businesses aligned but report their results separately beginning next year so Wall Street can begin to assess the EV business' growth and value it independently.

Ford's spin

Will it work? For now the answer is likely yes. ""We like the move and think it was driven by frustration"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said. ""Ford's [price-to-earnings ratio] stock trades in the high single digits a fraction of Tesla's [dropping this year] even though they became the number two seller of EVs and will grow much faster when the F-150 Lightning pickup ships in a few months."" Ford executives emphasized both operational and financial advantages that keeping the companies joined may give. Farley dwelled on the combined company's ability to finance its growth strategy without accessing capital markets while aides explained in a press briefing the details of plans to share costs between the EV and gasoline-powered vehicle businesses cut costs in the traditional unit and get both sides of the business to work together to boost profitability faster than they likely could on their own. ""If we spin this out we really risk that leverage"" Farley said. ""It doesn't make sense. The leverage is the key point and we have the capital.""

watch now

The centerpiece of the plan is to cut up to $3 billion in annual costs by 2026 with major targets including Ford's advertising budget – estimated at $1.8 billion in 2020 by Statista for just U.S. spending – and $4 billion a year cost of warranties which Ford Blue President Kumar Galhotra said will be addressed by improving the quality of Ford vehicles. Nelson said the company is likely to look outside the U.S. for many of the cost cuts too pointing to money-losing operations in Europe and parts of Asia. Fresh growth is likely to be spurred by the arrival of new EVs especially the F-150 Lightning for which Ford has reported 250000 pre-orders and is working to increase production in advance of shipping this year. Ford has hit that target while still only offering the electric version of its market-leading pickup truck in one body style compared to different cabs with different levels of luxury in traditional gasoline-powered F-150s. The company said it expects to get a third of its auto sales from EVs by 2026 – about 2 million vehicles. It sold about 726000 F-150s in the U.S. last year. But there is still reason to suspect a true spinoff could occur sooner.

EV spinoff talk won't go away

All of this may still lead up to in fact better position Ford to do the rest of the deal and completely spin off its Ford E unit by about 2024 said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. The keys will be continuing to expand sales of the electric Mustang Mach-E which sold more than 27000 units in 2021 about half the number of gasoline-powered Mustangs and following through on the early promise of the electric F-150 and the electric E-Transit commercial vehicle for small businesses adding other models as the company grows. ""In 12 to 18 months given the success of the F-150 investors will want to see them raise capital and double down"" Ives said. ""When they start to report unit sales so you can see demand in the EV business we'll be able to value it. It's the first step to an eventual spinoff of the EV business"" Ives added.

The underlying issues Ford management is facing go beyond the auto sector. In the energy business where tradition carbon-intensive businesses are being threatened by renewable energy sources incumbents are under attack from activists to consider spinoffs. Shell has faced an activist campaign and its CEO countered that the investors fail to understand the importance of the current cash generation model to the renewable energy investments being made for the future. And the past year has shown it to be a peak moment in corporate restructuring of iconic companies including GE and Johnson & Johnson. Emilie Feldman professor of management at The Wharton School University of Pennsylvania who specializes in corporate restructuring and divestitures says Ford and other car companies who may follow its approach aren't issuing what is likely to be the final say on corporate structure culminating in a full separation. ""Today there is still value in Ford's traditional auto and EV businesses remaining integrated whether because of cash flow or other operational interdependence. At some point in the future though (perhaps once the EV technology develops further) the calculus will change."" The history of the market is replete with examples of where the value of separation eventually came to exceed the value of integration and then divestitures happened. ""Situations have played out many times across industries and time periods whether it is companies with old plus new tech businesses companies with mature plus more nascent businesses or companies with commodity plus end-product businesses"" Feldman said. ""I suspect the same will eventually happen for companies like Ford and GM in autos and Shell and other energy companies that have green vs. brown energy businesses."" Other automakers like General Motors and Volkswagen will be watching to see if they can make similar moves Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. But Jonas who doesn't recommend Ford stock argued that relying on the cash flow of the existing business is expensively priced capital invested in a high-risk EV business. And the comparisons between Ford and other automakers only goes so far according to Colas. The Ford family looking over the board's shoulder and focused on maintaining the Ford 'blue' icon through all eventualities — he noted it was the only of its peers to never go bankrupt — has a history of what he described as more ""thoughtful decisions about the next leg. They want it to survive for the next 100 years"" he said. ""Ford has made a lot of good decisions recently and this is one of them"" Ives said.

Light-duty vehicles including sedans SUVs and pickup trucks are currently responsible for 58% of US transportation sector emissions. Pickup trucks accounted for 14% of light-duty vehicle sales in the United States in 2020 and the market share of both pickups and SUVs has grown in recent years.

In an open-access paper in Environmental Research Letters they show that the proportional emissions benefit of electrification is approximately independent of vehicle class.

For sedans SUVs and pickup trucks they found that HEVs and BEVs have approximately 28% and 64% lower cradle-to-grave life-cycle emissions respectively than ICEVs in the base case model. This results in a lifetime BEV over ICEV GHG emissions benefit of approximately 45 tonnes CO 2 e for sedans 56 tonnes CO 2 e for SUVs and 74 tonnes CO 2 e for pickup trucks.

Though the percentage savings is approximately the same across vehicle classes on average replacing an internal-combustion-engine sedan with a battery-electric sedan saves 45 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent replacing an internal-combustion-engine SUV with a battery-electric SUV saves 56 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and replacing an internal-combustion-engine pickup with a battery-electric pickup saves 74 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent over the lifetime of the vehicles. —first author and Center for Sustainable Systems Research Specialist Max Woody

They also found that the benefits of electrification remain significant with increased battery size reduced BEV lifetime and across a variety of drive cycles and decarbonization scenarios.





Cumulative greenhouse gas emissions versus vehicle mileage for (a) internal combustion engine and battery electric sedans SUVs and pickup trucks and (b) hybrid electric and battery electric sedans SUVs and pickup trucks. The lower and higher limits of each range are results for base and premium models respectively. Woody et al.

… there is substantial variation in emissions based on where and when a vehicle is charged and operated due to the impact of ambient temperature on fuel economy and the spatiotemporal variability in grid carbon intensity across the United States. Regionally BEV pickup GHG emissions are 13%–118% of their ICEV counterparts and 14%–134% of their HEV counterparts across US counties. BEVs have lower GHG emissions than HEVs in 95%–96% of counties and lower GHG emissions than ICEVs in 98%–99% of counties. As consumers migrate from ICEVs and HEVs to BEVs accounting for these spatiotemporal factors and the wide range of available vehicle classes is an important consideration for electric vehicle deployment operation policymaking and planning. —Woody et al.

This is an important study to inform and encourage climate action. Our research clearly shows substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions that can be achieved from transitioning to electrified powertrains across all vehicle classes. This study expands upon previous studies that have focused on comparing battery-electric vehicle sedans to their internal-combustion-engine or hybrid counterparts. We report emissions for vehicle production use and end-of-life stages on a per-mile basis and over the total vehicle lifetime. In addition we analyzed the regional variation in emissions considering differences in electricity grid mixes and ambient temperatures and we also explored the effects of the rate of grid decarbonization on emission reduction. —Greg Keoleian a professor at the U-M School for Environment and Sustainability and director of the U-M Center for Sustainable Systems

Researchers looked at three different model year 2020 powertrain options—internal-combustion-engine vehicles hybrid-electric vehicles and battery-electric vehicles—for midsize sedans midsize SUVs and full-size pickup trucks accounting for differences in fuel economy annual mileage vehicle production and vehicle lifetime across vehicle classes.

The researchers found that switching an internal-combustion-engine vehicle to a battery-electric vehicle results in greater total tonnage of emissions reductions as the vehicle size increases due to the greater fuel consumption of larger vehicles.

The researchers also found that battery-electric vehicles have larger greenhouse gas emissions in their manufacturing than internal-combustion-engine vehicles due to battery production but this impact is offset by savings in their operation. For battery-electric vehicles and internal-combustion-engine vehicles the breakeven time is 1.2 to 1.3 years for sedans 1.4 to 1.6 years for SUVs and 1.3 years for pickup trucks based on the average US grid and vehicle miles traveled.

Vehicle emissions vary across the country as different temperatures and different drive cycles affect a vehicle’s fuel economy. For electric vehicles the emissions intensity of the local electricity grid is also an important factor. The study developed maps to show the lifetime grams of carbon dioxide equivalent/mile for each powertrain (internal-combustion-engine vehicles hybrid vehicles and battery-electric vehicles) and vehicle type (sedan SUV and pickup truck) by county across the United States.

Researchers found that concerns about battery-electric vehicles having higher emissions than internal-combustion-engine vehicles or hybrids are largely unfounded as battery-electric vehicles outperform hybrids in 95% to 96% of counties while battery-electric vehicles outperform internal-combustion-engine vehicles in 98% to 99% of counties even assuming only modest progress towards grid decarbonization.

Charging strategies can further reduce battery-electric vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. The study found that charging during the hours of the day with the lowest grid emissions intensity can reduce emissions by 11% on average.

This study was supported by Ford Motor Company through a Ford-University of Michigan Alliance Project Award.

Anointed big kahuna of European Motor Sports in 1983 this gentleman convinced Ford’s high-ranking execs to approve two homologation specials: the mid-engined RS200 and the front-engined Cossie we’ll cover in this story.

The Sierra was chosen as the starting point for the Ford Motor Company’s Group A touring car for two reasons. First and foremost the Dearborn-based automaker initially had trouble selling the rear-wheel-driven model. And secondly the aerodynamic design would pay dividends in Group A. Cosworth  the company that developed the DFV engine with Ford’s backing was contracted for the powerplant of the Cossie. The British engineering company had to modify the Sierra’s existing 2.0-liter mill for this application a job they accepted with one string attached. Specifically Cosworth told Ford they had to place an advance order for 15000 units of the new engine.Ford was initially terrified by this prospect because Group A regulations mandated 5000 cars produced within a year. But as you already know by now the Ford Motor Company accepted Cosworth’s offer because they were hungry for success. On that note let’s get a little bit more technical.Codenamed T88 the Pinto block that serves as the basis for the YBB in the legendary hot hatchback displaces 1993 cubic centimeters. One of the biggest changes brought by Cosworth is the alloy head which rocks two camshafts that operate 35-mm intake valves and 31-mm exhaust valves.Gifted with a 90.8-mm bore and a 76.95-mm stroke this powerplant is further gifted with Mahle pistons forged steel connecting rods a high-flow oil pump a cast aluminum sump a forged steel crankshaft and a less restrictive exhaust system. Another tremendous change over the 2.0-liter unit in the Sierra is the 0.7-bar turbocharger namely a Garrett AiResearch T03B.Weber Marelli engine management electronic fuel injection and a compression ratio of 8.0:1 also need to be mentioned. We also have to remember the YBB is the very first series-production car engine to surpass 100 horsepower per liter. More specifically Ford quoted 201 horsepower at 6000 revolutions per minute and 204 pound-feet (277 Nm) at 4500 rpm.Now imagine what kind of grunt a mid-engined V8 supercar from the Prancing Horse of Maranello was capable of in 1985 when the Sierra RS Cosworth was revealed in full at the Geneva Motor Show. To be frank the lyrical waxing in the automotive media of that era wasn’t just hyperbole.Given the output figures of this force-fed lump the Blue Oval decided on a five-speed transmission shared with the Mustang. The BorgWarner T5 was understandably beefed up for this application. Spruced up with a quicker steering rack than the Sierra the Cossie also boasts firmer dampers stiffer coil springs thick anti-roll bars anddeveloped in collaboration with ATE. Ventilated rotors with four-piston calipers are present up front while the rear wheels are fitted with solid brake rotors and single-piston brake calipers.Riding on 15- by 7.0-inch alloys mounted with Dunlop rubber shoes the Sierra RS Cosworth puts the power down to the rear wheels with the help of a limited-slip differential of the viscous-coupling variety. Constructed from steel and fiberglass this fellow features a very recognizable rear spoiler.Originally envisioned with a triple-decker layout  the rear spoiler was inspired by the Red Baron’s plane according to Frank Stephenson. The Moroccan-born American designer explains that Ford’s bean counters voted against it.Frank Stephenson states that “the finance guy’s argument was that if we got rid of the middle wing we would probably be saving about five Deutsche Marks on the design and bill of materials. And so that won over unfortunately. That always felt for me like a big loss in terms of design. It’s still considered one of the iconic designs of the ‘80s but for me it always felt like this was a child that had been born with nine fingers instead of ten.”Even with a two-wing layout the rear spoiler increased the vehicle’s drag coefficient to 0.345 thanks to more downforce over the rear axle. Offered in standard Diamond White the Cossie was available in Black or Moonstone Blue at extra cost. No fewer than 5042 examples of the Sierra RS Cosworth were produced through January 1987 of which 2616 were delivered in the United Kingdom. Never offered in the U.S. of A. the Sierra RS Cosworth was immediately followed by the limited-production Sierra RS500 Cosworth.500 cars were sent to engineering company Tickford of which 394 were finished in black. The engine in the RHD-only RS500 is codenamed YBD and cranks out 224 horsepower. The subsequent Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth takes its mojo from the original YBB whereas the Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth 4x4 was offered with two mills: the catted YBG and non-catted YBJ."

Home run Homa took aim at the 14th hole at Bay Hill and delivered a wonderful pass at the ball with his typical beautiful tempo.

The sound of the contact was clean. A little thump. The pin was tucked away on the front right of the green. Hard to get at.

It's an aggressive pin position but Homa proved up to the challenge. The ball landed took three bounces and rolled on in.

Cue elation. Cue celebration. Cue a little jive from Homa one of the best follows on social media.

For years Homa has been roasting peoples' swings on Twitter. Now when they come for him he'll have a bit more ammunition.

Homa constructed an opening round of 69 and followed it up with a 74 to make the cut at Arnie's place.

He was well out of contention but this will be a sweet bit of history to look back on. It came during the third round.

Homa 31 is a three-time winner on the PGA Tour. He won the 2021 Genesis Invitational and collected the trophy from his hero Tiger Woods.

He also won the Fortinet Championship last year and also the claimed the 2019 Wells Fargo Championship.

From over par to under par in one fell swoop. What a brilliant moment for Homa.

Congratulations on the ace and keep up the impressive dance moves and keep roasting swings on social media. The PIP will one day be yours.

Elsewhere on day three PGA Tour pro Matt Jones launched his putter into the lake.

Sometimes clubs just need to die. RIP Jones' putter. Gone too soon. You're with the angels now.

Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Tang Renjian said rare heavy rainfall last year delayed the planting of about one-third of the normal wheat supply leading to a roughly 20% shortage in crop yield.

The shortage coupled with the war between Russia and Ukraine which together produce roughly 29% of global wheat exports could see wheat prices surge past the already incredible 14-year high Reuters reported.

Haas also ended its sponsorship with Uralkali the Russian fertilizer company owned by Mazepin’s father. Dmitry Mazepin is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his son's contract to drive was linked to the team sponsorship.

""As with the rest of the Formula 1 community the team is shocked and saddened by the invasion of Ukraine and wishes for a swift and peaceful end to the conflict"" Haas said in a statement Saturday.

Formula One earlier this week terminated its contract with the Russian GP. The race in Sochi was contracted through 2025.

That put the spotlight on Haas an American team entering its seventh season of F1 competition. Haas last year overhauled its lineup and added rookies Mazepin and Mick Schumacher son of seven-time F1 champion Michael Schumacher.

Haas removed the Uralkali sponsorship markings from its cars last week following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but Mazepin's status remained uncertain. The FIA ruled Friday all drivers must agree to its principles of peace and neutrality and ""acknowledge the strong commitment made by the FIA to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""

Mazepin posted on Twitter he had agreed to the stipulations and was disappointed in Haas' decision.

""While I understand the difficulties the ruling from FIA plus my ongoing willingness to accept the conditions proposed in order to continue were completely ignored and no process was followed in this unilateral step"" Mazepin wrote.

""I have treasured my time in F1 and genuinely hope we can all be together again in better times.""

Haas did not announce a replacement for Mazepin who turned 23 earlier this week. He did not score a point last season and was derisively referred to as ""Mazespin"" for his propensity to bring out the caution flag.

It allows you to create posters add lots of pictorial magic to your presentations and even jazz up your social media posts. We are talking of Canva the App that is the go-to design tool for thousands of people ranging from students to business executives to performing artists. But there is much more to the app than just what meets the eye.

The story of Canva is a fascinating one and full of surprises. So here are seven amazing facts you might not know about these multiple award-winning apps:

Created because design software was a pain to use

Canva’s CEO Melanie Perkins who is also one of its founders got inspired to create it in 2006 when she discovered how difficult design software was to use while teaching design at Perth in University of Western Australia. Perkins would say that while people could just jump in and do stuff on Facebook (which was in its early days) it took years to learn how to use design software. We are not one bit surprised. We STILL find most design software a maze. Canva thankfully is an exception.

Knowledge of tech? Uh…

Melanie Perkins might have been teaching at a University but by all accounts her experience of professional tech marketing and business was…nil.

Started with yearbook design and in the living room

Before Canva Perkins started a company with her then-boyfriend Cliff Obrecht (they got married in 2021) called Fusion Books in 2008. This was a cloud-based online platform focused on Yearbook Design and was targeted at schools. Of course Perkins made sure it was easy to use. In best start-up tradition the company got underway in the living room of her mother’s house. The enterprise was so successful that Melanie decided to leave university and focus on it full time. Fusion Books is still around and doing rather well – it was the largest yearbook publisher in Australia at one stage.

Want investors? Go kite surfing…no really!

Perkins had a tough time getting investors for Canva. She claims to have pitched the idea to more than a hundred venture capitalists in 2010 none of whom showed any interest. However Hollywood stars Woody Harrelson and Owen Wilson loved her idea and invested in Canva. Interestingly Perkins would have never met Harrelson or Wilson if she had not impressed venture capitalist Bill Tai. She says she learnt kite surfing to impress Tai who would also invest in Canva. Today Canva’s investors include the likes of Franklin Templeton and Sequoia Capital Global Equities. Do not let anyone ever tell you that kite surfing is useless!

2013…and Canva appears!

It took Perkins three years to get investment for her idea. Canva came into existence in 2013 backed by USD 3 million. Its three founders were Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht and former Google executive Cameron Adams. Interestingly one of Perkins’ and Obrecht’s technical advisors was Lars Rasmussen a co-founder of Google Maps. It was he who introduced the couple to Cameron Adams.

Co-founder and sandwich maker

He is Perkins’ partner and the co-founder of FusionBooks and Canva but Cliff Obrecht was also part-time chef for the team. He is believed to have often made sandwiches for the team lunch.

Model billionaires

Both Perkins and Obrecht are billionaires and among the richest people in Australia. They however have vowed to donate most of their equity in Canva. The couple plans to do so through the Canva Foundation. They have also announced a program with GiveDirectly for the distribution of USD 10 million to the needy in South Africa. Perkins says that they realised the importance of giving when they visited India and met someone who worked incredibly hard but earned less than a dollar a day had no home and slept in a computer cafe. Obrecht says it is not their vibe to hoard money.",,,,,,,,,,,,

President Felix Tshisekedi stirred up a storm last year accusing his predecessors of having signed lopsided contracts with mining companies – most of them Chinese – and saying he wanted to renegotiate them.

That should make the Congolese happy. But reality says otherwise.

As much of the world electrifies its cars countries are relying ever more heavily on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Central African nation produces two-thirds of the global supply of cobalt – an essential component of electric vehicle batteries.

President Tshisekedi’s campaign has further received rare support from Congolese opposition politician Adolphe Muzito who said the DRC had not benefited much from mining deals signed with Chinese companies.

Muzito served as the DRC’s prime minister under president Joseph Kabila’s administration between 2008 and 2012 and it was during this time that the country awarded mega infrastructure-for-minerals deals.

The current government says those deals were skewed in favour of foreign companies and elite Congolese politicians.

“The partnership between DRC and China … my country did not get anything out of the Sino Congolaise des Mines (Sicomines) agreement” Muzito said of the US$6 billion infrastructure-for-minerals deal signed by the Kabila government with Chinese investors in 2008.

The agreement allowed Chinese companies to be offered cobalt and copper in exchange for infrastructure construction.

As part of the deal Congolese state-owned commodity trading and mining company Gecamines formed a joint venture named Sicomines with a consortium of Chinese firms led by Sinohydro and China Railway Engineering Corporation to develop a copper and cobalt mine for US$9 billion.

However the value was renegotiated to US$6 billion after a push from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over fears that it could plunge Congo deeper into debt.

The entry of China into the DRC had filled a void left by Westerners “although they are historically and geopolitically closer to us” Muzito told the Post. “Nature doesn’t like emptiness.”

The most important thing he said was for the DRC to get the benefits it deserved.

Congo’s infrastructure fell into ruins under kleptocratic former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko after the end of Belgian colonial rule in 1960. Most of what remained was destroyed in the 1998-2003 interstate African war.

After years of instability and economic mishandling many Western companies did not develop their mining sites while others divested from the country. The Sicomines deal was a key feature of Kabila’s post-war rebuilding programme for the cash-strapped nation.

Out of the US$6 billion deal China was to use US$3 billion to invest in the mining industry and put the rest into infrastructure. However the Chinese companies started exploiting the minerals even before the US$3 billion that was to go into building infrastructure in the DRC had been disbursed according to Muzito.

“Only US$800 million was disbursed but still no infrastructure in sight. This is injustice” he said in Brussels last week.

The DRC controls more than 60 per cent of the world’s reserves of cobalt ore which is mostly exported to China for processing to make batteries for electric cars weapons machinery and electronics.

Muzito said that as the DRC moved to review mining contracts it was important to ensure legally fair and transparent renegotiation “to find a fair solution which preserves the rights of investors and the Congolese people”.

A recent investigation by a global consortium of media publications and NGOs found how the Chinese owners of some of Congo’s prized copper and cobalt mines used one of Africa’s largest banks to channel at least US$138 million of public funds to Kabila’s family and associates according to Bloomberg.

The DRC is also under pressure from the IMF to “clean up lopsided mining agreements granted to foreign firms” as a precondition for a new US$1.5 billion credit line.

However while Kinshasa maintains that it has not benefited much from the Sicomines arrangement China says it has built several projects in the Central African nation despite obstacles including a lack of power to develop the mines.

China’s foreign ministry last year defended the deal saying the model had not only increased tax revenue and created more jobs in the DRC but had also provided investment in infrastructure projects such as roads hospitals and hydropower stations.

The Sicomines deal is not the only project under a cloud. Mining giant China Molybdenum last week suffered a major setback after a Congolese court temporarily suspended it from operating the Tenke Fungurume cobalt and copper mine in which it holds a majority stake.

A third- party administrator would be appointed for six months a commercial court in Lubumbashi said in a case filed by DRC state-owned mining company Gecamines which holds 20 per cent of the project.

The troubles for China Moly the world’s No 2 cobalt producer emerged just two weeks after its CEO Sun Ruiwen and DRC President Tshisekedi engaged in a video call where they discussed a plan to create a supply chain for “new energy metals”.

They had met earlier in December in Kinshasa where the president indicated that “the expansion at TFM [Tenke Fungurume Mining] and development of the Kisanfu copper and cobalt mine are the key projects of national interest in the DRC”.

China Moly acquired a 95 per cent stake in the Kisanfu copper-cobalt mine from US-based Freeport-McMoRan in December 2020 for US$550 million.

The Congolese government – through Gecamines – accuses China Moly of not declaring thousands of tonnes of copper and cobalt reserves at the Tenke site a move that had allegedly denied Kinshasa much-needed royalties.

This comes after Kinshasa formed a commission in August to investigate the reserves at the TFM project which it said would help determine the true value of the government’s shareholding through Gecamines.

According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence Tenke is the second-largest cobalt producer in the DRC after Anglo-Swiss Glencore and accounted for around 10 per cent of global supply last year.

The legal action comes at a time when the cobalt supply chain is already under pressure due to high demand from the battery sector compounded by Covid-19 related logistics issues according to Benchmark.

It noted that China Moly had planned to produce between 17500 tonnes and 20500 tonnes of cobalt this year compared with 18500 tonnes in 2021.

“That supply chain is already stressed as demand for cobalt is pretty good” Caspar Rawles chief data officer at Benchmark said. “Should the court ruling hinder smooth exports of material this will exacerbate multi-year high prices.”

Other Chinese companies operating in the DRC include Huayou Cobalt Chengtun Mining Wanbao and CNMC or China Nonferrous Metal Mining Corp.

The US previously had substantial mining interests in the country. Freeport-McMoRan operated the TFM project before it sold its 56 per cent stake to China Moly in 2015 followed by the Kisanfu copper-cobalt project deal last year. China Moly raised its TFM holding to 80 per cent in 2019.

But the big power rivalry over the DRC’s mineral wealth may not benefit the country Muzito said. “When two elephants fight the grass suffers. We don’t want the DRC to be the grass that suffers.”

“We ourselves have to be organised” he said. “We need to establish our resources before putting them on the capitalist market – whether it is western or eastern that’s not what matters. What matters is that we get our deserving benefits in this balance of power.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Russia's invasion of Ukraine risks it all,"Male and female software developers work at their desks in the Luxoft Holding Inc. offices in Kiev Ukraine on Tuesday Oct. 31 2017. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Technology has been at the center of national security and global economic concerns for years. U.S. President Joe Biden used his State of the Union address this week to again focus on competition with China and competitiveness in technology manufacturing. But that speech was overwhelmed by the more immediate concern of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and there is another key link in the technology sector that the first land war in Europe since WWII has highlighted: the booming hub of tech workers in Eastern Europe. Ukraine Belarus and Russia – three countries now intertwined in war – have grown into essential growth areas for tech talent in a world more reliant on digital than ever before. From start-ups sourcing the developers and engineers they need to get to the next level to already established corporations relying on software partners for digital transformation hundreds of thousands of tech workers in the region have become critical to the global economy. Gartner estimates there are over one million IT professionals in the three countries with one-quarter (250000) working for consulting or outsourcing firms. There were 200000 Ukrainian developers in the country in 2020 according to Amsterdam-based software development outsourcing company Daxx which says that 20% of Fortune 500 companies have their remote development teams in Ukraine. Software vendors working on behalf of big corporations from financials to retail rely on the talent that the region has cultivated. Take EPAM Systems  as an example. More than 50% of its tech staff are across the three nations – over 30000 employees. It is an example of just how quickly war can disrupt the functioning of organizations in ways impossible to imagine with internal dissension now an issue for EPAM leadership as workers in Ukraine call for its CEO to take a much harder anti-Putin line according to a Bloomberg report even though it has so many workers in Russia and Belarus.

For many following the rapidly unfolding events on social media Aleksandr Volodarsky the Ukrainian founder and CEO of developer outsourcing company Lemon.io has helped to make the human dimensions and tech worker dimensions of the war real through tweets such as one in which he showed a picture of his chief marketing officer in military gear. He had announced back in mid-February that his company was providing two months of pay in advance to employees and he has since posted that clients are stepping up and ""even though developers are mobilized unavailable can't work or volunteered to help the army they will keep paying them regular salaries."" For analysts who have covered companies like EPAM Systems associated with the rise of talent in the region immediate concerns are with the contacts they have made and the individuals they have come to know from the ranks of company leadership and the broader tech communities in Eastern Europe and the scope of the humanitarian crisis in the region is greater than any company or sector outlook. ""Yes our teams are sending deliverables from a f—ing parking garage in Kharkiv under heavy shelling and gunfire in the area. Amazing humans"" Logan Bender chief financial officer at a San Francisco-based software licensing company said in a story posted to Instagram on Tuesday by venture capital meme account PrayingforExits. Longer-term though there is significant risk of a ripple effect across technology and other sectors. ""We've seen a lot of Eastern European countries become hotbeds for development"" said Scott Berg software analyst at Needham. ""Whether it is the right individuals or the right individuals at the right price across all of the companies I cover a solid third if not half have resources in that area."" ""These public companies the headline companies like EPAM are just the tip of the iceberg"" said another analyst.

The dawn of digital geopolitics

The ubiquity of digital technology is intersecting with the geopolitical aspirations of countries in what Gartner now refers to as ""digital geopolitics."" This competition in the digital realm between countries ""is now one of the most disruptive trends"" wrote David Groombridge Gartner Research VP and his colleagues in a report this week. The Gartner team says executives were worried about their enterprise location strategy even before the Russia-Ukraine War with 43% of boards of directors telling Gartner deglobalization was a major concern. The answer isn't to pull out of the region or necessarily pull existing accounts from vendors though this is a risk for any companies with significant talent pools in the region. Analysts say clients will be reluctant to pull work as long as operations can continue but may be less inclined to give expanded work to companies with this geographic risk especially when they have to take into account issues including cybersecurity and that could limit the growth trajectory for the Eastern Europe tech hub and companies reliant on it. For companies in the region they are just trying to understand basic operational issues such as how long they will access to funds to pay workers based in Russia where financial restrictions imposed by the West could limit their payroll abilities and making sure workers have the internet access needed. And the longer the conflict goes on the more tech firms in the region and their clients will worry about technology restrictions and implications for new product development. ""The current impacts to software development centers in Ukraine and surrounding countries have brought this into sharper focus forcing organizations to rapidly reconsider which countries their IT services and supply chains should be sourced from"" Groombridge told CNBC via email. ""The answer should not be a reactive onshoring of capabilities especially in a world where the current crisis will increase existing shortages of digital skills. Instead executives need to navigate a complex balance of competitive advantage geographic concentration risks skills availability legal and regulatory issues and country risk factors to relocate their IT services."" There was already an acute shortage of labor in the technology sector where on average it can take up to 70 days to hire a skilled worker. ""The best talent is in Silicon Valley and the U.S. but the second-biggest hub is Eastern Europe"" said one Wall Street analyst who has traveled throughout the region. Developing tech talent isn't easy and it isn't a problem as simple to fix as moving a factory from one location to another. ""The people problem takes a long time. These hubs take a long time to develop"" the analyst said. Unlike the economic hubs that have developed across the globe based on natural resource riches precious minerals or commodities for fuel intellectual concentration of resources doesn't happen often. Before Eastern Europe it had been decades since a significant new software and technology talent pool had been developed. So far the companies most exposed are managing — building up a cash reserve in advance relying on data centers outside the region to begin with building redundancies into processes in the event that systems aren't functioning. But the longer the conflict persists the more stability is at risk. The worst fears about cybersecurity and access to the technology needed to perform core tasks have not played out on a widespread basis though there have been internet outages in Ukraine and Russian missiles targeting key infrastructure and Russia's invasion is intensifying and expected to target more population centers. If there is a potential silver lining according to experts who have studied the region while other global tech hubs such as Israel and some South American nations are growing in the same way that European nations are committing to defense budgets that are much larger now than just a month ago Eastern European nations such as Poland Romania and Ukraine may see further investment and support in their economies in the future even if Russia remains shunned by the global economy. Volodarsky recently laid out a business plan with an end date that isn't typical for a CEO not measured in a quarter or year but rather ""until the end of the war."" • Keep it running with those who can work.

• Support and pay the team even if they are not available.

• Donate profits to army. Among all the other global implications of a war that is still for many in the stun phase one tech lesson that has the potential to be significant for both consumers and businesses is becoming clear: the global economy can't build a talent pool the size of the one that now exists in Eastern Europe quickly but it's hyper-real now that events within a few weeks can suddenly run the risk of seriously damaging it. —CNBC's Natasha Turak contributed to this report",,,,,,,,,

Many say FDM hasn’t taken off in business aviation due to pilot concerns over “tattle-tales” or having “Big Brother” in the cockpit The reasons however are much more complicated than company culture and the trust between pilots and management.



FDM first requires access to flight data which requires hardware that both records flight data and has a means to export it. Once all the flight data has been accessed the next step is in aggregating and using it.

In the past this process is more complicated than the act of extracting the data itself. Sophisticated FDM/FOQA programs can use thousands of data points and track hundreds of operational metrics and airlines can have teams of analysts working through the mountains of data being pushed from their fleets.



The thought of establishing an FDM program has seemed out of reach for most small and medium fleet operators but we are now seeing the first glimmers of industry-wide adoption of FDM coming to light.

Flight data recorders are standard in modern aircraft and providers of data exporting and analysis services are beginning to focus on business aviation as their next sales target scaling the costs to the business size.



Use Case: Stabilized Approaches



While the use cases for FDM are almost limitless one of the best applications of this technology is the monitoring of stabilized approaches.

Approach and landing is a critical phase of flight and represents up to 61% of aircraft accidents according to ICAO’s 2014 safety report. Mitigating the risks of landing failures results in significantly reduced incidents and accidents.

In addition to passenger and crew safety a hard landing or runway overrun can cost an operator months of downtime and expensive repairs to critical components such as the aircraft’s landing gear. It can also cost an operator’s reputation in the industry.

The consistent use of stabilized approaches has proven to significantly reduce these failures and has been commonplace in the airline and business aviation world for years.



The concept of stabilized approaches arrived with the advent of large jet-engine powered aircraft. Unlike their slower piston and turboprop predecessors jet aircraft require more time to configure for landing.

A measured slower approach to the airfield gives crews more time to establish ideal speeds and equipment configurations along with a plan to abort when the aircraft is not in the ideal setup for landing.



By using FDM/FOQA in their operations airlines consistently use aggregate data to identify systemic issues that lead to unstabilized approaches. FDM can uncover issues in airport approach systems aircraft system issues crew training and procedures and can provide crew members with a rich non-punitive interactive debrief of the approach.



Part 135 and other business aviation operators fly into a much larger variety of airports and more complex operational environments. Flight data monitoring and aggregated data from multiple operators across the industry would have a major impact on reducing mishaps and accidents in business aviation.



Accessibility And Scalability



In the past small operators and most business aviation operations lacked access to FDM tools that would require a fleet of data analysts and programmers to translate and a massive investment in hardware. However many affordable tools are now coming to market for smaller operations providing them access to their own data and de-identified data of larger fleet operators.



The Air Charter Safety Foundation a non-profit safety organization is currently beta-testing an FDM program for a small group of members. The data is collected from an AirSync device that can be used on a variety of Garmin cockpits and installed in a matter of minutes. From there the flight data is sent via Wi-Fi to a data analysis platform CloudAhoy.



The debrief dashboard in CloudAhoy aggregates the cockpit data airport approach information air traffic control communications and weather in one visualization page with a performance score. This functionality is a game-changer for safety managers to review aggregate data looking for systemic issues that can then drive changes in company procedures and training programs.

The ability to stop rewind add data layers and review gives safety teams rich and detailed flight information that would be impossible to capture in any other way.



Many other options are also available.

GE Digital Aviation offers a C-FOQA (Corporate FOQA) platform featuring flight analysis tools and integrations with data from other operators such as Gulfstream Collins Aerospace and the Polairus Aero safety management system.

Once operators get into a data analysis system they can begin to contribute data to and review data from the FAA’s ASIAS (Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing) network.

Today the number of business operators in ASIAS is small but it is quickly gaining traction particularly with large fractional fleet operators and corporate flight departments.



The future seems bright for FDM as cost-effective solutions to collect and analyze data come to market.

Beyond flight data the use of simulator training data through SOQA (simulator operational quality assurance) could further enhance the skill level of the industry’s pilots and its systems. Data analysis can give business aviation the ability to predict and mitigate failures before they result in an accident.

Now that’s something the entire industry can get behind.

Of the several types of community benefits hospitals provide the largest category of spending is Medicaid shortfall the difference between hospitals’ cost of Medicaid patients and their reimbursements. Nearly half (44%) of nonprofit hospitals’ total community benefit spending was from Medicaid shortfall in 2017.

Hospitals refer to Medicaid shortfall as evidence that they are serving Medicaid patients in their community and thus fulfilling their community benefit requirement. But do nonprofit hospitals spend more on Medicaid costs than their for-profit counterparts?

In a recent article in JAMA Network Open professor of accounting at Johns Hopkins University Dr. Ge Bai and colleagues compared reported spending on Medicaid shortfall across 3446 nonprofit and for-profit hospitals in 2019. They compared hospitals within the same state to adjust for each state’s Medicaid reimbursement rates.

They found that in about half of US states with both types of hospitals for-profit hospitals had higher unreimbursed Medicaid costs as a share of their expenses compared to nonprofit hospitals. The difference between Medicaid shortfall between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals was similar in states that expanded Medicaid and states that did not. Overall the average nonprofit hospital saw 2.51% of its expenses going to Medicaid shortfall; for the typical for-profit hospital the rate was 2.53%.

“The nonprofit hospitals have not done enough to deserve their tax subsidy.” Dr. Ge Bai in Modern Healthcare

This article is one of many recent studies that call to question whether or not nonprofit hospitals are doing enough to earn their tax-exempt status. Last year the Lown Institute found that 72% of private nonprofit hospitals spent less on meaningful community benefits than the estimated value of their tax exemption. In total nonprofit hospitals were short $17 billion in unrealized community investment.

Researchers have questioned whether Medicaid shortfall should be included as a community benefit given that states set their Medicaid rates at a level believed to be sufficient to cover hospital costs of delivering care. If the IRS does not consider discounts for other insurers such as Medicare or commercial insurers to be community benefits why should Medicaid be different? While charity care spending reflects the amount patients would pay absent of hospital policy Medicaid shortfall does not convey a hospital policy choice. For these reasons the Lown Hospitals Index does not include Medicaid shortfall under “meaningful community benefits.”

Yet even if Medicaid shortfall was included the study from Bai et al. shows that nonprofits still don’t exceed what for-profits spend. “Whether we look at community benefit as a whole or certain components of how the IRS defines it it doesn’t always appear that not-for-profits are delivering community benefit at levels of magnitude commensurate with what they actually receive in tax subsidies” said Gary Young director of the Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research at Northeastern University in Modern Healthcare.

Dr. Bai put it more bluntly. “The nonprofit hospitals have not done enough to deserve their tax subsidy. Taxpayers subsidize hospitals to help struggling working-class Americans but many nonprofits are not doing enough” she said.",,,,,,,,,

Seven in 10 use smartphones to discover weird and wonderful creative pastimes on popular social media platforms

To celebrate the launch of the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G new research of 1500 adults aged 18-25 years found a staggering 72% have been inspired to take up a new hobby as a direct result of watching clips on social media networks – with more than half spending four hours or more a week watching them on their smartphones – equating to a whopping 208 hours per year.

Not only are Gen Z learning new hobbies online including roller-skating as many as four in 10 have stepped behind their smartphone cameras to capture their own hobbies over social media too. When asked which social media platforms were most inspiring for finding new hobbies the study revealed TikTok (55%) as the most popular platform followed by Instagram (51%) and YouTube (48%) with the most inspirational ‘How To’ video clips including Extreme Make-up (15%) Meditation (11%) Cleaning Technology (9%) and Digital Illustration including Pet Portraiture (7%). Other new hobbies to enter the list include Bubble Nails a new trend that creates the effect of soap bubbles on a gel manicure.

The research inspired by the new A53 5G device – which champions content creation on the go – revealed that young adults are embracing their weird and wonderful interests online with four in 10 of those describing their newfound hobbies as ‘Awesome’ and a third (32%) as ‘Underrated’. Intriguingly photography (29%) was voted the number one Gen Z hobby followed by meditation (16%) and knitting (13%). Almost a fifth polled said their hobby makes them feel liberated and for those who post content 74% said seeing their hobby content do well on social media meant they can’t stop smiling.

When asked about the magic formula for creating good social media visual content almost half (46%) of those polled said good editing followed closely by a good camera (44%) humour (43%) length of video (38%) and authenticity (36%) were the most important. The A53 5G which launched 1st April features a 64MP Camera and AI-powered camera perfect for content capture on the go and two-day battery life[1] which will suit the third of those voting battery as the most important (32%) thing to ensure your device is ready at any time.

A successful outcome for almost half of those who’ve posted content about their hobbies on social media (48%) has been forming a new online business – as a result of engaging with followers. Nearly nine in 10 content creators said their posts have been received well by their followers gaining lots of positive comments and shares. While over a third (37%) agreeing their following has increased by 20 per cent or more since starting to share their unusual hobby content on social media. Other key motivators for sharing include showing off their new skills (26%) personal enjoyment (25%) connecting with others (24%) and learning new things (23%).

Annika Bizon Marketing and Omnichannel Director for Samsung UK & Ireland commented: “After two years of various lockdowns where our creativity could have been stiffened it’s no surprise we’ve seen an increase in awesome and unconventional hobbies coming from this generation. This audience craves expression turning to social media outlets like never before to watch create and share their content. With devices like our new Samsung Galaxy A53 5G Gen Z’s have the ultimate tool to capture better shots thanks to the AI-powered camera multi-lens camera and longer-lasting battery – so they can focus on bringing the fun and playfulness to content creation.”

London-dwelling roller-skater DeVante Walters 27 years old understands how important it is to capture his passion in real-time through smooth motion video capture. “There has been a significant rise in the roller-skating community in the past twelve months. Being without the gym for so long meant we had to adapt and find new interests that made us feel alive! That’s what it’s all about – a feeling. For me roller-skating has always been a passion so I took to social platforms like TikTok to share my moves tips and tricks – including dance routines. It’s totally transformed my life and by using my Samsung Galaxy A53 5G I can shoot stable videos like a pro! Above all else it is so important to connect with others through inspiring them to join in discover their inner talents and have fun with it.”

The hyper-connected and hyper-cognitive generation live their lives through the filter of their digital devices. They live seamlessly within the virtual and the offline transitioning their experiences with an ease that's unparalleled across previous generations.





This generation values individual expression wants to stand for a cause and wants to see some serious change come through their actions.





Having been born in a globally prosperous world (between 1995-2012) this generation as opposed to the millennials are less self-focused and more world-focused.

Gen Z's relationship with brands is also multi-layered. Beyond being a possession a brand provides access becomes an important form of self-expression and also becomes a platform through which they can display and practice their ethical concerns.

Brands are a way of self-expression

Individual identity and manifesting that in many ways is at the core of Gen Z's self-expression. Gen Zs are unlikely to buy brands because they help them become a part of a group or a tribe and are more likely to buy brands as individual preference. They are constantly seeking out brands that match their values or help them express themselves better or become a better version of themselves.





This changes the game for many branding theories that have been built over the decades. The brand as the ideological glue that holds consumers together as a tribe is at the crux of cult branding theory one in which brands such as Apple Google Starbucks Levi's Harley Davidson and the likes have been built.





Consumers who choose these brands are co-opting themselves and a group of others who all hold similar values and emotions about the brand.





So if Gen Z prefers to go solo does traditional branding theory rooted in the principles of community connection and shared values have any relevance today? Are cult brands appealing to this generation at all? Is there a change warranted in the way these brands are built?





Gen Z has endured and been at the receiving end of the worst global crisis that has been witnessed in decades. The lockdown has stripped this generation's ability to form real connections and form physical relationships in their most prime years. Their sense of community and bonhomie has been relegated to those managed online through WhatsApp and other social media channels.





The isolation crisis amongst Gen Z is real. Does this global isolation crisis hold an opportunity for brands to come in and say something meaningful? Since brands mean a lot more than just consumption can brands reignite a sense of bonding and community among a generation who seems to be losing all ties with a connected world?





For the devoid Gen Z generation can brands offer a powerful platform that helps them connect with other like-minded people who share their passions and their interests?





Is there a chance to revive the decades-old concept of cult-branding at a time when the global isolation crisis is threatening to strip this generation's ability to tribe and vibe with other people?

How brands can appeal to Gen Z?

Balancing the need to personalise with the need to tribe is where brands need to focus their strategies.

Appealing to this generation in a hyper-customised way but by giving them a platform to connect emotionally with other like-minded people will appeal to this generation's sensibility.

This can be done in the form of stories that talk about the brand's values and ethical ideology. Gen Z wants to read these stories through social media channels and be more involved in them.





Through purposeful initiatives that Gen Z can participate in or through causes that are dear to their hearts. Brands can make significant inroads into the hearts and minds of young Gen Z consumers.





Whether one calls it cult branding or a newer form of engagement-oriented branding the bottom line here is that every new generation heralds a shift in thinking and ideology. And with every new generation comes newer principles and practices of branding strategy that need to get employed. Here's yet another interesting evolution in the exciting world of branding that reflects the mindset values and ideology of a changing generation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ja2luc2V5LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlZC1pbnNpZ2h0cy90aGVtZXMvaG93LXRvLWltcHJvdmUtdGhlLWN1c3RvbWVyLWV4cGVyaWVuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to improve the customer experience,"In an increasingly digital world where products and services are scrutinized in the court of public opinion customer experience (CX) is king.

Race replays can be saved and share over the cloud across all consoles while access to in-game cameras effectively gives us the ability to switch between versions at will. It's clear that the game is indeed based on the existing Gran Turismo Sport engine but the balancing act in exploiting PS5 while still looking and running great on PS4-class hardware is remarkable.

Let's start with the absolute basics then. We've already established that PlayStation 5 operates at native 4K with no sign of dynamic resolution scaling and it's clear that the last-gen consoles stick to the established GT Sport formula: it's native 1080p on the base PS4 rising to a checkerboarded 1800p on PS4 Pro (though if your Pro is set to 1080p output resolution on the front-end of the console that's what you'll get instead). PS5 has increased clarity then but we also noted fewer edge aliasing artefacts too. The comparisons between base PS4 and Pro beyond the pixel count is minimal - they're very very close indeed - though we did spot some lower resolution texture elements on the vanilla machine. Essentially though you can consider the standard PS4 as a 1080p rendition of the Pro experience.

It's the comparison between Pro and PS5 that's perhaps most interesting though: both target ultra HD displays but the Pro is doing it with around one third of the pixel count of the PS5. Meanwhile in raw compute power PS5 has around 2.5x the GPU power of the Pro - but it's doing so much more than simply pushing more pixels. In this respect it's similar to the recently released Horizon Forbidden West - PS5 is delivering a much bigger boost to the experience than the raw teraflop count suggests.

That said the GT Sport engine basis does mean that the older machines are still getting a competitive experience and on first glance one might think that PS5's improvements are subtle but the more you look at how the games compare the more you appreciate the increase in fidelity. Foliage is always tricky to render: there's much more of it and of a much higher quality on PlayStation 5. Certain circuits ramp up density of trees too - to the point where in some cases Polyphony actually uses completely different higher detail models on the new console.

Lighting also benefits from a substantial increase in fidelity - not just the quality of it but the implementation too: PS5's indirect lighting solution looks a lot better simulating light bounce to a higher quality than the older consoles especially noticeable on more reflective surfaces. Volumetric lighting effects also appear to be missing on the legacy PlayStation machines while sun rays are replaced with a less effective bloom effect.

PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 Pro PlayStation 4 Foliage is much improved on PS5 to the point where an entire grass layer is missing on PS4-class machines. PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 Pro PlayStation 4 Volumetrics are pared back on older machines shadows are reduced in quality and the shadow map cascade on PS4 machines is also more intrusive. PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 Pro PlayStation 4 An entire layer of detail - most visible with the trees here - is gone on the older machines. PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 Pro PlayStation 4 PS5 here has improved lighting far superior shadows and more detailed vehicles - plus in-game motion blur (though you can have this on PS4 Pro in its 1080p mode. PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 Pro PlayStation 4 Interesting to note the differences in texture quality between the three machines here plus the enhanced lighting and reflections found on PS5. PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 Pro PlayStation 4 Cavity ambient occlusion on PlayStation 5 makes the nooks and crannies more accurately shaded on vehicles. Also note the difference in crowd density in the stands. PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 Pro PlayStation 4 Lighting is vastly improved on PlayStation 5 here - there's an entire layer of reflective surfaces missing on the older machines. PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 Pro PlayStation 4 PS5 is enhanced with far more environmental detail to the point where tree models can be entirely different if they're present on PS4/Pro in the first place. PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 Pro PlayStation 4 Switch between the three shots here and observe the differences in detail lighting shadow quality and tree models - plus those missing layers on older machines.

By extension shadows cast also appear reduced in quality or missing compared to PS5 with a far less effective shadow map cascade too looking visibly blurrier not too far away from the player. This push for improved fidelity on PS5 extends to vehicle models too where cavity ambient occlusion is missing on the older machines serving to give us a more realistic better shaded look on PlayStation 5.

Beyond this the new machine gets a vast range of enhancements possibly too numerous to mention but there's clearly a bump to texture quality across the board while level of detail (LOD) transitions are far more obvious on the older machines. Even with cars relatively close to the player it's possible to see less complex models in play on PS4 and Pro when put side-by-side with PS5. Reflection quality is also improved: in common with many driving games GT7 uses a dynamic probe based system where environments are dynamically sampled then mapped onto reflective surfaces - such as the car bonnet in 'roof cam' view. They're fairly low resolution on PS5 already but PS4-class machines are pared back still further.

In-game motion blur is also implemented on PlayStation 5 adding to the sense of speed and immersion. This is missing on PS4 but can be accessed on PS4 Pro if the front-end of the console is set to 1080p - as mentioned earlier this swaps out the checkerboarded 1800p for native full HD freeing up horsepower for the motion blur as well as opening the door to 60fps replays and likely improved in-game performance too. 60fps replays are optional on PS5 too - ray tracing is the default which caps performance to 30fps but going for the high frame-rate mode turns off the RT effects on replays and menus effectively trading fidelity for fluidity.

Performance? There's not much to discuss here. All versions target 60 frames per second and while slowdown is possible on all renditions of the game it's the PS4-class of hardware that's typically less stable. In fact it's fair to say that the additional features added to GT7 means that this new game seems to have more slowdown than its predecessor GT Sport. That said extreme wet weather racing combined with a packed grid can bring about performance drops on all PlayStations and sometimes this extreme load results in lower frame-rates on PS5 earlier on races - though the tables turn later on. Performance is generally fine in GT7 however and in most scenarios it is the new machine that is smoother overall outliers apart.

It's also no surprise to find that loading times are vastly improved on PlayStation 5. It's true that GT7 on PS4 and Pro are still vastly improved over the laggy menu system and extended load times of the PS3 era but with the comparison between PlayStation 5 and its predecessor we're talking about an order of magnitude improvement or better - 30 to 40 second loads are typically done by four seconds at the most sometimes faster (as low as less than one second). In fact GT7's launch day patch has actually reduced loading times compared to the review code. Transitions from menus to gameplay are now virtually seamless in GT7 and that makes a huge difference.

Ultimately Polyphony Digital has delivered three excellent versions of Gran Turismo 7. In common with other first-party Sony games the PS4 and Pro versions are mostly identical - resolutions apart. And as the core engine was built for that generation of hardware it's still a very good-looking game - and key engine improvements (such as dynamic time of day weather cloud rendering etc) make their way into all versions of the game. Comparing PS4 Pro to PS5 is almost like comparing a well-scaled PC game from its low/medium settings to high/ultra - with a sizeable resolution boost added too. I'm still not particularly happy about the game requiring access to the internet in order to function but this does open up a good feature: not only can replay data be shared between all consoles but in-game progression is freely interchangeable too.

Whether it's with Gran Turismo 7 or Horizon Forbidden West we're often asked whether the cross-gen requirement is holding back PS5 from being everything it can be and whether the existence of PS4 and Pro versions limits the scale and scope of the game. On the one hand the requirement to service three consoles instead of one may have an impact on studio resources. However on the other hand it's got to be stressed that brand new game engines based on exciting new rendering paradigms don't just appear out of thin air - they take a long long time to develop: a rendition of GT7 built from the ground up for PS5 would be impossible to deliver just over a year from the console's launch. Expect new and exciting things from the next Polyphony Digital game but what's clear from our testing is that GT7 on PS5 offers a vast array of improvements and enhancements over the last-gen rendition of the title - and you're getting a substantially improved experience on Sony's latest machine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDUvbG93LWNvc3QtdHdvLWNoYW5uZWwtc2NyaXB0YWJsZS13YXZlZm9ybS1nZW5lcmF0b3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Low-Cost Two-Channel Scriptable Waveform Generator,"Microcontroller addict [Debraj] decided to make his own programmable sine wave generator and was able to put it together for under $40 USD. Other than low-cost his list of requirements was as follows:

Dual sine wave output synchronized

Frequency Amplitude and Phase control

Low harmonics under 1 MHz

Scriptable via Python

The heart of the project is the Analog Devices AD9833 a complete Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) waveform generator system on a chip. If you’ve ever rolled your own DDS using discrete ICs or in an FPGA you can appreciate the benefit of squeezing the phase accumulator sine lookup table DAC and control logic all into a single ten-pin package. [Debraj] uses AD9833 modules from the usual online vendors for a few dollars each. He synchronizes the generators by disconnecting the reference crystal on the second module and driving it from the first one. The remaining specifications are met by the inherent characteristics of the DDS system and the scriptable interface is accomplished with an Arduino controlling the AD9833 chips and two programmable gain amplifiers (MCP6S31). We like the confidence that [Debraj] displays by sketching the initial circuit diagram with a ball-point pen — check out the sketch and the final pictorial schematic in the video below the break.

This is a good example of combining off-the-shelf modules to quickly build a project. This approach is great for one-off builds or as a proof-of-concept test bed that can later be spun onto a custom PCB. Another reason to use modules these days is that the modules are often in-stock but the chips are unobtainable. Though it appears [Debraj]’s only needs one of these generators it would be an easy board to layout and build — if you can buy the parts."

The U.S. Navy's Submarine Force took delivery of its newest attack submarine the future USS Oregon on February 26. It was the twentieth Virginia-class submarine to be co-produced at General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB) and Huntington Ingalls Industries – Newport News Shipbuilding through a joint agreement.

In addition the future USS Oregon was the eleventh Virginia-class boat delivered by GDEB and the second Block IV configured submarine.

""Oregon is in excellent condition and the captain and crew have expertly taken the ship through her paces” said Capt. Todd Weeks the Virginia-class program manager who rode the boat during her sea trials.

The delivery of this Virginia-class submarine was the culmination of nearly ten million work hours under the exacting standards imposed by Naval Sea Systems Command and Naval Reactors the Naval Sea Command announced .

""Each organization works tirelessly with the others focused on getting ships to sea as the first step in ultimately arriving at its Squadron and homeport where it becomes a vital asset to the nation"" added Captain Weeks.

The U.S. Navy's Virginia-class was designed to operate in the world's littoral and deep waters while conducting anti-submarine warfare anti-surface ship warfare special operations forces support mine warfare and reconnaissance. Their inherent stealth endurance mobility and firepower directly enable the Virginia-class subs to support five of the six maritime strategy core capabilities: sea control power projection forward presence maritime security and deterrence.

The result is a flexible multi-mission platform. The Virginia-class submarine can even be used to deliver special operations forces support or participate in mine warfare roles.

Third Navy Vessel to Honor Oregon

The future USS Oregon is the third U.S. Navy vessel to honor the Beaver State. The first USS Oregon was a brigantine ship purchased in 1841 and used for exploration until 1845 while the second USS Oregon was commissioned on July 15 1896.

The submarine's sponsor is Mrs. Dana Richardson wife of former Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson. Mrs. Richardson christened Oregon at Electric Boat in Groton Connecticut on October 5 2019.

Block IV Moving Ahead

As noted in a recent Congressional Research Service report the U.S. Navy has been procuring Virginia class nuclear-powered attack submarines since 1998 and a total of thirty-four had been procured through 2021.

In addition since 2011 the Virginia-class boats have been procured at a rate of two per year.

However due to the COVID-19 pandemic the ten remaining Block IV submarines had been delayed by four months on average though program officials stated that Block V has a schedule margin to absorb some Block IV delays. USS Oregon had been delayed by about sixteen months making it nearly two years since the Connecticut shipyard delivered a submarine.

The four-day event held from March 6–9 will host 30000 visitors including high-level delegations and exhibitors from nearly 80 countries.

“March 6 will mark an important milestone in the Kingdom’s journey toward localizing 50 percent of its military expenditure by 2030” said Ahmad Al-Ohali governor of Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Military Industries the organizer of the World Defense Show.

“There has never been a better time to partner with Saudi Arabia’s defense and security ecosystem as we continue to transform a nascent industry with immense potential. Our doors are open to international manufacturers and service providers who share our vision for technology transfer talent development and defense industrialization” he added.

The show will accelerate the industry’s future by showcasing the latest technological developments and demonstrating defense interoperability across all major domains — air land sea space and security systems.

The show will feature products and demonstrations from hundreds of local and global exhibitors including international partners such as Lockheed Martin Boeing General Dynamics Navantia BAE Systems L3 Harris and Norinco.

“The level of international demand is unlike anything we have seen before in the industry and that is testament to Saudi Arabia’s position as a key market for the industry and its vision to support economic growth through developing the defense sector. We look forward to inspiring conversations about the future of defense among visitors delegations and exhibitors from over 80 countries” said World Defense Show CEO Andrew Pearcey.

The show will facilitate a unique platform for networking collaboration knowledge-sharing and the discovery of innovations. A tailored meet-the-buyer program will host up to 600 meetings connecting buyers and suppliers across the global defense industry.

Another flagship networking platform is “Meet the KSA Government Program” highlighting opportunities in Saudi Arabia for investors to meet with critical local defense players and learn more about the industry’s strategy objectives tendering and procurement guidelines and partnership requirements.

The government representation will include main partners ministries of defense interior national guard Presidency of State Security GAMI and the Saudi Arabian Military Industries.

The World Defense Show venue spans 800000 sq. meters and features three large exhibition halls outdoor exhibit spaces a dedicated interoperability demonstration area a purpose-built 3km-long runway and space for static aircraft.

Running up to six times per day an interactive and immersive command and control center will feature a 20-minute show simulating the future of interoperability at the highest levels. There’s also a dedicated startup zone that will display the latest technologies driven by small and medium companies worldwide.

Daily themed panel discussions and keynote presentations will introduce the audience to insights giving rise to the technologies exhibited at the show. Key Saudi entities developing the Kingdom’s industry and the economy will deliver sessions that offer insights into Saudi Arabia’s defense industry transformation.

On International Women’s Day March 8 leading women in defense will gather at a special event to celebrate promote and accelerate participation in the defense industry. The full-day event will feature keynote presentations and interactive panel discussions to advocate for and connect with the diverse voices of today’s defense community.

The show’s final day will open its doors to 5000 talented Saudi students from the Kingdom’s best STEM institutions for the Future Talent Program.

Historians would later call it the Rhodesian Bush War but back then it was just tracking. Allan Savory wiped the sweat from his forehead catching a bead of black dye before it hit his eyes. Four Zimbabwean independence fighters had shot up a police station and Ian Smith’s rogue colonial government had tasked Savory’s Tracker Combat Unit with finding them. In his war memoir Savory follows trail signs along the banks of the Zambezi glimpses a camouflage jacket through the foliage and kills them all. Half a century later Allan Savory stepped into the lights on a stage in Vancouver. He told the TED Talk audience that he had come to regret ordering the deaths of forty thousand elephants during his time as a Rhodesian wildlife officer. He didn’t mention his central role in developing the tracking technique of the Selous Scouts who massacred thousands of civilians during the war using everything from machine guns to anthrax. That was all beside the point. He was there to tell a story about how cattle farming could save the world from climate change. The world believed him.

The Evolution of a Myth Savory called his theory holistic rangeland management but today it’s known by many monikers including regenerative ranching rotational foraging and adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing. Its central premise is that by putting cattle on the move overgrazing can be prevented and crucially atmospheric carbon can be sequestered into the soil. As evidence of the ranching sector’s environmental impact has grown undeniable — climate scientists calculate that beef alone produces a quarter of all food emissions and ecologists estimate it causes more than half of global deforestation in some areas — regenerative ranching has become a popular counterpoint for the industry’s defenders. Proponents assert that regenerative methods could turn deserts into grasslands. Some even claim it could reverse global climate change using a fraction of the world’s soils. Though Allan Savory developed his method in colonial Rhodesia and had published it by 1980 regenerative ranching remained a fringe theory until cattle baron Ted Turner broadcast Savory’s talk on YouTube in 2013. The video went viral the corporate world took notice and the financial floodgates swung open. Later that year another film debuted perhaps the first documentary focused on building soil carbon through ranching. It was called Soil Carbon Cowboys and it had an interesting financier: Shell Oil. Shell’s interest in promoting regenerative ranching was a classic carbon offset scheme — in the words of the film’s director “What if these oil companies used their money to help ranchers transition to AMP grazing and then shared in the credits for the carbon being stored in the soil?” With a pitch like that he landed a grant. In 2016 a second $500000 grant went to Cowboys cast member and consultant Richard Teague who has since published scores of academic articles on AMP grazing but is not required to disclose his associations with Shell not to mention other financial interests such as McDonald’s Dixon Ranches and the Savory Institute. In an anemic university research system heavily reliant on grant funding Soil Carbon Cowboys helped pioneer a new career pathway in academia. In 2018 its director Arizona State journalism professor Peter Byck brought in $4.5 million from McDonald’s to promote regenerative ranching through film coupled with another $1.25 million from corporate donors through the US Department of Agriculture’s Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research. This money was distributed among at least fourteen professors from Arizona State and other land grant universities including a Michigan State scholar named Jason Rowntree who secured a massive $19 million grant for regenerative ranching research from donors like Butcher Box and the Noble oil fortune in 2021. To continue providing private research grants corporate investors presumably prefer to see favorable results. In 2020 Rowntree served as principal investigator on a General Mills–commissioned study examining White Oak Pastures a ranch claiming to draw down 3.5 kilograms of CO 2 -equivalent emissions for every kilogram of beef.

Cargill said the upgrades include additional filling stations blending and storage tanks and warehouse improvements which will allow the company to more than double its annual production capacity for organic non-GMO tapioca syrup to 12000 tonnes by 2024. Tapioca syrup is used in food products such as ice cream snack bars and confectionery products including hard candies caramels marshmallows and gummies.

“American consumers’ appetites for products made with ingredients perceived as simple familiar and responsibly sourced continues to grow and evolve” said Dana Johnson vice president of sweetness segment Cargill Starches Sweeteners & Texturizers North America. “As our customers look to satiate that demand our tapioca syrup is increasingly in the sweet spot — offering transparent sourcing organic and non-GMO certifications and positive consumer perceptions.”

The investment in the Cikande sweetener facility is Cargill’s latest designed to enhance its ingredient and production capabilities.

The request is for boys and girls track meaning Bethlehem Academy's only solo spring sport will be softball if the co-op is approved by the Board.

Friesen indicated other schools are also seeing lower numbers in particular in baseball. He didn't know why but theorized having no spring sports in 2020 and no American Legion Baseball that summer simply sapped interest from many players.

In a memo to Superintendent Sesker Faribault Public Schools Activities Director Kevin Kleiner states ""We believe the formation of a cooperative sponsorship beginning in the 2022 season with Bethlehem Academy for Baseball is in our best interest to help sustain and grow our baseball program. Based on our participation numbers from the Spring of 2021 and known changes to student participation for the 2022 season we project in 2022 to less than 30 high school baseball players.""

29 in grades 9 through 12 are projected with 16 at the middle school level.

Kleiner also points out ""The cooperative sponsorship arrangements with Bethlehem Academy including financial agreements will be the same as in our other cooperative sponsorship programs.

Kleiner says Faribault Public Schools have adequate numbers in both the Girls and Boys Track and Field programs; however ""There is strength in having larger numbers in a sport like Track and Field. Generally all participants have the opportunity to compete in meets due to how meets are formatted for participants so this would not be preventing opportunities for FPS students. We have a cooperative sponsorship in Cross Country with Bethlehem Academy so having a cooperative sponsorship in Track and Field is a natural fit.""

One of the victims presumed dead is believed to be Flip Wars: Buying Blind star Lana Tufo's sister Alexandra Tufo. Alexandra's boyfriend Thomas ""Tommy"" Campana is said to have been the pilot.

""I cry in the morning and at night and during the day I'm kinda just numb"" the A&E reality star told WSVN on Wednesday.

On Facebook Lana shared a photo of herself hugging her sister alongside the caption ""I don't want to live on this planet without you 🤍.""

The search which lasted around 72 hours and involved six agencies was suspended on Thursday the same day divers from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office found two pieces of a plane in the ocean according to a Coast Guard news release published Friday.

The agency said MSCO divers were about to identify the tail number of the reported missing aircraft ""on the ocean floor in the search area.""

MSCO spokesman Adam Linhardt said their dive crew was asked earlier this week to search the area where a U.S. Coast Guard aircrew discovered an oil slick in the water according to The Miami Herald.

Capt. David Dipre of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission confirmed that MSCO divers had located a portion of the plane about 17 miles south of the Lower Keys per the newspaper.

The Vans RV-12 single-engine plane originally left Palm Beach County airport for Key West on Sunday.

""Having located the debris the search and rescue has now become a recovery effort for all agencies involved"" Dipre said in a Friday statement the Herald reported.

Cmdr. Lindsey Seniuk Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator for Coast Guard District Seven extended condolences to the victims' families in Friday's news release.

""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Alexandra Tufo and Thomas Campana"" Seniuk said. ""This was a challenging case and it made the decision to suspend that much harder after our partners found the debris field.""

According to FAA records obtained by the Herald Campana was the owner of the plane that is believed to have crashed. The outlet also reports that the FAA's pilot database shows Campana received his sport pilot's certificate in January.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident Dipre said. The captain noted that Florida Fish and Wildlife ""will work to coordinate efforts and provide all assistance needed to the NTSB."""

SAIC and GM don’t have just one joint venture but a small dozen and they also work together outside of China. It’s a mutual beneficiary relationship. Without SAIC Buick would probably have followed Pontiac and Saturn into obscurity GM would be mostly America-only and SAIC wouldn’t have three successful self-owned brands. The Sino-American love affair will celebrate its 25th anniversary this year. It’s a good reminder for the country’s politicians: working together brings more prosperity than trying to outdo each other in geopolitical mind games.

First contact

The earliest contacts between SAIC and GM date back to the 1980s when SAIC was looking for a foreign partner for the first time. In those negotiations GM did not want to go any further than assembling American-made knockdown kits and there is certainly no question of technology transfer. So the Volkswagen got the deal. More than a decade later GM sees the need to enter the Chinese market as a manufacturer (the American cars are of course already for sale via import) and end up in the arms of SAIC after all.

The big difference with the first talks is that on June 12 1997 GM and SAIC set up not one but two joint ventures. The first is of course SAIC-GM the second bears the name PATAC or Pan-Asian Technical Automotive Center. PATAC is therefore a joint R&D institute. SAIC and GM will not only make cars together but also develop and design the technology together.

In 2001 GM and SAIC intensify their relationship when they jointly take over ailing Daewoo Motor in South Korea (Suzuki also participates for a few percent at first but the Japanese quickly drop out). GM becomes the majority shareholder of Daewoo and immediately gives the company an important status. The traditional American models are of course still being developed in the USA but smaller cars and models for emerging markets will be the joint responsibility of Daewoo in Korea and Opel in Europe.

With their collaboration off to a flying start SAIC and GM double down on their collective efforts. They set up a range of new joint ventures:

SAIC-GM-Wuling (2002) – Joint venture set up to make the Wuling minicars. Now also the maker of the Baojun brand. More on it below.

Shanghai GM Dongyue Automotive (2003) – Originally established for the manufacturing of Chevrolets and auto parts this joint venture now produces several brands for SAIC-GM.

Shanghai GM Dongyue Powertrain (2004) – Makes engines for SAIC-GM and SAIC’s own brands such as Roewe and MG.

Shanghai GM (Shenyang) Norsom Automotive (2004) – Established in 1999 as a joint venture between GM and Jinbei part of Brilliance. The idea was to make Blazers and Silverado’s which only happens on a small scale. In 2004 SAIC acquired the shares of Jinbei and since then the company has acted as a supporting production facility for SAIC-GM.

In addition there are joint ventures in sales lending leasing and telematics services (such as GM’s OnStar).

SAIC-General Motors Automobile Co. Ltd.

SAIC-GM is set up to introduce the locally-made Buick to the Chinese market. The brand is of course already known from imported models but the Chinese production proves essential. Undoubtedly without the Chinese market we could have added Buick to the list of Oldsmobile Geo Saturn and Pontiac. But that doesn’t happen. The start is not entirely smooth because the typical American Buick Century is not quite what the Chinese were waiting for in 1999. The Buick Sail (Opel Corsa sedan) is already a better choice but the major successes come from the GL8 (a large MPV only for China) and the Excelle. The latter a compact sedan is made in many variants over time. With the Regal and LaCrosse Buick is also present in the more expensive segments.

While Buick is targeting the mainstream market perhaps a little at the higher end of it Chevrolet is targeting the lower end and younger buyers. SAIC-GM added brand in 2005. A little earlier in mid-2004 SAIC-GM also entered the premium market with Cadillac. Buick and Cadillac are now selling better in China than in their home country.

During the credit crisis of 2008 GM is in serious trouble and bankruptcy is inevitable. In 2009 the old GM (GM Corporation) is saddled with all debts and the assets are transferred to the new GM (GM Company). This way America’s proudest automaker can make a restart. SAIC also plays a role in this transition. The Chinese are lending the new GM tens of millions of dollars to keep Daewoo afloat. In exchange for the financial support SAIC receives a 51% majority stake in SAIC-GM. The 50/50 balance is restored in 2012 when SAIC acquires a one percent ownership in the American parent company instead of the extra 1% of SAIC-GM shares.

This turbulent time is creating a new dynamic in the collaboration. The R&D responsibilities of Daewoo then renamed GM Korea are being moved step by step to PATAC in Shanghai. Factories in Korea are closed and GM is supplying a larger part of the Asian market from China. If GM also sells Opel in 2017 GM Korea’s role is largely over. The development of compact and cheaper models is done entirely by PATAC. GM even sells some cars developed in China in its home market although they are still manufactured in North America.

Both Buick and Chevrolet now have a very extensive line-up with models in all major segments. Perhaps surprisingly Buick is by far the most successful commercially selling three times as much as Chevrolet. Cadillac is of course only present in the larger premium segments. The three brands together make GM the fourth automaker in China (about 1.5 million cars sold in 2020) behind Volkswagen Honda and Toyota. If you also include the sales of Wuling and Baojun associated with GM they are even number two.

SAIC-GM is therefore very important for ‘The General’ but vice versa it is almost the same story. SAIC first built its own brands Roewe and MG on the remains of MG Rover but now the technology comes from PATAC. For example the Roewe i5 and MG 5 are technically closely related to the Buick Verano and Chevrolet Cruze. Given the commercial success it seems obvious that the cooperation will only be strengthened.

SAIC GM Wuling Co. Ltd.

I already wrote an Automaker Story about Wuling describing its history in making agricultural equipment airplanes and combustion engines prior to a take-over by SAIC Motor. In this chapter I pick up where I left off. For the record we start in 2002 when SAIC GM and Wuling form a joint venture (SGMW) with the aim to further develop the Wuling brand which mainly produces minibuses.

Wuling immediately introduces a new minivan in 2002 under the name Zhiguang (translation: “Sunshine”). This car was designed in-house in record time. The Zhiguang has some early teething problems but these are quickly resolved and the brand continues its strong position in the segment. In addition to the Zhiguang the Mitsubishi-based Xingwang is also produced until 2009. Then it is replaced by the larger Rongguang.

The Zhiguang has a typical Chinese life span. A second generation of the model launches in 2011 but the original version also remains in production. That second-generation model disappears again in 2016 while the first generation is refreshed and adapted to the latest environmental standards and stays available to this day.

One of the reasons Wuling started the joint venture with SAIC and GM is the ambition to manufacture and sell passenger cars as well. In 2003 that dream partly came true. SGMW moves into passenger car production but not with the Wuling brand. The model that comes off the assembly line is sold as Chevrolet Spark (known elsewhere in the world as Daewoo Matiz).

It will take until 2010 before the first real Wuling passenger car sees the light of day. SGMW christens this medium-sized MPV Wuling Hongguang and fueled by commercial success a large number of variants soon follow. After a facelift in 2013 the basic version is called Hongguang S but there is also a Hongguang S1 (slightly larger export version which is also sold for some time in China itself) a Hongguang S3 (SUV version) and a Hongguang V (slightly more rectangular-shaped model with sliding instead of swinging doors at the rear). Moreover in 2018 the second generation appears as Hongguang as S and V. And in good Chinese tradition different versions and generations sell alongside each other.

Wuling Hongguang Plus The Wuling Hongguang in all its versions

The Hongguang is technically a simple design. The rather bland unibody stands on simple struts at the front with a rigid axle and leaf springs at the rear. The engine is a 1.5-liter with about 100 hp the 5-speed manual transmission transfers the power to the rear wheels. The interior is a collection of hard plastics and the seats are arranged in the Chinese 2+2+3 arrangement. That means two separate seats in the middle row and a three-seater bench at the very back. The price of Hongguang is unimaginably low by Western standards and the quality seems to be alright.

And so Wuling makes China’s Beetle or 2CV: a people’s car that provides mobility for the common citizen. Since its release the Hongguang has sold nearly five million copies and has been the best-seller in the Chinese market for many years. You will not easily encounter the Hongguang in the lists of classic people cars like the Beetle Ford Model T Fiats 500 or Mini but it does belong in it. Even today the Honnguang is good for several 100000 units a year despite the basic technology.

The name Hongguang is so strong that Wuling also uses it when it brings an absurdly cheap four-seat mini-EV on the market in 2020. This car is known as Hongguang Mini EV and is now the best-selling EV in China. Within 18 months of production over half a million units were sold which once again underlines Wuling’s name as a mobility provider for people with a small budget.

However the history of SGMW takes an important turn when the joint venture starts a second brand alongside Wuling in 2012: Baojun. Where Wuling’s MPV is still very close to light commercial vehicles Baojun has to make genuine affordable passenger cars. And where Wuling is mainly associated with SAIC Baojun is above all part of GM’s strategy. As said Daewoo became GM Korea and (together with Opel in Germany) was responsible for the development of smaller and cheaper models. Baojun is the brand promoting GM Korea’s cars in China.

In the first half of the 2010s Baojun introduces a complete range of cars in the compact and sub-compact segment as well as a large MPV. All these cars are equipped with modern GM technology with front-wheel drive and a new platform. Baojun focuses emphatically on the budget segment and manages to achieve considerable commercial success although this does not apply to every model. For example the 330 (a sub-compact sedan) from 2015 is an extremely obscure car even by Chinese standards with about 125 copies sold.

However GM’s close ties to SAIC are gradually shifting its global strategy. More and more activities are moving from GM Korea to PATAC in Shanghai and when Opel is sold in 2017 the development role in Korea is almost over. PATAC now leads many of GM’s overseas operations. The R&D center develops the technology for SGMW various Chevrolets and Buicks from SAIC-GM and for SAIC’s own brands Roewe MG and Maxus.

In 2019 SGMW makes a major change of strategy for Baojun to strengthen its brand position. Under the nomenclature “New Baojun” follows a whole line of products based on an entirely new PATAC platform. The biggest difference however is the introduction of the “Interstellar Geometry” design language (yes they do hip marketing language in China too) which makes the previously rather generic Baojuns look a lot more modern. The market response was hesitant at first and has stayed lukewarm ever since. Fortunately for SGMW Wuling’s expanding range of affordable cars makes up for the sharp drop in Baojun sales.

Since its inception SGMW is not limited to China alone. Within SAIC it is the main exporter of cars and also has a production facility in Indonesia. The main export markets are in Southeast Asia but cars are also shipped to South America and CKD kits to Africa. With this export it is easy to lose the overview. For example the Baojun 530 is sold in parts of Asia as Wuling Almaz but in India it is called MG Hector and there is also an extended version for sale which is not on the market in China. In South America the same car goes through life as Chevrolet Captiva. And a Baojun 630 sedan which has been retired in China for years is still supplied as Chevrolet Optra via CKD kits and assembly in Egypt to several countries in the Middle East and Africa.

Baojun RC-6 The “New” Baojun China doesn’t seem to like

Finally something about the company SGMW. It is commonly referred to as a joint venture but as SAIC owns 50.1% of the shares it is actually a subsidiary of the Chinese. GM holds 44% after a partial buyout of Wuling in 2010 leaving 5.9% for the company’s ancestor. SGMW is a good example of the international interdependence of the automotive industry. For SAIC it is a precursor to international expansion for GM a source of affordable models in developing markets and for Wuling a reliable stream of royalty income.

Closing observations

So this was the story of China’s number one car manufacturer in six long episodes. Shanghai Automobile transferred from making buses and a single mid-sized sedan into one of the country’s leading industrial conglomerates. Its main revenue comes from the international joint ventures but SAIC also has a strong position with its self-owned brands has a major components group and plays a role in commercial vehicles.

SAIC also looks well set to become the first Chinese car company to gain a global presence. It already serves several emerging markets both with its own brands and the SGMW brands. The next battleground is going to be Europe where SAIC is trying to (re-)establish MG as a genuine mainstream brand. The badge may help. If SAIC succeeds it will be seen as a true victory and the company may become less reliant on its joint venture partners. That said the synergy between SAIC and General Motors seems to be working really well. Both are strong in their respective home markets and nicely complement each other’s line-up in other parts of the world. When political tensions between the USA and China will finally diminish it’s probably not such a weird expectation to see further integration of the two automotive giants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyaXZpbmdsaW5lLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9hLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtdGhlLTE5NzMtMTk4Ny1jaGV2cm9sZXQtc3F1YXJlLWJvZHktcGlja3VwLWdtcy1sb25nZXN0LXJ1bm5pbmctY2xhc3NpYy10cnVjay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A History Of The 1973-1987 Chevrolet Square Body Pickup GM's Longest-Running Classic Truck,"A History Of The 1973-1987 Chevrolet Square Body Pickup GM's Longest-Running Classic Truck

March 6 2022

Story By Benjamin Hunting

After taking a big step towards modernity with its 'Action Line' of full-size C/K pickups built between 1967 and 1972 both Chevrolet and GMC were ready to make a further push towards comfortable capable trucks that could double as daily drivers or task-focused haulers. Enter the 1973 C/K a truck that few could predict would echo through the next two decades as one of GM's most popular vehicles.

Dubbed the 'square body' by fans (despite General Motors calling it the 'Rounded Line' internally) the rectangular-shaped trucks featured soft corners and a whole lot of street presence. They also introduced technologies and engineering details that were slower to make their way to the Ford and Dodge line-ups that Chevrolet and GMC competed with helping the square body leap out into an early lead that it took years for its Blue Oval rival to reel in.

Square But Smooth

There's no question that right off the bat the square body's styling scored points with pickup buyers eager for something new. Rather than the sleek appearance of the pickup it replaced the 1973 C/K featured broader bulkier looks that incorporated larger glass a hood that opens inside the fenders (rather than as a clamshell) and a larger grille.

It was a muscular yet clean take on the pickup concept and it helped contribute to roomier cabins with better ventilation and a quieter on-road experience. Suspension components were engineered specifically to absorb rough roads with minimal bounce (with asymmetrical shock placement at the rear and an independent front setup on two-wheel drive models) making use of computerized simulations prior to being cast—a first for GM's pickups. Wheelbases were stretched for all versions of the truck improving stability and smoothness and disc brakes were standard on the forward wheels.

In another new development aerodynamics were taken into account during the design process (including moving the antenna for the AM/FM radio into the windshield rather than using a stand-alone) and the dashboard was organized so as to make it easy for drivers to interact with rather than simply providing a an accumulation of gauges and controls as in years past.

GM also went big when it came to heavy-duty versions of the truck. In addition to the regular cab body style Chevrolet and GMC introduced a four-door crew cab as well as a dual-rear wheel model it marketed under the 'Big Dooley' name.

In short the square body was the first human-centric truck to emerge from General Motors and the extra effort paid off. Customers quickly realized that it was now easier than ever to use their Chevrolet pickup as both a work tool and a commuter vehicle opening up brand new markets for the brand among drivers who might not have had space for a second vehicle or who may have never before considered parking a truck in the driveway. More than a million examples were sold in the first year of production alone.

Big Blocks Small Blocks And Sixes

Mechanically the 1973 C/K square body didn't stray too far from Chevrolet's established playbook. Most trucks featured an inline six-cylinder engine (displacing either 250 cubic inches or 292 cubic inches) with a choice of three V8s ranging from a pair of small blocks (307 cubic inches and 350 cubic inches) up to a 454 cubic inch big block. Power peaked at 230 hp for the 454 (along with 360 lb-ft of torque) but the 350 was good for a respectable 175 hp and 275 lb-ft of twist.

Over the course of the next 10 years the 307 would be replaced by a 305 cubic inch unit and a 400 cubic inch motor would also appear on the order sheet. Other notable inclusions? The constant presence of four-wheel drive (both full-time and part-time) as well as the regrettable Oldsmobile diesel V8 that arrived for 1978.

Once the '80s came into view the engine line-up was simplified with the 305 the 350 and the 454 serving as the primary V8 choices. A 262 cubic inch V6 (better known as the 4.3L) arrived by the middle of the decade replacing the long-serving straight-six and a 6.2L Detroit Diesel V8 hit the order sheet in 1982.

Losing Its Edge

Both Chevrolet and GMC made a number of cosmetic changes to the C/K square body trucks over the course of their extended life-span but for the most part the updates were minor: moving wiper locations sloping the hood adding side markers and switching from egg-crate to split and two-level grilles (with turn signals eventually hidden alongside a pair of stacked headlights). Many but not all of these parts are interchangeable between years with most of the changes taking place from 1981-1987.

The decision to let the square body largely wither on the vine had consequences for GM. Although still a competent truck by 1980 the Ford F-Series had caught up with its innovations having already taken over the top sales spot it still enjoys today.

After 1987 the square body C/K was replaced by the fourth-generation version of the truck riding on the new GMT400 platform. It wasn't entirely over for the squares however: General Motors simply changed the name to R/V and sold them alongside the GMT400. Power was up across the board thanks to the introduction of throttle body fuel injection but half-tons were taken out of the mix leaving the R/V to customers seeking a heavy duty three-quarter or full-ton model. By 1990 only the three-quarter ton remained and after 1991 the square bodies were gone for good.

In the '80s GM was putting out a string of bad engines. The automaker was desperate to get out of the rut after introducing the infamous V8-6-4 which failed due to cylinder management issues. In came the HT4100 V8. The ‘HT’ stood for High Technology and ‘4100’ for the displacement.The HT4100 V8 lived up to its name and was a game-changer since it featured a throttle-body fuel-injection system and a lightweight aluminum block with casted iron sleeves.It ran in the Cadillac lineup from 1982 through to 1987 . It got good reviews for its smooth operation a rarity in GM in the early '80s. But consumers were quick to notice it was slow. The HT4100 V8 produced 125and 257 Nm of torque and was less powerful and efficient than the 4.1-liter Buick V6 that made 125 HP and 284 Nm of torque.Consumers reported all sorts of issues with the HT4100 V8. It suffered from head gasket problems coolant leaking issues and oil pump failures. Replacement parts were expensive and most repair shops wouldn’t work on them.It was yet another engine failure for General Motors. The remaining option was the 5.7-liter V8 diesel that produced 105 HP and 271 Nm of torque. But this engine also suffered from its own set of issues.GM followers had one viable option left the 4.1-liter Buick V8. it wasn’t as advanced as the HT4100 V8 but far more reliable and problem-free in comparison.While GM would still produce other horrible engines down the line the HT4100 V8 is by far the worst in its history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3BvbnRpYWMtYnJhbmQtcXVpY2staGlzdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Quick History Of The Pontiac Brand,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3BvbnRpYWMtYnJhbmQtcXVpY2staGlzdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wMy9oZXJlcy13aGVuLTIwMjMtY2FkaWxsYWMtbHlyaXEtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi13aWxsLXN0YXJ0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wMy9oZXJlcy13aGVuLTIwMjMtY2FkaWxsYWMtbHlyaXEtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi13aWxsLXN0YXJ0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here’s When 2023 Cadillac Lyriq Production Will Start,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2022/03/heres-when-2023-cadillac-lyriq-production-will-start/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wMy9oZXJlcy13aGVuLTIwMjMtY2FkaWxsYWMtbHlyaXEtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi13aWxsLXN0YXJ0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wMy9oZXJlcy13aGVuLTIwMjMtY2FkaWxsYWMtbHlyaXEtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi13aWxsLXN0YXJ0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

SAIC and GM don’t have just one joint venture but a small dozen and they also work together outside of China. It’s a mutual beneficiary relationship. Without SAIC Buick would probably have followed Pontiac and Saturn into obscurity GM would be mostly America-only and SAIC wouldn’t have three successful self-owned brands. The Sino-American love affair will celebrate its 25th anniversary this year. It’s a good reminder for the country’s politicians: working together brings more prosperity than trying to outdo each other in geopolitical mind games.

First contact

The earliest contacts between SAIC and GM date back to the 1980s when SAIC was looking for a foreign partner for the first time. In those negotiations GM did not want to go any further than assembling American-made knockdown kits and there is certainly no question of technology transfer. So the Volkswagen got the deal. More than a decade later GM sees the need to enter the Chinese market as a manufacturer (the American cars are of course already for sale via import) and end up in the arms of SAIC after all.

The big difference with the first talks is that on June 12 1997 GM and SAIC set up not one but two joint ventures. The first is of course SAIC-GM the second bears the name PATAC or Pan-Asian Technical Automotive Center. PATAC is therefore a joint R&D institute. SAIC and GM will not only make cars together but also develop and design the technology together.

In 2001 GM and SAIC intensify their relationship when they jointly take over ailing Daewoo Motor in South Korea (Suzuki also participates for a few percent at first but the Japanese quickly drop out). GM becomes the majority shareholder of Daewoo and immediately gives the company an important status. The traditional American models are of course still being developed in the USA but smaller cars and models for emerging markets will be the joint responsibility of Daewoo in Korea and Opel in Europe.

With their collaboration off to a flying start SAIC and GM double down on their collective efforts. They set up a range of new joint ventures:

SAIC-GM-Wuling (2002) – Joint venture set up to make the Wuling minicars. Now also the maker of the Baojun brand. More on it below.

Shanghai GM Dongyue Automotive (2003) – Originally established for the manufacturing of Chevrolets and auto parts this joint venture now produces several brands for SAIC-GM.

Shanghai GM Dongyue Powertrain (2004) – Makes engines for SAIC-GM and SAIC’s own brands such as Roewe and MG.

Shanghai GM (Shenyang) Norsom Automotive (2004) – Established in 1999 as a joint venture between GM and Jinbei part of Brilliance. The idea was to make Blazers and Silverado’s which only happens on a small scale. In 2004 SAIC acquired the shares of Jinbei and since then the company has acted as a supporting production facility for SAIC-GM.

In addition there are joint ventures in sales lending leasing and telematics services (such as GM’s OnStar).

SAIC-General Motors Automobile Co. Ltd.

SAIC-GM is set up to introduce the locally-made Buick to the Chinese market. The brand is of course already known from imported models but the Chinese production proves essential. Undoubtedly without the Chinese market we could have added Buick to the list of Oldsmobile Geo Saturn and Pontiac. But that doesn’t happen. The start is not entirely smooth because the typical American Buick Century is not quite what the Chinese were waiting for in 1999. The Buick Sail (Opel Corsa sedan) is already a better choice but the major successes come from the GL8 (a large MPV only for China) and the Excelle. The latter a compact sedan is made in many variants over time. With the Regal and LaCrosse Buick is also present in the more expensive segments.

While Buick is targeting the mainstream market perhaps a little at the higher end of it Chevrolet is targeting the lower end and younger buyers. SAIC-GM added brand in 2005. A little earlier in mid-2004 SAIC-GM also entered the premium market with Cadillac. Buick and Cadillac are now selling better in China than in their home country.

During the credit crisis of 2008 GM is in serious trouble and bankruptcy is inevitable. In 2009 the old GM (GM Corporation) is saddled with all debts and the assets are transferred to the new GM (GM Company). This way America’s proudest automaker can make a restart. SAIC also plays a role in this transition. The Chinese are lending the new GM tens of millions of dollars to keep Daewoo afloat. In exchange for the financial support SAIC receives a 51% majority stake in SAIC-GM. The 50/50 balance is restored in 2012 when SAIC acquires a one percent ownership in the American parent company instead of the extra 1% of SAIC-GM shares.

This turbulent time is creating a new dynamic in the collaboration. The R&D responsibilities of Daewoo then renamed GM Korea are being moved step by step to PATAC in Shanghai. Factories in Korea are closed and GM is supplying a larger part of the Asian market from China. If GM also sells Opel in 2017 GM Korea’s role is largely over. The development of compact and cheaper models is done entirely by PATAC. GM even sells some cars developed in China in its home market although they are still manufactured in North America.

Both Buick and Chevrolet now have a very extensive line-up with models in all major segments. Perhaps surprisingly Buick is by far the most successful commercially selling three times as much as Chevrolet. Cadillac is of course only present in the larger premium segments. The three brands together make GM the fourth automaker in China (about 1.5 million cars sold in 2020) behind Volkswagen Honda and Toyota. If you also include the sales of Wuling and Baojun associated with GM they are even number two.

SAIC-GM is therefore very important for ‘The General’ but vice versa it is almost the same story. SAIC first built its own brands Roewe and MG on the remains of MG Rover but now the technology comes from PATAC. For example the Roewe i5 and MG 5 are technically closely related to the Buick Verano and Chevrolet Cruze. Given the commercial success it seems obvious that the cooperation will only be strengthened.

SAIC GM Wuling Co. Ltd.

I already wrote an Automaker Story about Wuling describing its history in making agricultural equipment airplanes and combustion engines prior to a take-over by SAIC Motor. In this chapter I pick up where I left off. For the record we start in 2002 when SAIC GM and Wuling form a joint venture (SGMW) with the aim to further develop the Wuling brand which mainly produces minibuses.

Wuling immediately introduces a new minivan in 2002 under the name Zhiguang (translation: “Sunshine”). This car was designed in-house in record time. The Zhiguang has some early teething problems but these are quickly resolved and the brand continues its strong position in the segment. In addition to the Zhiguang the Mitsubishi-based Xingwang is also produced until 2009. Then it is replaced by the larger Rongguang.

The Zhiguang has a typical Chinese life span. A second generation of the model launches in 2011 but the original version also remains in production. That second-generation model disappears again in 2016 while the first generation is refreshed and adapted to the latest environmental standards and stays available to this day.

One of the reasons Wuling started the joint venture with SAIC and GM is the ambition to manufacture and sell passenger cars as well. In 2003 that dream partly came true. SGMW moves into passenger car production but not with the Wuling brand. The model that comes off the assembly line is sold as Chevrolet Spark (known elsewhere in the world as Daewoo Matiz).

It will take until 2010 before the first real Wuling passenger car sees the light of day. SGMW christens this medium-sized MPV Wuling Hongguang and fueled by commercial success a large number of variants soon follow. After a facelift in 2013 the basic version is called Hongguang S but there is also a Hongguang S1 (slightly larger export version which is also sold for some time in China itself) a Hongguang S3 (SUV version) and a Hongguang V (slightly more rectangular-shaped model with sliding instead of swinging doors at the rear). Moreover in 2018 the second generation appears as Hongguang as S and V. And in good Chinese tradition different versions and generations sell alongside each other.

Wuling Hongguang Plus The Wuling Hongguang in all its versions

The Hongguang is technically a simple design. The rather bland unibody stands on simple struts at the front with a rigid axle and leaf springs at the rear. The engine is a 1.5-liter with about 100 hp the 5-speed manual transmission transfers the power to the rear wheels. The interior is a collection of hard plastics and the seats are arranged in the Chinese 2+2+3 arrangement. That means two separate seats in the middle row and a three-seater bench at the very back. The price of Hongguang is unimaginably low by Western standards and the quality seems to be alright.

And so Wuling makes China’s Beetle or 2CV: a people’s car that provides mobility for the common citizen. Since its release the Hongguang has sold nearly five million copies and has been the best-seller in the Chinese market for many years. You will not easily encounter the Hongguang in the lists of classic people cars like the Beetle Ford Model T Fiats 500 or Mini but it does belong in it. Even today the Honnguang is good for several 100000 units a year despite the basic technology.

The name Hongguang is so strong that Wuling also uses it when it brings an absurdly cheap four-seat mini-EV on the market in 2020. This car is known as Hongguang Mini EV and is now the best-selling EV in China. Within 18 months of production over half a million units were sold which once again underlines Wuling’s name as a mobility provider for people with a small budget.

However the history of SGMW takes an important turn when the joint venture starts a second brand alongside Wuling in 2012: Baojun. Where Wuling’s MPV is still very close to light commercial vehicles Baojun has to make genuine affordable passenger cars. And where Wuling is mainly associated with SAIC Baojun is above all part of GM’s strategy. As said Daewoo became GM Korea and (together with Opel in Germany) was responsible for the development of smaller and cheaper models. Baojun is the brand promoting GM Korea’s cars in China.

In the first half of the 2010s Baojun introduces a complete range of cars in the compact and sub-compact segment as well as a large MPV. All these cars are equipped with modern GM technology with front-wheel drive and a new platform. Baojun focuses emphatically on the budget segment and manages to achieve considerable commercial success although this does not apply to every model. For example the 330 (a sub-compact sedan) from 2015 is an extremely obscure car even by Chinese standards with about 125 copies sold.

However GM’s close ties to SAIC are gradually shifting its global strategy. More and more activities are moving from GM Korea to PATAC in Shanghai and when Opel is sold in 2017 the development role in Korea is almost over. PATAC now leads many of GM’s overseas operations. The R&D center develops the technology for SGMW various Chevrolets and Buicks from SAIC-GM and for SAIC’s own brands Roewe MG and Maxus.

In 2019 SGMW makes a major change of strategy for Baojun to strengthen its brand position. Under the nomenclature “New Baojun” follows a whole line of products based on an entirely new PATAC platform. The biggest difference however is the introduction of the “Interstellar Geometry” design language (yes they do hip marketing language in China too) which makes the previously rather generic Baojuns look a lot more modern. The market response was hesitant at first and has stayed lukewarm ever since. Fortunately for SGMW Wuling’s expanding range of affordable cars makes up for the sharp drop in Baojun sales.

Since its inception SGMW is not limited to China alone. Within SAIC it is the main exporter of cars and also has a production facility in Indonesia. The main export markets are in Southeast Asia but cars are also shipped to South America and CKD kits to Africa. With this export it is easy to lose the overview. For example the Baojun 530 is sold in parts of Asia as Wuling Almaz but in India it is called MG Hector and there is also an extended version for sale which is not on the market in China. In South America the same car goes through life as Chevrolet Captiva. And a Baojun 630 sedan which has been retired in China for years is still supplied as Chevrolet Optra via CKD kits and assembly in Egypt to several countries in the Middle East and Africa.

Finally something about the company SGMW. It is commonly referred to as a joint venture but as SAIC owns 50.1% of the shares it is actually a subsidiary of the Chinese. GM holds 44% after a partial buyout of Wuling in 2010 leaving 5.9% for the company’s ancestor. SGMW is a good example of the international interdependence of the automotive industry. For SAIC it is a precursor to international expansion for GM a source of affordable models in developing markets and for Wuling a reliable stream of royalty income.

Closing observations

So this was the story of China’s number one car manufacturer in six long episodes. Shanghai Automobile transferred from making buses and a single mid-sized sedan into one of the country’s leading industrial conglomerates. Its main revenue comes from the international joint ventures but SAIC also has a strong position with its self-owned brands has a major components group and plays a role in commercial vehicles.

SAIC also looks well set to become the first Chinese car company to gain a global presence. It already serves several emerging markets both with its own brands and the SGMW brands. The next battleground is going to be Europe where SAIC is trying to (re-)establish MG as a genuine mainstream brand. The badge may help. If SAIC succeeds it will be seen as a true victory and the company may become less reliant on its joint venture partners. That said the synergy between SAIC and General Motors seems to be working really well. Both are strong in their respective home markets and nicely complement each other’s line-up in other parts of the world. When political tensions between the USA and China will finally diminish it’s probably not such a weird expectation to see further integration of the two automotive giants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNibi5jby56YS9pbmR1c3RyeS1uZXdzL2FncmljdWx0dXJlL2JlY29tZS1hLXBhcnQtb2YtdGhlLWNhc2UtaWgtc3VjY2Vzcy1zdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Become a part of the Case IH success story,"A rare opportunity beckons for suitable individuals or companies to establish a Case IH dealership in pre-identified areas in the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape.

Russia’s homegrown payments system Mir said the cardholders would still be able to access their funds make withdrawals and domestic transfers – at least until their bank cards expire.

Mir has processed most domestic payments in Russia since 2015 while foreign operators such as Visa and Mastercard continued to run international transactions. The operator – which is 100% owned by the country’s central bank – was established on government orders to protect the economy against sanctions imposed over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

“All cards of these payment systems already issued by Russian banks will continue to work within our country as before” Mir’s operator said in the early hours of Sunday.

“Until the expiration of their validity Visa and Mastercard cardholders have access to all the funds on their accounts as well as all the usual payment transactions – paying for purchases transferring funds from card to card withdrawing cash etc.”

The statement was issued shortly after the US firms declared on Saturday they would be suspending Russian operations in light of Moscow’s continued military assault on Ukraine.

On Sunday American Express said it was also suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus. “In light of Russia’s ongoing unjustified attack on the people of Ukraine American Express is suspending all operations in Russia” the credit card company said in a statement on its website. “We are also terminating all business operations in Belarus.”

Both Mastercard and Visa’s decision to suspend their Russian operations will primarily impact foreign payments meaning local consumers will no longer be able to use their Russian cards abroad or for international payments online. Foreign customers will also be blocked from making payments to Russian companies or withdrawing cash within the country.

“Payments abroad including on foreign internet resources will not be available with Visa and Mastercard international payment systems cards issued by Russian banks” Mir confirmed.

The move is expected to accelerate Russian banks’ adoption of Mir’s own cards which are accepted in a handful of countries including Turkey Vietnam Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

On Saturday Mir said it already had seen a surge in demand for its cards after sanctions were imposed against Russian banks by the US EU and UK. According to its own statistics more than half of Russians already owned a Mir card as of September 2021 accounting for 32% of all transactions.

The uptake is likely to play into critics’ fears that economic sanctions will merely incentivise Russia to invest in alternative schemes. Similar concerns have been raised about blocking Russia from Swift – the secure message system used by banks for cross-border payments – and the potential rise of alternatives such as Russia’s equivalent SPFS system.

PayPal stopped accepting new customers in Russia on Wednesday and on Saturday expanded that block saying its services there – primarily customers transferring money to each other – had been suspended. It added that it would allow withdrawals “for a period of time ensuring that account balances are dispersed in line with applicable laws and regulations”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkZmlyc3QuY29tL3VrL21hcmtldHBsYWNlLXNlbGxlcnMvb25saW5lLXJpc2stbWFuYWdlbWVudC9wcm9zLWNvbnMtcmVjZWl2aW5nLWZvcmVpZ24tcGF5bWVudHMtbG9jYWwtY3VycmVuY3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Receiving foreign currency payments in local currency,"The digital revolution has made global expansion easier than ever for small businesses. With international e-commerce sales expected to rise to a total of $6.4 trillion by 2024 small businesses that sell across borders can take advantage of global growth and increase their profitability.

However small e-commerce businesses often hit a stumbling block when it comes to getting paid in a foreign currency. The international payments industry is hugely complex creating roadblocks to growth which can be challenging for small businesses to overcome.

So what are the pros and cons of getting paid in a foreign currency by international customers? How are innovative payments solutions facilitating greater small business expansion and making complex foreign currency exchange rates easier to understand? What should e-commerce sellers look for when selecting an account to get paid in a foreign currency?

In this article we’ll examine the pros and cons of getting paid in foreign currency by international customers.

Pro: Customers prefer paying in local currency

Con: Small businesses have to shoulder the costs

Pro: Not all e-commerce sites support getting paid in foreign currency

Con: Accounting for local preferences everywhere makes getting paid in a foreign currency complicated

How modern payment solutions can make getting paid in a foreign currency a growth opportunity

Minimising foreign currency exchange rate costs for small businesses

Pro: Customers prefer paying in local currency

A recent survey conducted by PayPal showed that 76% of e-commerce customers preferred paying online in their local currency. If e-commerce sellers don’t provide customers with the ability to pay in their own currency they could seriously limit their viability as they attempt to penetrate new markets.

The same study also found that 62% of survey respondents checked foreign currency exchange rates before making a purchase. As e-commerce sellers are all too aware any delay to the checkout process is hugely detrimental to conversion rates. E-commerce sellers should always make checkout experiences as seamless as possible to encourage sales and offer currency values customers immediately understand.

Con: Small businesses have to shoulder the costs

Customers worldwide want to pay the price as listed and not pick up additional charges for choosing to do business with you. An unexpected increase to the listed price of an item is hugely detrimental to customer confidence. Transaction fees are typically tacked on at the checkout stage almost as an afterthought and are likely to affect customers’ purchasing decisions.

As a result the most successful e-commerce sellers shoulder the cost of getting paid in a foreign currency. Banks with opaque fees and charges make the problem worse as small businesses are unable to effectively benchmark and guarantee the profitability of the new markets in which they are trying to do business.

Pro: Not all ecommerce sites support getting paid in foreign currency

Some businesses choose not to accept getting paid in foreign currencies providing a huge competitive advantage for the small e-commerce sellers that do. In an increasingly competitive market one of the best ways to differentiate a business is to provide a far superior customer service.

Con: Accounting for local preferences everywhere makes getting paid in a foreign currency complicated

Sellers are too busy to independently survey and research the local preferences of each market they hope to serve. Time-poor and with limited resources small e-commerce businesses live or die by the features of their platforms.

Unfortunately most e-commerce platforms don’t have a simple method for sellers to easily account for local preferences. International customers in different countries around the world don’t receive an optimised checkout experience which adds further strain to struggling conversion rates.

Depending on the payment platform some small businesses partner with accepting the local currency of foreign customers can be made significantly easier for sellers.

Reuters-Yonhap





U.S. payments firms Visa and Mastercard said Saturday they were suspending operations in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine and that they would work with clients and partners to cease all transactions there.







Within days all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside of the country and any Visa cards issued outside of Russia will no longer work within the country the company said.







""We are compelled to act following Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed"" Al Kelly chief executive officer of Visa said in a statement.







U.S. President Joe Biden in a call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed Visa's and Mastercard's decisions to suspend their operations in Russia the White House said.







""President Biden noted his administration is surging security humanitarian and economic assistance to Ukraine and is working closely with Congress to secure additional funding"" a White House readout of the call added.







The move by the payments firms could mean more disruption for Russians who are bracing for an uncertain future of spiraling inflation economic hardship and an even sharper squeeze on imported goods.







Unprecedented Western sanctions imposed on Russia have frozen much of the country's central bank's $640 billion in assets; barred several banks from global payments system SWIFT; and sent the ruble into free-fall erasing a third of its value this week.







On Monday Ukraine's central bank chief Kyrylo Shevchenko told Nikkei Asia the central bank and Zelenskiy urged Visa and MasterCard to halt transactions of their credit and debit cards issued by Russian banks to increase pressure on the Russian regime the paper.

While roping with different partners two years ago at the National Finals Rodeo inside Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas each man collected big money over a 10-day stretch. Now that they’re together Wyatt and Worley stand to cash in even bigger during the final performance of The American set for noon Sunday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington.

Neither cowboy earned a chance to compete at the NFR this past December but that’s what sets them up so well this weekend. They advanced to The American through a series of qualifying events and won the first round Friday at Cowtown Coliseum in Fort Worth with a 4.53-second run. As qualifiers they are eligible for the $2 million side pot.

“That’s life-changing money and it gets you really excited to rope for that kind of money” said Worley a heeler from Berryville Arkansas.

Friday’s opening round featured 16 teams with 10 having earned an exemption by finishing among the leaders of the 2021 world standings. Each event’s contestant that wins will pocket $100000 but the qualifiers who claim the crown will earn at least a share of the side pot. That means if the Resistol tandem wins the top prize and no other qualifiers do then each man will pocket $1.1 million.

Only the fastest 10 runs from Friday’s round move on to Sunday and Wyatt and Worley lead the pack. There are four other Resistol cowboys that are eligible for the side pot: the team of Bubba Buckaloo and Joseph Harrison; header Cory Kidd roping with Lane Mitchell; and heeler Clay Futrell roping with Brock Hanson.

Other Resistol teams in field for Sunday are Cody Snow and Wesley Thorp and Dustin Egusquiza and Travis Graves. They will be joined by header Clay Smith and heeler Jake Long.

Wyatt of Clanton Alabama finished the 2020 campaign fourth in the heading world standings and third in the NFR average. Worley roping with Jeff Flenniken placed second in the aggregate and seventh in the standings; the year before he was 11th in the world standings.

Each man makes living roping and they have a chance at an incredible salary for 2022.

But are there some challenges that stand out above the others? The answer is yes but yes on two fronts.

The first relates to the teacher – the most important human influence on student learning. This has been shown through multiple analyses: trials in Uganda have suggested a real shift in learning when the teacher is strong research by the World Bank points to the importance of teachers’ beliefs in their students (what the groundbreaking psychologist Bandura called collective teacher efficacy) and an extensive study by the Rand Corporation outlines the extraordinary value-added teaching can have on students.

However this is only part of the puzzle. Teachers and students operate in systems characterised by values culture and opportunities which determine many crucial factors such as how far a student can hope to go in their journey what they will study and what the next steps in life might be.

A teacher alone cannot determine these aspects of life as many will be influenced if not completely determined by the second front that has the greatest effect on learning. This second front is ideological: elitism.

I’ve written a book on this – Education and Elitism: Challenges and Opportunities. I have noticed in my daily practice as a Principal that the theme of elitism is omnipresent from the pressure students put on themselves to enter elitist universities to the type of knowledge that is promoted and excluded in the curriculum. I argue that elitism is a central theme that defines almost everything that happens in schools and universities.

Of course this depends on geographic regions: in the book I show how educational elitism is far more strident in the free-market Anglo-American sphere for example than it is in social democracies in Nordic countries. However this is a question of valency for elitism affects all educational systems across the globe.

Let’s investigate what this means at different levels: meritocratic plutocratic and cultural elitism.

Meritocratic

First there is the elitist system of meritocracy whereby the best are promoted and awarded. But what do we mean by the best? Best at what? Traditional school assessment metrics measure attainment in academic domains and extra curriculars.

The question to ask is where the space is for neurodivergent physically challenged or socially disadvantaged students. Social advantage (or lack therefore) predicts opportunity. For instance students with access to coaching and technologically advanced infrastructures can get ahead in extra curriculars.

In essence meritocratic elitism is meant to be need-blind but it is not.

Plutocratic

Next there is plutocratic elitism meaning that the wealthy have the opportunities and the poor do not.

This is especially true in education for a number of reasons. First top-tier universities are still extremely expensive. Some students receive needs-based scholarships but even after scholarships average tuition is still very high. And its easier to get there through expensive schools with resources directed at college counselling.

A 2019 Oxfam report showed that poorer children in the so-called “developing world” were seven times less likely to finish school. A UNICEF report makes it clear that even in more developed countries “not all children have an equal opportunity to reach their full potential”. This is often because lower resourced schools struggle to provide the type of learning support that many student might need to excel.

Cultural elitism

Finally there is cultural elitism in other words presenting a curriculum to students that excludes many voices. For instance Kenyan students are still learning as much if not more about British history through a British curriculum than Kenyan history and culture.

This causes what is known as curriculum violence. When the curriculum is biased towards one cultural hegemony it can create complexes of inferiority among students and instructors from other less represented or pessimistically represented cultures. For example clumsy classroom experiments on what it means to be a slave or colonised person run the risk of traumatising students from historically denigrated cultures as they are forced to confront heavy painful issues in front of a curious audience.

Psychological well-being in schools often stems from a feeling of not belonging to the in-group. The effects of this alienation are manifold and can be extremely negative.

Anti-cultural elitist movements can veer into crude exclusionary tactics too: rubbishing Western culture; excluding people based on their identities or seeking stigmas categorisations and new types of stereotypes. Ironically in the effort to dismantle elitism a new type of elitism can be created. The search should be for an expression of culture that is less fragmented and more inclusive. Culture is a discussion to be had by everyone.

At the end of the day education is about building confidence in students for the next challenge and to build up someone’s confidence there must be care for their multiple identities not an aggressively elitist interest in some groups only.

A way forward

In my book I point out that elitism is not always necessarily bad. Situational elitism is at the core of much human organisation mainly in systems of contests canons of respect social structure or aesthetic discernment. Ultimately there is no such thing as a world without elitism.

However when it is too strident and unchecked it becomes important for educators to stand back to check the systems and values that are framing student learning and to adapt them if possible.

How to do this?

Broaden Assessment. Schools need to look carefully at how they can assess students more broadly than on academic skills predicated on social advantage. At the same time universities need to be part of that discussion too ensuring that the entry requirements to tertiary instructions are more holistic and appreciative of character and human flourishing than they are at present. If schools want to encourage entrepreneurship and student agency then transcripts have to change to recognise this. A group that is doing this work to broaden assessment is the coalition to honour all learning. Improve the reputation of state universities. As long as students are queuing at the door of the same top-tier Ivy League and Russell group universities the pressure on guidance counsellors teachers parents and of course students to outperform one another will remain causing stress and unhealthy zero-sum-game competition. To mitigate this entire national systems and districts have to do work to improve the reputation of state institutions so that progress to tertiary educational pathways is smoother and more mindful. Ranking tables should be discarded. Decolonise the curriculum. If the society that human beings need in the future is more inclusive sustainable and socially responsible then the values that are implicit in the curriculum need to be rethought. Schools should re-calibrate so that the curriculum experience is critically-minded diverse competence-based and celebratory of human qualities such as compassion cultural literacy environmental custodianship and accountability. A good starting place for this work is the study of history.

Therefore I submit that to reform education for good elitism must be addressed. Schools and society should allow for people to reach potential to become excellent but it does not have to be at the cost of others. If we look for the good and celebrate gifts as they are rather than how they should appear in one rigid framework the whole question of elitism will become a different question one of human flourishing in all its diverse and powerful expressions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYi5jb20vcmFuZ2Vycy9uZXdzL2ZlYXR1cmVkL3RpZ2Vycy0xOTk1LWJsdWUtYWx0ZXJuYXRlLWplcnNleXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tigers 1995 blue alternate jerseys | Texas Rangers,"The navy blue jersey hangs in Ron Reiss’ closet waiting for the day when baseball returns and he can wear his Tigers fandom again. It’s a little worn and looks like something from a video game or an alternate universe. The Olde English D on the left chest has a Tiger walking through it an alternate logo the Tigers had in the mid-90s. On the opposite chest is the jersey number something the team never had on its home jerseys. [A version of this story was originally published in May 2020.] Reiss thought it was a fashion jersey or batting practice gear when he found it on sale on eBay years ago and started wearing it to games. “I originally paid $25 or $30 for it because it was number 35. That was my lucky number” Reiss recalled. “But it wasn't until 10 or 12 years ago that [then-Tigers marketing director] Ron Wade mentioned that my jersey was an authentic that was worn and that some private collector was trying to buy them all because they were scarce.” Bill Henderson is one such collector. Not only does he search for unique items to add to his treasure trove of jerseys he has written a book about uniform oddities. Among the Philadelphia resident’s prized items is the all-burgundy Phillies jersey the team wore for one game in 1979. But even Henderson didn’t know what he had when a dealer in Wisconsin put a navy blue Tigers jersey on sale 20 years ago. “I just thought this was a unique-looking thing” he said. “And when I bought it I didn't know anything about it. … At first I found out it was only worn for one year. And then when I started doing the research I found it was only worn for one game.”

It was supposed to be for a year. It lasted a day. And for generations of Detroit fans who have known the Tigers for their classic home jersey it’s a forgotten piece of history even to the players who wore it. “It was sort of a quirk in the history of the club” former Tigers president/CEO John McHale Jr. said. ""It represents a strange departure."" For more than 85 years the Tigers have been known for the white home jersey with the Olde English D on the chest a look as familiar to baseball as those of the Yankees and Red Sox. When Detroit strayed for the 1960 season and wore a script Tigers home jersey fans complained. When John Fetzer took over as controlling owner in '61 he brought the Olde English D jerseys back. The look has become so familiar that some fans revolted two years ago when the Olde English D changed on the jersey to match the one on the cap. The look is so synonymous with the club so long-standing that it renders throwback jerseys moot. When MLB had a Turn Ahead the Clock jersey promotion in 1999 the Tigers kept their traditional home look shortened the sleeves and used a futuristic font for the name and number on the back. They wore the same look for Spring Training games as in the regular season until a few years ago. • Were these the worst -- or best -- jerseys ever? “The home uniform and the Olde English D that's always been a classic” Hall of Famer Alan Trammell said. “Even when I see it today I smile and I hope they never change it.” Aside from special events like Negro Leagues Weekend or Fiesta Tigers they haven’t deviated. But in May 1995 they came the closest to a change that they’ve come in modern times. Call it once in a blue moon.

I just thought this was a unique-looking thing. ... And then when I started doing the research I found it was only worn for one game. Bill Henderson

“This came about at a time when licensing is exploding in all sports but especially in MLB you have a lot of teams that are developing alternate looks” said Todd Radom a graphic designer and author who has created logos for pro sports teams and leagues for years. “In every sport designers like me -- in conjunction with teams and leagues -- had this brand-new toy with computer technology. So the explosion of more complex progressive graphics took place and when you combine that with a more tacit appeal to youth it makes for a perfect-storm moment regardless of team.” Across baseball several teams were going beyond the home whites and road grays and delving into alternate and third-color uniforms. The Tigers were holdouts. They’d tried different looks for batting practice jerseys for a few years. They had bright orange jerseys with blue lettering and numbers for batting practice on the road in 1993. “We looked like pumpkins” Trammell said. They also had blue jerseys for batting practice at home starting in 1994. Those didn’t have numbers on the front but they had orange white and blue striping on the top as well as the Tiger walking through the Olde English D on the front. “It was a mesh navy blue jersey” said Travis Fryman a Tigers infielder from 1990-97 “and we all loved them because they were so light and comfortable. The old polyester stuff in my day was not very comfortable.” The batting practice jerseys seemed to serve as inspiration for the game jersey to follow. No Radom didn’t design the jerseys but he chronicled them in his recent book ""Winning Ugly: A Visual History of the Most Bizarre Baseball Uniforms Ever Worn."" “As alternate jerseys go this one is not bad” Radom wrote “but it represents a strange departure from the Tigers’ tried-and-true uniform routine.”

Author and collector Bill Henderson addressed the Tigers' unique and hard-to-find alternate jersey in his book ""The Game Worn Guide to MLB Jerseys.""

It also came at a strange time for the club. The 1995 season began late as a result of the work stoppage that ended the previous season. The Tigers opened the 1995 campaign on the West Coast then returned home to boos for their home opener an 11-1 loss to Cleveland. Later that first homestand the Tigers introduced their first mascot PAWS. Into this stepped the new team president/CEO McHale whose family is steeped in Tigers history. His father a Detroit native played five seasons with the Tigers before serving as general manager in 1957-58. The younger McHale was also born in Detroit and joined the Tigers from the Rockies. Nobody needed to educate McHale about Tigers tradition. But likewise nobody had apparently told McHale about an alternate Tigers jersey in the works for Sunday home games. This combined for an interesting Sunday morning as the Tigers wrapped up their first homestand of the season. “It just didn’t look like the Tigers.” “I think it was right about or just after our pregame work had started” said McHale who now works with Major League Baseball. “I was in our office and I remember somebody came up to me and told me we were working out in [something] other than our home uniforms. This was completely the first word I had heard about this so I went down to the clubhouse to see what was going on.” McHale doesn’t remember who had let him know about the jersey switch. It could have been manager Sparky Anderson who was as surprised as McHale when the jerseys were waiting for his players in the clubhouse. It could have been a reporter who noticed the jerseys hanging in the clubhouse that morning. It could have been Jim Price then an analyst for Tigers games on television.

“If I remember right the jerseys were blue with a different D” McHale recalled. “But most shocking to me was the pants were pinstriped.” Yes pinstriped pants. “That was something to me that was not Detroit Tigers” McHale said. “This was my first homestand as the president of the Tigers. I talked to Sparky for a few brief moments. I talked to a couple players and it struck me that this was probably not the way I saw us presenting ourselves to our fans. It just didn't look like the Tigers to me.” While players from that club have some memory of the uniforms memory of the backstory was blurry. The opinion of the gear however was pretty clear. “I vaguely remember it looked a little goofy” said Buddy Groom the Tigers’ starting pitcher that day. “I think it had a goofy tiger on the left chest and a lot of orange on it. Sparky was old school and said 'This doesn't fit for home.'” After checking with owner Mike Ilitch McHale agreed. Still for one game they dressed in blue. The pinstriped pants at least were a no-go.

I vaguely remember it looked a little goofy. Tigers starting pitcher Buddy Groom

However quickly the Tigers lost the blue jerseys they also lost the game a 12-1 defeat to the Red Sox to complete a series sweep. Meanwhile the Detroit Red Wings opened their Stanley Cup playoff run that day down the street at Joe Louis Arena relegating the Tigers to the back pages of the papers with no mention of the jersey. The fan reaction however was less than enthusiastic. “It didn't go over very well” Trammell said. “The Olde English D it’s been there forever and we don’t want to change.” “It’s a little too busy.” Longtime clubhouse manager Jim Schmakel saves every style of jersey the Tigers wear from their traditional uniforms to special events to throwbacks. But he didn’t save the blue ones. “I never saw them again” McHale said. “I don't know what happened. There didn't seem to be an enormous amount of affection to them.” “They might have burned them” Price joked. What happened to them after that game is a mystery. But somehow they ended up in the wild.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbm9sYW53cml0aW4uY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDYvdG9wLTEwLXRleGFzLXJhbmdlcnMtcGxheWVycy1kdW5uaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Texas Rangers players right now: #10 Dane Dunning,"Texas Rangers Dane Dunning was nasty.

After working as a personal trainer and later in the security department at Encore Boston Harbor casino in Everett Bucci realized her lifelong dream of becoming a trooper when she graduated from the State Police Academy in May 2020.

“Tamar was beaming with pride as she celebrated this monumental occasion surrounded by family and friends” the obituary said. “This was the start of her greatest dream.”

Bucci’s career with the State Police began at the Leominster barracks before she transferred to the Brookfield barracks the obituary said. She joined the Medford barracks in February State Police said.

Two good Samaritans pulled Bucci from the wrecked cruiser Thursday night and a Stoneham police officer began CPR before she was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital where she was pronounced dead early Friday State Police said.

Bucci leaves her parents stepfather and several siblings the obituary said.

Bucci is the 22nd trooper in the department’s history to die in the line of duty State Police said.

“This angel number is about accomplishment on the highest level being encouraged to live your passion in order to serve as an inspiration to others to do the same. There is no one that could give this meaning as much justice as Tamar and there is no greater act of sacrifice than to give one’s life for another” the obituary said.

On Saturday hundreds of State Police troopers and first responders from various communities honored Bucci as her body was escorted in a solemn procession from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in the South End to Barile Funeral Home in Stoneham.

“We are grateful to the many members of the Boston Police Department Boston Fire Department and many other local police and fire departments who honored Trooper Bucci along the route from Boston to Stoneham. We were greatly moved by their presence” said David Procopio a State Police spokesman in an e-mail Saturday.

State Police Colonel Christopher Mason said last week that troopers are mourning the loss of their colleague.

“We are heartbroken by this tragedy and resolve to continue our mission to protect and serve by following the example set by Trooper Bucci in her brief MSP career and her life that was cut short far too soon” Mason said in a statement.

What Happened: In a litany of tweets on Friday Pal outlined his view that the likelihood of interest rate hikes is growing smaller by the day as the Fed and other central banks may be forced to take a more dovish economic stance to avoid a recession.

Pal told his over 900000 Twitter followers that “Europe is now in a hot mess.” Adding that he thinks there is a decent chance that Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) style handouts will be used to cover food and energy costs. “This could be a global thing. It was the new trick that the governments and CB’s learned in 2020” Pal said.

Where To Put Your Money: The founder of the crypto investment platform Real Vision said that in light of current macroeconomic conditions precious metals digital assets bonds and the US dollar are the best options for investors.

He added that the current global financial turmoil reminds him of March 2020 when most major financial markets collapsed before making strong V-shaped reversals.

When it comes to the current oil shortages resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine Pal said the ongoing energy and financial crisis may ultimately have a silver lining.

Pal has been a long-time crypto bull and recently revealed that while he's bullish on Bitcoin BTC/USD he has recently begun to favor Ethereum ETH/USD as his main crypto holding.

At the time of publication Bitcoin was trading at $38863.67 down 1.72% and Ethereum was priced at $2618.43 dropping 1.91% the declines occurring in a 24-hour period.

The retail giant has joined forces with several financial technology (fintech) startups with plans to create a “neobank” that will enable customers to manage money with lower fees.

Walmart announced in January 2020 a strategic partnership with fintech investment firm Ribbit Capital to develop and offer affordable financial solutions. Ribbit’s investment portfolio includes Credit Karma Affirm and Robinhood. Walmart hired two Goldman Sachs execs to head up the new fintech venture named Hazel.

Last month Walmart acquired the financial startup Even Responsible and One a digital banking alternative founded in 2019 by Brian Hamilton.

Pending regulatory approval all the startups will operate under the name ONE with Omer Ismail as CEO. The combined entity will have a workforce exceeding 200 people and have more than $250 million in cash on the balance sheet to advance growth according to the Walmart release on Jan. 26.

“Consumers everywhere are being left behind by the world of financial services” Ismail said. “Our vision is clear: build on Even and One’s success to offer a product that offers consumers the best way to spend the best way to access their wages and helps millions save and grow their money.”

Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner told analysts during the Feb. 18 earnings call that the fintech moves help consumers get paid early spend save borrow and grow their money as ONE seeks to develop a super app once the deals close in the first half of this year. The retailer said that the ONE app would be integrated inside Walmart’s physical and digital channels offering options to its 1.6 million U.S. employees and 100 million-plus weekly shoppers. As a standalone company and app Walmart said that one would be available directly to U.S. consumers and through partnerships with other leading employers and merchants.

Successful completion of trade marks another “first” for TW SEF

NEW YORK – June 2 2022 – Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW) a leading global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates credit equities and money markets today announced it has completed the first-ever fully electronic institutional Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) swaption trade. Goldman Sachs and Caisse de dépôt et de placement du Québec (CDPQ) were counterparties on the trade which was executed recently on the Tradeweb Swap Execution Facility (TW SEF). Since the completion of the inaugural trade 15 dealers are now providing swaptions pricing on TW SEF.

Following the acceleration of the global transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to SOFR at the end of 2021 Tradeweb introduced SOFR swaptions trading on the TW SEF platform to allow market participants a more efficient way to access market rates liquidity in SOFR. Swaptions traders now have the ability to harness the full power of the Tradeweb platform including Tradeweb’s request-for-quote (RFQ) tool to put multiple liquidity providers in competition and request-for-market (RFM) functionality to access two-way markets. In first quarter of 2022 52% of all SEF SOFR notional and 71% of dealer-to-client SOFR notional traded on TW SEF[1] making TW SEF the largest SEF for SOFR swaps. Since launching in 2013 more than $195 trillion in notional volume through more than 1.8 million trades has been executed on TW SEF.

Anshul Sehgal Co-Head of U.S. Interest Rate Products Trading at Goldman Sachs said: “We are pleased to have completed the first street-wide electronic SOFR swaption trade. We are focused on meeting our clients’ needs while being at the forefront of technological developments in the U.S. rates market including supporting the market’s transition to SOFR.”

Colm Murtagh Head of U.S. Institutional Rates at Tradeweb said: “Facilitating SOFR swaptions trading is yet another meaningful step forward in the electronification of markets demonstrating how non-linear swaps can also benefit from electronic execution and access to deeper pools of liquidity.”

A swaption (also known as a swap option) trade allows participants the ability to opt into an interest rate swap contract. Swaptions provide traders with optionality and control as they transact and hedge in the OTC market. Swaption trades represent an important and growing segment of the interest rates derivatives market.

Over the past 10 years alone Tradeweb has helped advance derivatives trading through a series of firsts in swaps and swaptions including: first fully electronic swap compression trade; first fully electronic two-way market swap; first fully electronic swaption trade; first fully electronic cleared inflation swap; first fully electronic multi-asset package trade; first fully electronic cross-currency swap; first fully electronic European invoice spread trade; and first fully electronic SOFR swap spread trade.

Located at 500 Main Street the collection of homes will range from studios up to two-bedroom accommodations including 119 affordable housing units.

The affordable units will be reserved for a mix of household incomes. A total of 20 units will be designated for households earning up to 50 percent Area Median Income (AMI). An additional 99 units will be available to households earning up to 60 percent of AMI.

Residents will have access to approximately 24000 square feet of amenity spaces including a fitness center a communal lounge a pool an outdoor roof deck and an on-site parking garage with electric vehicle charging stations and bicycle docks.

“We are thrilled to be celebrating this milestone alongside our project partners as we move one step closer to bringing 500 Main Street to fruition for the New Rochelle community” said Meredith Marshall co-founder & managing partner of BRP Companies. “Downtown New Rochelle is experiencing a major revitalization and we’re proud to play a part in one of the most significant economic development initiatives in the city’s history.

A $200 million construction loan was procured through a combination of both taxable and tax-exempt bonds issued by the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) Housing Finance Agency with credit enhancement via an equal amount of proceeds provided by Goldman Sachs and Merchants Bank of Indiana with Wells Fargo serving as the bond underwriter. Additionally HCR Goldman Sachs and Merchants Bank of Indiana provided a $25.4 million participation construction loan. Goldman Sachs will also be providing $40.7 million in equity and $20.7 million in LIHTC equity.

“The State’s investment in 500 Main Street is part of our ongoing efforts to expand the supply of safe and modern housing opportunities and deliver new economic activity to our downtown districts” said HCR commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas. “This truly transformative development will benefit the city for decades to come.”

Westchester County provided $5 million in grant funding and Interfaith Dwellings Corporation provided $2.5 million in low-interest rate debt. Permanent financing will be provided by a forward commitment from Merchants Capital via the Fannie Mae MTEB program.

Construction is slated to begin on the project in February 2022.

But the state Department of Transportation which is shaping a new regional transportation plan for the area says smaller projects that are among more than 200 ideas collected in the past year are likely to get going first perhaps in the next two or three years.

Pulaski Circle in downtown Hartford could be one of them. Vehicles traveling fast dump off I-91 into the traffic circle near Bushnell Park. Once there they converge with slower moving vehicles bicycles and pedestrians already struggling to navigate the confusing even dangerous area.

Motor vehicles wind through the Pulaski Circle in downtown Hartford.

Between 2017 and 2021 there were 121 crashes in Pulaski Circle 18 involving pedestrians with rear-end collisions accounting for more than half of incidents according to traffic statistics. Nearly 20% resulted in injuries.

Pulaski Circle could be helped by more signs to urge those exiting I-91 on what is known as the Whitehead Highway to slow down the planners say. What may ultimately be needed is a reconstruction into a modern roundabout or intersection with traffic lights they say.

The big projects are still critical but they can be a decade or more away according to Michael Morehouse vice president at Hartford-based FHI Studio an urban planning firm and a consultant on the regional planning effort.

“I think some people look at that and say ‘While that’s exciting it will never happen in my lifetime'” Morehouse said. The regional plan “is so comprehensive but it’s the short-term things that can address near-term needs that might not cost as much as some of these big projects.”

The regional transportation plan is being developed out of the Greater Hartford Mobility Study. The study launched in 2020 expanded beyond highways to include rail bus bicycle and pedestrians — and how they could connect and work together.

The study also seeks to promote the attractiveness and make more convenient traveling options that produce less carbon emissions which scientists say contribute to climate change.

The study takes into account evolving transportation needs with the COVID-19 pandemic for example leading to drastically altered commuting patterns as employers structure new hybrid workplaces split between home and office.

“We’re trying to think of the future and not just the way it was done in the past” said Casey R. Hardin transportation planning director at AECOM in Rocky Hill and a consultant on the state’s study.

Collaboration

The DOT has been collecting and prioritizing suggestions from the public planners and other experts. About 120 — Hartford’s Pulaski Circle among them — are advancing for more study with final recommendations expected at the end of this year. More options could still be added this year.

Lining up financing will be critical but the federal infrastructure funding approved this year by the U.S. Congress could provide an added boost said Kevin J. Burnham a DOT transportation engineer.

Collaboration with towns and cities also will be crucial to the plan’s success because the projects also are tied to economic development Burnham said.

Burnham said a major goal of the plan is to ensure that smaller projects remain usable even if the vision for larger ones change in the future.

The cost for the list of projects range from $1 million or less for the smaller projects to more than $100 million for major ones.

In Hartford Pulaski Circle is almost a forgotten gateway to downtown but it is poised to play a major role in surrounding development.

The historic former offices of the state attorney general will soon be converted to apartments part of the larger Bushnell South mixed-use development planned to replace parking lots immediately to the south.

The building at 55 Elm St. in downtown Hartford (right foreground) once served as office space for the state’s constitutional officers and work is expected to soon begin on a conversion to apartments. The historic building overlooks Pulaski Circle and Bushnell Park.

The iQuilt project which promotes a more walkable Hartford has targeted Pulaski Circle for more than a decade.

“It’s been a big gap in our pedestrian network in our bike network and frankly in our urban development network” Doug Suisman a Hartford native and lead planner for iQuilt said. “There are a lot of empty lots around it on corners. It’s kind of created a ‘no-anybody’s’ land around it. The opportunity is to totally flip that around and make it a vibrant corner.”

Suisman said iQuilt has long envisioned a roundabout there but it will be key to “tame” traffic coming off the highway as part of any plan.

“So it’s more like a city street farther back” Suisman said. “Right now it feels like a highway right through the circle.”

Here are six more short-term projects being considered for a final recommendation:

Aerial view of Goodwin University in East Hartford. Improvements along Ensign Street at upper left would better connect the university and its students to the town.

1. Strengthen connection between Goodwin University and East Hartford

Mode: Pedestrian/Bicycle/Bus

The Problem: Fast-growing Goodwin University and other educational institutions on Riverside Drive in East Hartford are isolated from adjacent neighborhoods. The Route 2 overpass above Ensign Street separates the two areas.

Goal: Build connections between the university and the town particularly along Ensign Street. Improvements would make it easier to navigate the area and it more attractive visually to reach restaurants bar and stores on the east side of Route 2.

Possible solution: Add amenities for bicycles along Riverside Drive Ensign Street and Main Street. Improvements would dovetail with what already exists on nearby Willow Street for bicyclists pedestrians and other “non-motorized” modes of transportation.

There is evidence of crashes on the barriers along I-91 in Coltsville south of downtown.

2. I-91 Curve Realignment near Coltsville in Hartford

Mode: Motor vehicle

The Problem: South of downtown Hartford a curve on I-91 south is one of the tightest curves among similar highways in the state. With a curve radius less than is needed for the posted speed limit there is an elevated crash rate.

Goal: Improve roadway safety by addressing the arc of the curve and reduce back-ups tied to crashes.

Possible Solutions: Change striping along curve or add more signs to encourage motorist to slow down in the area. Longer-term the curve may need to be reconstructed tricky and more costly because the curve is raised above the ground.

Increased bus service is needed beyond the 9-to-5 workday.

3. Improve Evening Bus Service

Mode: Bus

The Problem: Bus routes offer limited hours or less frequent service later in the evening not matching the schedules of many workers who do not work 9-to-5. This population of workers tends to have lower incomes and less vehicle ownership.

Goal: Increase length and frequency of evening service focusing on routes that connect the region’s transit centers to areas of high transportation needs.

Possible Solution: Adjust schedules to increase span and frequency of service. More buses and drivers may be needed. Partnerships with ride-sharing services or employer-provided micro transit or shuttle services are a short-term alternative.

More bicycle amenities in and around the rail station in Windsor could ease need for vehicle parking and encourage use of rail service.

4. Improve Bicycle Network Around Rail Station in Windsor

Mode: Bicycle

The problem: Rail and bus transportation hubs such as the one in Windsor cater to vehicles and pedestrians but not bicyclists.

Goal: Encourage more use of bicycles to reach the rail station boost use of public transportation and ease vehicle parking demand.

Possible Solution: Add on- and off-street bicycle amenities to connect station with surrounding neighborhoods. These would include bicycle lanes “buffered” bicycle lanes or other paths.

A southbound train out of Springfield in 2018 rips through banner at Hartford’s Union Station marking inaugural run of Hartford Line service from Springfield to New Haven.

5. Further Upgrade the Hartford Line

Mode: Rail

The Problem: The Hartford Line lacks “double tracking” in key locations limiting the number and frequency of trains particularly north of Hartford. Planned station improvements also would encourage more ridership.

Goal: Increase use and frequency of Hartford Line service.

Possible Solution: Planning and environmental reviews have been completed for the improvements.

A lack of sidewalks crosswalks and other pedestrian amenities discourages bus use in Wethersfield and other communities in greater Hartford.

6. Improve pedestrian amenities around bus stops along Charter Road in Wethersfield

Mode: Pedestrian/Bus

The Problem: Wethersfield’s Charter Road is just one example of a bus route where there are no sidewalks or crosswalks near a bus stop. The lack of those amenities discourages bus ridership.

Goal: Improve amenities around bus stops to encourage more use of buses.

Possible solution: Add sidewalks pedestrian ramps and crosswalks.

The Spartans got out to a 15-13 lead after one quarter behind a nine-point effort from their leading scorer Zach Philipkoski who finished the night with 32 points.

“We came in since the beginning we were the number one seed” Philipkoski said. “We already had a target on our back so we just had to come out and execute.”

In the second quarter the Atoms outscored the Spartans 14-11 to take a 27-26 lead into halftime.

“SAS – they probably should've been a two seed and not a 10 seed” New Hartford Head Coach John Randall said. “That’s a talented team. They gave us all we could possibly handle.”

In the third quarter Syracuse Academy of Science continued to bring it to the Spartans. Steyvon Jones scored 9 of his game-high 34 points in the quarter to help the Atoms extend their lead to 42-40 heading into the final quarter.

One of the focus points for New Hartford was to stop SAS from going on their big runs to put the game away. Coach Randall believes his team was able to neutralize that part of the Atoms’ game.

“You always feel you could do better but I thought we did a good job of not letting the 8-0 run happen” Coach Randall said. “There were [sic] a couple of 4-0 runs maybe even one 6-0 run but the barrage really never happened.”

In the fourth quarter both teams battled back and forth until the final whistle blew. New Hartford grabbed the lead multiple times down the stretch but SAS continued to answer back.

With 23 seconds left Philipkoski made one of two from the foul line to extend the Spartan lead to 56-53.

With the season on the line Jones banked in a three-pointer for the Atoms. With the game tied at 56 New Hartford's last second heave was no good and the game headed to overtime.

Late in the fourth quarter Philipkoski suffered a shoulder injury and played through it for the remainder of the game.

“You don't understand how much pain that kid's in right now” Coach Randall said about Philipkoski after the win. “I mean he gutted it out for us when I don't know if most would’ve.”

In the overtime period Philipkoski grabbed a late rebound and scored two big free throws to ice the game.

Prior to his free throws it was New Hartford’s supporting cast that got the job done. Colton Suriano found Connor Karwowski for an open layup to score the go-ahead basket.

“That’s been the story of this group” Randall said. “The unselfishness – Suriano could have put his head down like a bull and went to the basket; had his head up found Karwowski and he laid it in.”

Karwowski’s game winning layup came after two of his previous layups were blocked by SAS defenders.

“You don’t think about that that’s nothing” Karwowski said of responding after having his previous shots blocked. “It’s the same as any other layup no different.""

The Spartans improve to 21-2 on the season after winning the team's first section championship since 2007. They will play Section X's Malone in a regional playoff game at Cicero-North Syracuse High School 6 p.m. March 9.

By Ronni Newton

Three first-place finishes and broken meet and school records highlighted the impact Conard and Hall made at the New England Interscholastic Indoor Track & Field Championship on Saturday as more than a dozen athletes from West Hartford came home with medals and All-New England honors.

“It was a huge day for West Hartford at New Englands today” Hall High School boys coach Jeff Billing said regarding the meet which returned to the Reggie Lewis Athletic Center in Boston this year after being canceled in 2021 due to COVID-19.

Conard junior Audrey Kirkutis had tied the Class LL meet record with a 5-foot-6-inch high jump that earned her the gold medal at the state divisional championship held Feb. 11 2022 at the Floyd Little Athletic Center in New Haven. But at the State Open held at the same facility on Feb. 19 she placed third with a jump of 5-feet-2-inches.

Seeded seventh based on her State Open jump Kirkutis was back in top form Saturday successfully clearing 5-feet-5-inches before initially failing to make the 5-feet-7-inch jump.

She ended up in an exciting jump-off with two other athletes who had also cleared the 5-feet-5-inch mark on their first try according to Conard assistant indoor track and field and jumpers coach Matt Redman. In the jump-off Kirkutis was the only one to clear the 5-feet-7-inch bar earning the top spot on the podium as New England champion.

Conard’s Gavin Sherry (State Open and Class L winner in 2022) seeded first in the 2-mile race not only won but also set a new meet record crossing the finish line in 8:51.59. His twin brother Callum Sherry (third place in State Open second place in Class L) finished third in 9:01.34 his PR with Framingham MA runner Sam Burgess capturing second. The Sherrys who are seniors will both run at Stanford next year.

The other first-place West Hartford finish belonged to the four members of the Hall High School 4×400 relay team. The 3:23.84 time by the team of Jonathan York Sean McDaniel Toby Ruffo and Sam Sandler was almost four seconds faster than the second place Greenwich team (3:27.33).

Other highlights include a second-place finish by Hall’s 4×200 relay team (York Sandler Thomas Nash and Charlie Cameron) in 1:31.82 which Billing said set a new school record by more than a second.

Other notable performances included:

Hall’s Kate Sanderson earned All New England Honors with a third-place finish in the 2-mile in 11:02.14

The Conard boys 4×800 relay (Gavin Sherry Nicolas Martin Grant Walters Callum Sherry) came in fifth 8:03.42

Ruffo’s sixth place finish in the 600 (1:22.99) broke a Hall school record previously held by Miller Anderson

York finished sixth in the 300 (35.86)

Hall’s 4×800 relay (Colin Goldschmidt Nathanial Aronson Jamie Rendon McDaniel) team’s time of 8:05.51 was a season-best finish.

“There were only 13 boy and 13 girl events competed. That’s a lot of hardware from one town” Billing said.

Dall scheduled teams from all across the state and from different classes to make sure his team was ready for what could be another challenging postseason run.

“Battle-tested” Dall said.

The Wolverines were indeed tested and ready for a big battle Saturday. Dike-New Hartford repeated as the Class 2A champions with a 59-52 victory over Central Lyon in the finals of the girls state basketball tournament at Wells Fargo Arena Saturday night. The Wolverines finished the season with a 24-2 mark and another state championship.

“We played a lot of state teams that are here” Dall said. “We got beat a couple of times but we learned from it.""

It showed Saturday when the Wolverines found themselves in another scrap. Saturday's final included seven ties and 14 lead changes. The two teams were even tied 32-32 at halftime. By the time the fourth quarter rolled around Dike-New Hartford was clinging to a three point lead.

It didn’t last. Central Lyon tied the game on a 3-pointer by Addison Klosterbuer. But Dike-New Hartford reclaimed the lead on a jumper by Ellary Knock with 6 minutes and 21 seconds left. The Wolverines never looked back. They used a 6-0 run later in the quarter to build up a 58-50 lead that was too much for Central Lyon to overcome.

“We were in it the whole time before that” said Klosterbuer who finished with a team-high 19 points.

But Dall believes his team’s experience in the state tournament from a season ago and their challenging schedule this season made them ready for Saturday's challenge. Their regular season which had just two losses included a showdown with 1A powerhouse Bishop Garrigan.

Dall insisted the goal wasn’t to go undefeated this season. But to get better.

And get ready.

“If you look at our schedule you’ll see that it’s pretty tough” Dall said.

Payton Petersen who scored the first six points of the game finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds for Dike-New Hartford. Her twin sister Jadyn Petersen finished with 15 points and 12 rebounds. The Wolverines needed all of them.

“I was honestly getting tired but I knew I had to do it for my teammates do it for my coaches do it for everyone that’s helped me in the past how many years” Payton Petersen said.

Central Lyon finished the season with a 24-2 record. So did Dike-New Hartford which can now set its sights on a three-peat in 2022-23. Four are also in play for the Petersen sisters who are both sophomores.

But Payton Petersen said she's not worrying about that quite yet.

""Definitely not"" she said with a smile.

Recently Chris Cocks took the helm as Hasbro's (NASDAQ:HAS) CEO after its former head tragically died in late 2021. Cocks will have his work cut out for him: The stock for the toy and entertainment company has been essentially flat over the past five years. But his background suggests a possible move toward a more lucrative direction.

Who is Hasbro's new CEO?

Hasbro is arguably most known for its toys and legacy tabletop games like Clue Connect Four and Monopoly. However its new-age gaming division Wizards of the Coast best known for publishing fantasy and science fiction trading cards and tabletop games like Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons has become its growth driver. Cocks has been President and COO of Wizards of the Coast for the past five years helping revenue from that division double to more than $1 billion and played an integral part in building out its lucrative digital gaming division. For comparison Hasbro's total revenue only grew about 28% in the same time period from $5.02 billion in 2016 to $6.42 billion in 2021.

Under Cook's watch Wizards of the Coast's began to transform its tentpole franchises Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons into video games. While Hasbro doesn't break out exact figures within Wizards of the Coast it highlighted that revenue for its digital gaming segment was up 36% year over year. Perhaps more importantly those games appear to be gaining traction; management recently stated that its latest video game release Magic: The Gathering Arena has created a sustained boost of 50% in its monthly active users for mobile.

Cocks will most likely try to unlock Hasbro's 99 years of intellectual property history as the company's digital games segment has only scratched the surface with its releases to date. Among other properties Hasbro may look to tap into its popular G.I. Joe and Transformers franchises; a big-budget digital game based on the former is currently in development. Other investors are noticing Wizards of the Coast's potential too as an activist investor recently called on Hasbro to spinoff its gaming segment as a way to unlock value. While Hasbro has acknowledged that call the company has no plans to spinoff its fastest-growing segment.

A recent acquisition changes the game

In addition to its digital gaming segment Hasbro is expanding its entertainment segment through its recent acquisition of EntertainmentOne. The company has begun transitioning from licensing its IP for television and movies to in-house production. And similar to its gaming segment Hasbro is leveraging its IP to grow its entertainment business -- its 2021 films and TV shows included Clifford: the Big Red Dog My Little Pony and Peppa Pig. As a result the company's entertainment segment produced record revenue of nearly $1 billion in 2021 representing 24% growth from 2020 and 276% growth from 2016.

Even as Hasbro invests more in producing television and movies -- a key component in the strategy that management calls ""Brand Blueprint"" which it believes will lead to better toy sales -- entertainment can be more cyclical than other segments. While the studio will continue to produce and release films and television shows in 2022 the real potential may not come until 2023 with the release of big-budget blockbusters like Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Dungeons and Dragons.

Sorry! The turnaround may take a while

As Hasbro's gaming and entertainment divisions take time to develop the company faces challenges to its legacy consumer product segment which accounted for $3.98 billion in revenue for 2021 or roughly 62% of its total revenue. Most notably Hasbro will lose its license for Disney princess toys to rival Mattel in 2023. On its most recent earnings call management said those toys attributed an average of $250 million in revenue each year or roughly 4% of its total revenue. Still Hasbro recently expanded its licensing relationship with Disney for Star Wars and added Indiana Jones ahead of the fifth film's release in 2023. Additionally management continues to develop consumer partnerships with Fortnite and Roblox suggesting that Hasbro's toy segment will continue to live or die by its licensing deals.

Moreover like many consumer goods companies Hasbro is dealing with constrained supply chains. The company has navigated those challenges better than others by utilizing alternate ports in China and the U.S. and expanding its shipping capacity with air freight. The extra costs showed up in Hasbro's fourth-quarter earnings report: Operating profit for its consumer products only rose 2.9% year over year while revenue grew 9.4%. Management stated it would increase prices in the second quarter of this year to combat the continued supply chain issues.

Is it time to buy Hasbro stock?

Hasbro simply hasn't rewarded its shareholders over the past five years. However the company's new plan to develop its digital games movies and television shows from its historic catalog of IP could change that. Look to see if the company announces more digital games and entertainment projects this year and monitor revenue growth from existing ones. If Hasbro's new leadership can execute this change in strategy then the stock may finally get out of jail and pass ""Go.""

Just as we all got used to $22.99 as the new price point $24.99 became the new normal. Unless it’s for Boba Fett or any character wearing Boba Fett’s armor in which case $31.99 is the excessive-seeming tab. So for some collectors who feel more and more priced out the robed Boba Fett (Tython) and Fennec Shand may feel like the last reasonable purchases at the $22.99 mark still. If you can find them that is. Entertainment Earth currently lists preorders with expected April delivery. (Superhero Hype is an affiliate partner with Entertainmenet Earth and may earn fees based on site links.) Superhero Hype obtained these figures via members-only Hasbro Pulse “Back in Stock” sale.

Also for now Fennec Shand is the only official The Book of Boba Fett 6-inch figure with more slated to follow sometime in…January. This happens when Lucasfilm refuses to share even the most minor “spoiler” material with licensors. The Tython Boba Fett comes from The Mandalorian officially though it’s easy to imagine some tweaks to make him Tatooine Boba Fett.

Regardless of anyone’s opinion of his solo TV show most Star Wars fans felt pumped when the post-Sarlacc Boba Fett returned to beat up Stormtroopers and assist Din Djarin. And this figure became most-wanted ever since. It’s mostly worth the wait though it features a couple of misguided elements. First: the hood design only works if he wears it down. If it goes up it looks ridiculous and way too high.

So find a way to roll it back for any display or it just defies gravity like that.

The other slight misfire is the white paint on his face. It doesn’t look like the acid scarring on the show; more like a bit of Uruk-hai war paint haphazardly applied. That’s not necessarily a bad look for Boba but it’s inaccurate.

Those decisions aside. it’s a generous figure. He includes a bandolier belt and sash with holster under the fabric cloak and three weapons. The Gaffi stick has a string attached to sling over his shoulder while the sniper rifle’s attached to an adjustable plastic strap. Finally a pistol fits in his holster. There’s detail aplenty under his robe.

But with the robe covering so much Hasbro had a good opportunity to add articulation. Alas they did not take it. Star Wars seems to have abandoned the double-hinge elbow and knee in favor of disc-and-pin ball joints. The pinless look = awesome. The range of motion? Not so much.

The neck does include ball joints at both ends. If the lower one’s stiff at first just work it. The arms would work better with more articulation.

The detail level remains great. The shoes clearly bear the linework of Boba’s original trilogy footwear while the folds and creases in his clothing give excellent texture. Temuera Morrison’s likeness stays up to date and looks extra-lifelike compared to some older versions.

Fennec comes in her fully black outfit which nicely distinguishes between matte and shiny parts with orange highlights to match her hair braids and fox-themed name. The masked helmet slips on and off with ease though you might need to manually open up the eye slit after putting it on. This beats the currently tedious head-swap option most companies use for headgear. And the plastic rifle strap is twisted to fit the shape of her torso already.

Note the different “fabric” texture detail. It’s some serious micro sculpting extremely well done. What she’s missing is a removable stomach plate to show her cyborg mods. No doubt a future Fennec will remedy that.

The likeness is decent although trying to replicate realistic scars in smaller size is tough without throwing the look off a bit. The hair braid sits nicely in one pose and may look “floaty” at more drastic angles.

Thinking about a custom Marvel Agent May? She might look a touch too short. Maybe a head-swap on the right body though….

Fennec is fine with the articulation she has which also includes a double neck-ball. With no robes to hide joints the pinless ones work to get her gun in the right poses which is the main requirement.

No doubt this won’t be the last we see of her in figure form. But it will be the cheapest in this scale.

Take a look through the gallery below for more poses and close-ups.

Will these figures make the cut for you? Let us know in comments!

Top Trumps USA and Hasbro recently released a Texas Hill Country Edition of Monopoly which includes familiar places such as the Guadalupe River Gruene Hall and the Hays County Food Bank.

Serving as the Mermaid Capital of Texas the city is represented in the game by the Mermaid Society SMTX logo located on a Community Chest card within the board game.

“You know I’m really excited about any opportunity that features San Marcos in such a positive way” said July Moreno executive director of Mermaid Society SMTX. “All Texans can recognize that we are the Mermaid Capital of Texas.”

Moreno explained that Mermaid Society was first approached to be a part of the game several months ago as the game company sought after unique places and features that make up the Texas Hill Country.

“As a Texan I’m incredibly excited to present this edition” said Katie Hubbard Sales Executive Top Trumps USA Inc. “There was so much I didn’t know about my own backyard. I learned so much about the rich history culture and natural beauty the Hill Country has to offer. So many families have lived here for generations and their deep roots are evident in the way they show love for their communities and each other. I can’t wait for more people to discover what makes the Hill Country so unique and wonderful just like I did.”

Not only did Moreno express her excitement regarding the representation of the City of San Marcos but also how the game piece goes along with the purpose of Mermaid Society SMTX.

“What we represent which is about community I love the fact that we got the Community Chest card. So that really it really just kind of brings it home” Moreno said.

The Texas Hill Country Edition of Monopoly was officially launched on Wednesday March 2 at the Hoffman Haus in Fredericksburg TX.

According to a statement by Top Trumps USA “Texas Hill Country Monopoly is available at local and online retailers including Fredericksburg General Store Biedermann’s Ace HardwareFischer & Wieser Specialty Foods Das Peach Haus J. Forks Designs and The Dienger Trading Co. The game retails for $39.99.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL2RpZ2l0YWwvdHJhbnNmb3JtZXJzLWJhdHRsZS1hdXRvYm90LWNpdHktcmVjcmVhdGVkLXN0b3AtbW90aW9uLWFuaW1hdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transformers' Battle for Autobot City recreated with stop motion animation,"The Transformers: The Movie from 1986 will always hold a special place in the hearts of TF fans for its iconic '80s soundtrack and introduction of Unicron and Galvatron.

It is part two of an expected four-part series.

New research which includes powerful testimonies from nurses has revealed ‘shocking and systemic’ levels of racism in the profession.

The study led by Sheffield Hallam University involved more than 350 Black and ethnic minority nurses midwives and healthcare staff across the UK sharing their experiences of racism through the pandemic and during their working lives.

Researchers found that 77% of healthcare staff who challenged racism said they had not been treated fairly. While 59% said they had experienced racism during their working lives that was so bad it made it difficult for them to do their job.

Over half (53%) said they had experienced unfair treatment in the pandemic in relation to Covid deployment PPE or risk assessment. The same number said they had poorer mental health as result of racism at work.

The Nursing Narratives project research funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council includes around 50 interviews with Black and brown healthcare staff.

Of those interviews 19 have spoken about their experiences on film to create a resource of extended documentary testimonies which aims to help ‘build a collective voice’.

What the nurses said in those testimonies was incredibly powerful.

Estephanie Dunn is the regional director of the Royal College of Nurses in the North West and was a participant in the study. She has a lifelong background in nursing spanning the independent sector and NHS.

‘I joined nursing when I was 18’ Estephanie tells Metro.co.uk. ‘Joining the profession at such a young age I thought people would be more understanding more caring about the people they worked alongside and the people they cared for.’

Instead over the years Estephanie has witnessed Black and ethnic minority staff verbally and physically abused by patients a lack of support from management and racist attitudes from white members of staff.

In her role as a senior director Estaphanie says she spends a lot of time supporting ethnic minority staff through horrific experiences of racism harassment and abuse.

‘I have seen the mental health trauma that they have experienced as a result of the verbal emotional and physical abuse they experience while working’ says Estephanie.

‘It is so corrosive and it reduces their professional confidence their personal confidence. And they are fearful for their safety.

‘When a member of the public who comes in to visit a relative says to the nurse “Why don’t you go back to where you come from? I’ll go home and get my gun and come back and shoot you.” How do you carry on working that day? How do you walk across the car park or wait for your bus to go home?

‘I’m not saying things like this are an everyday occurrence. But when it happens it is hugely significant.’

Estephanie says the hardest part is knowing that these incidences of racism are witnessed by many people and yet too few are willing to call it out.

‘There are white people – patients and staff – who have stood up and reported and challenged on behalf of what they have seen or heard a member of staff have to experience. But there aren’t enough of them’ she says.

‘I think it’s incumbent on all of us to stand up in those situations. When you’re in a position where you can speak up with confidence you have a duty to do so.’

Racism and the pandemic

In the first month of the UK lockdown 72% of the NHS and social care staff who died were from Black and ethnic minority backgrounds.

This report concludes that racism and the unequal treatment of ethnic minority staff was a direct cause of the disproportional deaths.

Staff report that ethnic minority nurses were disproportionately sent to work in the most dangerous epicentres for Covid during the pandemic.

The study authors wrote: ‘Discrimination in allocation to high-risk environments must be understood as conscious decision-making and not an oversight. There were examples of pressure threats and coercion.’

They continue: ‘Some staff did raise concerns collectively with success. However it is clear that even after questions about risks to Black and Brown staff were raised publicly they were still often placed in areas of high risk.’

One Fillipino nurse said: ‘We were chosen to be exposed.’

The report also found issues of inequality with PPE. Nurses spoke of PPE being hidden by managers and handed out to individuals through preference ‘the preferred nurses usually being white’ read the findings.

Researchers also found evidence that many were denied appropriate PPE and allocated only surgical masks even when allocated to Covid wards.

Neomi Bennett a Black agency nurse described: ‘I was not given protection. I’d asked for… like a proper filtered mask and I was told I can’t have it because I will scare people.’

The impact of racism on nurses

More than a third of the study participants (33.4%) said they had been forced to take sick leave as a result of racism while 36% had actually left a job as a result of racism.

The report authors wrote: ‘Black and Brown staff repeatedly spoke about trying to prove that they weren’t lazy.

‘An HCA [healthcare assistant] reflected “they rarely trust that Black people can do things as well as white people”. Such perceptions have led to over scrutiny and victimisation severely impacting mental and physical health.

‘It has led to resignations electing to work as agency nurses leaving the NHS and in one instance leaving healthcare altogether.’

The conclusions of the study ‘This study clearly shows despite the series of initiatives to address inequalities the culture of the NHS fundamentally remains systemically racist. This put Black and Brown staff at greater risk during the pandemic leading to disproportionate impact and loss of life. ‘Therefore a radical shift in the institutional approach is needed to change the underlying narratives and dismantle the racialised structures that create an environment and tolerance for racialised inequalities which cause harm.’ Nursing Narratives project research

What needs to change?

As part of the study researchers called on the participants to help create a ‘manifesto for change’ with actionable points for the NHS universities and practitioners and government and regulators.

Here are the points the manifesto calls on the NHS to change:

Implement a zero-tolerance to racism policy and practice. Stop putting Black and Brown staff in danger of death and psychological harm. Build a more compassionate NHS with respect and equity for Black and Brown

workers. Remove whiteness as the benchmark in training and organisational culture Build an NHS with equality at the core of health provision for all ethnicities. Create clear and real consequences for racist actions including dismissal

legal action and referral to regulatory bodies. Create a fair and transparent recruitment process including all internal

opportunities. End the exploitation of Black and Brown workers – delegate work equitably.

An NHS spokesperson said: ‘There is never an excuse for racism or any form of discrimination and it should not be tolerated by anyone including our hard working and dedicated NHS staff.

‘While our latest equality report shows that we have made progress delivering a zero-tolerance approach to all and any form of discrimination it is undeniable there is significant room for improvement and we will continue to support NHS organisations to create real and sustainable change in race equality.’

HSY,Hershey's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vYWxsdGhhdHNpbnRlcmVzdGluZy5jb20vbWlsdG9uLWhlcnNoZXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Milton Hershey The Man Who Built A Chocolate Empire,"Soon after Milton S. Hershey established the Hershey Chocolate Company in 1894 he began giving back by sharing profits with his employees and founded a school for orphans that still exists today.

Milton Hershey was an industrialist of the sweetest kind. Born surrounded by dairy farms in central Pennsylvania he made a fortune by figuring out a way to mass produce milk chocolate at a time when such confections were a luxury good made in secret by the Germans and Swiss.

A confectioner’s apprentice in his youth Hershey quickly realized he wanted to be his own boss. He started two short-lived candy companies in the late 19th century and didn’t waver as they shuttered. Finally his third attempt spurred a thriving caramel company that he quickly sold off determined to focus on chocolates. To this day Hershey’s original factory still churns out billions of chocolate treats each year.

But Milton Hershey was also a progressive philanthropist funding transportation projects medical centers schools and charities. And because he and his wife could not have children he founded a school for local orphans which still operates today as the the Milton Hershey School and serves low income families in Pennsylvania. His astonishing legacy of giving back to his community has thus remained strong for more than a century.

Milton Hershey’s First Business Ventures

Born on Sept. 13 1857 in Derry Township Pennsylvania Milton Snavely Hershey grew up speaking Pennsylvania Dutch. His parents were Mennonite farmers of Swiss and German descent and instilled a discipline in Hershey that he would carry into adulthood. His sister was born in 1862 but tragically died four years later.

As an underage farmhand Hershey received little to no schooling after the fourth grade. He was only 14 years old when he apprenticed for a German-English newspaper and found no joy in the profession. While his father was enraged when Hershey was fired his mother suggested he try his hand as a confectioner.

Hershey studied the making of candy and ice cream under Joseph Royer in Lancaster Pennsylvania for four years before he ventured out to start his own business. And in 1876 he moved to Philadelphia just in time for America’s first World’s Fair. Hershey hoped the influx of tourists would lead his shop to succeed.

Despite financial aid from his mother and aunt Milton Hershey’s first business venture was an irredeemable failure. It went bankrupt in 1882 but would only motivate Hershey to forge ahead. Advised by his father to move to Denver Colorado Hershey arrived to find the city in the middle of an economic depression. Rather than start a new business he found work.

It was here that Hershey learned the value of making caramel with fresh milk. He set out yet again in 1883 to start his second confectionary in New York City. Although initially a success the business was brought down by cash flow issues and police seized his candy-making equipment after he defaulted on a debt.

By 1886 Milton Hershey was nearly bankrupt. And he used the last of his money to take the train back to Lancaster where those who knew him deemed him a failure.

How Milton Hershey Learned To Make Chocolate

In Lancaster a string of good fortune finally befell 29-year-old Milton Hershey. As Hershey tinkered with an old co-worker his aunt and his mother he eventually created a new type of caramel that he called “Crystal A.”

This caramel was made by mixing in fresh milk and Hershey went around selling it to anyone who would listen promising that it would “melt in your mouth.” Soon a British candy importer became so smitten with the product that he requested a wholesale order.

Hershey secured a loan from the Lancaster National Bank and purchased all the raw materials he needed to found the Lancaster Caramel Company. Opening in 1886 it sold caramels made with fresh milk to customers buying in bulk. It was such a success that Hershey employed 1300 workers in two factories by the 1890s.

With liquid cash in his pockets for the first time ever Milton Hershey treated himself to luxurious travel visiting Mexico Europe the United Kingdom and Egypt. He gambled in Monte Carlo and kissed the Blarney Stone in Ireland. And in 1898 he married Catherine Sweeney an Irish American New Yorker who would profoundly shape his future philanthropy.

But he also made an auspicious trip to the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1892 where he saw and bought chocolate making machinery from Germany. Until this point Hershey had only ever used chocolate as decorative coatings on his caramels. But now he was pondering a serious transition.

And in 1900 Milton Hershey sold the Lancaster Caramel Company for $1 million forfeiting the rights to “Crystal A” and all his caramel factories. But he shrewdly retained the rights for his chocolate recipes.

With the money from the sale he founded the Hershey Chocolate Company and bought land in Derry Township where he knew dairy farms were in strong supply. He broke ground on his new factory in 1903. Within two years of the factory’s completion in 1905 the Hershey Kiss hit the market.

The Lasting Legacy Of A Generous Philanthropist

With money to spare Milton Hershey and his wife began pondering how they should spend it since they could have no children who might inherit their wealth. So in 1909 they opened the Hershey Industrial School for orphaned boys in 1909 which still operates today as the co-educational Milton Hershey School.

While the Hersheys narrowly avoided sinking aboard the Titanic in 1912 after they decided at the last minute not to board Catherine died of pneumonia in 1915. Milton Hershey buried himself in work and was now producing the first nationally marketed chocolate in America and over 100 different varieties.

With business booming he began pondering building his farmland into a town. Intended to house workers and staff the town of Hershey Pennsylvania was designed by engineer Henry N. Herr.

Herr turned the Derry Township land into a booming company town with a bank hotel public school churches parks golf courses and a zoo. Herr even implemented a trolley system that led into Hershey from nearby towns. Today Hershey has a population of 14000.

After three years as a widower Milton Hershey transferred $60 million of his company shares to the Hershey Trust that funded the industrial school he had founded with his late wife. He launched construction projects in his town during the Great Depression to keep his residents afloat and never stopped giving.

He supported America’s war efforts against the Nazis in World War II by supplying the armed forces with chocolate bars that he formulated specially not to melt in the hand. Hershey was too old to fight but knew financial power could be wielded for good.

From the Milton Hershey School that annually educated 1900 students today to the M.S. Hershey Foundation which supports cultural activities in Hershey the philanthropist died a generous millionaire on Oct. 13 1945. While he himself is long gone his work proliferates throughout the globe.

From Twizzlers and Reese’s to Cadbury and Almond Joys untold millions of children have cherished the man responsible without realizing what he endured to get there.

The Iditarod is an annual race from Anchorage to Nome Alaska where teams of mushers and 12-16 dogs each travel over mountain ranges tundra and all the environments the nearly 1000 mile race offers according to Iditarod.com.

This race is in honor of the 20 mushers and their dogs who endured harsh conditions to deliver diphtheria antitoxin to Nome in 1925.

In the spirit of learning about the Iditarod Kimberly Fallon the IDEA teacher at Hershey Elementary and facilitator for these STEM-based lessons utilized block coding to teach about both STEM and the Iditarod.

Through utilization of a smart phone application students were able to program their own robot to make its way through the paper replica of the Iditarod trail.

""This was the culmination of everything we've been doing up to this point"" Fallon said. ""which was first coding using the block-based programming to maneuver the robot. And then it was also kind of learning information about the Iditarod dogsled race.

""So in spirit of the Iditarod... (the students) did some research on sled-dogs they picked the dog they thought would best lead their team – that was (a picture of the dog) on a cup – and the cup was powered by the robot. So then the students created a program and then they used that block-based coding to maneuver through the path.""

In order to successfully navigate the Sphero robots through the mock-Iditarod route the students had to properly use proper programming heading speed and duration to get the robot to move and turn when it was appropriate.

STEM-based lessons especially when combined with historical and modern events can provide students the skills they need to navigate the constantly developing technologically-based world we live in according to Fallon.

""The skills that they learn by doing this are universal"" Fallon said. ""The problem solving the collaboration... I mean I'm really impressed with each group how they're really sharing the responsibilities. They're communicating. These are the 21st century skills that we're really looking for.

""...these are skills that no matter what you do in your educational professional career those are essential skills. And those are really skills that employers are looking for. So I really think this is setting a good foundation for students going forward.""

Since its inception in 2009 a slew of Napa Valley hotels have opted into the Clean the World program donating thousands of pounds of soap and hygiene products to be sanitized and repurposed across the globe in areas where soap is hard to come by.

“It is not just soap; it's also the little containers that you get — the lotions conditioners shampoo … We collect all of those as well” said Charee Dion director of sales for Hilton Garden Inn Napa.

Hilton Garden Inn Napa officially joined the program in 2019 about three years after the Hilton brand hopped on board and Dion says the housekeeping staff have not only gotten used to collecting guests’ un-finished soap but they actually appreciate it.

“The ladies are really really excited about this program” she said. “Many of us come from developing countries. I'm Filipino and we are very aware that it's still struggling in many parts of the country as well as in Mexico or any other place. So I think us being from a different culture knowing that we can give back somehow is really motivating and it's inspiring to all of our team members.”

To date the Hilton Garden Inn Napa has donated nearly 10000 bars of soap and in collecting the recyclable materials their soaps come in have also collected about 1500 pounds of plastic.

Dion says the housekeepers keep a separate stash of recyclable items adding to the pile with each room they clean and once their provided box is full they send it along to the processing plants in Orlando and Las Vegas where Clean the World staff take it from there.

Upon smashing cleaning and re-molding the donated soaps the nonprofit organization then packages the goods into hygiene kits with shampoos toothpaste toothbrushes towels socks and other items before distributing them to their partners in 127 different countries.

At the Embassy Suites Napa Valley – another Hilton affiliate – executive housekeeper Maria Contreras also makes sure her fellow staff are collecting discards for Clean the World.

“There is a really cool video that we presented to staff when we were beginning the collection of the soap and it gives them a purpose for what the final destination of the product would be” said Contreras. “The team got really excited about it.”

Contreras has worked at the Embassy Suites for 34 years and since the hotel adopted the program back in 2015 she says the process has remained largely the same.

“The team has a cup for soap and another one for the little shampoos and lotions and then at the end of the day they will put them in the recycling bins in one of our storage rooms. When there is a full bin I will place the sticker back on and it goes back to the collectors” she said. “They made it pretty easy for us to follow through.”

As a result this location has been able to donate a total of 16601 bars of soap which ends up being about 2870 pounds of product.

“We all feel good that it isn't going to end up in a landfill and it is going to help impoverished people” said Contreras.

And now that Contreras and her crew are in the swing of the process they don’t foresee ever going back to the old method of disposing unused soaps.

“It’s like if you recycle all of a sudden not recycling makes you feel guilty” said Andrew Felsinger director of sales and marketing for the hotel.

And while the backing of hotel goliaths like Hilton is important to the success of Clean the World the initiative isn’t only for them.

Recently Napa’s luxury Carneros Resort and Spa joined the group of committed hotels in the area and based on Clean the World’s projections will likely donate about 8800 bars of soap on an annual basis.

However since the resort only officially started the program a few months ago time will tell how much waste they are actually able to save.

“I had done this program before at a previous hotel in New York so that is how I had learned about it"" said Ed Costa managing director of the hotel.

Thus far Costa says the housekeeping staff have not had any complaints about the process and he is optimistic about the positive impact that the resort may have moving forward.

“It's just a little extra work of storing everything and collecting everything and wheeling it back” he said.

This is a review of Canopy by Hilton London City.

Canopy by Hilton

I’m guessing that many readers may not be that familiar with Canopy by Hilton. To be fair prior to this I wasn’t too sure either! According to Hilton Canopy by Hilton is Hilton’s “upper-upscale lifestyle hotel brand located in the most dynamic neighborhoods across the globe every Canopy hotel becomes a natural extension of the community in which it calls home and provides an energizing atmosphere with thoughtfully local touches.” Any clearer?

One thing that is more simple to understand is the standards across every Canopy hotel:

Signature mattress designed just for Canopy by Hilton outfitted with the right amount of support and temperature control.

Nespresso machine to start your day

Uncloseted storage

A large bathroom with a large walk-in shower.

Every bed is topped with a canopy inspired by the neighborhood.

Canopy Central – a central space for guests day to night.

Location

The hotel has a good location for public transport with Aldgate tube station only being 2 minutes walk away. With that and Aldgate East tube station you can catch the Circle Metropolitan Hammersmith & City and District lines. It’s not the nicest of streets it is situated on but there is a good Thai restaurant Thai Square if you didn’t want to eat in the hotel.

It’s also not great for access as there is a double yellow line outside so if you have a lot of luggage you may have to lug it across the road. It seems definitely designed for short-stay customers.

Check-in

The outside of the building is very modern and it has a rather random display of what look like stuffed birds (bit hopefully are fake) in the window.

In my head I was expecting a super modern slightly minimalist reception but I was pleasantly surprised by the luxury feel of the reception area. The reception area is a large open-plan space with lots of seating and a bar at one end.

There is also a seating area off to one side.

I found all the staff at the hotel super friendly and helpful. On checking in I was given some drink vouchers which I assume was due to my status as a Hilton Diamond member. I was also upgraded to a Junior Suite.

The room

The room was a little more in line with what I was expecting in terms of being modern and simple. It felt very spacious and had a good view of the Gherkin and the City of London.

There was a lovely note and some snacks in the room to welcome me.

It did of course have the signature Canopy above the bed. I liked the fur throw on the sofa (which is a sofa bed) in case you were chilly while watching TV! Talking of TVs this one was large at 55 inches and had the usual Smart TV features.

I thought the room was particularly well equipped. It had a bathrobe and slippers which were in the open wardrobe. I liked the large area that you could lie your suitcase down on in the wardrobe. Much better than the annoying racks that can’t cope with a double-sided suitcase.

There was also a Nepresso machine a kettle and I loved the large water bottle you could refill.

As you would expect there was a safe but it was large and well-hidden. So many safes it is a struggle to fit a laptop in but this had plenty of space.

Finally there was a fridge which was empty except for some fresh milk which was also something I would only expect to see in a really top end hotel.

I loved the little extras in the room with an eye mask and some slipper socks in bright orange (a little bit on the easyJet orange for me!)

The bathroom was also a good size and well designed. It had everything I would expect from a luxury bathroom – large rainhead shower magnifying mirror and plenty of soft white towels and face cloths.

Toiletries were by Aptiva in Mountain Honey and had a mild unisex fragrance.

The bed was pretty comfortable and the room was super quiet. I could not hear any noise from the street below although I was on one of teh higher floors. It is not a particularly busy street for traffic anyway.

Food and drink

The hotel currently has the Freedom Café in the lobby and the Penny Squares for breakfast. Florattica Rooftop bar is due to open soon.

Freedom cafe is for coffee snacks lunch and an area to work in the day and then a bar at night with small plates. It has a great gin list with plenty of local options as well as some great cocktails.

Breakfast

Breakfast was also a pleasant surprise. The restaurant has a lot of large communal tables which I probably would not be a fan of if its busy. However it was pretty quiet when we were there.

There were no real complaints about breakfast apart from having to use a machine for coffee but it was at least a good bean to cup one. There was certainly a large enough selection of food to choose from.

The cold selection had salad meats cheese yoghurt cereal and some lovely fresh fruit such as berries. The bakery selection was also great with slice your own artisan bread and some good flaky croissants.

There was a full hot selection which also had a version of shakshuka one of my favourites.

Everything seemed good quality and the dishes were topped up regularly.

Facilities

There’s a large well-equipped gym and a concierge service.

Booking and pricing

I paid cash for the hotel and prices can be very reasonable if booked in advance. Prices start from around £150 a night or 56000 Hilton Honors points.

You can search for prices and availability here.

Conclusion

Overall I was impressed with the Canopy hotel. It was stylish with friendly staff and a good bar. The room had lots of extras and was comfortable and quiet. I also felt like my status was recognised which is always nice. Considering the price of the hotel it does make a good value option for a fairly luxurious hotel that is close to public transport."

The WTA Tour has finally found a new title sponsor: Hologic a medical device and diagnostics company focused on women's health.

WTA President Micky Lawler speaks of the ""most important partnership in the history of the WTA possibly the largest in women's sport"".

As one of the world's leading medical technology innovators Hologic has a primary focus on improving women's health and well-being. This includes industry-leading products in each of the company's categories: diagnostics imaging systems and surgical devices. Hologic's areas of focus include cutting-edge preventive medicine reducing inequalities in access to healthcare and education and unique research that helps countries around the world prioritize women's health  according to a WTA press release .

Since the end of the cooperation with Sony Ericsson in 2010 the WTA had remained without a title sponsor. At that time 88 million US dollars had been set for six years but no one wanted to comment on the exact numbers with Hologic.

""Hologic and the WTA come together with a common purpose as pioneering advocates for women"" said Steve MacMillan chairman president and CEO of Hologic. ""We are proud to stand with the WTA in its commitment to the highest integrity and values. Ultimately our partnership allows us to work together to further raise the profile of women and share the importance of early detection and treatment with women around the world split.""

WTA reaction after Peng Shuai scandal convinces Hologic

A title sponsor could be more important for the WTA than it has been for a long time: in a courageous step after the events surrounding Peng Shuai  the decision was made to suspend the tournaments in China . And that's exactly where the WTA had generated the lion's share of its income with around 30 percent.

Exactly this step of the WTA was obviously also decisive for a cooperation with Hologic.

""We have been watching very closely some of the bold and truly high integrity moves that the WTA has taken almost on its own"" Lisa Hellmann Hologic's senior vice president of global human resources and corporate communications told the New York Times . ""And that made us aware of both the potential need for title sponsorship and that we really want to support the stance they are taking despite the really negative impact on their business.""

Hellmann continued: ""It put their calendar at risk. It put a huge audience at risk but they stood up for what they thought was right and stood up for their players and by extension the voice of women around the world .""

Previous title sponsors of the WTA were Virginia Slims (a cigarette manufacturer the first title sponsor after the WTA was founded in 1973) Kraft General Food Corel Sanex and Sony Ericsson.

Hologic will be integrated with the WTA across all platforms including net signage at all WTA tournaments and virtual advertising at the WTA 1000 and 500 events. As the official health partner of the WTA Hologic will be a founding partner of Hologic WTA Labs a WTA initiative focused on health innovations and research-based projects specifically for female athletes.

DANBURY — When city school administrators visited the Cartus Corp. headquarters in 2019 they determined adding classroom space there wouldn’t work.

“It was too costly to retrofit for classroom spaces and so we couldn’t afford the lease plus the investment it would take to make it school-ready” said Superintendent Kevin Walston who was assistant superintendent at the time.

Today the Cartus property is considered the perfect new home for Danbury’s future career academy — a $164 million school serving more than 1400 middle and high school students.

Moving the career academy to 40 Apple Ridge Road is a major switch. After spending more than 11/2 years on planning the opening of the school in the Summit development the city dropped the plan in a matter of weeks working on a deal behind the scenes that Danbury leaders say will be better for students and the city.

“We were ecstatic quite frankly to know that (the Cartus) building was available” Walston said. “There were some limitations with the site at the Summit and this one quite frankly provides for opportunities that I think are going to better fit the mindset of the Danbury career academy.”

In building the career academy at the Cartus property Danbury has better control over the project and the school with opportunities to create a campus with more schools leaders said.

“Every step that you take on this land in the future we will own” Mayor Dean Esposito said Monday when he announced the plans. “Unfortunately at the other option we didn’t own the property. We owned a condo kind of concept. And for me personally it wasn’t acceptable.”

The Summit a 1.2 million-square-foot development on the west side will use the space intended for the school to add more apartments. About 400 are now planned.

“We’re certainly disappointed that we couldn’t come to terms but it's about the kids” said Mike Basile project manager for the Summit. “I think as long as the mayor and the city find a location to build a school I think it's great for the city.”

Why the Summit deal broke down

After months of planning attorneys from the city and Summit met in January to nail down the purchase of three pods within the building. They needed to agree on how the Summit would be taxed as well.

Esposito said it looked like there was an agreement on the table.

“At that point it seemed to be a solid agreement” he said. “And everybody left patting each other on the back.”

His staffers and attorneys indicated that things were looking good. A finalized sale likely was on the horizon.

The next day however the Summit came back with what Esposito called “some unacceptable requests.”

A specific sticking point came during the tax abatement negotiations.

City Council voted in 2020 to levy $860000 in annual property taxes charge an additional city services fee for 19 years starting at $550000 per year and drop the Summit’s appeal of Danbury’s assessment on its 99-acre property. After 10 years the property was to be taxed at a fair market value. Both parties signed a memorandum of understanding but Summit never signed the final agreement Basile said.

Pressure was increased for an extended term on the abatement Esposito said and a late adjustment in purchase price that led him to walk away temporarily although negations later resumed.

The assessment for the Summit is $41.3 million with taxes hitting $1.14 million based on the 2021 mill rate of 27.6 according to the city’s tax assessor. Now that the career academy deal is dead no abatement will occur..

“From this point forward they’re going to be taxed like any other developer in the city” Esposito said.

Basile declined to comment further on the taxes. He said didn’t fully know why the deal broke down.

“I don't think I could tell you” he said. “I think at the end of the day they were looking or more of a campus perspective but not sure I fully understand.”

Other factors in deal collapse

The city realized costs like condo association fees and common charges would be more burdensome than initially expected council members said. There were concerns that the city could need to contribute significant dollars for repairs in the future.

Advertisement Article continues below this ad

“We were leery about the fact that we would not own the property and it would not be within our control especially costs that may be handed to us down the road” said Warren Levy City Council Republican majority leader.

The city would need to contribute to fees to maintain the private road and condo complexes on the Reserve were worried about the wear and tear on the road from buses said Paul Rotello City Council Democratic minority leader.

“Money is always a major factor but I think at the end of the day some of the complexities inexplicable complexes built into the deal were something that the city ultimately wasn’t comfortable with” he said.

Basile said those kinds of concerns seemed to be a factor in the decision.

Advertisement Article continues below this ad

“A condo association can complicate things for a municipality” he said. “That's really what I think drove their decision making.”

The Summit Development is made up of a hedge fund and various partners around the country so the local Summit representatives had to get approval from higher-ups which complicated negotiations Rotello said.

“When you wind up in negotiations that are really complicated and minds are changing on regular a basis you start getting a little bit concerned that maybe these aren’t the kinds of partners that you want to be partnered with” Rotello said. “Maybe you want a little more clarity and a little more certainty.”

But there are no hard feelings between the mayor and the developers.

“You know the deal didn’t work out for us but they are a good solid employer here in Danbury” Esposito said. “The whole location over there has been solid. ... The local representatives from that project have been key to negotiations.”

Although the Zoning Commission approved plans for the Summit that included the career academy those approvals came with conditions that the city purchase the pods. This means the developers will not need to return to the commission to build additional apartments in the space intended for the school.

Why Cartus

After he initially walked away from the Summit Esposito envisioned building another high school at the Danbury High School campus and expanding Broadview Middle School.

Shortly after news came out that the negotiations with the Summit were faltering Melvin Powers owner of the Cartus land at 40 Apple Ridge Road called the mayor to tell him he had a third option.

“He called out of the blue and that’s just the reality of the whole thing. I think it’s just a real plus for the city of Danbury that we have that option” Esposito said.

Things moved quickly after that point. On Feb. 10 Esposito pulled together the City Council leadership to tell them about Powers’ offer. That same day the city leaders took a tour of the area.

Vinny DiGilio City Council president who visited the property that day described the Cartus deal coming together as like a “fairy tale.” He said he was impressed with how “immaculate” the building was and called the facility as a “game changer.”

Advertisement Article continues below this ad

“The openness of it and the ability to customize and just the space being able to handle immediate needs future needs and being able to provide something like that to the students and faculty and staff for generations to come is pretty amazing” he said.

Fred Visconti City Council Democratic legislative leader was part of that visit and saw the switch to Cartus as a “no-brainer.”

“That building meets what we want a lot better than what we probably would have had to do get the Summit set up the right way” he said.

City officials and the superintendent worked together to make the deal come together DiGilio said. The fully council was looped in and agreed it was the best option Levy said.

“It was just a lot of communication a lot of urgency” DiGilio said.

Benefits of new location

A lot has changed since 2019 when school administrators toured the Cartus building.

At the time the city could have only leased space in the building. Danbury moved onto other properties landing on the Summit which was seen as the only viable location for the career academy.

Advertisement Article continues below this ad

However the Apple Ridge Road property became available for purchase because Cartus plans to vacate the building due to the hybrid work model that COVID-19 introduced.

There’s far more parking — roughly 1300 parking spots about 1000 more than would have been possible at the Summit.

The downside of moving from the Summit to Cartus is that the school won’t be in the same building as CEOs and major businesses such as Nuvance Health Rotello said.

“But it’s not that far away from corporate headquarters” he said. “It’s entirely possible that we could get hem drive in every once in a while.”

Two other buildings near the one planned for the school could be up for sale as well. Powers owns one of the buildings while the other is the home to Hologic Inc.

In the future the city could decide to purchase the buildings for additional schools. The property is in an area of the city that’s growing.",,,,,,,,,

Credit report errors are not unusual. A recent investigation by Consumer Reports found that one in three Americans who participated in the study discovered at least one mistake on their credit report. About 29 percent found mistakes in their personal information while 11 percent discovered erroneous information about accounts.

Mistakes on your credit report can cause a whole host of problems

Incorrect personal information can affect your ability to access your credit report or get your identity confirmed with government agencies if for example you’re trying to file an income tax return or access your Social Security account online.

Errors involving accounts or public records can hurt your ability to qualify for a loan or credit card can increase the interest rates you pay or affect your premiums on auto or homeowners’ insurance policies.

Mistakes involving public records can also affect lending decisions and could potentially cost you a job offer if for example your credit report shows a bankruptcy or tax lien that isn’t yours.

It’s easy and free to get copies of your credit reports:

You should go to AnnualCreditReport.com and you can request all three reports there – from Equifax TransUnion and Experian. Or you can call 1-877-322-8228.

You will have to provide personal information including your Social Security number. For the rest of 2023 you can get a free credit report every week from each of the three bureaus. This was started in 2020 under COVID to help people learn whether payment extensions granted by banks were being honored or reported as late on credit reports. The free-report-a-week arrangement has been extended until Dec. 31 2023. After that you can request a copy from each bureau at no charge once a year.

IMPORTANT TIP: Do not go directly to the bureaus’ web sites; the reports won’t be free and you may mistakenly sign up for paid products such as identity theft monitoring.

Your credit report may be a dozen pages or more. If you have never seen a copy of your credit report or if it’s been a long time here’s a roadmap of the places to look for the most common mistakes that will hurt you or could signal a problem.

Now take a second to think about if instead of having all those various devices you chose items only compatible with say Apple Homekit. How much does that cost rise? There’s also a non-financial price in the form of the other things you’re giving up such as not having a smart display. Let’s take a deep dive into the costs of only choosing smart home devices compatible with one ecosystem.

HomeKit

Let’s start with Apple HomeKit. Imagine a house with one smart display TV (or tv accessory) a couple of plugs security camera video doorbell lights and speaker. This small list covers what are typically the first accessories people purchase when converting their home to something more intelligent.

For Apple users that translates to an iPad Apple TV Wemo plugs Logitech Circle View and Circle View Doorbell Nanoleaf lights and a couple of Homepod Minis. At the time of this writing that device set will run you around $1150. That amount may or may not seem like that much money to cover your whole home with devices although Google or Amazon would definitely be less expensive.

It’s usually better to avoid buying everything at once but instead to gradually replace devices as needed. You don’t have to worry much about extra subscriptions with this set. A $5-per-month subscription for iCloud will suffice.

HomeKit’s actual cost comes from its lack of devices. There’s not a true smart display yet and other devices have what’s known as the Apple tax — paying more money for a product that only works with Apple. The cheapest HomeKit-made speaker is the Homepod Mini at $100 but if you want a better sound Sonos would be your choice. Again not cheap. Adding more accessories as they come out — think items like a smart door lock vacuum or purifiers security systems or simply more lights or speakers — raises the cost exponentially.

However the benefit with HomeKit products comes when you’re already in the Apple ecosystem. You’re able to control all your products through one app along with setting up automation. The device setup process is relatively easy — just scan a QR code. Lastly there’s a reasonable expectation that everything will work seamlessly with each other and if not there will be decent customer support.

Assistant and Alexa

Running an exclusively Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa household is way more accessible and less expensive than with HomeKit. Not counting the smaller accessories Google has its Nest Hub Chromecast and Nest Mini for $200. Amazon has its Echo Show Fire TV and Echo Dots which range in price due to the plethora of first-party options but can easily be around $200. Those same product types cost $600 from Apple.

Another benefit to going all-in on one of these ecosystems is the sheer abundance of third-party accessories that companies come out with all the time. The extra accessories increase the competition in the retail space which lowers prices for consumers. This also increases the number of companies you can trust to make good products without charging a fortune such as TP-Link and Blink.

Google Assistant and Alexa have a presence in the smart home space that HomeKit doesn’t have yet. Some of these categories include smart displays robot vacuums and more. To enjoy the newest features and products you’d have to choose Google or Amazon.

All in?

Ultimately the question we have here is is it feasible? That’s a tricky question to answer. I chose to go all-in with Apple HomeKit due to its simplicity. I didn’t particularly appreciate needing multiple different apps to control my home or having to speak to numerous assistants and figuring out which one managed what device. On the other hand having all devices together and knowing they work and interact with each other is excellent. If there’s one thing I know I will pay extra for it’s peace of mind and convenience.

HomeKit isn’t for everyone though. I have to be patient in knowing that a proper smart display may never come waiting for Matter to materialize or just finding deals on the products.

There are other solutions for people wanting to go all-in on HomeKit including the popular HOOBS smart home server which allows you to make other outside accessories work within your HomeKit home through backend methods.

For most people it makes sense to configure your home with either Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa if starting fresh. Most new devices will be compatible with one or both ecosystems and you’re sure to find accessories for any budget. Even those with iPhones can download the Google Home or Alexa apps so don’t think you’re stuck in the HomeKit world. So yes going all-in with any smart home ecosystem is possible and even practical in most cases — you just have to know what you may possibly be giving up.

The fete returned to the beach in Santa Monica after last year’s show was moved online due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Waititi who was presenting his FX series Reservation Dogs with best ensemble cast continued: “If you’re in a tent you’re camping. Get over yourselves you’re fucking camping.”

Inside that tent Sunday the show’s major winners were Maggie Gyllenhaal and her directorial debut The Lost Daughter with onscreen representation and the war in Ukraine fueling conversation and acceptance speeches.

The Lost Daughter marks the first time that Netflix won best film at the awards show having had titles in the race in 2020 (Marriage Story) and 2021 (Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom). “More than anything we really want to thank all of the parents — especially the mothers — that came to us after seeing this movie and felt that they were seen; that their experiences are onscreen” said producer Osnat Handelsman-Keren.

Gyllenhaal took the award for best screenplay and best director one of the four women nominated in the five-person directing category. The Spirit Award nominees for directing represented an inverse of the Academy Awards best director race with four men and one woman (The Power of the Dog‘s Jane Campion) up for the honor. Outside of Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) and Gyllenhaal only two other women have won in the category — Martha Coolidge in 1991 for Rambling Rose and Sofia Coppola in 2003 for Lost in Translation.

Gyllenhaal began tearing up on stage accepting the best director award presented by last year’s winner Zhao saying “I love independent film. I grew up making independent film. I love watching film. Everyone here in this tent has scrambled to get their movies made.”

Elsewhere CODA actor Troy Kotsur continued to make history winning the best supporting male at the Sunday ceremony becoming the first deaf actor to earn a Spirit Award. Kotsur also recently became the first deaf actor to win an individual SAG Award and is the first deaf man to earn an Oscar nomination and the second deaf actor nominated in the show’s history. (CODA co-star Marlee Matlin was the first deaf actor to be nominated and win an Oscar for Children of a Lesser God.) “I can feel the spirits of the arts” said Kotsur during his awards speech the first of the afternoon.

A24 titles took both lead acting prizes. Simon Rex won for Red Rocket with Taylour Paige winning for Zola which was the ceremony’s most-nominated title also earning the best editing award for Joi McMillon. Elsewhere Drive My Car won the honor for best international film; the award was presented during the commercial break which came as a surprise. Traditionally the award is presented during the telecast with off-air awards being best cinematography and best editing.

For only the second year the Spirit Awards recognized creatives’ work in television. The awards ran across five categories with winners including Thuso Mbedu who earned the best female performance in a new scripted series for The Underground Railroad; and Squid Game actor Lee Jung-jae who took the male honor. Reservation Dogs earned best new scripted series with members of the majority native cast and crew taking the stage. “We don’t want a handout we just want an opportunity to tell our stories” said series co-creator Sterlin Harjo who acknowledged that the Santa Monica ceremony was taking place on the traditional lands of the Tongva people.

The FX series was also awarded the best ensemble cast presented by an animated Waititi who co-created and executive produces the show with Harjo. Star Devery Jacobs began the acceptance speech: “Each of us come from different nations across Turtle Island that survived 500 years of colonization. And in the 100 years of film and TV Reservation Dogs marks the first project with all indigenous creatives at the helm.” Actress Paulina Alexis continued the thank-yous adding “To the Tongva nation who host each of us here tonight in their traditional and rightful territory.”

Summer of Soul won best documentary with director Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson offering thanks multiple times to his fellow nominees which included fellow Oscar nominees Flee and Ascension. Offered Thompson: “The world is burning outside but we are in here celebrating. For artists it’s very hard to push forward so I thank all of the people in this category.”

Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine was also on the minds of everyone from hosts to presenters to winners.

“I would like to express my solidarity for the peoples of Ukraine” said Ruth Negga while accepting her best supporting female award for Passing remotely. Host Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally said that they offered their “best wishes” to those in the country. “I think we speak for everyone here when we say we are hoping for a quick and peaceful resolution. Specifically fuck off and go home Putin” said Mullally before she and Offerman raised their middle fingers to the camera.

On Nov. 22 FMN announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire a 71.69% share in its milling rival at an estimated cost of NGN80 billion (US $193.7 million). Additionally FMN announced an agreement with First Bank of Nigeria Ltd. to acquire the bank’s 5.06% equity in HFMP.

“We are delighted that approvals have been received and we are all set to begin execution of this landmark transaction that would positively impact Nigeria’s food security architecture and overall competitiveness” said Boye Olusanya group managing director FMN.

FMN operates 17 modern manufacturing facilities in 12 states with production capabilities across grain milling edible oil and sugar refining agricultural inputs and animal nutrition and protein segments.

FMN said its combination with HFMP would bring together two trusted brands and create a food business better positioned to benefit Nigeria’s growing population and leverage opportunities within the African Continental Free Trade Area.

“Our combined brands and businesses will mean an expansive scale of food production for both Nigeria and Africa” Olusanya said. “Together Flour Mills of Nigeria and Honeywell Flour Mills will be able to achieve rapid growth while maintaining high-quality products serving the evolving needs of our consumers.”

Honeywell said in a World Grain article addressing the merger that the transaction “combines FMN’s market-leading offerings that include grain-based foods sugar starches oils spreads and breakfast cereals with HFMP’s market leading diverse and differentiated range of carbohydrate products.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDE5MTY1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Delores Rouillard,"Delores Rouillard

Given current events could Russia accelerate the “Russification” of its upcoming MC-21 airliner to get around international sanctions?

As we have seen Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused an international outcry. The immediate result was the implementation of a series of sanctions. And some of these sanctions severely impacted Russian aviation. Airlines in Russia will have to return hundreds of aircraft to lessors. Or Russia could forcibly nationalize them entering a commercial stand-off with lessors.

But even aircraft that Russian airlines own outright could soon face a lack of spare parts. Even access to suitable maintenance/repair centres might become doubtful to start with. Russia and its airlines could certainly use a Russian aircraft – and they could soon have one in Irkut’s MC-21. There’s only one little problem with that: the MC-21 isn’t entirely Russian.

Irkut a subsidiary of UAC (United Aircraft Corporation) is planning two versions of the MC-21 airframe. The first to enter service will be the MC-21-300. Size-wise this plane is about the same length and capacity as a 737-9 and a bit smaller than an Airbus A321neo. The smaller MC-21-200 will come at a later date. This one is somewhere between the 737-7 and 737-8 (closer to the former) or between the A319 and A320.

Russia Certifies The MC-21

Aviation authorities in Russia (Rosaviatsia) awarded type certification to the MC-21 just before the end of 2021. This type certificate is for the MC-21-300. The launch customer for the plane will be Rossiya. UAC/Irkut aimed for the type to get EASA type certification when it enters service. But in any case the MC-21-300 would certainly face sanctions. This aircraft has Pratt & Whitney PW1400G engines.

These geared-turbofan (GTF) engines are very similar to the PW1100Gs that are an option for the A320neo. Obviously Pratt & Whitney is an American engine manufacturer. However there is a variant of the MC-21 with engines made in Russia. This is the MC-21-310. The first development aircraft with the Russian Aviadvigatel PD-14 engines flew in December 2020. But certification of this aircraft version is some time away.

Certification of a complex new system like an engine takes a lot of time. Very simplistically speaking there are two certifications: one for the new system and another approving it for use on a particular aircraft. Aviation authorities in Russia certified the PD-14 engine in 2018 – but they have yet to certify the MC-21 using it. It’s not clear how long it will take for this additional certification.

Many More Foreign Parts

And even when the MC-21-310 gets the all-clear its “Russification” will still face plenty of other hurdles. The plane also has an American auxiliary power unit (APU) from Honeywell Aerospace. A Russian company is working on an alternative option but this isn’t ready yet. There’s much more. Western companies often working with partners in Russia make many other critical systems for the MC-21.

The MC-21 will incorporate a number of impressive state-of-the-art design features. It will be the first-ever commercial airliner with active sidesticks. These sticks still won’t have mechanical connections to each other but they incorporate force feedback. So one pilot will know if the other is making control inputs. Pilots will also feel aerodynamic forces through the stick. The first planes to feature such a system are the Gulfstream G500/600 corporate jets.

And the company supplying this technology to Irkut for the MC-21 in Russia is Ratier-Figeac. It is a French company also supplying sidesticks to Airbus. Its parent company is USA’s Collins Aerospace itself a Raytheon subsidiary. Honeywell (the APU maker) is supplying more avionics along with Thales-Alenia (Franco-Italian) and Israel’s Elbit. Other foreign companies are providing power distribution systems actuators for flight control surfaces and even cabin interiors.

UAC/Irkut first faced the prospect of sanctions affecting the MC-21 after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. As a result the company developed carbon composite wings and wingbox both using out-of-autoclave technology. This is a technological leap that both Airbus and Boeing are also busy working on as we’ve seen. The first MC-21 with fully-Russian wings flew last December.

The MC-21 Russia And Sanctions

By all accounts it seems that Russia will have a modern and efficient single-aisle aircraft in the MC-21. But even without sanctions it would have taken many more years before this plane could replace a meaningful number of aircraft. The sanctions will only push back this date further. On the plus side the sanctions will probably boost the aircraft’s orders from Russian operators. But this will have to wait until they’ve recovered from this crisis!

But in the meantime the sanctions mean that Irkut will have fewer planes in the air. So the manufacturer will gain less experience with the current aircraft version as it tries to replace multiple crucial systems. Some of these parts may seem simple but developing certifying and incorporating replacements is difficult and time-consuming. Beyond the MC-21 Russia is working with China to develop the CR929 a future widebody.

Perhaps a Sino-Russian partnership to develop alternative systems for both aircraft might be an option. But given the sheer number of systems involved this is a long-term proposition. China also depends on many American and European companies for its C919. This single-aisle jet may achieve certification later this year. It has CFM LEAP-1C engines.

Overall Russia can’t depend on the development of the MC-21 to get around sanctions. The sanctions will almost certainly push back the plane’s entry-to-service date. But it will be interesting to see what the long-term prospects of the plane will be. UAK/Irkut also hope to make a cargo plane with the same Russian engines. Before the latest developments the schedule was for the first development aircraft to fly in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDE4OTI1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Robert DeWitt McKee,"McKee Robert DeWitt 91 passed away on February 27 2022 at his winter home in Tonto Verde AZ.

While students adapted well many grew accustomed to high levels of automation and convenience in nearly every area of their lives. As these students return to communal dining spaces dining managers are wondering what they can do to marry the best elements of high-tech convenience with the undeniable advantages of face-to-face interaction. “Everything has truly been at their fingertips” Rebecca Selesky says. “We need to ask what we can do to be more efficient and provide our students with the service that they’ve grown accustomed to.”

While the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of numerous technologies the big question is which innovations are here to stay. Dustin Cutler says “At Cornell dining we will not get rid of contactless payment. The mobile technology piece is something that we’ll keep forever.” Selesky is looking to increase the options that her students have for ordering on mobile with a focus on what she calls “grab and go operations.”

Ahmed arguably knows as much about mobile ordering as anybody in the world: last year Ohio State was the number one campus in the country for mobile ordering. “Nearly 100 percent of our orders came through on mobile” he says. It put us in a unique position to be successful during Covid. Because of that we were able to have students on campus.”

The question of automation looms large in any discussion of foodservice technology. It’s no secret that large parts of the service industry are looking at automation as a way to manage the labor shortages that are plaguing operations across the industry. While colleges are lucky to have a reliable stream of student workers they are not exempt from the challenges facing the rest of the country.

“If you ask 100 dining directors what their biggest concern is right now I would be surprised if 99 of them do not say labor” Ahmed says. “People don’t want to do monotonous work anymore.”

But the answer is not a kitchen full of robot workers. A kitchen without humans is at odds with the ideals of chef-forward cooking that dining managers have worked so hard to develop. Ahmed takes a utilitarian approach making an effort not to adopt technology for its own sake instead keeping the focus on the problems that his team is trying to solve.

“What we are solving for with automation is our labor crisis. We need to find a way where we’re not automating creative work but instead automating monotonous work.”

Horst agrees with his assessment. “With this technology who needs to be flipping burgers making smoothies or fries? Using robotics for that would allow you to use your skilled labor for things that are more meaningful.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdHRhZ25ldC5jb20vaG9tZS9hcnRpY2xlLzE1NTM1MzQ5L21vdW50YWlyZS1mYXJtcy1lbXBsb3llZXMtdm90ZS10by1kZWNlcnRpZnktYW5vdGhlci11bmlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mountaire Farms employees vote to decertify another union,"After the decertification of the United Food Commercial Workers (UFCW) union another union at the Mountaire Farms Inc. Selbyville Delaware plant will be up for a certification vote this year.

In a statement from Mountaire Farms on March 4 “the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has ruled that employees at the Mountaire Farms processing plant in Selbyville who are members of the Teamsters Local 355 will get the chance to vote to decertify the union on March 17 2022.”

The Teamsters Local 355 union has 230 employees and is the only union at the Selbyville plant. It is also the only Mountaire Farms plant that has a union.

The UFCW union was decertified in December after members filed against the union for charging members to new hires with a 30-day grace period. The campaign against the union was backed by the National Right to Work Foundation (NRFW) which is a legal aid nonprofit that works to weaken and eliminate unions.

There is no information currently on a specific reason that members filed for a decertification vote. But their letter to Mountaire Farms management stated “we are writing to express our interest in no longer being represented by Teamsters Local 355. We are tired and simply want them out of our lives since they serve no purpose. We trust that our company will do the right thing.”

“These employees have been patiently waiting for this opportunity to remove the union and we’re happy they finally are getting that chance to have their voices heard” said Phillip Plylar President of Mountaire Farms.

The vote will be overseen by the NLRB and will be held in person.

The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

Additional detail on the Company’s results including data for 22 domestic markets is available in the First Quarter 2024 Supplemental Financial Information on the Company’s website at www.hosthotels.com.



James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

The following are the results for transient group and contract business in comparison to 2023 performance for the Company's current portfolio:

Under U.S. GAAP costs to develop units for resale are considered an operating activity on the statement of cash flows and categorized as inventory. This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

_______________

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTE1Mzc0NTIwL2hvc3QtaG90ZWxzLWJ1eXMtMS1ob3RlbC1uYXNodmlsbGUtZW1iYXNzeS1zdWl0ZXMtZm9yLTUzMC1taWxsaW9uLWNhc2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Buys 1 Hotel Nashville Embassy Suites for $530 Million Cash,"Host Hotels & Resorts bought the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million in an all-cash deal.

The Bethesda Maryland-based hotel real estate investment trust said in a news release that the price represents a 12.6-times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or a capitalization rate of approximately 7.4% on the property's estimated 2024 results.

The sellers of the properties were Starwood Capital Group Crescent Real Estate and High Street Real Estate Partners.

1 Hotels is a brand under SH Hotels & Resorts which is the operator of the 1 Hotel Nashville. Starwood Capital owns SH Hotels & Resorts. Davidson Hospitality Group operates the Embassy Suites property.

Host Hotels expects the hotel will be among its top 25 properties based on estimated full-year results. It has an expected combined revenue per available room of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $58550.

The Pontiac Solstice holds a special place in the hearts of many enthusiasts and that’s particularly true of the range-topping GXP variant.

Introduced at the 2006 Los Angeles Auto Show the Solstice GXP featured a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine pumping out 260 hp (194 kW / 264 PS) and 260 lb-ft (352 Nm) of torque. It was paired to a standard five-speed manual and this allowed the rear-wheel drive roadster to run from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in just 5.5 seconds.

That was a winning combination but it doesn’t hold a candle to this V8-powered Solstice GT that was created by Michael Jonas of the Stainless Steel Brake Corporation and Chuck Mallett of Mallett Performance Cars. According to Mecum Jonas was disappointed the Solstice was four-cylinder only and learned that Mallett was developing an LS2-swapped model. As fate would have it Mallett was looking for brakes for their Solstice program and a partnership was born.

The resulting model is bound to turn heads thanks to its white exterior with blue racing stripes. The stripes weren’t the only addition as the Solstice GT has also been equipped with a ram air hood a rear wing and a center-mounted Corsa exhaust system. They’re joined by polished wheels that are backed up by an SSBC braking system that features three-piston calipers and 14-inch (356 mm) discs.

The updates continue in the cabin as there’s tan leather seats with blue suede inserts. The model has also been equipped with SSBC-branded floor mats a polished handbrake grip and a Hurst shift knob.

Of course the biggest change occurs under the hood as the four-cylinder engine has been replaced by a 6.0-liter V8 developing 400 hp (298 kW / 406 PS). It’s backed up by a five-speed manual transmission which features a LuK Pro Gold clutch and a custom bellhousing.

The modifications don’t end there as the Solstice GT has custom engine mounts as well as manifolds and catalytic converters sourced from a Corvette C6. Other highlights include a custom aluminum radiator and an upgraded suspension with Penske coilovers as well as adjustable shocks.

The car will be auctioned off by Mecum later this month but there’s no auction estimate.

Mario Duplantier drummer of Gojira and one of the modern masters of his craft. Now Mario has posted a video of a new composition on his Instagram which is basically a three-minute drum solo that you can lose yourself in and which solidifies his title as best drummer around.

“Movement” is a drum composition I wrote recently. The ocean has been very agitated recently causing strong swells that disrupt the calmness of the water. The horizon is less visible hidden by the waves. The world is in motion. Everything is constantly accelerating and decelerating. During these uncertain times we sway we dance with the movement and try to hang on. Mario Duplantier

The state of Montana has not had a warship named after it since an armored cruiser that was commissioned in 1908 and decommissioned in 1921.

Sea trials test every aspect of the submarine and it's capabilities.

Sea trials test propulsion weapon systems and make sure that it can dive safely to great depths.

The trials also make sure the crew can operate the sub with its new technology and most importantly that it doesn't leak.

The concept design received approval from the U.S. Navy back in 2015.

""It's been under construction over the last several years in remarkable ways from putting big pieces manufactured in Connecticut and in Virginia together in Virginia. And then doing the refinement work really is a step above it has capabilities that other submarines and other nations don't have"" said Bill Whitsitt Chairman of the USS Montana Committee.

The $2.7 billion submarine has an average sea life of around 30 years and will be able to hold a crew of over 130 sailors.

Once testing is complete the USS Montana will make its way back to the Norfolk Naval Base where it will undergo further updates and refinements while it waits for final approval from the U.S. Navy.

""It's been a remarkable journey for all of us who have been involved with the USS Montana. She has been an amazing piece of equipment that's come together. So I'm quite confident that the Navy is going to accept her in the near future"" said Whitsitt.

According to Whitsitt the USS Montana Committee has no doubt in their minds the Navy will approve the submarine.

If approved the committee will outfit the interior of the submarine to represent the state of Montana.

The committee hopes to see the future USS Montana in commission by June 25 where its home port is currently slated for Hawaii according to Whitsitt.

The U.S. Navy's Submarine Force took delivery of its newest attack submarine the future USS Oregon on February 26. It was the twentieth Virginia-class submarine to be co-produced at General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB) and Huntington Ingalls Industries – Newport News Shipbuilding through a joint agreement.

In addition the future USS Oregon was the eleventh Virginia-class boat delivered by GDEB and the second Block IV configured submarine.

""Oregon is in excellent condition and the captain and crew have expertly taken the ship through her paces” said Capt. Todd Weeks the Virginia-class program manager who rode the boat during her sea trials.

The delivery of this Virginia-class submarine was the culmination of nearly ten million work hours under the exacting standards imposed by Naval Sea Systems Command and Naval Reactors the Naval Sea Command announced .

""Each organization works tirelessly with the others focused on getting ships to sea as the first step in ultimately arriving at its Squadron and homeport where it becomes a vital asset to the nation"" added Captain Weeks.

The U.S. Navy's Virginia-class was designed to operate in the world's littoral and deep waters while conducting anti-submarine warfare anti-surface ship warfare special operations forces support mine warfare and reconnaissance. Their inherent stealth endurance mobility and firepower directly enable the Virginia-class subs to support five of the six maritime strategy core capabilities: sea control power projection forward presence maritime security and deterrence.

The result is a flexible multi-mission platform. The Virginia-class submarine can even be used to deliver special operations forces support or participate in mine warfare roles.

Third Navy Vessel to Honor Oregon

The future USS Oregon is the third U.S. Navy vessel to honor the Beaver State. The first USS Oregon was a brigantine ship purchased in 1841 and used for exploration until 1845 while the second USS Oregon was commissioned on July 15 1896.

The submarine's sponsor is Mrs. Dana Richardson wife of former Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson. Mrs. Richardson christened Oregon at Electric Boat in Groton Connecticut on October 5 2019.

Block IV Moving Ahead

As noted in a recent Congressional Research Service report the U.S. Navy has been procuring Virginia class nuclear-powered attack submarines since 1998 and a total of thirty-four had been procured through 2021.

In addition since 2011 the Virginia-class boats have been procured at a rate of two per year.

However due to the COVID-19 pandemic the ten remaining Block IV submarines had been delayed by four months on average though program officials stated that Block V has a schedule margin to absorb some Block IV delays. USS Oregon had been delayed by about sixteen months making it nearly two years since the Connecticut shipyard delivered a submarine.

But Intel’s ties to Russia run far deeper than chip sales.

For more than two decades the company has operated a major software development center in Nizhny Novgorod a city about 260 miles east of Moscow. Including staff at its Moscow office Intel’s Russian workforce totals 1200 people who work on key areas of Intel products such as autonomous driving and optimizing the architecture of Intel’s chips.

The Santa Clara Calif.–based semiconductor giant as well as other large U.S. tech companies with Russian workers find themselves operating in a business climate that’s been upended overnight. Nvidia IBM Dell Technologies Apple and Google also have offices in the country. As they navigate international scrutiny about business ties to Russia and operational challenges due to sanctions their decisions could impact hundreds or thousands of Russian tech workers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjd29ybGQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvNjE5MzU3L2FtZC1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWhhbHRzLWNoaXAtc2FsZXMtdG8tcnVzc2lhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Intel Microsoft Nvidia halt sales to Russia,"Both AMD and Intel on Thursday said that the two companies had halted sales of their products to Russia and Belarus an explicit commitment from the chip industry in taking action against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Microsoft also said it would halt “new” sales of Microsoft products. Nvidia said Friday that it has halted sales to Russia as well.

On Thursday morning AMD said it was halting all chip shipments. By Thursday afternoon Intel had joined AMD with a similar statement. Microsoft added its own statement on Friday morning.

According to AMD the chip ban extends to Belarus which Russia has used as a staging ground for its attacking forces. “Based on sanctions placed on Russia by the United States and other nations at this time AMD is suspending its sales and distribution of our products into Russia and Belarus” an AMD representative said in an email. “It is all AMD products and products we power (PCs etc) in Russia and Belarus.”

Intel too said it had suspended shipments. “Intel condemns the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and we have suspended all shipments to customers in both Russia and Belarus” Intel said in a statement on its Web site. “Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by this war including the people of Ukraine and the surrounding countries and all those around the world with family friends and loved ones in the region.”

Intel said that it had begun to raise funds for relief efforts too.

“We are working to support all of our employees through this difficult situation especially those with close ties to this region” Intel added. “We have launched an employee donation and matching campaign through the Intel Foundation that has already raised over $1.2 million for relief efforts and we are proud of the work our teams in surrounding areas including Poland Germany and Romania are doing to aid refugees. We will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine and the global community in calling for an immediate end to this war and a swift return to peace.”

For its part Microsoft said that it would halt sales of all “new” Microsoft products. “We are announcing today that we will suspend all new sales of Microsoft products and services in Russia” Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith wrote. “In addition we are coordinating closely and working in lockstep with the governments of the United States the European Union and the United Kingdom and we are stopping many aspects of our business in Russia in compliance with governmental sanctions decisions.”

It wasn’t clear whether Microsoft would leave in place ongoing subscription services. Microsoft also said that it continues to protect Ukrainian web sites from Russian attacks. “Our single most impactful area of work almost certainly is the protection of Ukraine’s cybersecurity” Smith added. “We continue to work proactively to help cybersecurity officials in Ukraine defend against Russian attacks including most recently a cyberattack against a major Ukrainian broadcaster.”

On Friday an Nvidia spokesman said simply “We are not selling into Russia.”

Finally clear statements in favor of Ukraine

On Feb. 24 the U.S. Department of Commerce implemented a new Commerce Control List-based license requirement for Russia. This requirement restricts exports to the country for key industries including “microelectronics” avionics navigation equipment and more. Essentially the new export rules blacklist Russia and businesses operating there from legally buying the restricted goods.

To date however the chip industry has been somewhat vague in how it has reacted to the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

On Feb. 26 for example an Intel representative merely said that “Intel complies with all applicable export regulations and sanctions in the countries in which it operates including the new sanctions issued by OFAC and the regulations issued by BIS.” At the time the representative declined to comment further when asked if that indicated a specific ban on sales to Russia. A source close to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) the world’s largest and most important fab told the Washington Post that the foundry has suspended all sales to Russia and to third parties that supply products to Russia. On the record however a TSMC representative told the paper that it would simply comply with the new export rules.

Compared to the overall market however chip sales to Russia represent a small fraction of total sales. On Feb. 24 the Semiconductor Industry Association released a statement that characterized Russia as “not a significant direct consumer” of semiconductors.

“While the impact of the new rules to Russia could be significant Russia is not a significant direct consumer of semiconductors accounting for less than 0.1% of global chip purchases according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization” the SIA said in a statement. “The broader Russian ICT market totaled only about $50.3 billion out of the $4.47 trillion global market according to 2021 IDC data.

“In addition the semiconductor industry has a diverse set of suppliers of key materials and gases so we do not believe there are immediate supply disruption risks related to Russia and Ukraine” the SIA added.

The AMD representative echoed what the SIA said specifically regarding its own supply chain. “Currently we do not believe that the conflict will impact our ability to provide products support and services to our partners and customers” the AMD representative said in his email.

Representatives for Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

Intel introduced its very first hybrid architecture client CPU platform codenamed Alder Lake late last year. The new platform brought with it much-needed improvements to performance and x86 efficiency especially in the multi-threaded segment. The Alder Lake lineup is currently shipping in all segments on desktop and mobile platforms but the 12th Gen family will soon be succeeded by its 13th Gen successor known as Raptor Lake.

Intel 13th Gen Raptor Lake Desktop CPUs - Refining Alder Lake With More Cores More Hybrid Goodness!

[Launched - 20/10/22]

On paper Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs look to be an optimized version of the 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs. They will be based on the same 10nm ESF 'Intel 7' process node utilize the same P-Core & E-Core design & will be supported on existing motherboards. But there's a lot that's changing with Raptor Lake and we are going to detail everything from official details to rumored information that we know about Alder Lake so far and what you could expect from Intel's next desktop lineup which will be pitted right against AMD's next Ryzen CPU lineup for desktops too.

Like Alder Lake Raptor Lake would utilize a completely hybrid architectural design. (Image Credits: Intel)

Intel 13th Gen 'Raptor Lake' CPUs Specifications

So starting with the specifications Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs will utilize the hybrid core design featuring a mix of Performance-Optimized 'P' and Efficiency-Optimized 'E' cores. For the new chips Intel will be using a brand new P-Core known as Raptor Cove which will replace the Golden Cove cores featured on the Alder Lake CPUs. For The E-Core Intel will retain the existing Gracemont core architecture but it will come with minor improvements.

The architecture has seen several optimizations and key refinements that have led to an increase from 16 cores and 24 threads to 24 cores and 32 threads. The new 10nm ESF (Intel 7) process retains Intel's clock leadership pushing the chips up to 5.8 GHz (up to 6 GHz on the KS variant).

Intel’s Raptor Lake will be built using the company’s new E and P cores you can read the architectural deep dive over here and represent a significant evolution in the company’s power efficiency targets. It will be built on the Intel 7 process and scale from 9 watts to 125 watts. DDR5 and PCIe gen5 will be supported (first to market) and feature new technologies like the Intel Thread Director.

Raptor Lake will be fully scalable from Desktop (LGA1700) to ultra-mobile. Interestingly however while the platform has 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores only the P-cores will support hyperthreading making for a total of 32 threads available. The integrated GPU will have 96 EUs of Xe architecture (good but nothing to write home about) but the thing that impressed us the most was the fact that Intel is claiming a 20% IPC uplift over Rocketlake.

Raptor Lake will feature up to 35 MB of noninclusive LL Cache and support DDR5-5200 LP5-5600 DDR4-3200 and LP4x-4266. It will also support two times the PCIe bandwidth thanks to its support of PCIe 5 and will be able to provide up to 16 lanes of PCIe Gen5 with up to 64 GB/s. The new design is fully modular and built like lego and should be completely scalable and flexible. The compute fabric interconnect has a bandwidth of 1000 GB/s while the IO fabric has a BW of 64 GB/s. The memory subsystem supports up to 204 GB/s but more importantly can scale memory frequency (and power) according to the need of the SoC.

So we are looking at a 40% core count bump and a 25% thread count bump vs the Alder Lake Core i5-12600K. The CPU comes with 24 MB of L3 and 20 MB of L2 cache for a combined total of 44 MB cache. Clock speeds are set at 3.5 GHz base 5.2 GHz boost and 5.1 GHz all-core boost while the E-Cores operate at 3.5 GHz base & 3.9 GHz boost clocks.

Intel 13th Gen 'Raptor Lake' CPUs Performance

Intel hasn't shared any detailed performance numbers of the 13th Gen Raptor Lake CPU family yet but based on what we know we can expect around a 10-15% uplift in gaming performance and 15-25% gains in multi-threading performance. These are just estimates and the final CPU performance could be much better. Intel's main aim with Raptor Lake is to tackle the 3D V-Cache and the Zen 4 CPUs. AMD has already touted its Ryzen 7 5800X3D as the best gaming processor right now so we can expect Zen 4 and its 3D variants to take that lead further up. The Ryzen 5 7600X is said to beat the Core i9-12900K in gaming at just $299 US.

A demo showcasing the benefits of the extra cores was shown by Intel during Investors Day '22 which revealed how the E-Cores can offload the work in Blender and leave the 16 P-Core threads available for other tasks. The Raptor Lake chip used within the demo is an ES part running at lower clock speeds and at a base TDP of 125W and was able to outperform the Core i9-12900K (though we don't know if the Alder Lake chip was also running at base TDP of its max TDP). Nevertheless it looks like those extra cores are going to deliver some nice uplift in performance overall. The recent rumors have highlighted clock speeds as high as 5.8 GHz for the top parts which will be insane to see on the desktop PC platform.

Over the course several benchmarks of Intel's Core i9-13900K and Core i9-13900 have leaked out showing promising performance that's well ahead against AMD Ryzen 5000 and Intel 12th Gen CPU lineup in multi-threaded and delivers a good beating in single-threaded workloads too. The final performance is looking to be highly competitive when compared to existing parts and also shows good competition versus AMD's upcoming Ryzen 7000 Desktop CPUs.

Intel 13th Gen 'Raptor Lake' CPUs LGA 1700 Platform

Intel is sticking with its LGA 1700 platform for at least one more CPU lineup and that's Raptor Lake. Chipzilla confirmed that Raptor Lake CPUs will be compatible with the existing LGA 1700 motherboards based on the 600-series chipset. But like each generation motherboard makers will be offering a brand new lineup of motherboards based on the 700-series chipset which will come with higher I/O lanes. In addition to that Raptor Lake chips will be supporting DDR5-5600 speeds which is a nice bump over the native DDR5-5200 speeds that Alder Lake supports.

This offers a nice upgrade path to users who are currently running a mainstream Core i3 or Core i5 CPU and want to upgrade to a higher-end chip. They can simply replace their existing 12th Gen CPU with a higher-end Core i7 or Core i9 SKU which will increase the overall performance of their PC.

The 13th Gen CPU will also feature enhanced overclocking capabilities. Alder Lake currently goes up to 5.5 GHz with the upcoming Core i9-12900KS SKU which is rated at a maximum power rating of up to 260W the highest ever on the mainstream platform.

There's also a new AI M.2 module support that's supported by Raptor Lake CPUs and could have something to do with PCIe Gen 5 SSD support. The AI module could automatically detect a PCIe Gen 5 SSD and set the protocol of the M.2 slot to the newer standard though we have to learn more details about it. But as per the latest information we have there doesn't seem to be any storage Gen 5 lanes coming directly from the CPU and motherboard makers would have to split discrete GPU (x16 lanes) with M.2 storage ports to enable Gen 5 SSD support.

Intel 13th Gen 'Raptor Lake' CPUs Pricing

Intel's pricing strategy starting its 12th Gen Alder Lake lineup has been very aggressive and that has definitely helped them sell enough units to start making a dent in AMD's Ryzen market share. Segments such as the Core i5 and Core i7 are showing up in the 'Top 10 Sellers' on several NA & EU-based retailers.

Each segment has featured a disruptive price point and it is likely that Intel won't be adjusting or moving their prices up considering that they have a formidable opponent on the horizon in the form of the Ryzen 7000 series. As such we can expect the 13th Gen Raptor Lake Desktop CPUs to adopt the same prices as Alder Lake. Considering that there's a $150-180 US gap between the top Core i9 and Core i7 SKUs we can see Intel slot in two Core i9 SKUs one with 16 cores & the other with 24 cores for its next-gen lineup.

Intel 13th Gen 'Raptor Lake' CPUs Launch & Availability

As for launch and availability the Intel 13th Gen Raptor Lake Desktop CPUs are expected to launch alongside the 700-series chipset family on the 27th of September 2022. The following is the latest embargo for 13th Gen CPUs:

The shelve launch is positioned for 20th October which will be around a month after the next-gen AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs. Both AMD & Intel are known to push out their premium offerings first before moving into the mainstream/budget segment so expect Intel to introduce 'K' unlocked parts and Z790 boards before venturing into the non-K lineup.

So I got a few photos with a note “can you write something about these?” In those photos we have two new Xeon D-1700 codenamed “Ice Lake D” platforms and another Elkhart Lake platform with two of the three being fanless designs.

Supermicro Fanless Intel Xeon D-1700 at MWC 2022 and a 1U

First we have the fanless Supermicro SYS-E302-12D. This features at least two different Intel Ice Lake-D SKUs. One is a Xeon D-1718T quad core CPU. The other is an Intel Xeon D-1736NT 8-core part with 2nd generation QAT onboard. There are also dual 25GbE ports and quad 1GbE ports.

The rear I/O is similar to a E300 system we saw with fans the SYS-E300-12D-4CN6P previously.

The new Ice Lake-D platform brings some compute upgrades but more by way of networking PCIe Gen5 QAT and other acceleration versus the previous generations. If you missed it here is the launch piece: Welcome to the Intel Ice Lake D Era with the Xeon D-2700 and D-1700 series.

There was also a short-depth 1U system the SYS-510D-10C-FN6P at the show that seems to be based on the same motherboard but with active cooling.

This looks like a future firewall platform for many of our readers. We did not get to feature this platform in our Ice Lake-D launch article.

Aside from Xeon D there was also Intel Elkhart Lake in a fanless embedded platform.

This has the Atom-based Elkhart Lake processors. You will see it is a 4-core 12W model called the “x642SE” here but that is not a public SKU. We think the “S” should be a “5” and is the x6425E. Here we get quad 1GbE ports we also get video since the Atom CPU has an onboard GPU and we also get 10Gbps USB ports.

On the back we can see USB 2.0 and serial ports like we saw in our recent Supermicro X12STN-E Review. These are for industrial embedded applications.

Final Words

Since the main thrust of the Intel Ice Lake D series is really network and embedded applications these seem like cool platforms. I can see why I was sent a task about writing something about these photos. These are new platforms so it is always good to get to see them out in physical form instead of just on web pages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LXRvLWNoYW5nZS1zdGFydHVwLWRpc2stbWFjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Switch Startup Disks on Your Intel or Apple Silicon Mac,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LXRvLWNoYW5nZS1zdGFydHVwLWRpc2stbWFjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The average price of a gallon of self-serve regular gasoline in Los Angeles County rose to $5.247 on Saturday but some gas stations in the area have even higher prices.

The Shell gas station located at Olympic Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Mid-City was advertising regular unleaded at $6.99 a gallon. The price for premium was listed at $7.29 a gallon.

Each of the three highest increases since July 14 2015 have occurred over the past three days.

""My husband told me and was like '$6' and I was like 'What?!'"" said Joana Esparza who was pumping gas early Sunday morning. ""I think I put gas last week sometime and it was still four-something. So I was just like 'We need to go electric.' I think we need to already because that's insane. I don't think we've ever paid that ... ever.""

The average price rose 8.6 cents Thursday according to figures from the AAA and Oil Price Information Service.

The Orange County average price rose 10.3 cents to $5.238 - the largest increase since July 2015.

Oil industry analysts attribute the price spike to the possibility of a supply shortage because traders shippers insurance companies and banks are avoiding Russian oil transactions for fear of running afoul of Western sanctions.

Growing number of lawmakers call for US ban on Russian oil

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is joining U.S. senators in a video conference Saturday as the White House resists calls from a growing number of lawmakers to ban Russian oil.

Pump prices have reached record highs as the price of a barrel of Brent crude for May delivery on the Intercontinental Exchange rose Friday to its highest amount since Feb. 13 2013 $118.11 increasing $7.65. Its 25.49% increase for the week ($23.99) is the largest on record based on available data back to Jan. 11 1991.

Crude oil costs account for slightly more than half of the pump price according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The rest of the price includes the other components of gasoline production costs distribution costs overhead costs for all involved in production distribution and sales taxes and carbon offset fees in California paid by the refineries.

“Both Russia and Belarus rely heavily on the export of timber and wood products” explained the groups in a statement released on Thursday. “In 2021 the export of timber and wood products from the Russian Federation was US$13.9 billion.

They said that most of the wood is being sold directly or indirectly to the United States the European Union the United Kingdom Japan and China. The wood is used to make buildings paper clothes and furniture and to fuel power plants.

While recent EU sanctions against Lukashenko’s regime as Russia's chief collaborator in the war did include wood and timber the groups say it’s not clear that they also include processed goods such as furniture or paper.

“The financial resources the Russian and Belarussian governments gain from wood exports help to equip the Russian invaders fuel their tanks and produce their bombs. Therefore consuming Russian and Belarussian wood and timber products means supporting death and destruction in Ukraine” the groups said.

In addition to the call for boycott the environmental investigative NGO Earthsight included a list of the largest importers of Russian timber into the US and Europe. They include giants like the Finnish firms UPM Kymmene and Stora Enso as well as the U.S.-based International Paper which is the second largest paper producer in the world.

Last on their list was the popular Swedish furniture giant IKEA.

“Russia is IKEA's second largest source of wood. IKEA is also a major consumer of wood from Belarus” Earthsight explained. “IKEA made direct imports of wood furniture panels and finished furniture from Russia worth $33m in the year to 2021” it said.

Almost all of the panels came from IKEA's own factories in Russia and were shipped to IKEA furniture factories in Sweden and Poland. The finished furniture went to Germany France Austria Italy the U.S. and the U.K.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmpvdXJuYWwuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDYvb2JpdHVhcnlyYXltb25kLXJheS1tYXJjZWwtYnVzc2llcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: Raymond “Ray” Marcel Bussiere,"CANTON – Raymond “Ray” Marcel Bussiere beloved husband of Pauline Elinor Bussiere (Carlin) and much cherished father of four daughters died peacefully in his sleep March 2 2022.

Nonwovens

World Production

Capacity Crunch

The world fluff pulp industry and its end-users in hygiene and nonwoven markets are facing a pivotal year— according to the latest dedicated analysis from Smithers . For the short term in first quarter 2022 fluff pulp prices have hit record levels. Even as these subside the market will face capacity challenges realize the need to adjust to changes in hygiene product designs and look to capitalize on the potential of one of the most sustainable inputs for nonwovens.Exclusive data from the new Smithers Study—The Future of Fluff Pulp to 2027—show that in 2022 world demand will reach 6.9 million air dried tons with a value of $8.3 billion. This is up from 5.8 million air dried tons valued at $4.5 billion in 2017; with much of the value growth accounted for unprecedentedly high per ton prices now being paid. List prices in Q1 2022 are as high as $2000 per air dried metric ton—two to four times their historic average.Smithers’ analysis reveals that as the post-Covid recovery continues around the world a moderate increase in volume at 3.4% year-on-year will push world consumption to 8.1 million air dried tons in 2027. Over the same period prices will moderate downward meaning value growth will slow markedly with overall value reaching $8.6 billion in 2027.Demand in particular will be strong in developing economies in Asia and generally track demand for hygiene goods which are the main end-use for fluff pulp. The main use is in the absorbent cores of nappies/diapers toddler training pants adult incontinence goods and feminine hygiene products. Combined these will account for just under 90% of fluff pulp demand in 2022.This market while still healthy is undergoing changes especially in the switchover to product cores that contain less or non-fluff pulp. This has been pioneered by Procter &Gamble with its DryMax cores as well as other companies like Belgium’s Drylock Technologies.While these hygiene goods are essential products for nonwovens manufacturers this fluff pulp is not converted into a nonwoven substrate before integration. Fluff pulp does serve as a feedstock for fiber-based nonwovens—airlaid coform spunlace—as well. In 2022 Smithers analysis shows these will consume 636200 air dried tons of fluff pulp.These grades are directed primarily toward a few products—such as wipes and table covers—and airlaid is also employed in feminine hygiene goods. Overall fluff pulp consumption in nonwovens will increase over the next five years due to its superior sustainability credentials; fluff pulp is one of the most sustainable raw materials based on tree species grown with no irrigation and little or no pesticides on land with no value for food production.This trend market is most advanced in Europe where legislation—mainly the Single-use Plastics Directive—has focussed the industry to investigate non-polymer constructions as a priority and ‘ethical consumers’ will pay a premium for more recyclable goods. Airlaid is best positioned to capitalize on this demand and it will especially bolster products such as Glatfelter’s cellulosic bonded fluff pulp for wipes. For competitors the top R&D goal is to develop their own biodegradable non-plastic binders or bonding fibers.Coform will remain confined to Kimberly-Clark with use in a 60/40% blend with polypropylene for its Huggies-brand baby wipes.The fastest growing nonwovens segment that employs fluff pulp is spunlace mainly for use in home disinfectant wipes. This has been a boom market during the past two years of global pandemic but only two major suppliers have products that work well with the disinfectant chemicals needed for these wipes. This is restraining growth but it is anticipated that several other spunlace cleaning wipes will be launched before 2027.With record prices and rising demand future supply is a central concern for the industry. Fluff pulp is highly concentrated both geographically and in terms of companies active. North America will supply 83.5% of the global capacity in 2022. Indeed cultivation for fluff pulp is largely confined to eight southeastern states where southern softwoods—mainly loblolly and slash pine—grow best. And three U.S.-headquartered companies—International Paper Georgia-Pacific and Domtar/Paper Excellence—now account for three quarters of total world output.This means that historically the U.S. has been the only region in the world that is a net exporter of fluff pulp. In South America there have been several capacity expansions across 2017-2022 from Klabin Suzano and Arauco. This will lead to the region soon joining the U.S. as a net exporter potentially as soon as 2023. Suzano has also pioneered the use of eucalyptus fluff pulp—one of very few hardwood trees used—under the brand name Eucafluff. The resilience of eucalyptus trees means they could ultimately allow fluff pulp production to expand into other regions not suited to growing softwood species.Asia will also gain its first in-region fluff pulp capacity in 2022; when Daio Paper starts up its converted 90000 air dried ton per year mill at Mishima in Japan. This will only account for a fraction of Asian demand for fluff pulp over the next decade however with the majority of demand still met by imports. The economic sanctions resulting from the war in Ukraine will also slow any aspirations the Russian forestry sector have for diversifying into fluff pulp.Despite expansions in South America coming on stream Smithers analysis shows these are failing to keep up with demand meaning supply is increasingly becoming tight. In response the industry is increasingly relying on a small number of swing mills that can quickly switch between output of fluff pulp and other pulps as required by market conditions.In 2017 such swing mills accounted for under 27% of fluff pulp capacity in 2022 this is projected to rise to just over 36%. While a few dedicated fluff pulp expansions are anticipated through to 2027 overall these will not keep pace with demand increases making swing mills even more important. This in turn will be dependent on fluff pulp remaining a higher margin product than other potential outputs—mainly southern bleached softwood kraft.The current and future market outlook for fluff pulp in nonwovens and other products is profiled in depth in the new Smithers study The Future of Fluff Pulp to 2027; including detailed analyses of end-uses technology developments and the output of all major fluff pulp mills worldwide.This essential business guide as the industry transitions through a pivotal year is available to purchase now from Smithers."

Despite a near-perfect record of his own Quinn likely wasn’t the favorite to most. But he had other ideas.

The senior scored a reversal in the second period and quickly transitioned it into a pinfall against New Lothrop’s Isiah Pasik to earn his first MHSAA Finals title.

Dealing with a small team at Mason County Central Quinn (51-1) credited the victory over Pasik (46-1) to his coaching staff family and friends who have all put time on the mat with him.

“I’ve got three older brothers up there watching me. They have pushed me my whole life” Quinn said. “There’s tons of people that came to the wrestling room to help me out. We don’t have a big team so I get to beat up on these guys (the coaches) every day.

“There’s tons of people to thank. I didn’t do it alone.”

103

Champion: Logan Gilbert Martin/Climax-Scotts Fr. (41-6)

Decision 10-5 over Logan Mears Union City Fr. (45-5)

Gilbert knew what he needed to do to come away with the 103-pound title.

Having faced Mears three previous times this season and winning all three he just stuck to his game plan.

“I was just trying to stop the switch on bottom. (Mears) loves to hit that and he’s really good at it. In neutral he likes to hit the slot but I tried to tie him up with my right arm” Gilbert said. “I was ready for him.”

Gilbert kept the pressure and scored five takedowns during the match.

“I don’t think it has hit me yet” Gilbert said of winning a title. “I don’t know what I am feeling right now but it feels good.”

112

Champion: Jacob Bunn Manchester Sr. (46-2)

Decision 5-2 over Trent Kimmel Martin/Climax-Scotts Sr. (37-3)

Making his fourth Finals appearance Bunn finally got through to the top of the mountain.

“It’s something I have been working toward for 14 years now” Bunn said. “I am just glad that I was able to get to the top in my senior year.”

It was a hard-fought win for the Manchester senior as he held off a late surge from Kimmel.

“Even before the match I just was thinking that it was another match and I couldn’t change up my style because it was a state final” Bunn said. “I went out there and just didn’t let the pressure get to me and stayed focused.”

119

Champion: Shawn McGuire Iron Mountain Jr. (39-2)

Decision 5-0 over Tyler Winch Iron Mountain Soph. (32-14)

It was a bittersweet championship victory for McGuire the junior as he dispatched of his Iron Mountain sophomore teammate for the title.

“It’s tough. It’s like your worst nightmare” McGuire said. “I can never imagine going against my teammate especially in a state final. It was difficult.”

McGuire controlled the match from start to finish scoring a pair of takedowns and adding an escape while keeping Winch from getting on the scoreboard.

“It does feel great to be a champion. I’ve worked really hard for this” McGuire said. “I’ve come close in the past and lost but I just kept working toward this goal. It’s hard to put into words.”

125

Champion: Landyn Crance Union City Soph. (45-3)

Decision 8-1 over Austin Marry Hudson Soph. (27-12)

As a freshman Crance saw his chances at competing for a Finals title ended by COVID-19. This year he made sure to make the most of his opportunity.

“Last year was devastating having it all taken away from me because of COVID. But I knew I just wanted to work harder this year to make up for it” Crance said.

Crance started fast and never looked back maintaining control of Marry throughout the six minutes.

“I knew I had to ride tight and stay on top” Crance said. “I knew getting off the bottom would be difficult with (Marry) so I just had to keep control of him.”

130

Champion: Derek Mayle Breckenridge Sr. (38-3)

Major Decision 14-1 over Dalton Birchmeier New Lothrop Fr. (31-13)

Mayle made sure his last match was one of his best.

The Breckenridge senior came within inches of a pinfall victory but still came away with a 14-1 win.

“This was the last match of my life so I just wanted to go out and have fun and end it on a bang” Mayle said. “I wanted to make sure that I didn’t leave anything on the mat.”

Mayle overwhelmed Birchmeier whom he had seen before in Regional competition. Still the New Lothrop freshman fought hard to see the full six minutes.

“I was pretty confident but I didn’t want to take the match lightly” Mayle said. “I just needed to stay disciplined and keep attacking.”

135

Champion: River Roberson Hesperia Sr. (45-2)

Decision 10-7 over Payton Rogers Hudson Sr. (33-7)

In one of the more back-and-forth matches of the Division 4 Finals Roberson grinded out a 10-7 win.

“It’s hard to believe but it’s an amazing feeling” Roberson said. “I’ve worked so hard for this it’s hard to believe it’s actually happened.”

Roberson found himself in a nearfall situation early in the match but battled back to take control. Once he got it he didn’t allow Rogers to get it back.

“When (Rogers) got the first takedown it kind of made me nervous. But I knew what I have been through to get here” Roberson said. “My coaches put me through a lot of intense training to be ready for matches like this.”

140

Champion: Manus Bennett Marlette Jr. (43-0)

Decision 2-0 over Bronson Marry Hudson Sr. (27-3)

In a matchup of two past champions Bennett scored a takedown in the second period to find a way past Marry.

“A lot of it was just mental technique for me. I knew if I could get the takedown I am really good at riding legs” Bennett said. “I knew he was a good wrestler. I just had to not allow him to work his strengths and find a way to work mine.”

The 103-pound champion in 2020 Bennett used his riding ability and endurance to hang on for his second title.

“Wrestling is the longest six minutes of your life. Two minutes can feel like years” Bennett said. “Seeing that clock finally hit zero it was a lot of relief.”

145

Champion: Sebastian Martinez Riverview Gabriel Richard Fr. (33-4)

Decision 4-1 over Dillon Raab Bark River-Harris Jr. (34-3)

Martinez became the first Finals champion in the young history of the Gabriel Richard program by scoring a pair of key takedowns.

“I am starting a new legacy for future Pioneers coming to this school” Martinez said of being the first champion. “This program is going to be something great and I am just glad I got to be the first.”

Leading 2-1 entering the third period Martinez didn’t get passive. He made an aggressive shot on Raab and earned a powerful takedown to lock up the victory.

“I was just trying to hold on but the best defense is a great offense” Martinez said. “I decided to take the shot in the third and managed to get the takedown to really secure the win.”

152

Champion: Parker Stroud Iron Mountain Sr. (41-6)

Decision 11-9 over Josh Collins Hemlock Sr. (41-5)

Stroud ended his prep wrestling career with a championship but wasn’t too thrilled with his performance in an exciting 11-9 victory over Collins.

“It feels pretty good but I didn’t really wrestle my best. It takes a little away from it but it still feels good to be a champion” Stroud said.

Stroud was getting a number of takedowns but Collins would respond with reversals and threaten to take the victory. It took an explosive takedown from Stroud to get the go-ahead points in the closing seconds.

“I was wrestling pretty well but I wasn’t getting much done on top” Stroud said. “I just managed to get the score in the end.”

160

Champion: Shenard Foster Detroit Loyola Sr. (17-0)

Decision 5-4 over Gavin Wilmoth Traverse City St. Francis Sr. (39-3)

After losing in overtime of last year’s championship match Foster was determined to not let that happen again this year.

The Detroit Loyola senior used his explosiveness and athleticism to top Wilmoth last year’s 152-pound champion.

“It feels great. I fell short last year so it feels great to win (a title) this year” Foster said. “It motivated me a lot because I knew I could do it.”

Foster was able to score two takedowns in the match while adding an escape. That’s all he needed as Wilmoth was unable to get him to the ground.

“I just had to stay smart. I am used to wrestling guys that are taller than me. (Wilmoth) was my height so I just had to be aggressive. I knew he couldn’t stop my shots” Foster said.

171

Champion: Cole Hopkins Evart Jr. (54-0)

Major Decision 15-7 over Noah Etnyre Lutheran Westland Jr. (48-5)

Hopkins completed an unbeaten junior season and avenged his lone loss in the 2021 Finals by scoring a major decision in the 171-pound championship match.

“That is the greatest feeling in the world” Hopkins said. “Since that day (last year’s loss) it’s been eating me alive. Every time I wake up that’s what I have been thinking about and it made me go harder.”

It was all about the takedowns for Hopkins as he repeatedly got Etnyre to the ground. He scored a quick takedown in the first and never trailed in the match.

“I just had to not wrestle scared” Hopkins said. “I had been here before so that gave me the confidence to wrestle that much harder and get the job done.”

189

Champion: Drew Allgeyer Bark River-Harris Jr. (40-4)

Decision 9-5 over Cameron Kimble Hudson Sr. (43-2)

It wasn’t always easy for Allgeyer but he led throughout the match to kick off the Division 4 Finals and earn his first championship.

“It feels amazing” Allgeyer said. “I am on top of the world.”

Allgeyer secured some early takedowns but Kimble put up a game effort with a reversal in the second period to keep things interesting. In the end Allgeyer pushed a pace that Kimble couldn’t quite match.

“When I was warming up I just kept telling myself that these six minutes were going to be mine” Allgeyer said. “That’s the way that I wrestle every single match.”

215

Champion: Caden Ferris Delton Kellogg Sr. (49-0)

Major Decision 10-2 over Grayson Orr New Lothrop Jr. (47-6)

Caden Ferris will be a name the Orr family is likely never to forget.

The Delton Kellogg senior won a second consecutive title at 215 pounds with a dominant 10-2 win over Grayson Orr on Saturday.

Last year Ferris defeated Grayson’s brother Camden Orr in the 215-pound final by a score of 13-11 in OT.

“It’s pretty cool” Ferris said of winning another title. “I’m feeling pretty good about it. I was pretty focused on winning.”

Among those eight grapplers are two who will be vying for a state championship and six who have yet to earn their exact spot in the medal round. Four of those six don the maroon of gray of Union City while two call Bronson their home.

After a long day of wrestling at Ford Field and after three grueling rounds of battle a pair of Chargers will wrestle for a state title as freshman Logan Mears and sophomore Landyn Crance will both toe the line with a state championship at stake.

Mears 45-4 on the season battled his way through the 103 pound weight class to punch his ticket to the biggest stage of high school wrestling in Michigan in just his rookie season. Mears started off his trek with a first round pin fall win over Bryant Wing of LeRoy Pine River in 3:03 followed up by a quarterfinal pin fall win over Blake Wendling of New Lothrop in 2:20. To punch his ticket to the finals Mears earned a pin fall victory over Colin Kuhn of St. Louis in 2:28 in the semifinals. Mears will face a familiar foe in the 103 pound state championship as he will take on Logan Gilbert of Martin (40-6). The two grapplers have met three times on the season with Gilbert taking wins in all three match ups via decision including their respective meetings in both the District and Regional finals meaning three of Mears’ four losses on the season have come at the hands of Gilbert.

Crance 44-3 on the year will face off with Austin Marry of Hudson in the championship match at 125 pounds. Crance missed out on last year’s postseason after being close contacted just before the district round after completing the regular season with an unbeaten record. As heartbreaking as that was for the sophomore it was further motivation for this season which has seen Crance only suffer one Division Four loss all season long. Crance kicked off his state championship meet with a first round pin fall win over Norman Slade of Ravenna in 1:12 followed by a 7-1 decision win over Nathan Peters of Memphis in the quarterfinals. In the semifinal round Crance used a takedown in the final :10 seconds of the match to take the dramatic 4-3 decision over Travis Frederick of Jackson Lumen Christi punching his ticket to the state finals where he will face Marry.

Union City has four other wrestlers who are assured a spot on the podium with that spot yet to be determined for each.

At 140 pounds is senior Brayton Mears (38-5) who dropped a heartbreaker to Manus Bennett of Marlette in the semifinals to advance to the consolation bracket. Bennett hit a takedown with only seconds remaining to take the win 4-2. Mears now moves on to the consolation semifinals where he will either face Alex Miller of Homer or Joseph Dawe of Ithaca with a chance at competing for third place on the line. The winner will move on to the third place match while the loser will advance on to the fifth place match.

At 160 pounds is senior Garrett Iobe (47-3) who advanced to the semifinals before falling to the undefeated Shenard Foster of Detroit Loyola via a 10-4 decision. Iobe now moves on to face either Zeke Thompson of Ravenna or Matt Riehle of Springport in the consolation semifinals. The winner will move on to battle for third place while the loser will advance to the fifth place match.

At 145 pounds junior Colton Russell (45-7) will look to possibly work his way to the third place matchup after falling in the quarterfinals of his tournament to Anthony Ward of Oscoda via a 4-3 decision. Russell took a win in the second round of the consolation bracket to assure his All State status defeating Wyatt Underhill of LeRoy Pine River by a 5-0 decision. Russell will now move on to face Evan Haferkorn of Iron Mountain (38-7) in the third round of the consolation bracket. The winner of that match will move on to face Martine Wiggins of St. Louis with a chance at the third place match while the loser will wrestle for seventh place.

The final Charger who is vying for his spot on the podium is junior Grady Iobe (41-4) who will compete at 215 pounds. Iobe found his way to the consolation bracket after dropping a heartbreaking 4-3 decision to state finalist Grayson Orr of New Lothrop in the quarterfinals. Iobe won his first match in the consolation round by a 5-1 decision over Seth Miller of White Pigeon. Iobe will now face Philip McLaurin of Niles Brandywine (42-8) in consolation round three. The winner will move on to face Logan Sallows of Hudson for a chance to wrestle for third place while the loser will wrestle for seventh place.

Also competing for Union City on the day but falling short in their bid for All State status was junior Garrett Halder at 189 pounds freshman Aidan Taylor at 130 pounds and freshman Montana Connell at 135 pounds. All three went 0-2 to see their state championship runs come to an end.

The Bronson Vikings have two of their six wrestlers still remaining in the tournament as junior Jacob Dixon is still alive in the 189 pound weight class while sophomore Aiden Fill remains in the 103 pound weight class.

Dixon (31-17) won his first match of the day via pin fall over Michael Tuomi of Rochester Hills Lutheran Northwest in 3:33 leading up to a tough battle with number two ranked Drew Allgeyer of Bark River Harris. Dixon ran into a buzzsaw in the quarterfinal round falling via 15-0 Technical Fall to Allgeyer sending Dixon to the consolation bracket. Dixon assured himself a spot on the podium after defeating Harley Robinson of Homer via pin fall in 2:52 to advance to the third round of consolation wrestling. Dixon will now face Triston Almanza of Blanchard Montebella in the third round of the consolation bracket. The winner will move on to face Cooper Symons of New Lothrop for a chance at competing for third place while the loser will advance to the seventh place match.

At 103 pounds Fill 42-13 on the year kicked off his day with a pin fall win over Alexander Wilson of Iron Mountain in 4:37. In round two of the tournament Fill dropped a pin fall loss to Cameron Perez of Lakeview in 2:50 sending the Viking sophomore to the consolation bracket. Fill assured himself an All State honor with a consolation round two win over Stephen Hertzfeld of East Jackson by a 7-1 decision. Fill will now take on a Joe Perez of Lakeview the brother of Fill’s second round opponent Cameron Perez. The winner will face off with Colin Kuhn of St. Louis with a chance to wrestle for third place on the line the loser will advance on to wrestle for seventh place.

Also competing for Bronson but falling just short on the day was Perry Lake who finished 1-3 Devlin Duff who finished 0-2 Carson Norton who finished 0-2 and Jacob Britten who finished 1-2 after taking a win in the opening round.

Full results for all four of the additional Viking wrestlers will appear in the final write up of the state finals.

Division Three

The Quincy Orioles sent three wrestlers to the MHSAA State Finals in Davin George at 189 pounds Hamilton Spieth at 215 pounds and Jacob Reif at 125 pounds.

George and Spieth both dropped their first two matches of the day and were eliminated from the tournament.

Reif meanwhile took a win in his first match of the day a pin fall victory over Sam Vesperman of Grosse Ille in 4:48. Reif was bumped to the consolation bracket after falling via pin fall to Michael Wilson of Grand Rapids Catholic Central in the quarterfinal round. Reif dropped his second round consolation match to Tyler Geer of Remus Chippewa Hills by a 7-2 decision to see his trip to the state finals come to a close.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Four men in black tactical gear pinned him his face to the concrete to cuff his hands behind his back.

He did not resist. He couldn’t. He was so gravely dehydrated he would be dead by their next shift change.

“I didn’t do anything” Mr. Johnson moaned as they pressed a shield between his shoulders.

It was 1:19 p.m. on Sept. 6 2019 in the Danville Correctional Center a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson 21 and serving a short sentence for gun possession was in the throes of a mental collapse that had gone largely untreated but hardly unwatched.

He had entered in good health with hopes of using the time to gain work skills. But for the previous three weeks Mr. Johnson who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia had refused to eat or take his medication. Most dangerous of all he had stealthily stopped drinking water hastening the physical collapse that often accompanies full-scale mental crises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9sb2NhbC1kaXNhc3Rlci1kZWNsYXJhdGlvbi1pc3N1ZWQtaW4tam9obnNvbi1jb3VudHktYWZ0ZXItZGVhZGx5LWZsb29kaW5nLXN0b3Jtcy8zNTM0NTU4L9IBgQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNkZncuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbG9jYWwtZGlzYXN0ZXItZGVjbGFyYXRpb24taXNzdWVkLWluLWpvaG5zb24tY291bnR5LWFmdGVyLWRlYWRseS1mbG9vZGluZy1zdG9ybXMvMzUzNDU1OC8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local disaster declaration issued in Johnson County after deadly flooding storms,"Over the weekend Johnson County in North Texas was hit hard with severe storms and flooding leading to a local disaster declaration issued by the county judge on Monday.

At the height of the disaster 32 roads were closed due to flooding and emergency crews responded to 17 high-water rescues. Unfortunately one of these rescues was for a little boy who was found dead hours after being swept away by floodwaters early Sunday morning.

Johnson County Emergency Management Director Jamie Moore described the situation as ""scary to be in fast water.""

""It's been a difficult time for Johnson County over the last several days"" said Moore.

Emergency crews from across the county worked tirelessly to rescue those trapped in the floodwaters including Moore himself who was caught in high water on the way to rescue the Warren family.

""I accelerated and came around the corner and ended up in high water and my vehicle was surrounded"" Moore said. He had to work on top of his truck. ""I ended up spending the next hour and a half on top of my truck.""

Across the city of Venus firefighters responded to another high water rescue on County Road 616. Firefighters said a woman who was eight months pregnant was trapped.

""We witnessed a car that was being swept off the bridge into flood waters"" said Venue Fire Department Engineer Zach Hagaman.

""By some miracle I don't know how she was able to grab ahold of a tree and she climbed up higher into the tree to escape the flood waters which was still inaccessible for us but it bought us a little more time.""

Hagaman said he tied a rope to his waist and tried to walk through the swift water to the woman but could not reach her. A swift water rescue crew from Red Oak was able to get her to safety.

As the county continues to deal with the aftermath of the severe storms and flooding residents are encouraged to stay informed and heed any warnings issued by local authorities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YWhvby5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9kd2F5bmUtam9obnNvbi1pcy1kaWZmaWN1bHQtdG8td29yay13aXRoLXJlcG9ydC1jbGFpbXMtdGhlLXN0YXItaGFzLW1vdW50YWlucy1vZi1wdWJsaWMtZ29vZHdpbGwtdG8tb2Zmc2V0LW5lZ2F0aXZpdHktZXhwZXJ0LXNheXMtMTcxNDAyNDM4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dwayne Johnson is difficult to work with report claims. The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvc2VhbmRncmFoYW0uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcm9nZXItam9obnNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Lane Johnson Obituary 2024,"Garner NC: At 5:14AM on May 5 2024 Heaven gained another angel when Roger Lane Johnson age 72 known to many as “Rog” or the “Running Man” won his battle with cancer.

It has been an interesting offseason for the Bengals... There were solid free-agency pickups and a good draft class but two trade requests since the end of last season.

One of those trade requests came from Tee Higgins after the Bengals placed the franchise tag on him.

There has been little to no progress since the trade request according to reports but Zac Taylor has made it clear he looks forward to seeing Higgins for the 2024 season.

Cincinnati Bengals legend Chad Ochocinco hit on the topic recently and says he has been in contact with Higgins “a few times.”

“I think we’re going to work it out. We’ll figure it out” Ochocinco said when asked about the contract issues between the two sides according to TMZ Sports.

Higgins is set to make over $20 million this season with the franchise tag but it is clear he wants long-term security as well.

Ochocinco ended his conversation with TMZ saying “It’s business — it’s the nature of the business. He’s going to be all right though.”

We will see what the long-term future holds for Higgins and the Bengals but as of right now I expect to see him suited up in week one and ready to roll."

Compared with the deep economic crisis brought about in the country by Western sanctions the consequences for the rich world have been small. Though American stocks fell sharply when the war started on February 24th on March 2nd they closed almost 4% higher than their level the night before the invasion. European stocks are about 4% down—a big hit but nothing compared with the financial rout under way in Russia where the currency has collapsed and stockmarket trading has been suspended for days.

In part the muted reaction reflects Russia’s low weight in the global economy: about 2% in dollar terms. The country’s relative poverty and smaller population when compared with the rest of Europe mean that its exporters depend on European demand but not vice versa. Goldman Sachs a bank estimates that the loss of exports caused by a 10% fall in Russian spending would cost the euro zone only about 0.1% of its GDP  and Britain still less.

The upcoming store will be located on the northeast corner of Custer Road and Eldorado Parkway and will open in 2023.

“We are thrilled to be breaking ground on our third store in Collin County in the vibrant community of McKinney” said Juan-Carlos Rück H-E-B’s executive vice president of North West Food Drug. “Our company just like the city of McKinney has a rich history in Texas. We have a passion and commitment to serve the cities in which we operate. We look forward to adding more than 500 McKinney Partners to our H-E-B family and giving back to organizations that help this area thrive.”

H-E-B also announced at the groundbreaking that it would be donating $10000 to nonprofit organizations to mark the occasion including Seed Project Foundation Community Garden Kitchen Love Life Foundation Hugs Café and City Church.

H-E-B ’s future store will have a modern distinctive character designed to integrate and look like a part of the McKinney community. Other features will include a large curbside zone at the back of the store a fuel station and car wash a pharmacy drive-thru and a True Texas BBQ.

“Today is an exciting day for our community as we break ground on this highly-anticipated store in the City of McKinney. H-E-B is famous for its wildly committed fanbase and unwavering commitment to the communities they serve” said McKinney Mayor George Fuller. “We are proud to be part of the growing H-E-B family in Texas and give our residents more options to keep their dollars local.”

The plans for the store in McKinney were first introduced in June 2021 when the company initially announced the completion date as spring 2023. The project is now set to be completed in late 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's Easier With X-Rays,"Here’s an interesting and detailed teardown and repair of a Keithley 2001 7.5 Digit multimeter that is positively dripping with detail. It’s also not every day that we get to see someone using x-ray imaging to evaluate the extent of PCB damage caused by failed electrolytic capacitors.

Sadly this particular model is especially subject to that exact vintage electronics issue: electrolytic capacitor failure and leakage. These failures can lead to destroyed traces and this particular unit had a number of them (in addition to a few destroyed diodes just for good measure.) That’s where the x-ray machine comes in handy because some of the damage is hidden inside the multi-layer PCBs.

[Shahriar] perhaps best known as [The Signal Path] narrates the entire process of fixing up the high-quality benchtop multimeter in a video embedded below (or you can skip directly to the x-ray machine being broken out.) [Shahriar] was able to repair the device thanks in part to it being in relatively good shape and having the right tools available.

However the Beckman Instruments building located at 4300 North Harbor Boulevard is still standing and was just selected to receive a 2021 Governor’s Historic Preservation Award. This award is the only official preservation award presented by the State of California to recognize exceptional achievements in the field of historic preservation. While the awards ceremony won’t occur until April I wanted to take a deeper look at the history of the Beckman Instruments Administrative Building.

According to Bob Ziebell’s Fullerton: A Pictorial History “The company dates back to 1935 when a young chemistry professor at the California Institute of Technology used his skill and inventiveness to build a simple pH meter for a scientist friend.” This professor was Dr. Arnold O. Beckman and he worked with two students in a metal shed to develop a pH meter or acidimeter a device that could precisely determine the acidity or alkalinity of any solution. The pH meter became such a huge success within the scientific community that Beckman was able to resign from his teaching job at CalTech and take on the full-time role as President of National Technical Laboratories.

With World War II underway there was a greater demand for scientific instruments. According to the Fullerton Heritage webpage for Beckman Instruments Beckman realized there was a “great need for new spectroscopic instrumentation. In the 1940s he invented the first quartz spectrophometer the commercial infrared spectrophometer the precision helical potentiometer the analytical ultracentrifuge the direct-writing oscillographic recorder and the automatic amino acid analyzer.” The DU Spectrophometer helped revolutionize chemical measurement to the point where many scientists divide the history of biochemistry into periods pre-DU and post-DU. All these ground-breaking scientific inventions led to the growth of National Technical Laboratories which was renamed Beckman Instruments Inc. in 1950.

In 1953 the company needed additional space so they started construction on an expensive factory and headquarters here in Fullerton which cost $2.5 million to build. Beckman Instruments’ headquarters and plant were established on a forty-acre orange grove in unincorporated land between La Habra and Fullerton “at a time when Fullerton was just beginning to industrialize” leading to an economic boom “for the still mostly rural city” according to Fullerton Heritage.

The 43000-square-foot structure was the first large high-tech industrial “campus” to be developed in Fullerton and one of the earliest in Orange County. According to historian Arnold Thackray in the book Arnold O. Beckman: One Hundred Years of Excellence “The design was highly modern centered on the concept of flexibility for further expansion. Additional space could be easily constructed and integrated and any interior spaces could be reconfigured quickly and efficiently. Such a flexible design befitted a firm dedicated to new instrumentation in a growing array of technologies.” The buildings were interconnected and there was extensive landscaping. Its Mid-Century Modern architecture was the precursor to many other major manufacturing companies in Fullerton in the 1950s and 60s.

Most of the plants and factories constructed in Fullerton during the postwar era were box-like structures. Some companies hired notable architects such as Kimberly-Clark employing Skidmore Owing and Merrill and the American Electronics Plant hiring Eugene Choy according to American Architects Directory. However most of the architectural designs coming out of the postwar era weren’t remarkable. Beckman Instruments hired architect Lawrence Whitney Davidson to design their new facility according to Fullerton Heritage. Davidson whose early work was done in the Mid-Century Modern style went on to design golf clubhouses industrial plants movie studios school classrooms and municipal buildings transitioning easily between private military and public works projects. He had a strong background in both architecture and engineering and had designed other manufacturing plants before his Fullerton project. In the 1950s and 1960s the Beckman administrative office building became a recognized architectural symbol of the scientific instruments company.

In an article in the February 20 1953 issue of the Fullerton News Tribune Beckman acknowledged that he had selected Fullerton because of its low tax rate and ample supply of water to run his operations. He also thought that Fullerton’s residential areas would be a good fit for his present and future employees. In November 1954 when the Beckman facility officially opened 8000 people toured the building which was an impressive number of visitors given that Fullerton’s population at the time was only 13958. In 1955 Beckman was chosen from a pool of 500 plant-of-the-year candidates to be honored with the Significant Plant Award from the national magazine Factory Management & Maintenance. “Faced with extraordinary requirements for flexibility and expandability Beckman meets both demands to a remarkable degree with a plant that is also a pacesetter in appearance and employee services” noted the magazine.

Beginning with this Fullerton location Beckman Instruments would grow from scattered locations into a unified cohesive multinational corporation and in the next 30 years would become one of the most recognizable firms in the world.

Nine hundred workers were hired at the Beckman facility many of whom relocated from Pasadena and South Pasadena. Beckman Instruments required “a multitude of scientific professions crafts and skilled workers” according to Fullerton Heritage. Over the decades the company would go on to employ thousands of Fullerton residents many of whom spent a large part of their lives at the Harbor Boulevard facility. The firm also hired a lot of Fullerton College and Cal State Fullerton graduates. Several former employees and company executives eventually left Beckman Instruments to form new companies such as the International Biotronics Corporation and an active group of Beckman retirees still meet in Fullerton.

By the time it closed its doors in 2010 Beckman Instruments had become a world leader in the development and manufacturing of products for scientific industries medicine education space exploration and defense with its products helping scientific communities all over the world. Interestingly scientists working on the Human Genome Project used Beckman’s Biomek 1000 robotic workstation in their study of DNA structure. Beckman Instruments had become a source of pride to local residents and a business hallmark for the City. The company built its reputation by making generous donations to local Fullerton groups including St. Jude Hospital the Boys Club the United Fullerton Fund and the Children’s League of Fullerton. Beckman gave away dozens of scholarships to local high school and college students; donated instruments to Fullerton College and CSUF; and provided funding for science and technology exhibits programs and field trips.

Today the building is the home of A.J. Kirkwood Electric a company involved in construction electrical engineering and systems technologies and is located in the Beckman Business Center. Fullerton Heritage has helped preserve the building with few alterations. The city of Fullerton recently received a letter from the California Office of Historic Preservation notifying them that the Beckman Instruments Administrative Building is among the projects selected to receive a 2021 Governor’s Historic Preservation Award. The letter was signed by Julianne Polanco State Historic Preservation Officer and was sent on behalf of Governor Gavin Newsom. The ceremony for the Governor’s Awards will be held Thursday April 28 in Sacramento.

By Raymond Chimhandamba

Handas Consulting (Africa Market Nonwoven/Hygiene Specialist)

Johannesburg South Africa



Increasing investment in Africa’s nonwovens sector by global players and other foreign producers is one of the key indicators of the potential that the sector offers. Kohan’s Textile Journal points out that the nonwoven sector growth has been in line with periods of high economic growth in the region and also notes that key drivers for the sector are rising spending power of the local population as well as growth in the medical and hygiene sectors and in the plastic industry. Increased awareness urbanization and population growth will also increase demand. Africa’s growing construction sector will also increase demand for geotextiles and roofing while the growing automotives industry will feed into the demand for nonwoven-based filtration media. The aging population will boost demand for medical and surgical products.



Key global players like Fibertex PFNonwovens and Spunchem are among some of the key global players that have production facilities in South Africa. Fibertex South Africa is a leading manufacturer and supplier of a comprehensive range of geotextile products throughout Africa while PFNonwovens has recently invested about $40 million to expand its nonwovens facility in Cape Town which serves the hygiene industry for South Africa and the rest of the region. Spunchem also services the hygiene sector as well as the nonwovens needs for the agricultural sector and medical sectors with meltblown.



Kenya South Africa and Nigeria are the leading hubs for the demand of nonwovens in the East Southern and Western sub-regions respectively. Kenya leads the demand for imported nonwoven raw materials and finished goods in East Africa. In the absorbent hygiene space Kenya has its own local players such as Interconsumer Products Limited and has attracted China’s Sunda which has built the biggest absorbent hygiene factory in East Africa. One can expect other global players to follow in the short to medium term.



Both Kimberly-Clark and Proctor & Gamble are very active in South Africa’s absorbent hygiene products sector together with several other significant local players that either lead categories such as Unsgaard the market leader in the pantyliners category or are in the top three or significant players in private label like National Pride Li’l Masters and Cleopatra Products. In Nigeria Kimberly-Clark has recently commissioned its absorbent hygiene facility. Hayat has also been manufacturing its diapers locally for several years and is now a market leader in the category. Still in Nigeria local player Wemy Industries leads the market in wet wipes and face masks while other local players like Eleganza Industries keep increasing marketshare within the absorbent hygiene products sector. Andritz will soon supply two baby diaper lines to Fouani Nigeria indicating the growing demand for nonwovens in that country and the region as well as the localization drive for nonwovens absorbent hygiene products.



Ethiopia’s massive population the second biggest on the continent attracted another leading global player Ontex which installed a high speed baby diaper line a few years ago. In Ghana Sunda boasts local manufacturing capability in the baby diaper sanitary pad diaper pants and panty liner categories. SAH (Societe D’Articles Hygeniques) a rapidly growing husband and wife group with roots in Tunisia is also setting up new manufacturing sites in Sub-Saharan Africa. With manufacturing sites in Cote D’Ivoire and Senegal and a previous focus on francophone Africa SAH is fast expanding into English-speaking Africa in more recent years starting with distribution capability.



Sanitary pads are not readily available for young girls in the region especially in rural and/or remote places because of cost. As a result girls in most parts of the region miss up to four or five days of school every month creating a gender and even generational disadvantage. As a result most governments (Kenya South Africa Zimbabwe and several others) have done away with VAT on sanitary pads. This development is likely to drive the growth of the category even further. Adult incontinence is another growing opportunity in the region driven by growing awareness. Local production in the main regional hubs is also growing. In Nigeria Dr Browns is a Wemy Industries brand that has been around for decades and is well established. Previously only available via the pharmacies regionally adult incontinence products are slowly becoming more readily available in retail and the price is gradually dropping. As the products become more available in retail an optimal price point will gradually be reached and this will drive demand and raise awareness even further. The growth of the retail sector goes hand in hand with the growth of AHP’s in the region owing to the cyclical nature of AHP products which ensures that consumers need them at regular intervals and for set durations of their lifetimes.



Most raw materials for absorbent hygiene products in the region are still imported from South America Egypt China or South Africa. Egypt takes full advantage of its membership of COMESA (Common Market For Eastern and Southern Africa) economic block to export to mainly East African markets.

Nonwovens Specialization in the Africa Region I have been fascinated with the level of specialization of some of the nonwovens players on the African continent particularly within the Sub-Saharan Africa region. In South Africa Gelvenor Textiles focuses on technically engineered fabrics and has been around since 1965. Areas of specialization include a variety of aeronautical textiles industrial fabrics protective workwear technical apparel and high performance outdoor textile fabrics. Over the past five decades the company has innovated a wide range of internationally acclaimed and trusted fabric solutions. The fabric innovations are tested by the independent Advanced Textile Services (ATS) to prove that the products meet the stringent internationally accredited standards.



Gelvenor Textiles is the first African manufacturer of aeronautical fabrics and has pioneered the manufacturing of aeronautical fabric to the African market as far back as 1967 and has continued to innovate in this field focusing on parachutes hot air balloons paraglider and aircraft coverings. This company from the Southern tip of Africa has made its mark in innovative fabric solutions that have shaped and influenced both the South African and international textile industries. Their achievements include pioneering a water-based coating for parachutes producing South Africa’s first flame retardant fabric and—since 1994—holding the title of Africa’s largest weaver of aramid fabrics for ballistic protection according to their website.



In the plastics space Da Run Fa Chemical Fibre is a producer of regen polyester staple fiber and PET straps for packaging for the local and export markets. Da Run Fa‘s manufacturing process consumes about 2000 tons of Regen PET per month as feedstock and by creating this sustainable demand for regen PET the company adds to the PET value chain and contributes to South Africa’s efforts towards a circular economy.



According to PETCO’s website the industry partner Da Run Fa’s innovative use of recycled PET bottles creates a lucrative purpose for a product which would otherwise have reached the end of its lifecycle. This also has a positive indirect impact on the economy as marginalized communities start collecting recyclables and develop recycling businesses or cooperatives that create job opportunities. South Africa has one of the highest unemployment rates on the continent and by global standards the plastic recycling industry has provided one the best income generators for families and the unemployed making South Africa one of the countries with the highest recycling rates globally above 40% according to Plastics SA a plastics industry body.



Sen Li Da Chemical Fibre through its two main divisions: a Recycling Division and a Fibre Division has responded to the increasing demand by consumers and industry for plastic recycling by using post-consumer PET for the opportunities of the hollow conjugated fibers market. In 2008 Sen Li Da set up a PET recycling and fiber manufacturing plant in Kwazulu-Natal. At first the plant was able to recycle 19500 tons of PET and convert 13600 tons of PET to fibers per year by purchasing and using post-consumer PET products for this purpose.



Brits Nonwoven another specialist nonwovens player in South Africa is a leading South African specialist nonwoven producer that services a wide range of industries and applications in both local and international markets. Their products include Isotherm thermal insulation for geyser blankets to ensure that house owners save power by ensuring their geysers do not lose too much heat unnecessarily in the ceiling in winter. Electric blankets help to ensure that this does not happen.



Acoustisorb is a light compressible sound absorption material manufactured from thermally bonded polyester providing excellent acoustic properties and is the result of extensive research and development. Granric Insulation manufactures thermal insulation and sound absorption products for commercial industrial residential and air-conditioning applications with a wide range of products to meet customers’ specific needs. The Lalakahle range which means Sleep Well in the local language offers single foam replacement mattress units providing a comfortable and affordable mattress.



It is clear that nonwovens will be a growing sector in Africa and will be an interesting place to watch in the next three to five years both from a finished product point of view to equipment installation as well as localization of raw materials manufacturing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm95Y290dC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtYnJhbmRzLXJ1c3NpYXMtaW52YXNpb24tdWtyYWluZdIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm95Y290dC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtYnJhbmRzLXJ1c3NpYXMtaW52YXNpb24tdWtyYWluZS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Calls to boycott McDonald's other brands in wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"Major global brands including McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N )  PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.O ) and the Estee Lauder Cos Inc. should consider pausing their operations in Russia New York state's pension fund chief wrote in letters to several companies on Friday.

Curator David Dunlap says he was fascinated about the relationship and history Kapuskasing and the Times had dating back to when the newspaper co-owned the mill with Kimberly Clark. He adds the exhibit includes a number of photos published in a 1930s book.

“An aerial view overall of the town and one is an overall aerial view of the paper mill itself” he said. “And then there is also a large photograph showing the arrival of Spruce Falls paper on West 43rd street.”

Dunlap says due to the location of the offices the rolls of paper had to be shipped daily to print the next days’ edition.

The New York Times and Kimberly Clark sold the mill to the employees and Tembec in the early 1990s but the paper continued to be printed on Kapuskasing newsprint until 2003.

The museum is closed to the public because It’s located on the 15th floor of the new offices but private tours are available to those from the Kapuskasing area who want to see it."

The timing of the challenge which has taken place over the last six years also coincides with the restaurant’s 13th anniversary according to pastry chef Lydia Kimberly. It sounds like an easy challenge but apparently it’s not.

“Since we started in 2016 over 50 people have taken on the challenge and we’ve only had two winners” Kimberly wrote in an email interview.

The challenge got its start in the back of the house when staff decided to bake some for Mes CHamoru according to Kimberly.

“As the staff was standing around telling stories about their memories of eating rosketi we started laughing and choking (lol) with dust flying out of our mouths” Kimberly wrote. “That’s when Chef Peter (Duenas) decided to challenge all the staff at eating rosketi. Just for bragging rights. So everyone got three cookies and were timed. In the end Chef Peter had the best time. And so the Rosketti Challenge was born.”

Although the challenge is only available for dine-in guests you can try it at home by picking up their packages of a dozen rosketi for $8.

“It is honest to goodness a traditional recipe from Nana. ... We just envision our Nana every time it’s made: hot kitchen in the middle of summer sitting at the table smashing that dough with a fork waiting what felt like forever for that first pan to come out so you could sneak a few without her noticing. ...

What does it take for a product to survive and thrive generation after generation? For some companies it is adhering to the ideas of a visionary founder; for others it’s adapting to the market. Some products that we’ve known forever have become part of conglomerates and while they maintain their brand identity to a greater or lesser degree have become just one of many products under a giant umbrella – but at least they’ve managed to last.

To determine the oldest products on the market in America 24/7 Tempo derived information from History and other historical websites company websites state and city history sources and various media outlets. Some material was updated from previous 24/7 lists.

Boldface names like Heinz Kraft and Campbell’s made the list. So did uniquely American soft drinks including Coca-Cola Pepsi and Hires Root Beer – as well as one historic beer brand. (These are America’s 30 oldest beers.)

There are also some candy companies whose output has defied Father Time – and a number of firms making candy and other products still owned or run by their founding families. (These are the largest Fortune 500 companies still run by their founders.)

Some of the items that have stood the test of time are household cleaning products such as 20 Mule Team Borax Libman corn brooms and Murphy’s Soap. And in the kitchen you might use cutlery and cookware made by American companies that are more than 100 years old.

Brands like Brooks Brothers which has made ready-to-wear suits since the California Gold Rush of 1849 and luxury goods provider Tiffany remain the gold standards in their respective industries by not compromising on quality even as tastes and their competitors have changed.

The request is for boys and girls track meaning Bethlehem Academy's only solo spring sport will be softball if the co-op is approved by the Board.

Friesen indicated other schools are also seeing lower numbers in particular in baseball. He didn't know why but theorized having no spring sports in 2020 and no American Legion Baseball that summer simply sapped interest from many players.

In a memo to Superintendent Sesker Faribault Public Schools Activities Director Kevin Kleiner states ""We believe the formation of a cooperative sponsorship beginning in the 2022 season with Bethlehem Academy for Baseball is in our best interest to help sustain and grow our baseball program. Based on our participation numbers from the Spring of 2021 and known changes to student participation for the 2022 season we project in 2022 to less than 30 high school baseball players.""

29 in grades 9 through 12 are projected with 16 at the middle school level.

Kleiner also points out ""The cooperative sponsorship arrangements with Bethlehem Academy including financial agreements will be the same as in our other cooperative sponsorship programs.

Kleiner says Faribault Public Schools have adequate numbers in both the Girls and Boys Track and Field programs; however ""There is strength in having larger numbers in a sport like Track and Field. Generally all participants have the opportunity to compete in meets due to how meets are formatted for participants so this would not be preventing opportunities for FPS students. We have a cooperative sponsorship in Cross Country with Bethlehem Academy so having a cooperative sponsorship in Track and Field is a natural fit.""

The devices free up human workers for other tasks and convert real-time data about a poultry flock into actionable insights for farmers.

In addition robots offer intangible benefits to poultry farmers – from welfare to biosecurity.

Mortality recovery robots

A poultry mortality recovery robot uses sensors a neural network and computer vision to learn how to recognize when a bird is deceased and needs to be retrieved.

The robot performs the recovery sequence four times a day taking a different route through the poultry house each time. Once a sequence is completed the robot returns to its charging station to power up.

“It’s an opportunity to help the grower grow chickens easier” Dusty Reynolds founder of Birds Eye Robotics said. “If they can spend a little bit less time picking up dead birds with the robot it opens up the door for them to spend time on what they want to focus on.”

Dusty Reynolds (Courtesy of Birds Eye Robotics)

In the future this technology could map out where the birds died providing insights farmers and veterinarians can use to evaluate trends and make quicker mortality diagnoses.

“We’re really fortunate because with the technology we’ve had we’re able to move the birds in a really gentle way. We’re now capable of being able to say what else can we be doing at the bird’s eye level?” said Reynolds.

“To be able to gather more information helps the producer makes decision quicker. The first entry point for us is doing the hard work of picking up the dead birds and the next is capitalizing on the eyes the ears of the human picking up those birds just using the robot as a medium.”

Ceiling-suspended robots

Ceiling-mounted robots riding on rails attached to the ceiling of a broiler house collect and share data and insights on the welfare behavior and health status of the birds.

“One of the benefits that we find from the ceiling-mounted robot is that it’s traveling a defined track” Scott Becker Cumberland's director of North America sales said. “You’re not going to get an area where you get stuck in litter or get knocked over or enter into an obstacle.”

Scott Becker (Courtesy of AGCO)

The device runs along a track mounted every six to eight feet along the barn making six to eight continuous loops per day.

“This gives you an opportunity to experience different points of time throughout the day and different activity levels of the animals” Becker said.

Thermal sensors on the robot and artificial intelligence track environmental parameters such as air quality thermal sensation light and sound and identify potential risks to poultry health and welfare as well as farm equipment.

Becker stresses robots help with poultry welfare too. People entering a house to conduct welfare checks can cause stress reactions in the broilers. However a robot is in the house constantly allowing the birds to demonstrate more natural behaviors. A robot may more accurately and quickly detect changes in bird calls activity and other behaviors.

Tests of the ceiling-suspended robotic technology are underway in Europe. Cumberland plans to expand trials into the U.S. and Canada by the end of 2022.

“It can provide a lot of information that we didn’t know before” Becker said. “The more level of detail we get the more we’re learning and the better of we’ll become. There’s knowledge in power and this provides us an awful lot of things to know.”

Roving robots

Broiler production is highly labor-intensive. Workers assess equipment as well as bird health and welfare and collect dead birds daily. At breeder facilities farmers need to train birds where nests are located and pick up floor eggs.

A roving robot could perform many of these tasks reducing the need for farmers to enter the houses directly according to Colin Usher senior research scientist and interim branch chief for the robotics branch in the Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division at the Georgia Tech Research Institute.

Colin Usher (Courtesy of the Georgia Tech Research Institute)

“Our general idea is how can we get these machines to try to hopefully lighten the load and provide better management tools for the people that have to operate poultry facilities” he said.

For example when it comes time to train broiler breeders where their nests are located a robot could drive around the floor identify chickens and push them toward the walls. In addition this discourages floor eggs training the birds to only lay their eggs in the nests.

“When we started looking at robots it quickly moved away from being just a sensing system to something that can manipulate the environment” Usher noted.

Monitoring robots can improve biosecurity and prevent disease outbreaks from spreading between poultry houses. Today’s robots feature a suite of sophisticated sensors 2D and 3D cameras and even an automated arm for mortality tasks and picking up floor eggs. This means fewer people enter each broiler house reducing cross-contamination.

Environmental monitoring capabilities track changes to the microclimate of the broiler house including temperature humidity gas concentration and light levels.

Sensors help the robot map out floor areas and generate smart paths for navigating throughout the entire house. The sensors also detect birds in their path giving gentle nudges at first to encourage movement or telling the robot to circle around a bird refusing to budge.

You know the ""Four Seasons"" story....in brief:

Frankie Valli formed the ""Variatones"" in Newark around 1954/1955. They evolved into the ""Four Lovers"" in 1956. Band members would come and go...and singles would be released with limited success. The band would play clubs and lounges.

In 1960 the Four Lovers failed an audition to play the lounge at a Union Township bowling alley.

Bob Gaudio says: ""We figured we'll come out of this with something. So we took the name of the bowling alley. It was called the Four Seasons.""

The newly-minted ""Four Seasons"" also signed on as artists with Bob Crewe's production company. And their fortunes changed...dramatically.

New Jersey hits! (Craig Allen photo). New Jersey hits. (Craig Allen photo). loading...

Hits including ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" ""Rag Doll"" ""C'mon Marianne"" and more would follow through the 1960s. Then they hit a dry spell.

Frankie Valli would score a solo hit in the mid-60s ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" and cruise right into the 1970s...

...with: ""My Eyes Adored You"" ""Swearin' To God"" and ""Grease."" Click here for the ""Grease"" story.

The Four Seasons would (finally) return to the pop charts with ""Who Loves You"" (#3/1975) another of New Jersey's Greatest Hits.

This brings us to ""December 1963 (Oh What A Night).""

You can't buy this record. It went to radio stations only. (Bob O'Brien photo). Did you catch the label company's name? (Bob O'Brien photo). loading...

According to co-writer Bob Gaudio the hit song that we all know and love was originally set in 1933 called ""December 5 1933."" And it celebrated the repeal of Prohibition.

Neither Frankie Valli nor song co-writer Judy Parker (the future Mrs. Gaudio) was thrilled by the lyrics. Plus Valli objected to part of the melody.

So Gaudio started reworking the lyrics and Parker returned to the melody...and a 1930's-centric prohibition song became a 1960's-based nostalgic love song.

Now the Four Seasons had to try to downplay the sexual overtones of the song...to sell the song to the more-conservative radio stations and programmers...their gateway to the listening and record buying public.

""December 1963 (Oh What A Night"") is about a guy losing his virginity.

I know...you're shocked.

Remember...it was late 1975 when the song first hit the Jersey airwaves.

""December 1963 (Oh What A Night)"" went to #1 for the week of March 13 1976 and would stay perched at the top of the pop charts for 3 weeks.

This would be the Four Season's 5th and final #1 song in New Jersey...and it would be the band's only song to hit #1 in England.

The lead singer in the first verse is Four Seasons drummer Gerri Polci (as you can see in the video above and in the really cool LIVE video below).

Frankie Valli comes in on the second verse.

Don Ciccone formerly of Union County's ""Critters"" (""Mr Dieingly Sad"" and ""Younger Girl"" in 1966) is also prominently featured.

Since hitting #1 in the Bicentennial year ""December 1963 (Oh What A Night)"" has never left the New Jersey radio airwaves.

And 18 years later it would be introduced to a whole new generation.

A dance/remix by Dutch producer/DJ Ben Liebrand went to #14 on the pop charts in New Jersey in 1994.

Liebrand actually remixed the song in 1988 but it was only released in Europe.

“Murder Kroger.”

It’s a nickname that this local grocery store just can’t shrug. Crudely dubbed after it’s long history of random killings “Murder Kroger” is known around Atlanta for it’s scary past. But what exactly happened for an innocent looking supermarket to earn such an intense name?

Cynthia Priolea pictured before her death.

Opening in 1986 “Murder Kroger’” was your typical grocery store with it’s main highlight being it’s driver’s license renewal service. It operated normally for years continuing along without a nickname until 1991 when a 25 year old woman was killed in the store’s parking lot. Damon Parker Stephanie Buffington and Cynthia Priolea were heading into the store when approached by an unknown car. The three friends were walking down the road with enough room for the car to go around them but the driver didn’t think so bumping the back of Priolea. In response she sprayed the driver with mace not noticing he was already holding a revolver. Not long after the gunman shot three times with bullets hitting Priolea in the leg stomach and mouth. “I remember looking at him as he drove off” says Parker in an interview with Creative Loafing. “It was like he’d done it a thousand times. He didn’t screech his tires or anything. He drove off as cool as can be.” Priolea’s murder remains unsolved today.

The next major event occurred in 2002 when a woman followed a foul smell to an abandoned car finding a dead body.

“I remember pulling into the back entrance of the store after work one night and being instantly overwhelmed by the stench of what I assumed had to have been a dumpster full of expired meat” said journalist Elizabeth Williams in an interview with ThePlug.” You can imagine how horrified I was when I saw the headline Man Found Dead in Kroger Parking Lot move across the AP wire.”

The third murder technically occured in the Ford Factory Lofts steps away from it’s shared parking lot with the Kroger. Lee Lowery a Junior Georgia State student was shot and killed during an armed robbery. Only shot one time Lowery died the next day at Grady Hospital. “I get a lot of strength from Lee” said his mother Allison Webb during an interview with Midtown High School’s newspaper.

“As I raised him I learned a lot from Lee. I admired his strength I admired him being so self-assured his convictions in helping people.” Lowery pictured left in his senior portrait.

Joshua R. Richey was the most recent victim of the Murder Kroger dying on site in 2015. Trying to confront a man who was breaking into his car the 38-year-old construction worker was shot and killed in the grocery store parking lot. “A good man was taken for no reason” said Richey’s wife Kathy said in an interview with AL.com. “My daughter no longer has a father and I no longer have a husband. It’s tearing our family apart.”

Richey pictured with his wife Kathy. Richey’s truck being robbed before he was shot.

Four murders within thirty years but somehow the legacy of “Murder Kroger” has outgrown the innocent people who died on its premises. It has a Facebook page a signature theme song and most recently a visit from talk show star Conan O’Brien. He detailed the trip with a post on blog Team Coco: “From the condom wrappers in the parking lot to the unrefrigerated crab legs in the back … Murder Kroger did not disappoint.”

Despite its intense history the former crime scene is now a base for humor although the original supermarket no longer stands. In 2016 it was replaced by an office and apartment complex housing a full-sized Kroger on the bottom floor. The building is completely demolished but the nickname still remains. Murder Kroger… to some an elaborate joke and to some a painful location of the past.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcm5zdGFibGVwYXRyaW90LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjIvMDMvMDUvcGFjay1saWVzLWV4cGxvcmVzLWxheWVycy1jb2xkLXdhci1kZWNlaXQvOTM4MDY1NjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Pack of Lies' explores layers of Cold War deceit,"Barbara Clark

BARNSTABLE — “Pack of Lies” is a surprising tense drama by the late British playwright Hugh Whitemore now performing at the Barnstable Comedy Club through March 20. The play is based on actual events surrounding the real-world Portland Spy Scandal that broke in Britain in the 1960s.

The drama originally performed in London in 1983 winning a Laurence Olivier Award for best actress Judi Dench who played the lead role of Barbara Jackson. In 1987 it became a TV movie starring Ellen Burstyn Teri Garr and Alan Bates.

The drama is set in the early 1960s as the Cold War is heating up. It’s ostensibly about espionage one of the central themes of the era’s hostilities between the West and Communism but audiences will discover it also involves wider deceits of a different kind.

The Jacksons are an ordinary British family living in an ordinary London suburb. Daughter Julie sneaks off for rides on her boyfriend’s motorbike; wife Barbara takes art classes; the couple enjoy the company of Helen and Jim Kroger their best friends who live across the street.

That is until Stewart an agent from Scotland Yard’s Special Branch pays the Jacksons a visit apparently to advise them that there could be Russian spies in this ordinary neighborhood and to enlist the use of an upstairs room overlooking the street to keep watch on local comings and goings in search of any such perpetrator.

In any era espionage counts as a despicable and harmful deceit. But little by little the Jacksons as well as the audience are witness to a different kind of underhandedness one in which the spycatchers may prove as harmful as the spies in the havoc they can wreak in the lives of this family and where lies and deceit become the order of the day.

As he insinuates himself into the Jacksons’ lives skirting the truth and increasing their suspicions questions begin to arise: Besides being a government employee working to preserve his country’s stability is Stewart also an opportunist who cares little about the people he’s manipulating – except to achieve the British government’s ends?

Stewart is slow to name the perpetrators but it gradually becomes clear that his surveillance has always focused on the Krogers as the guilty parties. “Pack of Lies” increases in tension as Stewart lets the Jacksons in on the truth – that their friends are the spies in question. The couple now ramp up deceits of their own with daughter Julie and with the Krogers themselves as they begin to distance themselves from the couple.

The play effectively portrays what happens as lies become integral to the Jacksons’ lives and asks the question: Is one betrayal worse than another in the lasting harm it may wreak in the lives of both practitioner and victim? Can such lies insinuate and spread irreparable damage?

This thoughtful drama is ably directed by James F. Ring a longtime participant in local theatre both behind the curtain and onstage. Ring has surrounded himself with a group of talented actors each of whom has successfully worked to bring a unique character to life.

As Barbara Jackson Miranda Daniloff Mancusi realistically portrays the slow derailment of a seemingly stable character whose trust has been irretrievably shattered. Late in the play confronting Stewart she tells him she knows the extent of Helen’s lies but also sees the consequences of their collective deceit: “You went one better: You made us do the lying.”

Standout smaller parts are beautifully acted by Alessandra Scibelli (Julie) and Kelly Kean (Thelma) and actors Bob Shire (Stewart) and Missy Potash (Sally) effectively add to the cast roster.

Several of the characters break the action addressing the audience directly with monologues that fill in the backstory and help advance its timeline. Exceptional among these are lines spoken by Rick Martin (Bob Jackson) and Stuard M. Derrick (Peter Kroger).

On opening night stage adjustments occasionally left a little too much space between actors’ lines especially in Act I and hopefully response times will speed up once the production finds its legs.

Bringing the play’s themes into line with our present era director Ring said the play “is about the damage done when ordinary decent people lose faith in their neighbors their friends and their governments.” He added that in this era of “ideological divide it (is) a privilege to bring the play to life for our community.”

We now demonstrate the successful use of ADHIV RDTs in hospital services at a tertiary level hospital in Malawi as a preface to scale up in the country. The program was successful because of didactic training practical demonstrations of use the ease of testing using a preset algorithm and continuous supervision of the new intervention. In addition the ADHIV RDTs were incorporated into the existing system already providing ART and TB drugs in the medical wards. This helped in reducing the time between diagnosis and treatment of HIV TB and CM.

Not surprisingly CrAg positivity was higher in the hospital setting than in previously documented outpatient settings in Malawi.The prevalence of CrAg positivity among outpatients with CD4 < 100 cells/ml and WHO stage IV was 3.5% (95% CI: 0–8.4%) and 5.0% (95% CI: 0–15%) respectively [17]. A meta-analysis shows in concordance to our setting that the prevalence of cryptoccaemia is higher in hospitalized patients (9.8% [95% CI 4.0–15.5%]) compared with outpatients (6.3% [95% CI 5.3–7.4%]) [20]. In our study a higher inpatient CrAg positivity rate may have been a result of screening all PLHIV hospitalized regardless of CD4 count or WHO stage. Our finding that more than half of the serum CrAg positive patients had confirmed CM supports the need for CrAg screening and preemptive antifungal treatment at the time of HIV diagnosis for all patients with advanced HIV disease [8 15].

The urine X-pert test did not significantly add to the detection of disseminated TB beyond urine LAM. This is also well supported in a clinical trial which showed that urine LAM had major incremental diagnostic benefit with urine X-pert contributing few additional diagnoses [14]. The Urine LAM is also easier to use in our setting as it was conducted on the ward whereas the urine X-pert required transportation and testing in the laboratory. The lower cost easier use and higher performance of the Urine LAM make it a logical test for investment and incorporation to increase TB diagnosis. Urine X-pert has no significant addition to urine LAM as a rapid diagnostic test for TB and therefore can be eliminated from advanced HIV care algorithms for resource-limited settings.

Lower CD4 count (≤ 200 cells/mm3) was the most important predictor of a positive Urine LAM and serum CrAg test. Hence CD4 count remains an important marker of the performance of the ADHIV RDTs. However considering the time and cost of the CD4 cell count test we need to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding a CD4 cell count test in the hospitalized patient as a benchmark for performing ADHIV RDTs. Certainly the outpatient models show the cost-effectiveness of preemptive screening for cryptococcal disease regardless of CD4 [14 19]. In our study half of the patients had CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3 but positive cases of LAM and CrAg were also found among patients with CD4 > 200 cells/mm3 emphasizing the need to follow advanced HIV disease full package model for all hospitalized patients [15].

Despite the substantial coverage of ART in Malawi (86%) [22] hospitalization for HIV related complications remains high (45%). In this study inpatient mortality was 30% for those with TB and 21% within two weeks of CM diagnosis similar to r previously reported clinical trials [23]. There is some evidence of long-term impact on mortality using ADHI RDTs for TB but not for CM [14 21 24]. Our study was not able to conduct routine HIV RNA to determine the rate of treatment failure among these inpatients with ART experience or fully evaluate their adherence. However the treatment failures identified in hospital admissions represent failures in the outpatient systems of the HIV program. These system problems may include inadequate pre-ART screening for opportunistic infections missed treatment failure evaluations weak retention strategies for defaulters late diagnosis of HIV infection and late presentation for acute illnesses. The short time from admission to death for our cases highlights that real-time inpatient diagnosis may be too late to significantly alter mortality for our inpatient population. Strengthening outpatient programs is needed to reduce mortality.

We could not assess all inpatients due to high volumes and limited resources. However we believe the patients in this study reflect a true picture of the situation in the medical department. We were also unable to ascertain all inpatient outcomes that may have affected our overall inpatient mortality estimate. The study staff looked through all discharge/death folders and notes available in the wards but some files were missed because of inadequate record keeping. The hospital record-keeping is poor because the hospital uses paper-based unstandardized documentation. Most missing files would presumably be of patients who died as death files are taken away from the wards expeditiously to perform death audits. However TB and CM diagnoses and mortality estimates in this study align with previous work in Malawi [3 6 12 23].

Key challenges in the implementation of ADHIV RDTs noted were inability to assess all admissions with existing staff high turnover of staff requiring continuous mentorship renovation of space to include adequate lighting for visualization of ADHIV RDTs results and the time required to perform a test that required dedicated staff. These thematic areas need further exploration as the scale-up ADHIV RDTs for management of opportunistic infections continues.",,,,,,,,,,,,

John McEvoy/Special to The Colorado Sun

The Seven Peaks Festival has found a new home.

The world’s top concert promoter Live Nation last summer canceled its 20000-person Labor Day weekend country music concert in Buena Vista after Chaffee County commissioners refused to raise coronavirus-related capacity limits. Saguache County commissioners last week approved a special use permit for Live Nation to host as many as 20000 concert-goers in the San Luis Valley just outside the tiny hamlet of Villa Grove.

“Villa Grove and the business owners here are thrilled” said Jamie Williams the owner of Villa Grove Trade a restaurant and general store that first opened in 1882. “I’ve got a few neighbors who are not so excited mostly people who are concerned that this might not fit with our slow town but hey it’s only one weekend.”

It will be the largest event in the history of Saguache County a rural valley with a population of about 6600 people and four municipalities one of which Bonanza has three residents.

Netflix is the latest media company to pull out of Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Given the circumstances on the ground we have decided to suspend our service in Russia” a spokesperson for Netflix said on Sunday.

Previously Netflix announced that it would ignore a Russian law requiring media platforms to carry state propaganda channels. Now the streamer has decided to forgo operations in Russia outright effectively disconnecting with its nearly one million subscribers based in the country.

Netflix is but the latest corporation to cut ties with Russia. Both Live Nation and Spotify separately announced their plans to indefinitely cease conducting business in the country while Apple paused the sales of its products. Facebook is also no longer accessible in Russia but that decision was made for Facebook by the Kremlin after the social media platform refused to comply with the country’s demand to cease fact-checking state media.

Meanwhile a number of bands have canceled upcoming tour dates in Russia including Green Day Bring Me the Horizon Iggy Pop Nick Cave Franz Ferdinand Yungblud and many more.

The programme will tell the story of Cilla’s rise from a working-class background to becoming one of the nations most successful singers of the British Invasion — a phenomenon when UK music appeared to invade the US in the Sixties. It sees rare and never-before-witnessed archive footage and interviews with Cilla’s friends and contemporaries attempt to uncover what the singer was like outside the spotlight.

The documentary includes contributions from a range of stars including Gloria Hunniford Christopher Biggins and Andrew Lloyd-Webber. Cilla began her career as a singer having been championed by her friends the Beatles and scored two number one hits with ‘Anyone Who Had a Heart’ and ‘You’re My World’ in 1964. In the following seven years the Liverpool-born star had 11 top 10 UK singles while an additional eight made the UK top 40. In 1970 at the height of her success Cilla performed in front of the Queen.

Cilla Black made history when she performed for the Queen

Cilla is one of the most successful British singers of the Sixties

The meeting was historic: Cilla was at the time heavily pregnant with her son Robert and so became the first-known pregnant woman to be presented to Her Majesty. But while recalling the historic moment Cilla also revealed that she had picked an “unfortunate” song to sing for the Queen. In archive footage from ITV documentary Cilla: The Lost Tapes the late singer said: “I made a bit of history as the Queen never knowingly up until then had been presented to a pregnant woman. “I was almost dropping so they had to ask permission from the palace and it was an unfortunate song choice as it was ‘Oh Pleasure Man You’ve Done It Again’”.

Ringo Starr propsed to Cilla Black

Trending

As the song’s title suggests ‘Oh Pleasure Man You’ve Done It Again’ charts the tempestuous relationship between a man and a woman and her eventual success in escaping him — despite the pleasure she derives from their relationship. In the Seventies pregnancy discrimination was frequent and women who were expecting a child were sometimes even sacked for being pregnant. Later in the ITV documentary Cilla discussed her relationship with Beatles star Ringo Starr. The musician is even heard revealing that the legendary drummer once asked her to marry him. Don't Miss:

She said: “He was desperate because the other Beatles had girlfriends. “So I called his bluff and said if he posted the [wedding] bands in 48 hours I’d do it.” The Beatles played a significant role in Cilla’s rise and her manager Brian Epstein was the man responsible for discovering the Fab Four in 1961. Actor Andrew Lancel who played Brian in West End show The Man Who Made The Beatles previously told the Sunday Post: “We’re all familiar with Cilla the star the national treasure and this show shows how he put her on course to become that.

Cilla Black was close friends with the Beatles

“She was already making a name for herself but [Brian] opened doors to her breaking her in the States and introducing her to The Beatles. “Paul McCartney wrote the theme song for her TV show. “Brian was particularly close to John Lennon and it was he ‒ and his fierce Aunt Mimi who told Lennon to introduce Cilla to Brian ‒ who persuaded Epstein to give Cilla an audition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8xNTc2MTQ5L2NpbGxhLWJsYWNrLWRlYXRoLWh1c2JhbmQtYm9iYnktd2lsbGlz0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzcy5jby51ay9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L211c2ljLzE1NzYxNDkvY2lsbGEtYmxhY2stZGVhdGgtaHVzYmFuZC1ib2JieS13aWxsaXMvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'I'm a wreck!' Cilla Black 'willed herself to die' months before death,"Cilla Black and Bobby Willis interviewed in 1993

Cilla Black was one of the most iconic Liverpool stars of all time. Having come up in the music industry alongside The Beatles she quickly became a national treasure and was loved by everyone. On top of her singing career - of which she was known for the massive track Anyone Who Had a Heart - she was also the main attraction of the reality show Blind Date which she hosted. She also had her own variety show titled Cilla. But in her final years of life she was not happy.

Cilla's childhood friend Terry McCann spoke out about the star shortly after she died in 2015 aged 72-years-old. He explained how he had visited her before her death and she was not in a good state of mind. Terry said: ""I wasn't surprised when I found out she had died. The last thing she said to me was she was going blind. She showed me her hands she had arthritis."" (Via BBC) The star died in 2015 in her home in Estepona Spain. A spokesperson for the High Court of Justice in Andalusia suggested that ""an accident"" may have had a contributing factor to her death. An autopsy later revealed she died from a stroke following a fall. Terry said Cilla knew her death was coming.

Terry revealed: ""She willed herself to die. She said: 'Bobby's waiting for me.'"" Cilla was with her husband Bobby Willis for 30 years from 1969 to 1999. She then lived without him for 16 years. Terry continued: ""Her mother went the same way. I don't know what her mother died of but it seemed she associated it with her mother's death and she just knew it was going to happen.""

It could conceivably alter the way some people think about investing too.

At least that’s the view of two analysts with Citi who argue that the height of social responsibility at this moment requires putting your investment money into the stocks of companies that make weapons.

“Defending the values of liberal democracies and creating a deterrent which preserves peace and global stability” is so important that weapons makers should be included in funds that carry an E.S.G. or “environmental social and governance” label the two analysts Charles J. Armitage and Samuel Burgess wrote.

That labeling seems utterly bizarre for some E.S.G. investors however.

It certainly does to Andrew Behar the chief executive of As You Sow an advocacy and research group that frequently files shareholder proxy proposals on E.S.G. issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9taWRkbGUtZWFzdC9hcnRpY2xlLTcwMDQ4MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Losing Russia safety measures a strategic problem for Israel in Syria - analysis,"Losing the security measures in place with the Russians in Syria would be a strategic problem for the IAF as Jerusalem continues to maintain a diplomatic balance over the war in Ukraine.

Russia intervened in the Syrian conflict in September 2015 on the side of embattled President Bashar Assad and Moscow is seen as the main power to speak with when Israel wants to carry out strikes in the country.

Israel’s war-between-wars campaign has seen thousands of airstrikes against Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria since it began in 2013 including hitting convoys of advanced weaponry heading to Lebanon. Dozens of clandestine operations are also alleged by foreign media to have occurred in Syria and Lebanon against targets that are perceived to threaten the Jewish state.

Russia and Israel have been using safety measures to avoid any unwanted conflict. Moscow has allowed the IAF to maintain its freedom of operation over Syria as long as it does not endanger Russian forces.

With Russia turning a blind eye to strikes Israel says it has been able to significantly disrupt the smuggling routes by land at sea and in the air and achieve satisfactory results in its campaign.

Russia also informs Israel when it is carrying out patrols along the northern border over Syria’s Golan Heights such as in late January when Russian SU-34 SU-35 and an A-50 early-warning and control aircraft flew alongside MiG-23 and MiG-29 fighter jets from the Syrian Arab Army.

“The mission route included the Golan Heights the southern border of Syria the Euphrates River and northern Syria” read a statement by the Russian Defense Ministry. “The Russian pilots took off from Khmeimim Air Base while the Syrians took off from the Sayqal and Al-Dumayur bases near Damascus.”

“The two countries’ pilots developed skills for cooperation in various situations” it added. “This kind of joint mission will now take place on a regular basis.”

Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu traveled to Syria and spoke with Assad about military-technical cooperation.

Though the IAF does not see the safety measures between the two air forces stopping Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made them become more aware of the situation along its northern border. The IAF also does not expect to see Russian fighter jets intercept Israeli jets in Syrian or Lebanese airspace.

FORMER DEFENSE minister Moshe “Boogie” Ya’alon who initiated the measures with Russia when he was in office in 2015 said he does not think Moscow will stop talking with Jerusalem regarding Syria.

Ya’alon said he thinks there is a mistaken assumption that “if we take this position or another there will be a hostile front between Russia and Israel. But the interests even in Syria between Russia and Israel are the same.”

“It is much better if we do the coordination” Ya’alon said. “Even then [when he started the coordination with Russia] we knew Russia had their interests. I said to them ‘We won’t disturb you; you don’t disturb us.’ Also now I don’t think Russians have any interest to make issues for Israeli aircraft or other attacks on Iran in Syria. But if it happens God forbid Israel has capabilities.”

The safety measures in place since 2015 have recently come under scrutiny after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded neighboring Ukraine under the pretext of “denazifying” the country. Israel has been heavily criticized for not taking a tougher stance on Moscow in line with the United States and dozens of other countries from around the world.

According to a report on the Axios website although Washington understands that Jerusalem needs to balance its security interests it has to also take a clear stance on the war because it is a “matter of right and wrong.”

Israeli officials have said the IDF’s war-between-wars campaign has not yet been affected by the Ukraine-Russia war and Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov last week said the status quo would continue because it “helps ensure the safety and security of our army.”

Putin has even threatened to use his nuclear weapons – a move that senior IDF officials have called extremely worrisome – so Israel needs to continue to tread safely through the stormy waters currently flowing around it.

When Putin launched the invasion – the largest invasion in Europe since World War II – he said that “Russia was left with no other choice.”

According to Ya’alon who is the chairman of the upcoming ISDEF (Israel’s largest defense homeland security and cyber exhibition) Russia does not want to start another hostile front with a state like Israel when it is also dealing with Iran in Syria as well as a war in Ukraine.

He said he did not want to discuss specifics of what Israel could or could not do militarily in the event that the coordination mechanism between Israel and Russia breaks down but he reiterated that until now there has been only one Israeli public statement against Russia’s actions in Ukraine.

“We need to be on the right side of history” Ya’alon stressed. “This hasn’t been enough. Bennett must also say it. It needs to be clear. It won’t lead to a hostile front in Syria because of their interests.”

LOW,Lowe's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZmlnaHRpbmdpbGxpbmkuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi8zLzYvZm9vdGJhbGwtdmVkZXJpYW4tbG93ZS1zZWVzLWRyZWFtLWNvbWUtdHJ1ZS1hdC1uZmwtY29tYmluZS5hc3B40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vederian Lowe Sees Dream Come True at NFL Combine - University of Illinois Athletics,"The last few months have been life-changing for Vederian Lowe . Back in December — a few weeks after Lowe played his final football game as an Illini — he was invited to the 2022 NFL Combine.

Lowe heard the news first from head coach Bret Bielema  then received the formal invitation a few days later. Becoming one of only 58 offensive linemen selected for this year's combine is an ode to Lowe's younger self who never imagine getting this far.

""It's very special because I grew up watching the Combine"" Lowe said. ""Ever since like 2011 I've watched the NFL Combine and for me to even have the opportunity to be up here and to be able to compete (Friday) and showcase my abilities means everything. My family means everything and they'll only be two hours away and be able to see me in this fashion; it means the world to me.""

On Jan. 1 Lowe left Champaign and headed to San Diego to train for the combine. While out there Lowe also played in the East-West Shrine Bowl in Las Vegas on Feb. 3. This allowed Lowe to get a head start for the combine as he was able to talk and meet with NFL scouts and coaches another once in a lifetime opportunity.

Competing and training out west was an incredible opportunity for the Illini graduate it also meant Lowe had to leave behind his wife — Haylee his two sons — King and Trey and his teenage brother — Vydalis.

Throughout the two months Lowe was in California he was only able to make it home for one night to see his family. After spending time with his boys and surprising them with new stuffed animals that second good bye got even harder.

But those goodbyes might have made the biggest difference in Lowe's training. If he had to be away from his family he was going to work as hard as possible to make missing those moments worth it.

""He's like 'this is go time this is the only time in my life I'll be able to have this opportunity so I need to show myself and prove myself now'"" Haylee said. ""There's no do-overs so now is my time. Especially with him being away from his family it wasn't a little opportunity it was something that he needed to take very seriously because he was putting a lot at stake to go there. Leaving me and the boys and his brother and stuff at home he was like this isn't some I'm going to take lightly if I have to do that.""

While leaving home for an extended period of time Lowe Haylee was able to visit California almost every other weekend with the help of her mom as a reliable babysitter. This allowed Haylee to see her husband ""in his element"" while also giving Lowe a view of why this training was so important.

Since becoming a father a husband and legal guardian Lowe has dedicated every day to giving his family a great life. Those personal traits are things NFL teams have begun to show their appreciation for.

""All those things kind of just came to me I didn't go to it"" Lowe said. ""The only think I went to was becoming a married man. That was something that I wanted to do. Me becoming a father very early wasn't planned. It wasn't something that I thought of doing at the age that was that. But it came to me and I made the most out of all things that's happened you know good or bad. Me getting guardianship of my brother like I said that was something that came to me and with the help of my wife we are able to care for him because of the unfortunate situation that he's been in. So I've made the most out of everything that has happened to me in my life good or bad. And it's definitely helped me become the man that I am today. I think it's made me a well-polished man. I feel like it's really helped my character having to grow up quicker. And I think that that's a good trait that teams will like when they talk to me.""

Lowe's personal character has easily stuck out at the combine when meeting with teams but his versatility on the field has also popped.

This past fall PFF graded Lowe the No. 31 tackle in the nation and the No. 37 run blocking tackle in the nation. NFL analyst Lance Zierlein noted Lowe's athleticism bend pass punch and recovery as NFL-caliber traits.

On Friday Lowe measured out at 6-foot-5 314 pounds with a 35 3/8 inch arm length highlighting his strong and durable size. But what Lowe really wants teams to take away from his combine outing is his ability to be a versatile offensive lineman.

""I definitely feel comfortable working from both sides. I started playing tackle at right tackle and converted over to left tackle when I got to college. So playing both tackles I feel like I'm very capable of doing that and very capable of flipping sides whenever. Whatever a team is looking for that's what I'm ready to play.""

""That's just something I've done with great coaching over the last few years just established more tools from our toolbox"" Lowe said. ""I feel like that helps your game if you can do more things well. I think that just with the coaches I've had you know I've had really great people around me who have taught me great things and I'm very grateful.""

Lowe has also made it a point to emphasize how reliable and coachable he is. In the 2021 season Lowe broke Illinois' starts record and finished his career with 52 starts on the offensive line. Lowe believes holding that record highlights his consistency and durability while also showing how much experience he has gained through the years.

Another unique point in Lowe's game is his ability to adjust to any playbook. Going through multiple coaching changes while at Illinois Lowe was able to learn a lot of different schemes and reads. While learning a whole new playbook before his final year with Illinois took him some extra time Lowe said being under Bielema's downhill offense opened up a whole new part of his game.

""I felt like when I first got to college it was so difficult for me to pick up on a playbook"" Lowe said. ""That was the first time I really had a coaching change in four years but from Coach Smith to Coach Bielema and the three different offensive coordinators I had and then three different o-line coaches I had has definitely helped me pick up on different tendencies and stuff like that way quicker than I normally would have. And I'm glad for it. The experiences have taught me a lot. The experiences have given me a routine on how I can learn stuff. Coaches here always ask me how would you learn something? And it's very easy for me to tell them because I've done it multiple times before so I feel like it's helped me a lot.""

In general spending the extra year at Illinois under Bielema and offensive line coach Bart Miller was crucial for Lowe's physical and mental development.

Haylee said her and Lowe are forever grateful for Bielema and the opportunities he gave Lowe. Between being a Big Ten Media Day selection the speaker at the Big Ten Kickoff Luncheon and team captain Lowe was taken under Bielema's wing from the start.

""It was the best thing possible for him"" Haylee said. ""We weren't sure in the moment of making the decision because there's a lot of things where he could have gotten hurt anything could have happened. He could have lowered his draft stock if he got hurt and him taking that leap I think he took it a lot more seriously because he was like this is my last opportunity. I think he did the best for him between Coach B coming in and everything that he was able to accomplish with getting the Big Ten media day opportunity and being the captain. Everything that he hadn't had the previous years he just has gone above and beyond through this last year so I'm glad he stayed I really am.""

With Lowe finished at the combine he is now back at home with his family where he will prepare for Illinois' Pro Day on Friday and the NFL Draft in April. Lowe will also be reunited with many of his teammates this week as he hasn't seen them for a few months either.

All of 2022 has been a dream come true for Lowe so far and he can only hope the best is still to come. While the ultimate goal is to hear his named called on draft day Lowe still took time to soak in the NFL Combine experience.

To future Illini who hope to have that same opportunity Lowe emphasizes the important of staying true to oneself and never losing sight of how far work ethic can get you.

""Definitely to just keep grinding keep working. I remember I never thought I would get this far"" Lowe said. ""When I first started playing I never thought that I would get this far. I didn't put my mind to it as much. And I when I finally put my mind to it this came to fruition it became a reality. I would definitely let the guys know that with the work ethic and just working hard and continuing to be consistent day in and day out that your dreams can come true.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzcmVjb3JkbmV3cy5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy93dHIwMTk1NzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pamela Lynn Lowe Obituary,"Give to a forest in need in their memory

Ron DeSantis barred the sale of lab-grown meat in the Sunshine State.

DeSantis signed the legislation called SB 1084 into effect on May 1 casting it as a bid to stop the World Economic Forum’s goal of forcing the world to eat lab-grown meat and insects “an overlooked source of protein” according to a news release.

Rather “Florida is increasing meat production and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef” the governor’s office added.

DeSantis previously has blasted “the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

4 Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez moved to Florida mere months before announcing a $60 million investment into lab-grown meats via the Amazon founder’s Bezos Earth Fund. Bezos Earth Fund

The move comes about a month after the Bezos Earth Fund chaired by the Amazon founder and Sanchez announced a hefty investment into sustainable protein including plant-based fermented and cultivated meats — part of the organization’s larger $1 billion commitment to expanding food production Fortune earlier reported.

“We need to feed 10 billion people with healthy sustainable food throughout this century while protecting our planet. We can do it and it will require a ton of innovation” Sanchez wrote in a statement announcing the $60 million investment.

Lab-grown meats differ from its slaughter-free counterparts like Impossible Foods in that they are grown from real animal cells that are replicated scientifically eliminating the need to farm animals.

Impossible burgers and other vegan proteins such as Beyond Meat meanwhile are made using alternative protein sources like tempeh tofu seitan and beans among other products.

According to science magazine Scientific American the US Department of Agriculture granted its first-ever approval of cell-cultured meat produced by two companies GOOD Meat and UPSIDE Foods last June — less than a year after the Food and Drug Administration declared the companies’ products safe to eat.

Before garnering US approval GOOD Meat had already been selling its cultivated chicken in Singapore. It made its debut in America in a dish curated by well-known chef José Andrés at his Washington DC restaurant China Chilcano.

The nonprofit Good Food Institute reports that the cultivated meat industry has grown to include more than 150 companies backed by $2.6 billion in investments Fortune cited — with Bezos among those funding the sector.

Bezos and DeSantis’s clashing opinions on the lab-grown meat industry are coming to light shortly after the 60-year-old tech billionaire moved from Seattle near Amazon’s headquarters to Miami closer to his space exploration firm Blue Origin’s home base.

In October 2023 it was revealed that Bezos had purchased two mansions on Florida’s exclusive “Billionaire Bunker” the man-made island formally known as Indian Creek Island.

Last month he added a third multimillion-dollar estate to his sprawling Miami portfolio in an off-market transaction reportedly worth $90 million.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

(MPC) along with local state and federal policymakers on June 2 celebrated the groundbreaking for North Dakota’s first dedicated soybean processing facility. By harvest 2023 the plant — owned by the previously announced ADM-MPC joint venture Green Bison Soy Processing — is expected to be producing approximately 600 million pounds of refined vegetable oil annually which will be supplied exclusively to MPC as a feedstock for renewable diesel.

“The need for lower-carbon more sustainable products are one of the fundamental trends underlying ADM’s strategy and purpose and we’re proud to continue to scale up our leadership in this critical area” said Ken Campbell ADM’s president of North America Oils Biodiesel and Renewable Chemicals. “Renewable diesel is a potentially transformative opportunity for the oilseed industry for farmers and for the sustainability of our transportation system. We’re excited to celebrate our bright future and we look forward to working with MPC and producers across North Dakota as we bring this state-of-the-art plant online in less than a year and a half.”

Dave Heppner senior vice president of strategy and business development at MPC added: “The Green Bison Soy Processing facility represents another step in MPC’s commitment to investing in a sustainable energy-diverse future. The Green Bison Soy Processing facility will help us further optimize our renewable feedstock sourcing and we are excited about the opportunity to partner with ADM and the state of North Dakota as we move forward with the development of this facility.”

When complete the approximately $350 million complex will feature state-of-the-art automation technology and is expected to have the capacity to process 150000 bushels of soybeans per day. Vegetable oil from the plant will be supplied exclusively to MPC to serve as feedstock for the production of a targeted 75 million gallons of renewable diesel annually.

The construction of the new complex is supporting hundreds of jobs in the region and the facility is expected to employ approximately 75 people once operational.

“As a Top 10 soybean-producing state the ADM-MPC joint venture is a game-changer that will provide lasting benefits for North Dakota soybean growers” Governor Doug Burgum of North Dakota said. “Green Bison will add value and expand the market for one of our farmers’ most important crops while also creating 75 direct jobs and diversifying our economy to support our communities our citizens and the entire state. It’s also a shining example of the growing synergy between our agriculture and energy sectors in North Dakota. We appreciate ADM and MPC for this significant investment in our state and their well-placed faith in our highly productive and innovative farmers and we’re grateful for the efforts of Lt. Gov. Sanford and so many other state federal and local partners who helped make this happen.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy91a3JhaW5lLXJ1c3NpYS11cy1lY29ub215LWluZmxhdGlvbi1nYXNvbGluZS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9ycy0yMDIyMDMwNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the Russian invasion of Ukraine could affect the U.S. economy,"A trucker loads his truck with fuel at the Marathon Oil Refinery in Salt Lake City Utah on Oct. 29 2021. Prices for gasoline are expected to hit $4 a gallon soon and could go higher if Russia holds back on oil and gas shipments. But that is unlikely Mark Zandi writes because it would throw even more chaos into a beleaguered Russian economy. (George Frey/AFP/Getty Images/TNS) Read more

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is taking a human toll and has put global democracies on the defensive but under most scenarios it will have little fallout on our economy.

The principal link between the Russian invasion and the global economy is through oil natural gas and other commodity and industrial prices. This constitutes the bulk of what Russia and Ukraine export to the world.

Since it became clear that Russia was amassing troops on its border with Ukraine earlier this year West Texas Intermediate oil prices have risen about $30 per barrel to more than $100 per barrel. Prices have risen even though global supplies have not been significantly disrupted by the Russian invasion because the threat of an interruption remains. The increase in prices is a premium added for this risk.

» READ MORE: $4-a-gallon gasoline is coming no matter what

If oil prices remain near $100 per barrel then American consumers will pay almost $4 for a gallon of regular unleaded by this spring up about 60 cents. This would ultimately add as much as half a percentage point to year-over-year consumer price inflation and reduce U.S. real GDP growth this year from an estimated 3.7% to 3.5%. This hurts but it is a modest impact.

Of course Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting higher oil prices are especially bad timing as that will push already painfully high prices even higher. And gasoline prices play an outsize role in shaping our expectations about future inflation. Most of us purchase gas regularly and see the price each day as we go to and from work. Nothing influences people’s thinking about future inflation more than what they are currently paying at the pump.

If inflation expectations start to rise then the Federal Reserve fearful that the higher expectations become self-fulfilling will have little choice but to raise interest rates more aggressively than it already is signaling it will do. Even before the Russian invasion global investors had been anticipating a series of rate hikes this year. This will be difficult for the economy to adjust to but any more rate hikes would meaningfully increase the odds that the economy will stumble. So far inflation expectations are holding firm but they bear close watching.

The wobbly stock market is another potential economic vulnerability that could be exposed by the Russian invasion. Stock prices are down about 10% from their all-time high at the start of the year equal to a loss of about $5 trillion in market capitalization. This is largely due to investors adjusting to the prospects of the Fed tightening and higher interest rates and is consistent with a garden-variety correction. While the Russian invasion has caused big intraday swings in stock prices they are still not far from where they were when all this began.

However stocks remain significantly overvalued and if events don’t stick precisely to script which isn’t too hard to imagine they are at risk of selling off. Another sustained 10% decline in stock prices would be consistent with a bear market which would be the loss of real money for many households causing them to turn more cautious in their spending. It would also signal that global investors are discounting an economic downturn straight ahead.

Russia and Ukraine’s outsize role in the global neon market could also surprisingly turn out to be a big problem as neon is critical to the semiconductor-making process. If neon production and exports are disrupted then chip production will be too with big implications for everything from consumer electronics to vehicles. This takes on added importance given the ongoing supply-chain disruptions to the chip and chip-dependent industries caused by the pandemic.

There are many other possible darker scenarios on how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will play out. Russia could curtail its exports of oil natural gas metals and industrial products. It is plausible under this scenario that oil prices spike closer to $150 per barrel. Putin could also extend his invasion beyond Ukraine if not by design then by accident given the confusion that exists in the midst of a battle.

The damage to the global economy in these scenarios would be severe and recession unavoidable but it would push the reeling Russian economy even deeper into the abyss. Given this it is difficult to imagine Russia going this route but it was difficult to imagine just a few weeks ago where things stand now and thus it is prudent not to rule out any scenario.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is wrenching to watch as it inflicts an enormous toll on the Ukrainian people. Hopefully there is a resolution soon. If there is any good that comes out of it perhaps it will be a reaffirmation of democratic nations in their democracies and a newfound willingness to fight for them.

He was born Nov. 11 1952 in Tiffin Ohio to Walter Lowell and Marilyn June (Osborne) Dommer who preceded him in death. On June 24 1978 he married Lisa Darlene Benton in the Provo Utah Temple. She preceded him in death on April 1 2002.

Surviving are four sons: Paul Benton Dommer (Briana) of Queen Creek AZ Rex Benjamin Dommer of Colorado Springs CO Michael Joseph (Richae) of Oahu HI Matthew (Meagan) of South Jordan; nine grandchildren; a brother Walter David (Diana) Dommer of Grand Rapids OH; and eight sisters Cynthia Moorhead of Findlay OH Sally (Wayne) Hardy of Taylor AZ Mary Parkins of Findlay OH Judith (Todd) Gibson of Las Vegas NV Nancy (Dan) Maynes of Payson UT Amy (Sterling) Johnson of Fitchburg WI Norma (Thomas) Gomm of Sandy UT and Anne (Joel) Harris of Payson UT.

Martin had several careers in his lifetime. He graduated from Brigham Young University with a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science degree. He worked in the oil business for several years including for Marathon Oil Company Gulf Oil and others. In the mid-1980s he moved his family to Parker and then Littleton both in Colorado where he established a successful home inspection business that continued until he moved to Utah in 2004.

In Utah he worked at various jobs until he decided to go back to school for a second Master’s degree this one in marriage and family therapy. He graduated with top grades from Argosy University in Salt Lake City and began the career that would mean the most to him and in which he worked for the rest of his life. He had always had a gift for the hard sciences winning first place in science in a statewide academic competition in Ohio when he was in the ninth grade. But his career in the soft science of family therapy meant the most to him. Working with the guidance of the Lord he lovingly blessed and helped to heal many wounded souls.

Martin also loved genealogy. He studied German in high school which not only helped him on his mission in Brazil part of which he served in the German-speaking city of Blumenau but also helped as he later sought out his German ancestors and had the temple work performed for them. He found thousands of names and he continued to do this research until near the end of his life.

He loved to work with his hands. He began painting houses while in high school and he put himself through college by painting houses and apartments. He built a vacation cabin for his family in Leadville CO. and he later built a large cabin on property he owned in Colorado’s high mesa often driving there while he was being treated for his terminal illness. He also did nearly all his home and vehicle repairs.

He was a gifted musician playing bass guitar string bass (for which he was given a music scholarship to play in the BYU Philharmonic Orchestra) baritone and piano. He learned from his father how to repair musical instruments. He performed gigs with friends in a musical group during their years at Findlay (OH) High School from which he graduated in 1971. He also wrote poetry and shared it with his family and friends.

Martin loved to garden and had huge vegetable gardens at his homes in Oklahoma Colorado and Utah.

He knew the scriptures so well that he could usually give you the reference if you gave him a few words of a verse. He had a remarkable memory and knew where each mile marker was located on the route to his cabin in Colorado.

Martin served in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout his life wherever he was called. He volunteered as an ordinance worker in the Provo Temple for two years. He considered his therapy work a mission and used to say he had called himself on another mission in his 50s. He loved the Lord deeply and he loved to serve Him by serving others. His sons and grandchildren brought him joy and he was very proud of them. He will be loved and missed by all his family members until we are all reunited in heaven.

Martin’s request was that his body be cremated and the ashes taken to his land in Colorado where a private memorial service will be held.

The Green Bison Soy Processing facility will help us further optimize our renewable feedstock sourcing and we are excited about the opportunity to partner with ADM and the state of North Dakota as we move forward with the development of this facility.”

When complete the approximately $350 million complex will feature state-of-the-art automation technology and is expected to have the capacity to process 150000 bushels of soybeans per day. Vegetable oil from the plant will be supplied exclusively to MPC to serve as feedstock for the production of a targeted 75 million gallons of renewable diesel annually.

The construction of the new complex is supporting hundreds of jobs in the region and the facility is expected to employ approximately 75 people once operational.

“As a Top 10 soybean-producing state the ADM-MPC joint venture is a game-changer that will provide lasting benefits for North Dakota soybean growers” Governor Doug Burgum of North Dakota said. “Green Bison will add value and expand the market for one of our farmers’ most important crops while also creating 75 direct jobs and diversifying our economy to support our communities our citizens and the entire state. It’s also a shining example of the growing synergy between our agriculture and energy sectors in North Dakota. We appreciate ADM and MPC for this significant investment in our state and their well-placed faith in our highly productive and innovative farmers and we’re grateful for the efforts of Lt. Gov. Sanford and so many other state federal and local partners who helped make this happen.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS93ZXJlLW5vdC1nb25uYS10YWtlLWl0LXdoYXQtZG8tdXMtcmVmaW5lcmllcy1pbXBvcnQtZnJvbS1ydXNzaWEtYW5kLXdoYXQtaWYtdGhleS1zdG9w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We're Not Gonna Take It - What Do U.S. Refineries Import from Russia?

Some tourism operators in Nigeria want Marriott International to bring St. Regis to Nigeria following the announcement that the hotel chain plans to open in the United Kingdom. Marriott International Inc. which manages top hotels around the world had announced the signing of a management agreement with Cola Holdings and The Westbury Hotel Limited to bring the luxury St. Regis brand to the United Kingdom. The new entrant situated on one of London’s most alluring neighbourhoods is expected to welcome its first guests in 2023.

St. Regis will also open 11 new resorts around the world by 2025. The announcement was made in the Marriot Virtual Press Briefing recently which was hosted by the President EMEA and Senior Vice President Design Hotels & EMEA Brand Portfolio Satya Anand who also gave overview of some of Marriott’s brilliant openings this year.

The Nigerian operators expressed their joy saying that business travellers will have the most pleasant time when they visit Nigeria if the prestigious St. Regis is represented in Nigeria on franchise. They said the newly established Marriott property in Ikeja Lagos is already showing results after the agreement was signed.

An event planner Chioma Egu from Lagos hails the move saying “St. Regis is a few luxury away.” She wants Marriott to bring the brand to Nigeria to join the vibrant Lagos hospitality market.

“St. Regis brand is not represented in Nigeria right now. We expect the cherished St. Regis brand to be premiering in Nigeria” she said excitedly. Egu continued “The anticipated St. Regis Hotel will not only add more beds to the competitive Lagos market it will also undoubtedly be well received by the executives.

Another tourism operator in the country pinning her hope on Marriott to give more beds is Ibiso Lawal. While commenting on Marriot International new achievement Ibiso one of Nigeria’s travel experts urged Regis Hotels & Resorts to bring the ‘leader in luxury’ here.

“I think their policy transcends the purely commercial gains important though they are. St. Regis brand will stand out. I will be delighted if Marriott will manage a St. Regis hotel in Nigeria to enable people here to feel its classy brand” he noted.

According to him “Nigeria has hotels. We have Sheraton Hilton Golden Tulip brands to mention just a few. The question is which hotel chain is not represented in Nigeria. But we want more saleable rooms in the upmarket segment. Already Marriott International is making waves in Lagos. Like Oliver Twist we want St. Regis and you know what that means for the accommodation segment in Nigeria competition will bring down rates.”

Travel industry insiders are desirous of having more saleable rooms in the upmarket segment of Abuja and Lagos hotel industry to bring down rates. At present it has been difficult to control price. Lagos has one of the world’s highest accommodation tariffs. Lagos Tourism has received poor record when it comes to accommodation tariffs. Hotel rates in Lagos remain high. For example guestroom rates at Sun Heaven Hotels & Resorts Ikoyi Lagos start from N45000 to N150.000 a night.

Another Lagos hotel Eko Hotels & Suites charges higher rates which starts from N69000 a night to N300.000 a night (Eko Signature).

The challenge is the market forces a mismatch in demand and supply whereby more guests are looking for a few standard guestrooms. Prices for the saleable rooms are therefore very high.

Speaking earlier on hotels a MASHAV expert from Israel Illan Ben-Joseph said: “Nigeria has hotels and more are coming.” What should worry people he said is having budget hotels. “Most hotels in Nigeria are in Lagos. What happened to places like Jos where you hardly find a good hotel? Government should encourage entrepreneurs to develop hotels and attractions in certain areas and give tax relief” Ben-Joseph said.

The St. Regis brand meanwhile continues to expand its renowned global portfolio by adding this highly sought-after address in Mayfair London. Plans call for an extensive $122 million (90 million pound) redevelopment and transformation of the former Westbury Mayfair Hotel with the addition of an eighth floor.

St. Regis London which boasts 196 rooms and suites is offering a highly personalised guest experience on the corner of Bond Street and Conduit Street that will blend the brand’s modern glamour with the best of British style and service.

The hotel will be designed by Peter Newman-Earp of Morrison Design with interiors by Richmond International. Furthermore the property is set to receive an extension to the rear of the hotel creating enhanced public areas along with renovations to the façade of the building and the drop-off area outside of the main entrance. Design plans include a signature restaurant speakeasy jazz bar fitness centre and spa.

The St. Regis London will honour the building’s heritage by retaining the iconic Polo Bar originally designed for the Phipps family of America avid polo players and creators of the Westbury Hotel in New York and London and where guests will be able to enjoy a local twist on the Bloody Mary St. Regis’ signature cocktail."

In times of turmoil employers need to address the impact that events can have on their workers even those far from the center of conflict.

This crisis will be most traumatic for employees in Ukraine or the wider region and for those employees with family and friends located there but many are feeling shocked saddened and anxious about what may lie ahead.

That this tragedy is unfolding on the heels of a global pandemic is amplifying feelings of uncertainty. But as we learned during the pandemic there is much that employers can do to help employees weather a crisis with empathy and meaningful support.

Your actions during the Russia-Ukraine conflict will likely have a long-lasting impact on your people and the resilience of your own business. Employees will remember how their employer supported or didn’t support them in this and other periods of crisis.

So what can organizations do now to manage with empathy?

The safety and security of employees should be the number one priority. Employers with operations in Ukraine and neighboring areas have the most pressing challenges: they may have employees who are fleeing sheltering or involved in combat. Consider how you can assist with basic needs including food transportation communications healthcare cash and legal assistance. And you may want to let all employees know what steps you are taking to help those directly affected by the war to help ease the sense of powerlessness many are feeling.

Consider how you can assist with basic needs including food transportation communications healthcare cash and legal assistance. And you may want to let all employees know what steps you are taking to help those directly affected by the war to help ease the sense of powerlessness many are feeling. Open the dialogue. Even if you don’t have operations in the region don’t assume that the attack on Ukraine doesn’t directly impact any of your employees — it very well may. It’s important to address the situation and open up the dialogue. Remind employees how to contact the Employee Assistance Program and tap into other mental health resources. While blast company communications have an important role managers are the key communicators in this situation — make sure they are prepared and have resources to support employees.

Offer ways to help. It's natural to be distressed by what we're seeing and many people are wondering what they can do to alleviate the suffering of those directly affected. Helping others has been proven to improve mental health and well-being and there are countless ways to help with the crisis in Ukraine. Provide a list of credible charities and organizations that are accepting donations and consider matching your employees’ donations.

While the impact of this crisis will be experienced differently by each employee employers can make a meaningful difference. Let employees know what you are doing to support the people of Ukraine even if you don’t have operations there. Beyond that flexibility supportive leadership and thoughtful communications can help those affected directly and indirectly know that you care.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Chieftains the top-ranked team entering the competition beat out the likes of second-seeded Franklin (144.900) and the third-seeded Wilmington/Bedford co-op squad (142.450).

Masconomet got off to a great start on the vault thanks in large part to Misiura and Brandt who posted scores of 9.850 and 9.750 respectively the top two showings on the day for the event.

“They’ve worked their entire life at gymnastics and the two of them their work ethic at the gym is unparalleled” said Masco coach Alicia Gomes-Miffitt. “You can’t outwork those girls. It just shows in their performance.”

On bars Misiura scored a 9.750 freshman Fallon Eberhardt put up a 9.250 and Brandt a 9.200.

The depth was on display again on the beam typically a pivotal event with a flurry of high scores from Brandt (9.500) Misiura (9.000) senior Emma Quirk (9.150) and freshman Natalia Carfarelli (9.000).

The Chieftains took a commanding lead into the final event and did not relent with performances of 9.100 from Quirk 9.375 for Carfarelli 9.525 for Misiura and 9.575 for Brandt.

“Carfarelli’s floor routine was phenomenal” Gomes-Miffitt said. “She had a hard meet at sectionals and wiped out on floor pretty bad. To have that confidence to come back to a state meet and do what she did was amazing I’m just super proud of her.”

Despite there being no tournament in 2021 the Masco program did not skip a beat with its third consecutive state title overall and with a young core are primed to dominate for years to come.

“This year we have a really strong freshman class” said Gomes-Miffitt. “I never really look into the future I think about every single day in the gym just working hard and seeing where we end up.”

Franklin senior Emma White was tremendous on the day scoring 9.650 on bars 9.800 on the beam 9.750 on the floor and 9.725 on vault highlighting her team’s runner-up performance.

White had the highest all-around score with 38.925 and her performance on beam and floor were the high scores on the day.

Wilmington/Bedford got strong performances from Emily Provost on the floor (9.400) and vault (9.350).",,,,,,,,,,,,

Russia’s homegrown payments system Mir said the cardholders would still be able to access their funds make withdrawals and domestic transfers – at least until their bank cards expire.

Mir has processed most domestic payments in Russia since 2015 while foreign operators such as Visa and Mastercard continued to run international transactions. The operator – which is 100% owned by the country’s central bank – was established on government orders to protect the economy against sanctions imposed over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

“All cards of these payment systems already issued by Russian banks will continue to work within our country as before” Mir’s operator said in the early hours of Sunday.

“Until the expiration of their validity Visa and Mastercard cardholders have access to all the funds on their accounts as well as all the usual payment transactions – paying for purchases transferring funds from card to card withdrawing cash etc.”

The statement was issued shortly after the US firms declared on Saturday they would be suspending Russian operations in light of Moscow’s continued military assault on Ukraine.

On Sunday American Express said it was also suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus. “In light of Russia’s ongoing unjustified attack on the people of Ukraine American Express is suspending all operations in Russia” the credit card company said in a statement on its website. “We are also terminating all business operations in Belarus.”

Both Mastercard and Visa’s decision to suspend their Russian operations will primarily impact foreign payments meaning local consumers will no longer be able to use their Russian cards abroad or for international payments online. Foreign customers will also be blocked from making payments to Russian companies or withdrawing cash within the country.

“Payments abroad including on foreign internet resources will not be available with Visa and Mastercard international payment systems cards issued by Russian banks” Mir confirmed.

The move is expected to accelerate Russian banks’ adoption of Mir’s own cards which are accepted in a handful of countries including Turkey Vietnam Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

On Saturday Mir said it already had seen a surge in demand for its cards after sanctions were imposed against Russian banks by the US EU and UK. According to its own statistics more than half of Russians already owned a Mir card as of September 2021 accounting for 32% of all transactions.

The uptake is likely to play into critics’ fears that economic sanctions will merely incentivise Russia to invest in alternative schemes. Similar concerns have been raised about blocking Russia from Swift – the secure message system used by banks for cross-border payments – and the potential rise of alternatives such as Russia’s equivalent SPFS system.

PayPal stopped accepting new customers in Russia on Wednesday and on Saturday expanded that block saying its services there – primarily customers transferring money to each other – had been suspended. It added that it would allow withdrawals “for a period of time ensuring that account balances are dispersed in line with applicable laws and regulations”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzMvNS8yMjk2MzQzMy92aXNhLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtc3VzcGVuZC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visa and Mastercard suspend their services in Russia,"Visa and Mastercard are suspending operations in Russia in another major blow to the country’s financial system according to a report from the Associated Press.

In an announcement on Visa’s website the company says it’s working with partners in Russia to “cease all transactions over the coming days.” A separate press release from Mastercard contains a similar message noting that it’s suspending services in Russia and that its decision wasn’t taken “lightly.” Both companies explain that any transactions made with Mastercard or Visa cards issued by banks in Russia won’t work outside of Russia while any cards issued by banks outside of the country won’t work at Russian merchants or ATMs.

“We regret the impact this will have”

“We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues and on the clients partners merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia” Visa CEO Al Kelly states. “This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values.”

As noted by Bloomberg anyone with a card issued in Russia will still be able to pay for products and services with Mastercard and Visa cards however neither financial company will process the transactions — Russia’s National Payment Card System (NSPK) will have to handle them instead.

Visa and Mastercard’s announcement comes shortly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with US lawmakers and asked that they halt both companies’ operations in Russia. “Pleased to hear that Mastercard and Visa will be suspending all their operations in Russia effective immediately” Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) said on Twitter following the meeting with Zelensky.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdmlzYS1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLXJ1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLWludmFzaW9uL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL3Zpc2EtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS1pbnZhc2lvbi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visa Mastercard and American Express suspend operations in Russia over Ukraine invasion,"Mastercard and Visa are suspending their operations in Russia the companies said Saturday in the latest blow to the country's financial system after its invasion of Ukraine. American Express followed suit on Sunday and said they would be suspending operations in Russia.

American Express said their cards will no longer work at merchants or ATMs in Russia. Additionally American Express said they will be terminating all business operations in Belarus.

""One of our company values is to 'Do What is Right'"" American Express said in a statement. ""This principle has guided us throughout this difficult crisis and will continue to do so as we stand by our colleagues customers and the international community in hoping for a peaceful resolution to this crisis.""

Mastercard said cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by its network and any Mastercard issued outside the country will not work at Russian stores or ATMs.

""We don't take this decision lightly"" Mastercard said in a statement adding that it made the move after discussions with customers partners and governments.

Visa said it's working with clients and partners in Russia to cease all Visa transactions over the coming days.

""We are compelled to act following Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed"" Visa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly said in a statement.

The twin suspensions were announced within 16 minutes of each other and they followed a private video call earlier in the day between President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and U.S. lawmakers. During that conversation Zelensky ""asked us to turn off MasterCard and Visa for Russia"" Representative Brad Sherman a Democrat from California tweeted. ""I agree"" he added before Mastercard and Visa made their announcements.

Earlier in the week Visa and Mastercard had announced more limited moves to block financial institutions from the networks that serve as arteries for the payments system. Russian people have already been hit hard by heavy sanctions and financial penalties imposed by the U.S. government and others.

Since the invasion of Ukraine the value of the Russian currency the ruble has plunged by more than a third to a record low. That's pushing up inflation for Russian households and all the fear has helped cause long lines at ATMs.

Many other companies around the world have also made moves to increase the financial pressure on Russia and its people because of its attack on Ukraine. Some are selling their stakes in Russian companies such as energy giant BP while others like Harley-Davidson halted product shipments to the country.

""This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values"" Visa's Kelly said.

The moves by Mastercard and Visa could make real differences to their bottom lines. Russia accounted for 4% of all of Visa's net revenue in its last fiscal year including money made from domestic and cross-border activities. Ukraine accounted for about 1% Visa said in a filing with U.S. securities regulators this week.

Mastercard said in its own filing that about 4% of its net revenues during 2021 came from business conducted within into and out of Russia. Another roughly 2% was related to Ukraine."

Rashid Khan puts national duty above franchise cricket

Afghanistan leg spinner Rashid Khan said on Saturday (March 5) that he is not ready to play franchise cricket at the expense of national duty.

Rashid who took part in the 2022 edition of the Pakistan Super League joined his team-mates just before Afghanistan's series against Bangladesh and there were reports that he could leave the series midway to be with the Lahore Qalandars for the final of the PSL. Rashid however confirmed on Twitter that he wasn't leaving Bangladesh to take part in PSL putting the rumours to rest.

""It's not about work or not work national duty is national duty. You do well for the national team or you do bad that is different thing that is something which is not in the control of the players. But overall I think wherever I go and wherever I play when there is national team (commitments) I have to be there'' Rashid said.

""When my national team is on tour I have to be there and I have to be ready to play. It's not about if I'm effective or not my presence will give the message to all the youngsters that there is no bigger thing than national duty. Whatever happens you have to leave that and you have to come to national duty.

""I am here because of my national team as Afghanistan has taken me to this position. If the Afghanistan team was not there I don't know where I would be I don't know what I would have been doing but Afghanistan has given me all the respect all the name...I have to respect that and I have to be available for my team anywhere any time'' he said.

Rashid added that he is looking forward to playing international cricket back home in Afghanistan which according to him is a bigger dream than winning the World Cup. The political situation in Afghanistan has meant that the board hasn't been able to host international matches at home and instead have played their home games in the UAE and a few other venues.

''Playing in my own country is my biggest dream. That is a bigger dream than winning the World Cup for my team. Playing in home conditions - you know when were playing and we saw the support for the Bangladesh team - that is different feeling. I want that same feeling in my country as well and I think it is the dream of every player...I hope it happens soon when we are playing international cricket. It's a dream of a country and dream of every player"" said Rashid.

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

The SNP said it does not comment on such matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

In New York close to 35 percent of Mcdonald's ice cream machines were broken Saturday morning. In Dallas 17.24 percent weren’t working. In Los Angeles and Chicago nearly 16 percent were broken. Fortunately for San Francisco residents with a hankering for ice cream no machines were reported down.

For many customers – including some who have created memes and petitions about their McDonald’s ice cream-related woes – it may seem strange that a company with more than $23 billion in revenue would have such trouble keeping equipment running for years. Even McDonald’s social media team has joked about it.

So what is going on? Why aren't these machines working?

According to Wired the $18000 Taylor Brand ice cream machines used at over 13000 McDonald's locations ""have gained a reputation for being absurdly fickle and fragile"" and have a hard-to-navigate user interface.

Not too long ago there was an outside attempt to make the machines easier to use.

""It's a huge money maker to have a customer that's purposefully intentionally blind and unable to make very fundamental changes to their own equipment"" Jeremy O’Sullivan told Wired.

After studying the machines O'Sullivan and his partner Melissa Nelson started selling a Wi-Fi gadget called Kytch around three years ago that ""essentially hacks"" the machines and offers an easier interface. Now they are suing both Taylor and McDonald’s.

Kytch filed a complaint against McDonald’s Tuesday. Previously the startup sued Taylor. It claims both companies attempted to reverse engineer Kytch's device according to Food & Wine. In July a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Taylor related to the case said the outlet.

In a statement sent to Food & Wine McDonald's USA called the allegations ""meritless.""

At one point McDonald's owners in 30 states used Kytch's breakdown-spotter the startup company said according to The Wall Street Journal. However McDonald's told franchisees that the devices were not sanctioned and could pose a safety hazard. Kytch denies it.

""A lot of what's been broadcasted can be attributed to the lack of knowledge about the equipment and how they operate in the restaurants"" a Taylor representative said. ""You have to make sure the machine is cleaned properly. The machines are built up with a lot of interconnecting parts that have to operate in a complex environment and manner.""

In particular an automated heat-cleaning cycle intended to destroy bacteria that can last up to four hours causes issues for McDonald's stores. If the cycle fails the machines can't be used until a repair technician can get them going again.

In September The Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Trade Commission had reached out to McDonald's franchisees over the summer about the ice cream machine problem. Even with the reported FTC inquiry and legal battles regarding the machines it doesn’t seem that they are getting easier to use according to mcbroken.com statistics.

Software engineer Rashiq Zahid created the site in 2020 when he was 24 years old according to The Verge. Jack in the Box another fast food chain partnered with mcbroken this week to promote its own frozen treats.

The finicky machines at McDonald's are such a cliché that a whole website has been dedicated to tracking their malfunction around the country (nearly 9% of U.S. machines are broken as of writing). The elusive soft serve and McFlurries have spawned memes conspiracy theories and even led to several competitors poking fun at Mickey D's.

Then in the fall of 2020 McDonald's franchisees banded together to form a soft-serve salvation squad which resulted in the use of a device that tapped into the soft serve machine's inner workings and allowed restaurant owners to more easily identify a solution to the machine's ever-present problems.

Unfortunately it seems that as soon as operators started seeing the benefits of the new technology (created by a software company called Kytch) McDonald's decided to sabotage the whole operation.

Now Kytch is suing the chain to the tune of $900 million for halting the software company's success and making false accusations about the safety of their devices.

The lawsuit brought forth by Kytch isn't necessarily a surprise. The company sued McDonald's ice cream machine manufacturer Taylor and its distributor last spring for theft of trade secrets. The weird part is that through the discovery process of the lawsuit Kytch found that McDonald's not Taylor spearheaded efforts to copy Kytch's product and spread negative rumors about the company.

But why is McDonald's getting all worked up about a tool that actually fixes their ice cream machines? Kytch has a few theories.

The first theory is that of a ""lucrative scheme"" going on between McDonald's and Taylor. By allowing Taylor to monopolize the manufacturing and repair of their ice cream machines (which Kytch alleges were designed to malfunction) McDonald's is helping the company reap millions of dollars in revenue. In turn Taylor continues to create new kitchen products exclusively for McDonald's.

Another theory is that the number one fast-food chain was mad that Kytch solved their problem without them while McDonald's had been ""trying"" to figure out a solution with Taylor for the last twenty years.

""Positive coverage about Kytch angered McDonald's"" reads the complaint put forth by Kytch. The complaint further accuses McDonald's and Taylor of joining forces to ""drive Kytch out of the marketplace."" It continues: ""According to Taylor's internal emails 'McDonald's [was] putting all of their eggs in this basket to fight Kytch' because '[t]hey have nothing else ready from their own IT Team.'""

The lawsuit puts forth both of these theories as reasoning why McDonald's allegedly made false accusations against Kytch while simultaneously trying to steal its technology. The complaint also alleges that the fast-food chain and Taylor ""enlisted a group of Kytch Trial participants to develop a competing product that would prevent Kytch from fixing the machines"" and ""held bi-weekly meetings devoted to copying Kytch's technology.""

While it seems strange that McDonald's wouldn't welcome a solution to its soft-serve woes with open arms you can't forget that the fast-food chain itself was allegedly founded on a stolen idea depending on who you ask. Businessman Ray Kroc calls himself the founder but many other sources say he stole the concept and burger recipes from the McDonald brothers.

It's unclear how this legal battle will pan out but it looks like you probably won't be having an easier time getting a McFlurry anytime soon—sorry!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Z3J6LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMi1kZWFkLTEtaW5qdXJlZC1hZnRlci1zaG9vdGluZy1hdC1hLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1wYXJraW5nLWxvdC1pbi1idWZmYWxvLWNyaW1lLWNvbW11bml0eS12aW9sZW5jZS13bnkvNzEtMzdlOWI5OWMtNjg1OC00MGRhLTlkMTMtN2U2YTM4ZTk5ZWQ30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 dead 1 injured after shooting in a McDonald's parking lot in Buffalo,"Officers were called to the McDonald's at Genesee Street and Bailey Avenue around 11:30 p.m. Saturday after a shooting in the parking lot.

BUFFALO N.Y. — The Buffalo Police Department said two men have died and another man is recovering after a shooting Saturday night.

BPD said officers were called to the McDonald's at Genesee Street and Bailey Avenue around 11:30 p.m. after getting reports of a shooting in the parking lot.

When police arrived at the scene they found three shooting victims. A 26-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. A 27-year-old was transported to Erie County Medical Center where he later died and a 28-year-old is listed in fair condition.

According to the BPD the shooting appeared to be targeted in nature.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lYXRwb3VsdHJ5LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNjU2My1tY2RvbmFsZHMtdG8tZGVjaWRlLW9uLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1ydXNzaWFuLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtYnktZW5kLW9mLWp1bmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's to decide on future of Russian operations by end of June,"CHICAGO — McDonald’s Corp. plans to announce further decisions about its operations in Russia and Ukraine by the end of the second quarter which would be the end of June said Christopher J. Kempczinski president and chief executive officer.

“In both countries we have continued to pay employees and provide additional support to them and others in need but it's clear that this crisis is far from over” he said in an April 28 earnings call to discuss financial results for the first quarter ended March 31. “With an ever-evolving situation we are analyzing our options and expect to provide clear direction to investors and other stakeholders no later than the end of the second quarter.”

He later in the call added “I would tell you that we are being exhaustive. So my guess is that there probably isn’t a scenario that you could come up with on your own that we’re not looking at.”

McDonald’s temporarily suspended operations in Russia and Ukraine at the end of February because of the war in Ukraine. The company in the quarter had $27 million of costs related to the continuation of employee salaries lease and supplier payments as well as $100 million of costs for inventory in McDonald’s supply chain that likely will be disposed of because of the restaurants closing.

The Russian and Ukrainian markets combined represented about 2% of McDonald’s systemwide sales in 2021 Kempczinski said. Closing the restaurants had a negligible impact on the company’s overall sales in the first quarter he said.

McDonald’s net income in the quarter was $1.10 billion equal to $1.48 per share on the common stock a 28% decrease from $1.54 billion or $2.05 per share in the previous year’s first quarter. Revenues rose 11% to $5.67 billion from $5.12 billion."

Polaris the Medina-based vehicle maker is among the U.S. companies that last week halted sales or exports to Russia in response to that country's invasion of Ukraine.

Apple said last week it stopped selling iPhones and other products in Russia and Nike temporarily closed its stores in Russia. Other companies such as Microsoft Ford and Exxon have suspended products or operations there.

Companies are navigating trade restrictions and political pressure as well as the logistical and financial challenges of continuing to operate in Russia with its economy in turmoil.

A Polaris spokeswoman didn't share how much of the company's sales come from Russia and added that its decision was not related to sanctions. The company's primary markets are the U.S. and Canada with other countries including Russia accounting for the remaining 14% of its sales according to company filings.

But for the most part Russia is not a big business partner for Minnesota.

It was the state's 33rd largest market abroad for goods in 2021 with $65 million in exports. That accounted for a tiny fraction of Minnesota's $24 billion in total exports last year according to an analysis of trade data by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED).

On the flip side Minnesota imports far less from Russia — about $7 million last year for items such as fertilizer books and plastics according to DEED. That number has also been rapidly declining in the last couple of years.

Minnesota's largest export markets with annual total sales in the billions of dollars are Canada China and Mexico. Other countries high up on the list are Japan South Korea and Germany.

Indeed the state's exports to Russia declined in the last couple of years. They're down 38% since 2019 while the state's exports overall have otherwise risen 6%.

The largest categories of state exports to Russia last year were medical devices ($16 million) and machinery ($16 million) the latter of which includes computers and lifting machines. Other areas were electrical equipment ($14 million) such as integrated circuits and switches and vehicles ($7 million) which includes snowmobiles.

Medical device maker Medtronic whose operational headquarters are in the Twin Cities has a presence in both Russia and Ukraine where it has nearly 300 employees.

Russia accounts for less than 1% of the company's total sales Karen Parkhill Medtronic's chief financial officer told the Star Tribune shortly before the fighting began Feb. 24.

After the war began Medtronic said in a statement that it was evaluating the effects of the sanctions closely and would follow legal requirements ""while doing our best to mitigate impacts on patients.""

Ukraine is a smaller trading partner for Minnesota ranking 54th as an export market with $18 million in goods sent there last year. The largest categories for exports were vehicles aircraft (engines and parts) machinery and electrical machinery.

And Ukraine came in 69th in terms of goods imported to Minnesota with $5 million in goods mostly plastics honey machinery and milling products.

There are several Minnesota companies that have offices in Russia or Ukraine including 3M Cargill Medtronic and Ecolab.

There are no known Russian companies operating in Minnesota according to state officials.

Ann Callie Manning best known for her enormous leadership contributions to social racial and economic justice initiatives died March 3 2022. Born in her beloved Keosauqua Iowa to Evelyn (Trink) Manning and John Albert Manning on November 24 1947 Ann was 74 years old. A lifelong leader of causes that sought to dismantle systemic injustices she was a loved mentor to many in the Twin Cities and beyond.

Ann graduated from Old Dominion University in Accounting St. Mary’s University with a Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology and from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government where she received a mid-career Masters in Public Administration. After her first job as a CPA accountant she had as she later described “a “checkered career history”. She held positions in Human Resources and Director of Corporate Planning at Medtronic Director of Strategic Business Services at Wilson Leaning and Strategic Planning consultant with U Care and numerous other corporate and non-profit groups.

She was Coordinator Wealth for the Common Good a network of leaders that promotes an economy that works for everyone. She also organized the second annual Women’s Congress of the Science and Environmental Health Network for which she was honored with the 84th Sullivan Ballou award. It honors activists reformers and others who have “merged their hearts and actions into the wave of spiritual evolution that is making the world a better place”.

It was in her social and racial justice work that Ann most embodied the principles of her Christian heritage and her Buddhist practice. Her latest work with Plymouth Congregational Church’s Racial Justice Initiative was a testimony to her values of compassion and equity for all. As a member of the Board of the Indigenous Peoples Task Force was deeply involved in its Capital Campaign for its new Center for Art and Wellness support of its youth choir ensemble and her participation in water walks to honor and protect our living waters. She was a member of Tergar Meditation Community under the guidance of Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche. Members described her as an activist embodying the principles of a Bodhisattva whose intention in life is to be a benefit to all beings.

Ann was a natural networker aligning with and supporting additional causes for which she nudged her friends to become active. Many say they would not be doing the particular community work they’re currently engaged in if it weren’t for her invitation - no her gentle but bold suggestion. Days before she died some of her “closest” 100+ friends participated in a Zoom meeting to celebrate her life. They spoke to her how her compassion mentorship witness and friendship had played an impact in their lives. As one friend later said memories of her “wisdom and grace fill my broken heart.” Another said “She made the world a better place.”

Ann was a woman of uncommon intelligence charm and equanimity. She had a wry sense of humor that usually contained a clear message. Her last Facebook post just one month ago proclaimed “I Read Banned Books. What’s on your list to read this winter?” She also loved music of all genres. She had a beautiful voice and it’s no surprise that one of the last times she awakened was to the sound of a music therapist singing and playing “There’ll be Peace in the Valley for Me” on his guitar. She opened her eyes and said very clearly “So true” and then returned to her deep slumber.

Ann was devoted to her large family. She was preceded in death by her parents Evelyn (Trink) and John Albert Manning and is also survived by her siblings: George Manning (Kathy) Mai Nguyen (AFS) (Ham) John Manning (Lynn) David Manning (Janet) Matt Manning (Judy) Albert Manning (Kim) Elizabeth Manning her aunt Betty Perkins her many nieces nephews and cousins. The Manning family wants to pay special appreciation to her longtime friend and devoted caregiver Barb Arney and her large numbers of friends and co-conspirators for their love and support over her illness. They also appreciate the tender care given to Ann at the J.A. Wedum Residential Hospice and to the wonderful staff in various departments of Abbott Northwestern Hospital.

Donations can be made in Ann’s honor to Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative Indigenous Peoples Task Force (Nibiwalk and Ikidowin programs) Science and Environmental Health Network or any other program with which Ann was involved. Condolences may be addressed to: Barbara Arney 6800 York Ave S Apt 810 Edina MN 55435. A celebration of life service will be held at Plymouth Congregational Church 1900 Nicollet Avenue Minneapolis May 17 2022 at 10 am. Additionally there will be a graveside service at Purdom Cemetery in Keosauqua Iowa followed by a celebration of life at the Hotel Manning on Saturday April 30 2022 at 2 pm.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."
META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIyOTU5ODYwL21ldGF2ZXJzZS1leHBsYWluZWQtdmlkZW8tZ2FtZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The metaverse explained: what it is and why tech companies love it,"What is the metaverse?

Good question. “Metaverse” is currently a major buzzword in the worlds of tech business and finance and like all buzzwords its definition is fuzzy contested and shaped by the ambitions of the people using it.

Here’s one thing we can say for sure: The term was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash to describe a virtual world in wide use in his imagined future a 21st-century dystopia. In Snow Crash the metaverse is a virtual-reality world depicted as a planet-encircling market where virtual real estate can be bought and sold and where VR goggle-wearing users inhabit 3D avatars whose form they have freedom to choose.

These three elements — a VR interface digital ownership and avatars — still feature prominently in current conceptions of the metaverse. But none of them is actually essential to the idea. In the broadest terms the metaverse is understood as a graphically rich virtual space with some degree of verisimilitude where people can work play shop socialize — in short do the things humans like to do together in real life (or perhaps more to the point on the internet). Metaverse proponents often focus on the concept of “presence” as a defining factor: feeling like you’re really there and feeling like other people are really there with you too.

This version of the metaverse arguably already exists in the form of video games. But there’s another definition of the metaverse that goes beyond the virtual worlds we know. This definition doesn’t actually describe the metaverse at all but does explain why everyone thinks it’s so important. This definition isn’t about a vision for the future or a new technology. Rather it looks to the past and to the now commonplace technologies of the internet and smartphones and assumes that it will be necessary to invent the metaverse to replace them.

The influential venture capitalist Matthew Ball who has written extensively about the metaverse describes it as “a sort of successor state to the mobile internet.” (Mark Zuckerberg who last year gave his company Facebook the name Meta and said the metaverse would be its focus has used an almost identical phrase; clearly Ball’s essays are hugely influential on Silicon Valley thinking.) Remember when smartphones revolutionized tech the economy and society itself? The metaverse is expected to be an equivalent watershed and lots of businesses want to get ahead of that.

There are many things to challenge in Ball’s vision but the biggest is his proposition that the metaverse will be a single network as open interconnected and interoperable as the internet is now. That’s a very big ask. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

Is the metaverse new?

In brief: lol no. We’ve already established that the term has been around for 30 years and not just in fictional form. It’s formed a part of corporate visions of the future for quite some time. During the first VR boom of the ’90s U.K. grocery chain Sainsbury’s put together a VR shopping demo that’s eerily similar to a video that Walmart made in 2017.

Beyond marketing puff-pieces and proof-of-concept demos metaverse-like virtual worlds have actually existed for almost as long as their fictional counterparts. Hype pieces about people getting married in the metaverse will elicit a sigh of recognition from anyone who has followed online gaming for the past few decades. One of the most famous virtual worlds and perhaps the closest to the metaverse ideal is Second Life an “online multimedia platform” which launched in 2003.

Second Life mostly resembles an early-’00s massively multiplayer online role-playing game like World of Warcraft only with all the game taken out: the combat the quests the stories the rewards. It fulfills many of the roles imagined for the metaverse of the future and has done so since its launch. Users are embodied in avatars and hang out with each other in virtual spaces. They enjoy virtual versions of real-world experiences from business meetings to clubbing. Users can create their own content and services and trade with one another. There’s a virtual economy with its own currency which can be exchanged with real-world currency. Second Life is almost a textbook metaverse to the extent that such a thing exists.

Another notable but oft-forgotten example of an early metaverse was PlayStation Home. Sony’s ill-fated virtual social hub for PlayStation 3 launched in 2008 and closed in 2015 to the sorrow of its tiny community. It didn’t go anywhere and seemed to a casual user quite pointless but it’s an interesting example of what a highly corporatized metaverse — as opposed to the anarchic community-driven Second Life — might look like. It featured a lot of advertising and one-way purchasing opportunities and not a great deal else to do; it suffered from sitting right next to much richer and more entertaining virtual worlds the games themselves in your PS3 interface. But the clean blandly stylized utopian futurism of its art style clearly prefigures Zuckerberg’s recent metaverse demo. This is what companies think our dreams look like.

The reality of course is probably closer to the messy sometimes grubby Second Life. Give humans a chance to build a world without restrictions and they’ll either come up with a branding opportunity or a fetish dungeon. That should serve as either a warning for the future architects of the metaverse or an opportunity.

Why is everyone suddenly talking about the metaverse?

There are a few factors that have catapulted it to the forefront of the tech industry’s thinking in the past few years. One is that a couple of technologies closely associated with visions of the metaverse have matured. Virtual reality which was taking its first faltering steps in the ’90s as Stephenson wrote Snow Crash is now well a reality. Commercially available headsets of decent quality exist including standalone wireless devices like the Quest. Facebook’s purchase of Oculus in 2014 was an early indication of where Zuckerberg thought his business might be headed.

Another is the blockchain the barely comprehensible and energy-hungry technology that has made cryptocurrencies and NFTs possible. NFTs which have become an obsession for crypto enthusiasts snake-oil salesmen suggestible executives and (bizarrely) some parts of the art world over the last year or so could enable the ownership of virtual items and real estate within the metaverse.

It should be noted that it is possible to “own” and even trade virtual items in plenty of games and virtual spaces Second Life included without using the blockchain — but that ownership is pretty flimsy and usually subject to a license agreement. NFTs offer different (but similarly flimsy) methodologies of proving ownership. Regardless the uniqueness and supposed portability of NFTs has metaverse proponents excited.

Just as significant a factor in the metaverse trend is the coronavirus pandemic which has radically altered lifestyles across the planet. With people spending so long in Zoom meetings for work and with soaring use of video games as people seek to enter more colorful and exciting environments without leaving the comfort and safety of their homes it’s natural for tech companies to look for ways to capitalize on the situation by bridging these two needs.

Late in 2021 Facebook’s rebranding and its metaverse-focused mission statement sealed the deal. Since then the term has cropped up with increasing ubiquity — in the business world at least. The world of government and politics may take a while to catch up as it focuses on how to contain the power of Big Tech in the here and now as well as how to mitigate the deleterious effects of social media on actual society — which continues to be a thing. Boring!

Isn’t the metaverse just… video games?

Maybe! You know who thinks so? Microsoft. On buying Activision Blizzard for almost 70 billion dollars Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella commented: “When we think about our vision for what a metaverse can be we believe there won’t be a single centralized metaverse and there shouldn’t be. We need to support many metaverse platforms … in gaming we see the metaverse as a collection of communities and individual identities anchored in strong content franchises accessible on every device.”

It’s possible Nadella was just throwing shareholders the buzzword of the day in the hope it would help get them behind such an enormous acquisition. Nevertheless he was outlining a vision that was strikingly different from the all-encompassing VR internet put forward by Ball and Zuckerberg. In his version metaverses are plural and they’re all around us already. They are persistent communities formed around virtual places where people want to be — like World of Warcraft or Call of Duty: Warzone.

There’s consistency in Microsoft’s thinking here. In 2014 around the same time Facebook acquired Oculus Microsoft bought Mojang and its enormously popular game Minecraft. Minecraft with its social creative and deeply customizable gameplay is often cited as a metaverse-adjacent game and it’s notable that Microsoft has not tried to strongarm it into exclusivity on its own platforms; it views Minecraft as a valuable platform in its own right.

MMOs like WoW share an obvious kinship with metaverses in form if not function. But there are closer analogues to be found in two post-Minecraft games that are hugely popular with kids. In both Roblox and Fortnite your avatar your presence your customization choices and your social connections are almost more important than the game itself — or the games plural in Roblox’s case.

Roblox is an incredibly free-form environment almost on par with Second Life where players author their own games and chase status and dreams of real-world success — and where brands create advergames as a way to reach the elusive tween demographic. Fortnite meanwhile has staged colossal in-game cultural events like the 2020 Travis Scott concert that drew over 27 million participants. To many observers including Ball these events represent the closest we’ve come to a true metaverse experience.

Should I resign myself to living in the metaverse?

Not just yet. Despite the maturity of the idea and the current obsession with it in boardrooms the technology still needs a lot of work — especially if it really is to become “the next internet” envisioned by Ball and Zuckerberg. And despite the pandemic that has confined so many of us to our houses a strong consumer desire for a metaverse experience that isn’t just a video game has yet to be proven.

The biggest obstacle to Ball and Zuckerberg’s metaverse becoming a reality is interoperability. You might want to call it standardization; it’s the idea that you will be able to take your avatar and digital possessions with you from one app or game or virtual world to the next. (Ball imagines bringing a unique Counter-Strike gun skin with you into Fortnite for example.) For the metaverse to become the next stage of evolution of the internet interoperability is vital but the hurdles are so huge as to seem insurmountable. There are technical challenges: how to bring an asset from one graphics engine to another and render it faithfully across a bewildering range of hardware configurations for one. There are legal and commercial challenges too: circumventing intellectual property rights and persuading countless businesses to agree not to wall off their gardens. It’s a lot lot harder than agreeing on a standard for hypertext links for example.

Beyond that people have to be persuaded that this is something they want. The technology through which we access these worlds needs to be at least as comfortable and convenient to use as a smartphone and as portable or it will seem like a backward step from the mobile internet it’s supposed to be replacing. And while the science-fiction appeal of such a virtual world might seem obvious on the surface you have to question how deep the desire to spend time there really goes. In fiction from Snow Crash to The Matrix and Ready Player One metaverses are usually envisioned as an escape — willing or not — from dystopian realities that are too awful to bear. I dare hope that we’re not quite there yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2RhdGFkZWNpc2lvbm1ha2Vycy93aHktdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLWNhbi1vbmx5LWJlLWRlY2VudHJhbGl6ZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the future of the metaverse can only be decentralized,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers/why-the-future-of-the-metaverse-can-only-be-decentralized/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2RhdGFkZWNpc2lvbm1ha2Vycy93aHktdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLWNhbi1vbmx5LWJlLWRlY2VudHJhbGl6ZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lucHV0L3RlY2gvdGhlLWxhd25tb3dlci1tYW4tbWV0YS1tb3N0LWltcG9ydGFudC12ci1tb21lbnRzLXRpbWVsaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From 'The Lawnmower Man' to Meta: VR's most important moments,"The Lawnmower Man unlike the Stephen King short story it’s based on is not about a homicidal satyr.

The film adaptation that turns 30 this month is instead a warning and absurd expansion on what at the time was still a fairly nascent technology virtual reality. The titular “Lawnmower Man” is experimented on by being thrust into VR simulations that over time boost his intelligence give him psychic powers and ultimately make him a violent megalomaniac.

It’s classic '90s genre fluff. Goofy — gun-toting VR apes are involved — and more than a little offensive viewed in 2022 The Lawnmower Man (check out Inverse’s oral history of the movie) is extra bizarre because of the prominent position VR and its accompanying technologies have assumed in the 2020s.

The world’s biggest social media company Facebook rebranded to Meta to focus on VR AR and build “the metaverse.” Every major company is rumored to be working on or to have worked on some kind of mixed reality or XR (the blanket term for VR and AR) product. All for the technology that trained monkeys for war in that one movie from the '90s.

The point is VR has come a long way and it seems like it has even further to go. So here’s an incomplete timeline of its biggest milestones from The Lawnmower Man till now.

***

The Lawnmower Man premieres (March 6 1992)

This film is not the first time Stephen King’s work has been butchered in the transition to the screen but it is one of the notable few times he’s asked to have his name removed twice from a film (once for its theatrical release and once for its home video).

The Lawnmower Man is a bit of a mess loud and violent but also “the noise and the lights induce a torpor that is quite soothing” according to The New York Times. The film’s basic idea that VR could easily become the obsession of a small group of scientists and futurists with too many resources has only proven to be more and more true though.

Snow Crash is published (June 1992)

The novel that cursed us with the term “metaverse” is also the one that’s seemed to have the biggest influence on Zuckerberg and other current tech CEOs. Snow Crash imagines a dystopian future that’s come to rely on a corporate-controlled (everything is corporate-controlled) virtual reality internet called “The Metaverse” for work recreation and plenty of other things in between. The very thing Meta would like to make.

The metaverse of author Neal Stephenson’s novel is deeply stratified in terms of class and not exactly a liberatory vision of the internet or any evolution of it. Naturally it’s the vision Silicon Valley types have latched on to today. The book is ultimately less about VR than it is about language but Stephenson coined the word that haunts us to this day.

Nintendo releases the Virtual Boy (August 14 1995)

An example of Nintendo’s experimental approach to console design the Virtual Boy is one of the earliest consumer products that approach the VR headsets we have today. It’s far from the quality anyone wanted as a device with simplistic red and black graphics in stereoscopic 3D but Nintendo’s headset was out there making people think about wearing displays to play a game at home. Something they might be doing now with an entirely different headset.

Second Life launches (June 23rd 2003)

The Washington Post/Getty Images

Second Life is an MMO created by Linden Lab a start-up that entered the scene in 1999 to explore VR. The game is a collection of player-made worlds a whole little digital universe with all the real estate and brands that entails. Life happened in Second Life. People got married in Second Life. Plenty of people thought the game would be a big deal and in some ways it was.

Since its heyday in the early 2000s Second Life hasn’t been taken as seriously as when it was first released. But when Meta or any other company waxes rhapsodically about the metaverse the easy proof that their ideas aren’t so revolutionary is a game from 2003.

Palmer Luckey creates the Oculus Rift (2009-2010)

Allen J. Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images

Palmer Luckey VR enthusiast and future Oculus founder worked on an early Oculus Rift prototype after saving money for parts. According to a profile from Eurogamer that early model had a 90-degree field of view low latency and haptic feedback.

Luckey connected to Doom developer John Carmack on the Meant To Be Seen forum over his VR tinkering an important relationship that would continue into the formation of Oculus and beyond.

Ready Player One is published (August 16 2011)

Ernest Cline’s New York Times Bestselling Novel is a riff on some of the elements of Snow Crash. There’s another future dystopia that’s also become dependent on VR this time to escape global warming and widespread economic downturn in the real world. The plot is a mixture between Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and a pop-culture scavenger hunt only really engaging with the social ills of its VR scenario on the surface level.

Ready Player One might not have the same cultural impact on people’s understanding of VR as Snow Crash but it has helped to crystallize a relationship between VR and the real world that’s easy to read into Big Tech’s pursuit of VR today. That VR is being pushed as an escape from the dire state of the present-day world. VR as the ultimate tool of escapism.

Oculus Rift prototype demoed to press (May-June 2012)

John Carmack borrowed Luckey’s prototype and began showing it off to the press in early 2012 who accepted it enthusiastically. At E3 2012 Carmack announced Doom 3 BFG Edition will support head-mounted display (HMDs) for VR.

That early prototype was held together with electrical tape but despite its appearance it’s widely credited with reigniting an interest in VR development. It also served to generate a ton of buzz for Luckey’s Kickstarter project something he’d been mulling about publicly in the lead up to Carmack’s demos.

The first Oculus Rift developer kit proved to be tremendously successful raising over $2.4 million on Kickstarter. VR modes in games and VR support also started popping up across the PC gaming space as developer kits made it into backers' hands.

Facebook buys Oculus VR (March 25 2014)

Oculus VR was formed as a proper company in 2012 with Luckey Brendan Iribe and Nate Mitchell serving as its founding members. John Carmack left Id Software to become Oculus’ chief technology officer not long after.

In 2014 the company was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion. The social media giant planned to extend Oculus’ reach outside of gaming as the company prepared for “the platforms of tomorrow.” Oculus maintained some amount of independence partnering with Samsung for the Gear VR the company’s first version of smartphone-based VR.

“Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever and change the way we work play and communicate” Mark Zuckerberg said in Facebook’s press release announcing the acquisition.

Oculus VR would eventually be brought fully into the fold first as Facebook Reality Labs and later just Reality Labs after Facebook’s rebranding.

Google shows off Google Cardboard (June 25 2014)

San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images/Hearst Newspapers/Getty Images

The original Google Cardboard headset was a gift bag freebie for anyone that attended Google I/O 2014. The rudimentary cardboard headset starts flat and can be folded to hold a variety of different phones for simple VR-like experiences. It even included a lever on the side that simulated touching a phone screen for interactions within supported apps.

Cardboard was the precursor to Google Daydream and probably still the cheapest possible way to watch 360 videos. Google sold Cardboard on its site until March 2021 before it was discontinued. The device was most commonly used in Google’s Expeditions program for schools. For many people Cardboard was an intro to VR.

HTC and Valve introduce the Vive (March 1 2015)

picture alliance/picture alliance/Getty Images

Facebook and Oculus weren’t the only companies exploring virtual reality. In 2015 HTC a formerly popular Android phone manufacturer introduced the Vive a VR headset designed in partnership with Valve.

The original Vive used two 1080p displays one for each eye had a 90Hz refresh rate and used base stations to track movement for room-scale VR. HTC and Valve’s headset would help set the standard for PC VR going forward. It also had a wild bug-eye design.

HTC continued to release VR headsets in the years that followed and Valve eventually released its own VR hardware in 2019 called the Valve Index.

Final Oculus Rift released to the public (January 6 2016)

Oculus finally launched a consumer-focused version of the Oculus Rift for pre-order in 2016. The headset was an expensive proposition at $599 because of the pricey high-end PCs it required to work properly.

Sony finally launches PS VR (October 13 2016)

picture alliance/picture alliance/Getty Images

“Project Morpheus” was introduced as an in-development VR headset for the PlayStation 4 in 2014 and the company finally launched the console VR system in October 2016 as Playstation VR or PS VR.

The PS VR featured an ergonomic futuristic design and was partially hampered by a convoluted system of cables and a passthrough box on older PlayStation 4 models. The VR system also relied on a mixture of Sony’s Playstation Move peripherals keeping it from having the quality of control the Vive or Oculus Rift had.

Getting VR on a console people actually owned was a big deal and Sony is finally following it up with the PS VR 2 which it revealed the design of in February 2022.

Apple and Google work on VR and AR projects (2016-Present)

Google tried its hand at phone-based VR with Google Daydream a now-defunct platform that used Android phones to power simple VR apps and games. The company is now reportedly working on an augmented reality device called Project Iris.

Apple is rumored to be working on its own higher-end VR headset in advance of AR hardware sometime in the mid-2020s. Whether Apple’s rumored headset is primarily meant for developers or even ends up launching remains to be seen.

Launch of the Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift S (April 30 2019)

Outside of the original Oculus Rift the Oculus Quest is probably Facebook and Oculus’ most important product. The standalone VR headset proved that VR apps and games could be compelling even without the processing power of a gaming PC. And that VR experiences could be entirely portable without the trade-offs that phone VR came with.

It also helped cement the Touch controllers as the VR controller design to beat. You’ll see the little loops with handles everywhere including the Oculus Rift S the follow-up to the VR headset that started it all.

Oculus Quest 2 launches (September 16th 2020)

Sergio Flores/AFP/Getty Images

The Oculus Quest 2 was introduced in late 2020 as the perfected version of the Oculus Quest with higher resolution displays a more comfortable fit support for hand tracking and a more approachable price. The Quest 2 became Facebook’s vehicle for pushing VR and thanks to the Link Cable the company’s preferred way for users to do PC VR experiences once the Rift S was discontinued.

Using the headset for all the applications that Facebook imagines is a bit ambitious (and uncomfortable) but the Quest 2 hit a real sweet spot in making VR completely approachable for the average person.

The biggest sign that VR is here to stay (at least for the time being) is probably Facebook’s decision to rebrand to Meta and focus on building the “embodied internet.” There’s lots of reason to be skeptical of Facebook’s decision and skeptical of Facebook in general but by tripling down on the metaverse it started a whole wave of BS.

Metaverse becomes the ultimate buzzword (Now)

After the “enterprise metaverse” the only place we can go is up. Everyone has a metaverse pitch they’re all terrible. The metaverse has become a meaningless term to signal that your company is doing something futuristic. Meta bought a horrifying (and sad) Super Bowl ad for the Quest 2.

After losing a quarter of its value post-VR pivot Meta is apparently eyeing a return to video products. The circle of life continues.

VR Week 2022 is an in-depth look at the decades-long future of VR successes failures and innovations to come.

SARASOTA FL — Rumble a YouTube alternative that recently opened a headquarters in Longboat Key will continue to broadcast RT on its video platform despite a worldwide crackdown on the Russian state-controlled news network.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a week ago major technology companies have removed or restricted the network including the Roku Channel Store and DirecTV which both removed the English-language RT America from its offerings according to CNBC. Meta Platforms which operates Facebook and Twitter have also restricted access to the network Reuters reported. Facebook and Instagram have designated RT as “Russian state-controlled media.”

The European Union also banned RT and Sputnik another Russian-owned media outlet for spreading disinformation about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine according to Reuters. On its Facebook page RT said that it broadcasts in more than 100 countries and had more than 10 billion video views across all of its platforms in 2021.

The online vide-sharing platform based in Toronto and popular among conservative influencers and right-wing viewers the Washington Post reported. In 2021 Rumble had an average of 36 million users monthly up from 1.6 million users each month in 2020 according to Small Business Trends. In January the platform saw 39 million users.

Former President Donald Trump turned to Rumble after being banned from multiple social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also uses the site to shares state news with residents. Other prominent figures on the site include U.S. representatives Matt Gaetz and Devin Nunes Sen. Rand Paul former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Sean Hannity and Ben Shapiro. Rumble estimates that it will invest about $50 million in the Sarasota area and Florida over the next several years. Sarasota County lured the company to the area with an incentive grant worth about $825000 according to SRQ magazine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL01lZGlhLUVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvQmFuZGFpLU5hbWNvLXRvLXNwZW5kLTEzMG0tY3JlYXRpbmctR3VuZGFtLW1ldGF2ZXJzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bandai Namco to spend $130m creating Gundam 'metaverse',"TOKYO -- Japanese video game and toy company Bandai Namco Holdings is spending 15 billion yen ($130 million) to develop a ""metaverse"" featuring fearsome battle robots and other characters from its flagship Gundam franchise.

Last updated on: March 5 2022 04:47h.

As we near the four-year anniversary of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) repeal there aren’t many sports betting firsts left to be claimed. But one of those happened on Friday when NHL All-Star Connor McDavid signed an endorsement deal with BetMGM.

With the Edmonton Oilers captain now a brand ambassador for the mobile sports betting and iGaming operator McDavid becomes the first active player from one of the “big four” North American major professional sports leagues to promote a US sportsbook.

I am very excited to partner with BetMGM as they continue to shape the future of sports betting” McDavid said in a statement. “It’s also a real honor to be on the same BetMGM team with star athletes like Wayne Gretzky and Kevin Garnett both of whom I admire very much.”

While he toils in Edmonton the northernmost North American city with a major league franchise McDavid is very much a star in the NHL as one of the most dynamic offensive talents in the league. A two-time winner of the Hart Trophy which is bestowed upon the NHL’s most valuable player McDavid won it last year after racking up an impressive and league-leading 105 points in a COVID-shortened 56-game season. This year he’s on pace to lead the NHL in points for the fourth time as he has 79 through 54 games with Edmonton.

Nothing Gray About McDavid’s Deal

Technically McDavid is not the first active player from an NHL NBA NFL or MLB team to sign with a sports betting operator.

Last month Toronto Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews inked a deal with Bet99 a company currently operating as a gray market sportsbook in Canada. According to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman Matthews’ deal covers just the operator’s free-to-play game.

Canada legalized single-game sports betting last year. Now Ontario is in the process of allowing regulated sportsbooks to operate in the province effective next month. However it’s uncertain whether Bet99 will be one of the sportsbooks approved to operate.

The NHLPA the players’ union told players last October that it reached a deal with the league to allow players to sign with sports betting operators Friedman noted in his article last month. It’s allowed provided it’s done in jurisdictions where single-game betting is legal.

Endorsing players cannot be shown betting nor can they endorse betting on NHL games. The arrangements also cannot tie the sportsbook to the club unless there’s already a relationship between the two.

Why the Deal Makes Sense

There will be a few raised eyebrows with the announcement. However sports betting is now a legal and well-regulated product. So having active players as endorsers should be considered on the same level as teams having official sports betting partnerships.

It makes sense that the first active player to endorse a sportsbook is a hockey player. The NHL was the first league to embrace Las Vegas awarding the city an expansion franchise for the 2017-18 season. The league also held its All-Star Game on the Strip last month.

It also makes sense that BetMGM is the promoted sportsbook. T-Mobile Arena home to the Las Vegas Golden Knights is owned in part by MGM Resorts International. MGM Resorts operates BetMGM through a joint venture with Entain.

Finally it also makes sense given the pending launch in Ontario Canada’s largest province. That launch will take place as hockey’s regular season winds down. Ice hockey Canada’s national winter sport should be a major market in Ontario and other Canadian provinces. That’s especially true once the Stanley Cup Playoffs launch.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bhd. (UHSB) AxiCom Sdn. Bhd. (AxiCom) and Microsoft are partnering together to extend broadband connectivity to the rural communities in the country. AxiCom is the first Malaysian company that has completed the TVWS trial with Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) and entrenched as the first TVWS solution provider in Malaysia.

In a pilot project the first TV White Space (TVWS) technology has been installed in the small town of Parit Sulong Johor bringing new hope and opportunities as local businesses and communities in the area can now enjoy enhanced internet services. Prior to this the remote area had poor 4G and LTE coverage and high-speed broadband access were limited. The initiative is part of the joint commitment to realise an inclusive responsible and sustainable digital economy as envisioned by the Government through MyDIGITAL.

“We want to ensure that every Malaysian including the B40 and rural communities are part of the nation’s digital-first socio-economic development. The Government has outlined bold goals to ensure every household is connected to the internet through MyDIGITAL and the Jalinan Digital Negara (JENDELA) Plan. Today’s initiative is an important milestone in that direction. Through initiatives such as these we are determined to transform the level of connectivity and reduce the current digital gap to realise Malaysia’s MyDIGITAL aspirations” said Datuk Seri Dr. Noraini Ahmad Minister of MOHE.

According to the MyDIGITAL blueprint household access to broadband services in rural areas are lower than in urban areas. In 2019 80.4% of rural households had access to mobile broadband compared to 88.8% of urban households. Meanwhile about 11.7% of rural households had access to fixed broadband while 35.3% of urban enjoyed the same. Cognisant of the need to address the opportunity divide the Government in partnership with the private sectors including UHSB AxiCom and Microsoft are committed to increasing the rollout of broadband infrastructure projects to drive digital transformation and inclusion.

The initiative in Parit Sulong Johor leverages TVWS technology which is the first in Malaysia. TVWS are unused broadcasting frequencies (UHF bands from 400 MHz to 700MHz) between television channels that can act as a fixed wireless service with very large coverage. TVWS signal can penetrate through more walls and obstacles enabling whole-home media distribution unlike a Wi-Fi signal can penetrate up to 2 walls. Hence TVWS is more suited as a complementary network for rural and unserved areas where laying fiber is not a feasible solution as vast distances make that process prohibitively expensive. TVWS is cheaper and faster to deploy compared to traditional fiber and it can travel long distances and transmit through forested terrain.

“UiTM Holdings through its wholly owned subsidiary MYREN Network Sdn. Bhd. (MNSB) was granted the Network Facilities Provider (NFP) and Network Service Provider (NSP) licenses by MCMC where we can build fibre optic infrastructures nationwide including fixed links cables towers and poles thus enabling the supply of very high bandwith internet connection. With today’s launch we are going full speed ahead with our infrastructure projects to connect previously unconnected communities to enable inclusive education and improve the competitiveness of Malaysia and Malaysians” said Dato’ Sri Shahril Mokhtar Chairman of UiTM Holdings Sdn. Bhd.

“We are excited to be playing a crucial role in this partnership with a focus to bring high-quality solutions by combining experience innovation and state-of-the-art multimedia and technology for users in rural Malaysia. We believe TVWS will be the game changer to benefit rural communities where broadband access is a challenge and ensure they can be seamlessly integrated into the digital economy. With digital transformation being an important catalyst for Malaysia’s inclusive economic recovery MyDIGITAL will enable Malaysia to take advantage of the breadth of opportunity that technology offers” said Syamsul Azly Akbar Chief Executive Officer from AxiCom.

“Access to the internet is fundamental for a digital-first economy like Malaysia. Microsoft is working with partners like MoHE UiTM Holdings and AxiCom in Malaysia to bring internet access to local businesses and the community in Parit Sulong Johor. This reflects Microsoft’s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more” said K Raman Managing Director of Microsoft Malaysia.

The TV White Space trial with MCMC is part of Microsoft’s Airband Initiative which works with partners to advance digital equity – access to affordable internet affordable devices and digital skills – as a platform for empowerment and digital transformation across the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53ZmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvb3Bpbmlvbi8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L3doeS1taWNyb3NvZnQtaGFzLXJlbW92ZWQtc29saXRhaXJlLXdpbmRvd3MtYW5kLWhvdy1wbGF5LzkzNjU5NjEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Microsoft has removed Solitaire from Windows and how to play it,"Jeff Werner Special to the Daily News

Q: I'm a Solitaire junkie and have a wonderful game on my Windows 7 laptop. However this 11-year-old laptop is about to die and I wondered if I could transfer the game to my Windows 10 laptop?

I'd love to be able to put this game on my MacBook Air but I don't think that's going to happen.

A: Your question had a ring of familiarity to it Gordon. So I searched the column archives over at ItsGeekToMe.co (not .com) and sure enough way back when the column was relatively young reader Keith S. asked a very similar question about moving Solitaire (I.G.T.M. No. 82 Feb 15 2009).

In that case and just to illustrate how much time has passed since then Keith wanted to move it from a Windows XP machine to his “new Dell with Vista.” Ah those were the days! (*SHUDDER*)

People really love their Solitaire. But have you ever stopped to think about why it was ever a part of Windows in the first place?

Windows is a computer operating system and graphical user interface not a gaming platform. The answer is really quite interesting and steeped in the skills or rather lack of skills of people who were early adopters of home computers.

Nowadays skills like basic mouse usage such as clicking on things on the screen and performing drag and drop operations is second nature to us. But back when Windows was in its infancy these were relatively new concepts to people and Microsoft developed the computerized version of the venerable old card game to give users a means to practice using the mouse.

Changing technology:Keeping up with today's TV technology is not easy | It's Geek to Me

Tech help:Gmail's format doesn't translate well to all cellphones | It's Geek to Me

It was a good choice as the game incorporates all the basic mouse functions and causes the player to use them over and over again. The whole thing is presented in a way that’s not boring so it’s a rather ingenious method of teaching mouse skills. It also allows Solitaire junkies to claim that they are just honing their computer skills when their spouse yells at them for spending too much time playing on the computer.

Solitaire first appeared with Windows as part of version 3.0 released on May 22 1990. It was included with every version of Windows sold between 1990 and 2012 which means that it shipped with over 1 billion copies of Windows.

That makes it one of the most widely distributed and most played computer game titles in the entire world! Is it any wonder people don’t want to lose touch with this old friend when they upgrade their operating system?

Now that you know more about the history of computer Solitaire than you probably ever wanted to let’s get on to answering your question. While it is technically possible to move the Solitaire program files from one platform to another in the modern computing era in which we live I don’t really see the point.

The reason Solitaire is no longer distributed with Windows is because it is now freely available in the Microsoft Store which is Microsoft’s answer to Apple’s genius invention of the App Store. As part of the research for this column I took a peek into the Microsoft Store and found no fewer than 60 versions of Solitaire available for free. These are sure to offer a far richer gaming experience with better graphics and more playing options than the old classic that originally came with Windows.

Your MacBook Air isn’t left out in the cold either. The Apple App Store carries multiple free versions of Solitaire for that platform.

Microsoft's statement released Friday said the company is working closely with the U.S. the European Union and the United Kingdom to coordinate with government sanctions against Russia.

The decision comes after several companies stopped sales and doing business in Russia including Apple Nike Toyota Honda and Volkswagen. Microsoft also said they've helped protect Ukraine's cybersecurity against Russia's attacks. The company has acted against Russian measures targeting more than 20 Ukrainian government IT and financial sector organizations Microsoft president Brad Smith said in the statement.

""We have also acted against cyberattacks targeting several additional civilian sites. We have publicly raised our concerns that these attacks against civilians violate the Geneva Convention"" he said.

The Microsoft Philanthropies and UN Affairs teams are also working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to aid refugees by providing technology and financial support and ""are defending these groups from ongoing cyberattacks"" Smith said.

The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights is reporting that 32 children were killed and 70 injured since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. As of this morning evacuations of civilians in the strategic port of Mariupol in the southeast have stopped amid reports of continued shelling by Russian troops that violated a cease-fire.

""Like so many others we stand with Ukraine in calling for the restoration of peace respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and the protection of its people"" Smith said.

More tech companies will likely follow suit in banning sales to Russia said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors Friday. And most companies wouldn't take a major hit he said.

""If the US tech world pulled the plug on Russia it would have a 1%-2% revenue impact in a worst case scenario"" Ives said. ""This is a move the Street would gladly applaud given the heartbreaking Ukraine invasion by Russia that is playing out in front of the world's eyes.""

But unlike the PC version of the title you can’t use a keyboard and mouse to control your plane. However that’s about to change according to Flight Simulator head Jorg Neumann.

In a developer Q&A spotted by Windows Central  Neumann said Microsoft is working on adding platform-level support for the feature suggesting most games on Xbox Cloud Gaming could eventually include the input method. “So the platform team is working on this. I know I can't give a date because it's the platform team. I don't know their dates but it's coming"" he said. “I’m hoping it will be done by June or so but I can’t ever tell.”

Responding to The Verge a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the company was working on the feature but declined to provide a release date. “At launch Microsoft Flight Simulator supports standard controller inputs for cloud gaming” they said. “The team is experimenting with touch/gyro and is excited to embrace M&K once it’s available on the platform but we have no specific announcements or timing to share at this time.”

Keyboard and mouse support would be a useful addition to Xbox Cloud Gaming for a couple of reasons. For one it would allow PC and Mac owners to play games like Halo Infinite without buying a gamepad. Instead they could use the peripherals they already have on hand. Secondly it would make it easier for Microsoft to bring PC exclusives like Age of Empires IV to the service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtY29uc29sZS1oYXMtc3RvcHBlZC13b3JraW5nLWVycm9yLWZpeC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Ways to Fix the “Microsoft Management Console Has Stopped Working” Error,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtY29uc29sZS1oYXMtc3RvcHBlZC13b3JraW5nLWVycm9yLWZpeC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

See which ones made the cut.,"(Sean P. Means | The Salt Lake Tribune) Packs of hard seltzer and other alcoholic products in a refrigerated case at the Smith's Food & Drug in Rose Park on March 4 2022. A bill passed by the Utah Legislature on March 3 2022 will make some brands of hard seltzer available only in state liquor stores.

About half of the hard seltzers available in Utah will soon be removed from supermarket and convenience store shelves and available only in state liquor stores because of a change in state law that passed the Utah Legislature this week.

As part of the Legislature’s omnibus alcohol bill which cleared its final legislative hurdle Thursday and is headed to Gov. Spencer Cox’s desk the state will prohibit the sale of beverages that contain even a trace amount of ethyl alcohol a commonly used stabilizer for artificial flavorings that is used in such products as soda mustard and teriyaki sauce.

Of the 80 hard seltzers and kombuchas approved for sale in Utah grocery and convenience stores according to Michelle Schmitt spokesperson for the state’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control 39 of them have ethyl alcohol in their flavorings. Those varieties most likely will be moved to state liquor stores she said.

If Cox signs the bill which is likely the new law would take effect July 1. Stores would be given six months to comply. Products that use glycol-based flavorings could still be sold in grocery and convenience stores.

The omnibus bill also among other actions would change the DABC’s name to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Services and would end the practice of allowing holders of liquor licenses to sell them to the highest bidder.

The growing popularity of hard seltzers in Utah over the last two or three years has been “remarkable” said Shanna Clay director of operations for M&M Distributing a wholesaler of beer and similar products. The change in the law she added “causes quite a few complications not just locally but nationally and will impact the supply chain structure everywhere.”

“The suppliers are having to go back to their flavoring houses to see what can be reformulated with ethyl alcohol or to try to get it switched over to propylene glycol” Clay said. “That then touches packaging food nutrition labels and ingredients. It creates hiccups across the whole system and everyone’s going to encounter that with this short window of trying to get products compliant.”

The change will be confusing Clay said “because to the consumer of hard seltzer 5 percent [alcohol volume] is 5 percent.”

Also some brands use both types of additives depending on the flavor. For example according to DABC four flavors of Bon & Viv Hard Seltzer would be available in grocery stores because their flavorings are glycol-based — while four other varieties of the same brand because their flavors contain ethyl alcohol would not be sold in grocery stores.

Also some brands package their seltzers in variety packs and if even one flavor is made with ethyl alcohol the whole pack would be allowed only in liquor stores.

Clay noted that her company distributes hard seltzers to 1300 stores in six Utah counties: Davis Salt Lake Summit Tooele Utah and Wasatch. Those seltzers with ethyl alcohol flavorings will now be sold only in 45 state liquor stores. For M&M and the other distributors in the state Clay said the loss of sales will inevitably lead to a loss in jobs.

The Utah Legislature banished “flavored malt beverages” — so-called “alcopops” such as Mike’s Hard Lemonade — to state liquor stores in 2008. The beverages were allowed back into grocery and convenience stores in 2016 when the DABC ruled that their formulation had been altered enough to qualify as “beer” under Utah law.

Schmitt said DABC is working with beverage makers confirming what ingredients are being used in each product to determine which ones will be moved to state liquor stores and which ones can be sold in grocery and convenience stores. There are applications pending for other seltzer products and those also will be reviewed she said.

Here as of Friday are the specific brands and flavors of hard seltzers and kombuchas that can be sold only at liquor stores or can be sold in grocery and convenience stores.

It's been a tumultuous week off the field for Everton with the club suspending all their sponsorship agreements with Russian companies and also calling time on their shirt sponsorship with Cazoo.

On Wednesday Everton confirmed they were suspending their sponsorship agreements with Russian companies USM Megafon and Yota with immediate effect.

The Blues had been under increasing pressure to react after Russia's military invasion of Ukraine.

Then on Friday it was revealed Everton's shirt sponsorship with Cazoo will come to an end following the culmination of the current season.

The number of official 'partners' - as the club refer to them as - now stands at 15.

Here we take a look at the current commercial deals Everton have in place.

Cazoo

Everton signed a three-year-deal with the online car retailer in June 2020 to replace SportPesa as the club's front-of-shirt sponsor.

It is understood Everton activated a break clause in the contract with Cazoo which was initially valued to be around £9.6m a year and that developments were not affected by a decision over Russian companies earlier in the week.

The ECHO also understands discussions between Everton and Cazoo took place before the turn of the year over a decision to potentially extend their deal or not.

Both sides had the opportunity to refuse but it was the Blues who took up that option.

Cazoo later revealed they had failed to agree suitable terms to extend their agreement with Everton but will continue their deal with Aston Villa.

hummel

The Blues' new kit supplier - or 'technical partner' as the club call them - also signed a three-year-deal in May 2020 replacing Umbro.

hummel are also supplying all training and leisure wear over the length of the deal too.

The ECHO understands the agreement is worth between £8-10m a year to the club.

Fanatics

Everton signed a 10-year-deal with Kitbag who were later bought out by Fanatics in 2009 worth a total of £32m.

And in February 2019 the club entered into a new ""multi-year"" agreement with the US-based Fanatics to continue as the club's official retail partner.

Everton refused to disclose the value of the new arrangement but it is understood to be worth more than the £3m-a-year they got as part of the original deal.

The Blues also said at the time that it was the biggest deal in its field outside of the Premier League's top six.

Socios

Everton launched a partnership with fan token firm Socios at the start of the current season.

The partnership with the firm Chiliz a blockchain provider created an $EFC Fan Token for supporters to purchase from the Socios.com app the aim to provide 'new experiences for Everton supporters across the world' allowing for token holders to have a say on club initiatives through online polls in a bid to engender a stronger connection with the club's global fan base.

Socios is the world's biggest fan token firm having already partnered with other Premier League teams like Manchester City Arsenal Aston Villa and Leeds United plus European football giants like Paris Saint-Germain Internazionale Juventus and AC Milan.

It has also entered into partnerships with sporting leagues internationally including teams the NBA and the UFC organisation and has been leading the wave of firms entering into the sporting marketplace over the past couple of years.

Parimatch

A two-year-deal saw Parimatch become the club's official betting partner in Europe and the CIS region.

The value of the deal with Cyprus-based Parimatch was not revealed. They are the training wear sponsor for Leicester City.

The ending of the SportPesa deal in 2020 allowed Everton to explore the possibility of regional betting partnerships such as this one.

Davanti Tyres

One of the club's more long-running commercial deals Davanti struck a new three-year agreement in 2020.

The details of the new deal were not disclosed but it was described as ""renewed and expanded"" from the one signed in 2017 with the UK-based firm.

Fratelli Beretta

The Italian food company became Everton's official partner in Italy in late 2018 before expanding their ties with the club further.

Fratelli Beretta became the club's first official Academy sponsor and has signed fresh terms to carry on in that role.

Sokin

Everton signed up fintech innovators Sokin as its official global payments partner in May last year.

A multi-year agreement Sokin provides a payments platform allowing people and businesses to seamlessly move money in 38 currencies and 200 countries and territories.

The Turmeric Co.

Everton announced a partnership last November with health brand The Turmeric Co. which was founded by Welsh international footballer Hal Robson-Kanu.

The brand specialises in nutrition-packed turmeric shots to enhance performance and aid recovery and now supplies the Everton men’s and women’s first teams including regular users Mason Holgate Tom Davies and Izzy Christiansen.

Carling

In 2017 Everton agreed a deal with beverage company Molson Coors for Carling to replace Chang as the beer of choice in the concourses at Goodison.

The agreement was simply referred to as being ""multi-year"" as is still listed on the club's website as being a sponsor.

Lucozade

While Lucozade are listed among the club's official partners they are more a supplier of the club's sports drinks.

Rushbet

In December 2020 Everton announced a ""multi-year"" agreement with Rushbet.co to become the club's official betting partner in Colombia.

The Blues' growth strategy in that region has accelerated in recent times with the arrival of a number of high profile players and although the deal was struck after the signing of James Rodriguez who has since moved on to Al-Rayyan in Qatar they retain Yerry Mina.

Football Manager

Everton announced Football Manager as a new official partner for the women’s team last September.

Football Manager branding now appears on interview backdrops and across content output from the club’s official social media accounts for the women’s team and as part of the agreement the renowned gaming brand also features in pitchside advertising at Everton Women’s Walton Hall Park stadium and at all fixtures they play at Goodison Park.

Fridays

Fridays joined forces with Everton Women in July 2021 becoming the team's Official Restaurant Partner for the 2021/22 season.

The collaboration sees the two work collectively to raise awareness of women in sport and as part of the agreement Fridays’ branding appears on pitchside advertising at Everton’s Walton Hall Park stadium with the restaurant also gets access to matchday experiences player appearances and official merchandise for giveaways.

Clarity Sports

In January 2021 Everton signed a ""multi-year"" agreement with Clarity Sports to become the new official team and business travel partner - and the club's match break partner.

Clarity Sports will replace a similar deal the Blues had in place with Thomas Cook.

Premier League rivals such as Manchester City Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are said to also use Clarity.",,,,,,,,,

Many large food manufacturers including PepsiCo and Coca-Cola and fast-food chains like McDonald’s and Yum Brands are facing growing pressure on social media platforms and from large investors to halt operations in Russia.

Companies “need to consider whether doing business in Russia is worth the risk during this extraordinarily volatile time” the chief of one big investor New York state’s pension fund said on Thursday.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson

McDonald's and PepsiCo along with many others are being urged to end their business in Russia.

New York state's comptroller wrote to several companies calling for action per Reuters.

British politician John Mann has made similar requests.

McDonald's and PepsiCo are among the food and drink companies facing calls from political figures to cut business ties with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

In a letter Friday Thomas DiNapoli New York state comptroller urged companies to rethink their Russian business operations because they face ""significant and growing legal compliance operational human rights and personnel and reputational risks"" Reuters reported.

He added that suspending or ending business in Russia ""would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market"" and play a key role in ""condemning Russia's role in fundamentally undermining the international order.""

McDonald's and PepsiCo did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

Other companies including Estee Lauder Kimberly-Clark Corp Coty Inc Mondelez International Inc Fortinet Inc Bunge Ltd Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and Trimble Inc were also asked in the letter to boycott business in Russia per Reuters.

Since Russian President Vladamir Putin invaded Ukraine in an unprovoked attack scores of companies have taken action by ending or limiting their commercial dealings with Russia.

Ikea Spotify and Nike were among the major companies that recently severed business ties with Russia. Some retail brands including Publix and Kroger also showed their solidarity with Ukraine by removing Russian vodka from store shelves.

British politician John Mann called for similar action to DiNapoli. In a tweet he said: ""If Mcdonalds and Starbucks continue to sell in Russia then an international boycott of their products should be instigated.""

Social media users have also called for company boycotts with McDonald's facing particular scrutiny.

One user who posted a photo of open McDonald's stores in Russia said: ""Guess who is doing business as normal in #Russia no surprise #BoycottMcDonalds.""

Another said: ""@McDonalds Leave #Russia or lose loyal customers the choice is yours. #BoycottMcDonalds.""

Pausing or ending operations in Russia ""would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market and play an important role in condemning Russia's role in fundamentally undermining the international order that is vital to a strong and healthy global economy"" the letter said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vemFib3JvbmEuY29tL2VuL2NvbGFzLWJsYWNrLWxpc3Qtd2hhdC1nbG9iYWwtYnJhbmRzLWNvbnNjaW91c2x5LWtlcHQtdGhlaXItdGllcy10by1ydXNzaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global brands that consciously stay in Russia,"Russia launched a military attack against Ukraine on February 24 2022.

Despite Russian officials denying civilian bombing the occupiers have continued to commit cruel crimes against humanity since the start of hostilities.

Global brands begun to leave the Russian market en masse but not all of them.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on the morning of February 24 2022. The aggressor did not directly declare the war but instead cowardly called it a military operation. The Russian occupiers insidiously did not give the time to Ukrainian authorities to evacuate civilians. Instead the enemy brazenly continues to claim that it does not commit crimes against civilians but rather protects them from nationalists. But the world is not to be fooled. All civilized politicians and celebrities are actively expressing their support for Ukraine. World brands began refusing to do business with Russia. However not all of them.

Zaborona has blacklisted companies that that did not leave the Russian market immediately but waited a long time for public reaction. Moreover most of them claimed that they planned to leave Russia but did not specify terms conditions plans etc. Conventionally we called it the Coca-Cola’s Black List because it was the first global brand to express its official position.

The list is constantly updated.

The list of companies that continue to operate in Russia

It is worth noting that there are many reasons why so many international companies have decided to commit a mass exodus from Russia:

sanctions provided for blocking the operational work of banks and accordingly cards;

threat of complete disconnection from SWIFT;

troubles with logistics due to Europe’s closure of airspace for Russian aircraft;

herd instinct;

Ukrainian origin;

a sense of justice;

hate for war and terrorism;

love and support for Ukraine.

The official operating activity of an international company in any country means the payment of all relevant taxes. And this in turn means that the money of companies paid in taxes is distributed by governments for various state sectors including weapons (in the case of Russia — for sure). Therefore those global brands that decided to continue their operations in a country that has invaded another independent state have to realize that people’s blood is on their hands as well.

If you are deliberately financing terrorism you have to bear all the responsibility. So let’s move on to the list.

Coca-Cola — the first company that officially declare that they are not going to stop doing business in Russia.

“All of Coca-Cola’s operational production and logistics facilities in Russia continue to operate. We are fully responsible to our partners society and thousands of our employees in Russia. Our unconditional priority is the safety of our employees” claimed in the company’s press-release to Russians.

On March 8 the 13th day of the war after considering all the reputational risks and consequences that mass boycotts of Coca-Cola products could lead to the company decided to suspend its business in Russia.

“The Coca-Cola Company announced today that it is suspending its business in Russia. Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve” said in the statement.

However it is not specified what measures will be taken to suspend the business. The Coca-Cola Company has as many as 10 facilities for the production of soft drinks in Russia.

On March 30 it became known that the German Ritter Sport will not leave the Russian market: it accounts for 7% of the company’s turnover.

Nestlé — a large Swiss company which has three factories in Ukraine/ After the beginning of Russian invasion they announced that temporarily shutting down Ukrainian facilities due to the danger to workers. Instead they do not want to sever ties with the enemy.

“Our factories and offices in Russia continue to operate. Our goal is to provide consumers with high quality food and beverages in all regions where we are present. We continue to provide a wide range of food products on the market” said the company representatives to Russian media.

On March 9 the company’s spokesperson told Reuters that Nestle was suspending all capital investments in Russia. On March 11 one of the largest food-producing companies announced restrictions on trade with the aggressor but not completely.

It was reported that Nestle has stopped exporting and importing non-essential food items like coffee (eg Nespresso) and water (eg S. Pellegrino). That is all other Nestle products (baby food confectionery breakfast cereals etc.) will continue to appear on the shelves of Russian stores.

On March 17 the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmygal posted on Twitter that he had contacted the CEO of Nestlé about the side effect of its work in Russia. We have to point out that there is no official confirmation or comment from the company in this regard.

On March 23 Nestlé issued a new statement on its work in Russia. The company will remove several more of its brands from the Russian market including KitKat and Nesquik and will provide to Russians only essential food such as infant food and medical/hospital nutrition.

“While we do not expect to make a profit in the country or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future in Russia any profit will be donated to humanitarian relief organizations” said in a press release.

Danone — despite the fact that this international company has publicly condemned the Russian invasion and declared its readiness to provide any assistance to Ukrainians one of the world’s leading food giants is deliberately refusing to leave the aggressor’s market.

“We do not plan to suspend our activities in Russia and leave the market. For now the company’s key systems infrastructure and logistics in Russia operate in a regular mode” Russian propagandists reported.

On March 6 the company announced that it would stop making new investments in Russia but stays in the Russian market.

METRO is one of the world’s largest cash and carry companies which has a huge number of stores in Ukraine. Like other multinational giants from our blacklist this one also refused to sever trade ties with Russia.

“METRO continues to operate in Russia. We do not plan to close our shopping centers. All METRO stores operate in regular mode. We have provided the necessary stock of goods and are setting up supply chains” claimed in the company statement on March 3.

Auchan — another global chain of hypermarkets and supermarkets that does not want to leave Russia. Moreover the Russian department of Auchan did not make any statements or comments on the withdrawal.

In early March Auchan imposed restrictions for Russians on the purchase of socially important products. So the conditional Russian Ivan is unable to buy more than 10 kg of sugar 10 bottles of sunflower oil five packs of flour of 2 kg three packs of salt 10 packs of pasta rice buckwheat and other cereals.

Leroy Merlin is a French network of supermarkets selling building materials and furniture that has at least 107 stores in Russia.

The company has no plans to leave the Russian market and even wants to take advantage of the fact that many competitors have stopped their cooperation with the aggressor. In a letter to partners on March 11 the management of the Russian department of Leroy Merlin stated that the company is ready for new proposals to increase supplies and expand the product range

Mars and Mondelez International — both American food companies expressed virtually the same position two weeks after Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine.

The management of Mondelez International one of the largest food corporations in the world primarily known for the Oreo and Milka brands has decided to reduce its activities in Russia but not to stop production at Russian facilities. The reduction of activity means the cessation of all investments in Russia as well as the curtailment of all advertising activities.

Mars which owns brands such as Snickers Twix M&M’s Milky Way Whiskas has announced similar approach:

cessation of all activities in social networks;

termination of all advertising activities;

curtailment of all investments in the Russian market.

That is the American confectionery giants are not currently considering the option of a full exodus from Russia.

Pirelli — unlike its concurrents an Italian tire manufacturer does not want to leave Russia.

“Pirelli is constantly monitoring the development and consequences of the situation [in Ukraine] with the help of a specially created crisis committee. At the moment we have no plans to stop production at any of our facilities [in Russia]” ANSA reported.

Probably in the near future they will have to make a choice between Russia and the support of motorsport fans. The fact is that Pirelli is one of the members of the F1 sponsorship team. Formula 1 has already condemned the war and terminated the contract with the Russian GP which was held in Sochi. What is more the Haas F1 team the main sponsor of which was the Russian company Uralkali refused to cooperate with them and said goodbye to the Russian pilot Nikita Mazepin.

On March 17 2022 the company published a press release entitled ‘The Board of Directors approves the results to 31 December 2021’ the last two lines indicate the issues of work in the aggressor country.

“Investments halted in Russia excluding those linked to security. The activities of the factories will be progressively limited to finance salaries and services for employees” the document claims.

Huawei the Chinese telecommunications giant not only stays in the Russian market but is also suspected of helping the Putin regime to fight against cyberattacks on government and propaganda resources.

According to Daily Mail this was even reported by the Chinese media but later all such messages were deleted. It was noted that Huawei intends to use its research centers in Russia (there are five of them) to train 50000 technical experts to protect Russian Internet network in the face of cyber threats.

Obviously Huawei denies all the accusations but few believe the claims of Chinese monopolists. In particular on March 7 one of the best footballers of the XXI century the forward of Bayern Munich Robert Lewandowski terminated a multimillion-dollar sponsorship contract with Huawei amid reports of the Chinese giant’s cooperation with Russia.

Tetra Pak — a Swedish-Swiss company the largest manufacturer of food packaging in Russia. A striking example of a company that tries to sit on two chairs at once.

Initially the management of Tetra Pak was keeping silent about the war and only on March 12 released a statement condemning Russia’s actions. It was said that company are going to refuse to invest in Russian economy and restrict on its activity in the aggressor state to essential food products such as milk and children’s food.

However on March 28 the Russian media reported that Tetra Pak was temporarily suspending the production of packaging for wine and beverages with a capacity of two liters (except juices). Moreover the reason is not that Russian missiles are destroying Ukrainian cities and killing peaceful Ukrainians but simply a lack of raw materials for packaging.

It’s unclear how wine can be considered as a socially important product for Russian children but Kremlin propagandists noted that Tetra Pak has enough raw materials for only one month and has not yet agreed on new supplies from China.

It is worth mentioning the work of catering services in Russia. As of March 7 the following companies continued to operate with the aggressor:

Yum! Brands (the owner of KFC  Pizza Hut  Taco Bell )*;

(the owner of   )*; McDonald’s **;

**; Starbucks ***;

***; Burger King ****;

****; Papa John’s.

*Yum! Brands. On March 8 the company announced the suspension of investments and the development of restaurants in Russia. In fact this means that Russian franchisees have been left without external funding but will continue to operate at their own expense. Yum! Brands has promised to redirect all the profit taken from Russian outlets to humanitarian efforts.

**McDonald’s. On the same day as a direct competitor in the face of KFC the company officially announced the temporary closure of all 850 restaurants in Russia. “McDonald’s has decided to temporarily close all our restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market. We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners” said in the statement.

However the company will continue to pay full salaries to its employees in Russia. And there are about 62000 of them!

***Starbucks. Immediately after McDonald’s the official position of one of the world’s largest coffee chains has appeared. After 13 days of war Starbucks decided not to sponsor the murderers and announced the suspension of business in Russia.

“We condemn the unprovoked unjust and horrific attacks on Ukraine by Russia and our hearts go out to all those affected… We continue to watch the tragic events unfold and today we have decided to suspend all business activity in Russia including shipment of all Starbucks products” said in the letter sent by CEO Kevin Johnson.

****Burger King — Restaurant Brands International which owns the Burger King chain finally made a statement on Ukraine on March 10. It turns out that in Russia the company does not own any Burger King restaurants in Russia because the business is fully franchised and managed by a local master franchisee.

In the end the company made a choice and announced a number of steps to sever operational ties to Russia namely:

refusal of new investments in Russia and expansion of the network;

suspension of all the corporate support for the Russian franchisees including at the level of operations marketing and supply chain;

any profits from franchised operations will be redirected to humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees.

In addition there were large corporations that had been keeping silent for a long time haven’t made any statements about leaving the Russian market and had continued to work with the aggressor as if nothing was happening. These included PepsiCO P&G and Unilever. However after some time weighing all the reputational risks they declared their positions:

PepsiCO — partial suspension of sales of goods in Russia (this applies to soft drinks under the brands Pepsi Sprite Mirinda; sales of goods in the categories of baby food and dairy products will continue);

— partial suspension of sales of goods in Russia (this applies to soft drinks under the brands Pepsi Sprite Mirinda; sales of goods in the categories of baby food and dairy products will continue); P&G — suspension of new investments in Russia cessation of advertising activity and reduction of the range of goods in stores (only health hygiene and personal care products will be left on the shelves);

— suspension of new investments in Russia cessation of advertising activity and reduction of the range of goods in stores (only health hygiene and personal care products will be left on the shelves); Unilever — suspension of exports of its products to Russia cessation of advertising activity refusal of new investments and profits from the Russian Federation (basic foodstuffs and hygiene products manufactured at the company’s Russian enterprises will remain on the market).

Raiffeisen Bank — In early March Reuters reported that one of the largest banks in Central and Eastern Europe Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) was looking into leaving Russia. Subsequently the RBI denied this information and its Russian department still continues to cooperate with the aggressor.

On March 9 they went even further. The Raiffeisen’s press-center reported that the bank has made Visa and Mastercard cards termless for Russian individuals and small businesses.

“Raiffeisen Bank’s Visa and Mastercard cards have become termless. Now individuals entrepreneurs and owners of small and micro businesses can use them in Russia without limitation. It is not necessary to reissue the cards — the validity of current cards has been extended automatically” the bank reports.

Deutsche Bank — Germany’s largest bank also does not want to leave Russia completely.

«We are often asked why we are not withdrawing completely from Russia. The answer is that this would go against our values. We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight. And as far as we can we will continue to also support them too at this difficult time» — Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing wrote on March 10.

However the German bank has declared its readiness to cease some types of businesses in Russia (not specified) and added that over the past few years DB has significantly reduced its presence in the Russian market. In addition the bank’s management assured that it would closely monitor the sanctions policy of the EU and if necessary they would adapt to the new approach to cooperation [or exodus from Russia].

Finally on March 11 the management of Deutsche Bank dared to announce that the largest German financial institution is eager to leave Russia. “We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations. There won’t be any new business in Russia” the bank said in a statement.

Crédit Agricole — French banking group has been keeping silent about its work in Russia for a long time. And only on March 22 almost a month after the beginning of invasion the company decided to sever all ties with the aggressor.

It is noted that one of the largest French banks has already suspended new financing of Russian companies and in a few weeks it will completely suspend all its activities in Russia.

“The group has contacted its international corporate clients to establish the terms of the cessation of services provided locally by Crédit Agricole CIB which will take effect in the coming weeks” noticed in the bank statement.

Hyatt and Hilton — the largest chains of luxury hotels were silent for two weeks waiting for what the public would say about them Finally they made statements about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On March 9 both companies announced that they will stop advertising campaigns in Russian market refuse to open new hotels in Russia but are not going to close existing ones.

They also expressed the full support and the readiness to promote the humanitarian efforts to Ukrainian refugees. “The Hilton network is ready to donate up to 1 million hotel room nights in hotels across Europe to support Ukrainian refugees fleeing horrific violence in their country” said in the statement.

A similar offer was made by Hyatt. Both companies also promised to direct all profits from activities in Russia to humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Nonetheless there are some hotel networks that continue to operate in Russia and do not comment on the situation in Ukraine:

Accor ;

; Intercontinental Hotels ;

; Marriott.

Renault — a French automotive company that stopped production at its facilities in Russia on February 28. As it turned out the reason was not the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the genocide of the Ukrainian people organized by Putin but the problems with logistics and lack of spare parts.

Renault was not going to completely refuse to sponsor Putin’s bloody regime and on March 21 even restore production at its Moscow plant.

However just two days later after heavy criticism of the company on the Internet Renault again announced the closure of its plant in Moscow.

“The Board of Directors of Renault Group met today and approved the following items: Renault Group activities in its manufacturing plant in Moscow are suspended as of today. Regarding its stake in AVTOVAZ Renault Group is assessing the available options taking into account the current environment while acting responsibly towards its 45000 employees in Russia” the company said in an official statement.

In addition the following companies are still fully or partially presented on the Russian market (as of March 23):

See which ones made the cut.,"(Sean P. Means | The Salt Lake Tribune) Packs of hard seltzer and other alcoholic products in a refrigerated case at the Smith's Food & Drug in Rose Park on March 4 2022. A bill passed by the Utah Legislature on March 3 2022 will make some brands of hard seltzer available only in state liquor stores.

About half of the hard seltzers available in Utah will soon be removed from supermarket and convenience store shelves and available only in state liquor stores because of a change in state law that passed the Utah Legislature this week.

As part of the Legislature’s omnibus alcohol bill which cleared its final legislative hurdle Thursday and is headed to Gov. Spencer Cox’s desk the state will prohibit the sale of beverages that contain even a trace amount of ethyl alcohol a commonly used stabilizer for artificial flavorings that is used in such products as soda mustard and teriyaki sauce.

Of the 80 hard seltzers and kombuchas approved for sale in Utah grocery and convenience stores according to Michelle Schmitt spokesperson for the state’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control 39 of them have ethyl alcohol in their flavorings. Those varieties most likely will be moved to state liquor stores she said.

If Cox signs the bill which is likely the new law would take effect July 1. Stores would be given six months to comply. Products that use glycol-based flavorings could still be sold in grocery and convenience stores.

The omnibus bill also among other actions would change the DABC’s name to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Services and would end the practice of allowing holders of liquor licenses to sell them to the highest bidder.

The growing popularity of hard seltzers in Utah over the last two or three years has been “remarkable” said Shanna Clay director of operations for M&M Distributing a wholesaler of beer and similar products. The change in the law she added “causes quite a few complications not just locally but nationally and will impact the supply chain structure everywhere.”

“The suppliers are having to go back to their flavoring houses to see what can be reformulated with ethyl alcohol or to try to get it switched over to propylene glycol” Clay said. “That then touches packaging food nutrition labels and ingredients. It creates hiccups across the whole system and everyone’s going to encounter that with this short window of trying to get products compliant.”

The change will be confusing Clay said “because to the consumer of hard seltzer 5 percent [alcohol volume] is 5 percent.”

Also some brands use both types of additives depending on the flavor. For example according to DABC four flavors of Bon & Viv Hard Seltzer would be available in grocery stores because their flavorings are glycol-based — while four other varieties of the same brand because their flavors contain ethyl alcohol would not be sold in grocery stores.

Also some brands package their seltzers in variety packs and if even one flavor is made with ethyl alcohol the whole pack would be allowed only in liquor stores.

Clay noted that her company distributes hard seltzers to 1300 stores in six Utah counties: Davis Salt Lake Summit Tooele Utah and Wasatch. Those seltzers with ethyl alcohol flavorings will now be sold only in 45 state liquor stores. For M&M and the other distributors in the state Clay said the loss of sales will inevitably lead to a loss in jobs.

The Utah Legislature banished “flavored malt beverages” — so-called “alcopops” such as Mike’s Hard Lemonade — to state liquor stores in 2008. The beverages were allowed back into grocery and convenience stores in 2016 when the DABC ruled that their formulation had been altered enough to qualify as “beer” under Utah law.

Schmitt said DABC is working with beverage makers confirming what ingredients are being used in each product to determine which ones will be moved to state liquor stores and which ones can be sold in grocery and convenience stores. There are applications pending for other seltzer products and those also will be reviewed she said.

Here as of Friday are the specific brands and flavors of hard seltzers and kombuchas that can be sold only at liquor stores or can be sold in grocery and convenience stores.

WHEN his marriage broke down after just three months Justin Bartholomew turned to energy drinks.

Battling depression the 25-year-old relied on the caffeine hit they gave him to get through the day.

4 When his marriage broke down after just three months Justin Bartholomew turned to energy drinks

4 That spiralled into addiction and led to the scaffolder taking his own life his dad believes

But that spiralled into addiction and led to the scaffolder taking his own life his dad believes.

Dad Keiron 68 says his son’s craving for the drinks including Red Bull turned him into “a zombie”.

“It was as powerful an addiction as crack for him which was horrible to see” Keiron told Fab Daily.

“I worked with Justin scaffolding and me and all the boys would tell him he had to cut back. But he said he couldn’t.”

A report in the British Medical Journal shows one in three children consumes at least one energy drink a week though the average can contain the same amount of caffeine as a shot of espresso.

The sugar-heavy products have been linked to a host of unpleasant side-effects ranging from increased blood pressure to disturbed sleep headaches and stomach pains.

And there are fears this could be just the tip of the iceberg.

‘Thousands throwing their lives away’

Fab Daily heard from one man who suffered a heart attack and was told energy drinks could be to blame while a mother of three who drank 15 LITRES of Lucozade a day admits her cravings left her “as addicted as to any drug”.

The warning comes as the Government plans to ban sales of energy drinks to the under-16s.

Keiron a semi-retired scaffolder told Fab Daily his son would turn up at work with carrier bags full of energy drinks while empty cans in his van’s footwell left it looking like a recycling bin.

Keiron from Peacehaven East Sussex said: “He was severely depressed and felt he needed the drinks to keep him going.

“But it became a vicious cycle of needing more and more to get through the day. He was getting less and less sleep which made the depression worse.

“I believe Justin’s normal coping mechanisms weren’t in place because of his energy drink addiction.”

From May 2016 Justin was under the care of a mental health crisis team.

But his addiction worsened and he would arrive at work with the drinks every day.

He started experiencing heart palpitations and sleepless nights.

Keiron adds: “He became like a zombie.”

Justin died on August 1 2017.

Keiron said: “It was the worst day of my life. Justin had been screaming out for help but we couldn’t get through to him because of the energy drinks.” Keiron believes the products should be banned completely.

Keiron Bartholomew on son Justin

He said: “There are tens of thousands of adults who are addicted and throwing their lives away.”

The Government ran a consultation on banning the sales of energy drinks to under-16s in 2018 but decided there was not enough data to justify changing the law.

However most supermarkets and High Street chemist Boots brought in voluntary bans prohibiting children from buying drinks containing more than 150mg caffeine per litre.

A study commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care suggests frequent consumption — classed as five or more times a week — could be linked to poorer mental and physical health and worse academic performance.

York University researchers warned in a new BMJ Open study that frequent consumption also raises the likelihood of school exclusion boozing and smoking.

The DHSC told Fab Daily a plan to end the sale of energy drinks to under-16s will be set out “in due course”.

Last year a BMJ report revealed a 21-year-old student suffered heart failure and spent 58 days in hospital after downing two litres of energy drinks every day for two years.

Similarly pub landlord Lee Kamen suffered a heart attack in 2017 at the age of 49 which he puts down to drinking four cans a day of the energy drink Monster.

Lee who owns the Vault bar in Witham Hull said: “I was working flat-out doing up the pub and would drink at least four cans a day to keep me going.

“After about a year I collapsed with a heart attack despite being teetotal and never having smoked. The doctor said my energy drink intake was probably the cause. I didn’t have a clue there was anything wrong with drinking them until then.”

I was working flat-out doing up the pub and would drink at least four cans a day to keep me going. After about a year I collapsed with a heart attack despite being teetotal and never having smoked. Lee Kamen

Lee who had a stent fitted and will be on medication for the rest of his life was then horrified when his 11-year-old daughter Summer bought a can of Monster on the way home from school last year.

He said: “Straight away I told her to pour it down the drain.”

He has since convinced Summer’s school to educate its pupils about energy drinks.

Lee added: “These drinks are packed with sugar and caffeine. I was very fit and healthy — and look what it did to me.”

Mum Kayleigh Judge 36 believes her Lucozade addiction has left her with chronic high blood pressure.

She has banned her sons Tyler 16 and Lee 14 from having drinks such as Red Bull and Monster in the house.

The restaurateur from Moray in Scotland says: “Often I’d pick up six 500ml bottles on the way to work then six more at lunchtime and six more on the way home.

“Then I’d work my way through six one-litre bottles in the evening — totalling 15 litres in 24 hours.”

Kayleigh became hooked on Lucozade when her first marriage was ending in her late twenties.

She said: “It was a way of coping with all the stress. If I didn’t get my fix I became a truly nasty person.”

Often I’d pick up six 500ml bottles on the way to work then six more at lunchtime and six more on the way home. Then I’d work my way through six one-litre bottles in the evening — totalling 15 litres in 24 hours. Kayleigh Judge

At 30 she went “cold turkey” after being diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure and put on medication. Energy drinks typically contain 32mg caffeine per 100ml roughly the same amount as a cup of filter coffee. Lucozade Energy has around 12mg per 100ml.

Now Kayleigh is calling for a total ban on all energy drinks. She said: “I won’t stock them in my restaurant or let my sons have them in the house. We have so many arguments because they see energy drinks as cool.

“I don’t see why these drinks exist. They’re hugely harmful and I wish I’d never started on them.”

Dietitian Rebecca McManamon a spokesman for the British Dietetic Association said: “Increased caffeine consumption in children and adolescents results in increased blood pressure poor sleep headaches stomach pains and diarrhoea.

“Consumption of energy drinks can affect a young person’s mental health and lead to poor diet — but also significantly impact sleep while the brain is still developing with reduced sleep being further linked to risk of weight gain.”

EU regulations state all energy drinks with a caffeine content of more than 150mg per litre must be labelled “not recommended for children”.

Gavin Partington of the British Soft Drinks Association said: ""Energy drinks and their ingredients have been deemed safe by regulatory authorities around the world. They are legally required to declare ‘High Caffeine Content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women’ followed by the exact caffeine content expressed in mg per 100ml on the label. We remain committed to supporting the responsible sale of energy drinks.""

The Sun has contacted Lucozade Red Bull and Monster last week for comment.

Red Bull referred us to Energy Drinks Europe’s research by the European Food Safety Authority including that “the general population of healthy adults is not exposed to any health risk from caffeine if the daily consumption is limited to 400mg.”

Are you at risk? IT can be hard to know when energy drinks have become a problem instead of enjoying them as part of a balanced diet. Moderate caffeine intake is around 400mg a day. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg about the same as a cup of coffee. Experts at UK Rehab say signs of addiction include: Drinking a lot in a short space of time

Developing a tolerance and needing to drink more to get the same ‘hit’

Relying on them to get through the day

Disturbed sleep

Anxiety and depression

Muscle twitching and difficulty concentrating

Stomach aches and acid reflux

Feeling irritable

Brain fog

Fatigue and lack of energy For more information visit uk-rehab.com

Secondly the above-mentioned consumer virtual goods in an online marketplace and online retail services for buyers and sellers of downloadable multimedia files containing artwork authenticated by NFTs are referred to.

Thirdly an online non-downloadable platform for users to browse create modify and manipulate virtual retail consumer goods for entertainment and amusement purposes.

Fourthly this filing is related to providing NFTs crypto-collectibles digital tokens or any digital asset to use or transfer on a software as a service (SAAS) or platform as a service (PAAS).

Lastly and probably one-of-its-kind trademark in providing nutrition and wellness coaching such as non-emergency medical treatment services wellness programs nutrition advisory services providing healthcare services and nutrition services as well as counseling — in virtual and augmented reality environments or the metaverse.

The filing basis by CVS is a Section 1(b) i.e; intent-to-use basis – you have a genuine intention to use your trademark in the near future and not currently at the present.

CVS is the latest in a long line of companies to file trademarks in the metaverse and NFTs joining major retailers. However its attempt to provide virtual health care services in a metaverse environment may be the first of its kind.

Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Tang Renjian said rare heavy rainfall last year delayed the planting of about one-third of the normal wheat supply leading to a roughly 20% shortage in crop yield.

The shortage coupled with the war between Russia and Ukraine which together produce roughly 29% of global wheat exports could see wheat prices surge past the already incredible 14-year high Reuters reported.

Prosecutors said the raids were in connection with the ""cum-ex"" tax evasion scandal.

German authorities have raided the offices of Morgan Stanley as part of a multi-billion euro tax fraud investigation.

Prosecutors in Cologne confirmed they had searched the Frankfurt branch of the US bank in connection with ""cum-ex transactions"".

A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley confirmed to Germany's DPA news agency that search warrants had been carried out.

""The investigation relates to past activity and we continue to cooperate with the German authorities"" they added.

Around 75 investigators from various authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse were involved in the raids the prosecutor's office said. The private homes of two suspects were also searched for ""relevant"" communications.

The so-called ""cum-ex"" scheme consists of quickly buying and selling shares around the dividend payment date so tax authorities can no longer identify the true owner.

The process makes it possible to claim the same tax credit on the profits attached to the dividend several times. According to Germany's finance ministry the total amount of tax evaded by the company was around €5.5 billion.

Lawyer Hanno Berger has been on trial since April for his role in the alleged tax fraud scheme.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWF0dXJlcy8yMDIyLTAzLTA2L2JhbmtlcnMtYXJlLWFiYW5kb25pbmctaG9uZy1rb25nLWFzLWJlaWppbmctYW5kLWNvdmlkLXJlbWFrZS10aGUtY2l0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Are Expats Leaving Hong Kong?

“Once upon a time we went to a computer show in Los Angeles” says Love ’72 ’75 a natural raconteur. It was 1985 at one of those cavernous software conferences and a guy from a brand-new computer company called NeXT walked up to the booth that Love and Cox were manning. NeXT was started by Jobs after he was ousted from Apple and before Apple bought NeXT rehired Jobs and changed the world in profound and dramatic ways. The NeXT employee was interested in what Love and Cox had done which was to extend and expand the programming language C into a language called Objective-C.

“He came back an hour later and said Steve sure would be interested in knowing more” and he invited them to the newly opened NeXT office in Palo Alto. “We arrived on a Tuesday and they had opened the doors on Monday” Love says. “I guess one could call that a ground-floor opportunity.”

It started with pigeons

How did Love who received his master’s and doctoral degrees in psychology at the University of Washington find himself in such a promising position at such an opportune time in the history of computers?

It started when he was an undergraduate in the late 1960s at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa not far from the tiny town of Aliceville where Love grew up. Love wanted to know how the mind works. To do this he learned to program electric relay switches the precursor to circuit boards “so we could train pigeons to peck when a light came on and things like that.”

His application to graduate schools listed this electromechanical programming experience which caught the eye of Earl “Buz” Hunt chair of the psychology department at UW at the time. “Earl was studying memory and cognition and he wanted people who could do computer-controlled studies of human memory” Love says. The two struck up a friendship often spending winter weekends cross-country skiing in the mountains near Seattle.

Once he was working in Hunt’s lab Love proposed a different tack to their research. “I walked in one day and said ‘Buz we’ve been making a lot of progress with this memory study but if you told me to study basketball players I wouldn’t go to the local gym I’d go to the NBA’” Love recalls. He told his mentor “If we’re going to study memory why don’t we find somebody who’s good at it and study them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbmFseXNpcy1ub3JtYWxseS10cmFuc3BhcmVudC10dXNpbXBsZS1idW5nbGVzLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtY2hhbmdlLXJhdHRsaW5nLWludmVzdG9yc9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbmFseXNpcy1ub3JtYWxseS10cmFuc3BhcmVudC10dXNpbXBsZS1idW5nbGVzLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtY2hhbmdlLXJhdHRsaW5nLWludmVzdG9ycy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analysis: Normally transparent TuSimple bungles leadership change rattling investors,"For a young public company known for transparency TuSimple Holdings’ sudden replacement of Cheng Lu as CEO with co-founder Xiaodi Hou showed that unexpected moves rattle investors. And shaken investors sell stock.

A lot of stock.

TuSimple is trading near its all-time low. For the week it was down 32.65% with most of the damage on Thursday the day of the announcement..

The timing and immediate execution appeared to be a PR blunder with volatile markets already spooked by inflation fears and how much Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could further impact global economies.

Though executive succession had been discussed at the board level and was known to senior leadership TuSimple (NASDAQ: TSP) had never mentioned it in quarterly earnings calls nor during presentations in analyst conferences.

Perhaps a timed transition would have brought a less extreme investor reaction.

Contractually Lu will stay on as an adviser to Hou for the next year. But he is unlikely to stick around that long. That may prove unfortunate for TuSimple because Hou the largest shareholder in the company is more technically oriented and less practiced in external communications.

Watch now: Dissecting TuSimple’s sudden shakeup

A computer scientist who grew up in China and earned a Ph.D. in computation and neural systems from the California Institute of Technology in 2014 Hou founded TuSimple with partner Mo Chen in 2015. Chen is giving up the board chairmanship to Hou but remains a director.





With Lu’s departure inside directors will hold two seats instead of three a nod to a corporate governance trend toward more independent directors.

Hou and Chen own the vast majority — 62.5% — of B-series shares which carry 10 times the voting power of Class A common shares.

Near-term noise?

Hou’s original establishment of TuSimple in the Cayman Islands and significant investment from a subsidiary of Chinese technology giant Sina Corp. were central to an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

The intergovernmental agency recently concluded the probe with TuSimple signing a national security agreement and two Sina-related Chinese directors agreeing to retire at the end of their current terms.The Sina subsidiary also agreed to a standstill in its 20% stake in TuSimple.

The CFIUS agreement apparently had no bearing on the changes at the top. Greater integration of TuSimple’s technology and commercialization efforts is something Hou could foster. As a technology company TuSimple with Hou as the public face may inspire confidence in partners and investors.

“We are very familiar with Dr. Hou and continue to have high confidence in the TSP story but acknowledge that this sudden transition brings near-term noise/execution risk” Ravi Shanker an equity analyst with Morgan Stanley said in a research note.

Shanker has been bullish on TuSimple predicting a breakout for the stock because of its successful driverless pilots. Overall TuSimple gets a “strong buy” rating based on the recommendations of 10 analysts. Nine have strong or moderate buy ratings.

A tech company first

Former Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration interim administrator Jim Mullen who spent 15 years at Werner Enterprises will continue to manage fleet relationships. Former Morgan Stanley banker Pat Dillon remains CFO. Four other technology vice presidents have been promoted in recent months.

Lu joined the company in 2018 as president and CEO replacing Hou. He brought 13 years of private equity and investment banking experience. His ability to raise money and develop partnerships bought time for the technology to mature without the pressure of a short financial runway.

Lu’s undergraduate computer science degree helped him to be conversant in the technology but not at a brainiac level.

At age 40 he has no immediate plans for what’s next though he won’t work for an autonomous trucking competitor. As the third-largest individual shareholder in TuSimple at more than 2% the father of young twins doesn’t need to work even with the shrunken value of the stock price $11.45 compared to more than $79 at its peak.

Meeting milestones

The list of accomplishments under Lu’s leadership is impressive. TuSimple is establishing a lead in the race to commercialize trucking with no human in the cab. Consider that it:

Completed the first “driver-out” pilot run an 80-mile trip from a Tucson Arizona railyard to a Phoenix freight depot on Dec. 22. (As chief technology officer it was Hou not Lu who decided the timing.) TuSimple has repeated the trip multiple times and plans to make the pilots permanent expanding to Texas.

Was the first autonomous trucking company to go public raising $1.1 billion in an initial public offering last April that valued the company at $8.1 billion. TuSimple ended the year with $1.3 billion on its balance sheet. It lost $411 million mostly due to ongoing research and development expenses. Freight-hauling revenue was $6.3 million.

Is developing an autonomous freight network that covers most of the lower third of the U.S. from Tucson to Orlando Florida and north to Charlotte North Carolina. It has created high-definition maps for thousands of miles of roads so far. Competitors are mostly focused on test runs in largely flat and dryTexas.

Attracted numerous large fleets suppliers and two railroads as investors and advisers and has 7325 nonbinding reservations for a purpose-built Navistar LT Class 8 truck it is partnering with the Traton Group subsidiary to sell by 2024. TuSimple has retrofitted about 70 Peterbilt Model 579 and International LT trucks used in human-supervised autonomous freight hauling.

“Over the last several years we basically took an R&D startup and gave it the resources it needed and we hit our major milestones in the first year as a public company” Lu told FreightWaves. “We’re a tech company. It was time for Xiaodi to come back into the forefront.”

Ashlee Margolis knows that and it’s why she opened her Beverly Hills office to throw a party in their honor on Feb. 22. No sneaking in the back door or pretending to be a boss’s plus-one for 125 administrative insiders from companies like CAA UTA Brillstein Entertainment Partners Gersh Agency Mosaic Lede Company Wolf Kasteler Public Relations Align PR and more. Upon arrival they were greeted by rapid COVID-19 tests and hosts Margolis managing partner Jenine Leigh-Pollard and the rest of The A List staff.

It was the second assistants-only bash thrown by Margolis and her team at A List a top celebrity influencer and entertainment marketing events and special projects firm that maintains a client roster that includes New Balance J. Crew Rothy’s Reformation OSEA Genexa Grove Collaborative SEED Ritual and others. The last one went down three years ago and Margolis felt it was even more urgent to send invites now for another hang.

“It’s been tough for all these assistants who have been isolated while working from home” explains Margolis. “They haven’t been able to meet other assistants in a social setting and some haven’t even been able to meet those who work at their own company.”

She recruited a roster of sponsors — Sparkling Ice Spiked Cocktails and Fly By Jing — that delivered libations and snacks. Fly By Jing founder Jin Gao was even on hand to help prepare a special menu that featured dumplings and tacos. There were pies by Prince Street Pizza tequila by Teremana and the celebration happened to coincide with National Margarita Day providing a good excuse to showcase Sparkling Ice’s newest Cocktail inspired Hard Seltzers. The low sugar canned seltzer will be launching in two flavors Strawberry Margarita and Mango Mule.

Margolis said she still is tight with many of the people she met during her own assistant days working under notable PR and branding power player Lara Shriftman. “They are now this generation’s top publicists managers and agents” she explained. “I want to give my team the opportunity to build relationships with people who will be the heads of agencies and studios one day. I love networking and bringing people together. My business is all about relationships and I want to help build them for the next generation of leaders at The A List.”

There’s more of them to meet now too. Margolis explained that her firm tripled in size amid the pandemic under the guidance of Leigh-Pollard. Even with diverse duties and an expanding employee base Margolis says she’s still got a soft spot for throwing events and on Tuesday night she even made sure everyone had a name tag on their chest to provide for maximum mixing and mingling. “I love to create a vibe and have fun and last night was the perfect evening to kick off to getting back to hopefully some normalcy again. The most asked question I got all night was ‘So when is your next one?'”

Cryptic messages of hope

In an exclusive interview with TUKO.co.ke's Hillary Lisimba KNH employee Winfred Gumbo revealed that the art was donated by different institutions.

""Most people never really take a keen interest in the mosaics but if you look closely you notice each has a message of hope"" she disclosed.

The messages range from simple words like ""Wish you Well"" and ""Be Brave"" to more exciting compilations that engage the patient's mind directing it away from the sickness.

Women’s safety campaigners have said “more needs to be done” a year on from Sarah Everard’s murder as they joined local politicians to unveil a bench commemorating victims of male violence.

Members of Reclaim Sutton’s Streets an offshoot of the larger group Reclaim These Streets demanded “fundamental change” as they spoke at the ribbon-cutting event in the town’s Trinity Square in south London.

Nearly 100 people including Mayor Trish Fivey braved the rainy weather to gather in the square on Saturday and pay tribute to all women who have been killed by men.

The bench which features a brightly coloured mosaic with a motif of hearts and stars was created by artists Samia Tossio and Hana Horack-Elyafi after campaigners received planning permission from Sutton Council.

Sarah McGuinness head of the campaign group hailed the community effort as evidence of progress but said it had come “at such a high cost”.

“We’d had enough and we wanted to make our streets safe” she said.

“At last there is a genuine cross-party local commitment to end gender-based violence but it’s at such a high cost.

“Slogans like ‘she was just walking home she was just going for a run’ put women in a hierarchy against other women. We would never hear ‘she was just going for a one-night stand’. Why is it that women are sometimes blamed more so than the predator?

“We have come so far but the language has got to change.”

Ms Fivey said the past week had been a “very sad reminder” of Ms Everard’s murder as well as other victims of male violence.

“Today we’re here to unveil this very moving tribute to all women and girls who have died as a result of male violence no matter who they were or where they lived” she added.

The bench’s surface is inscribed with the words “never commit never excuse never be silent” a phrase used by the White Ribbon Campaign.

Its approval came after women and girls expressed their anguish over the murders of Ms Everard and schoolteacher Sabina Nessa and asked what could be done to recognise the need for change.

Saturday’s event was scheduled in between the anniversary of Ms Everard’s death on March 4 and International Women’s Day on March 8.

Women in the crowd also shared the ways in which they had become more “cautious” and “anxious” while alone in public since Ms Everard’s death.

Joyce Bossey a local florist who spoke at the event said the unveiling had been “wonderful but emotional”.

Reflecting on the recent anniversary of Ms Everard’s death Ms Bossey said it had left women “traumatised” and there was still a “nervousness and anxiety” about walking in public.

She also expressed ambivalence about the Metropolitan Police’s new Walk And Talk scheme in which women are invited to “buddy up” with officers while travelling through areas in which they feel vulnerable and share their concerns.

“The police are not going to be walking through the park at night chaperoning you (all the time). That’s not going to be unfortunately.

“It’s a good idea but change comes through education in our schools. It starts there”.

Sheila Butter 54 said: “I personally don’t even go out in the dark any more. I don’t go out in the evening any more.

“We feel we have to (change our behaviour) but it should not be that way. It’s about men changing their behaviour ultimately.”

She said putting the bench in a popular town square was a step towards the community at large being forced to confront the reality of violence against women.

“I will show my son (the bench) and talk to him about why it’s here” Ms Butter said.

Nicola Weatherill a 49-year-old teaching assistant said: “I’ve become even more cautious (since Ms Everard’s murder). I feel like I’ve stepped up what I’m doing” she said.

She added “anything that sparks a conversation” would help to keep the issue in the spotlight.

Ms McGuinness said she hoped the bench would serve as a “permanent way” of remembering all those who have been victims of male violence.

“We are going forward but there is still so much to be done” she added.",,,,,,

AFP-Yonhap



By Lee Min-hyung



The Korea Exchange will suspend trading of a Seoul-listed Russia-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Monday amid the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.



Under the decision any trading of the KINDEX Russia MSCI ETF ― operated by Korea Investment Management ― will come to a temporary halt until further notice according to the exchange operator. The fund is the only Russia-related ETF sold here.



""This is part of a move to protect investors and stabilize the market and the trading suspension will remain in place for the time being"" the exchange said in a recent statement.



The announcement came at a time when Russia is escalating its invasion of Ukraine which has been jolting the global asset market for the past few weeks.



But data showed that retail investors here have been on a buying spree of the ETF for the past two weeks on hopes for its rebound after bottoming out due to the war risk.



According to the data from the Korea Exchange retail investors purchased the fund product worth 28 billion won ($23 million) between Feb. 21 and March 4. Since mid-February the price of the fund has been nosediving. It closed at 10070 won on Friday a drastic 29.97 percent fall from the previous trading day.



Of note was that the fund attracted the biggest attention from individual investors on Feb. 25 when Russia started its all-out invasion into Ukraine. They purchased 18.3 billion won worth of the fund on that day alone topping the list of the daily ETF sales volume here.



But the fund operator issues a warning to investors leaving open the possibility of the fund's possible delisting here.



""The fund product comes with risks on possible delisting so investors are advised to pay close attention before making investments"" the asset management firm said in a recent statement.



Despite the concern other data also showed that retail investors have engaged in a buying spree of Russia-related ETFs listed on the U.S. stock market.



Korean retail investors purchased $19.55 million worth of VanEck Russia ETF between Feb. 21 and March 4 according to data from the Korea Securities Depository. They also purchased $13.98 million worth of iShares MSCI Russia ETF and $4.84 million of Direxion Daily Russia Bull 2X respectively during the same period.



Given that the price of such Russia-related funds here and abroad nosedived amid the unceasing war risk between the two countries market experts urge investors to remain more than careful when seeking new investment opportunities.



""Some investors are moving to look for new investment opportunities by investing in undervalued assets after the outbreak of war in Ukraine"" eBest Investment & Securities analyst Choi Kwang-hyuk said. ""But it remains questionable to say that now is the right time to purchase stocks. Investors need to maintain a conservative attitude while paying continuous attention to any changes in the Ukraine crisis.""

The maker of Stolichnaya vodka announced a major rebrand Friday in direct response to its founder’s “vehement position” against the Putin regime and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The vodka famously marketed as Russian will now be sold and marketed simply as Stoli the company said in a statement.

Stoli Group’s founder Russian-born billionaire Yuri Shefler was exiled from that nation in 2000 because of his opposition to Putin. The liquor has long been marketed as Russian vodka but its production facilities have been in Latvia since that year. Stoli Group is a unit of Luxembourg-based SPI Group.

The company also cited its employees’ desire to take action and to accurately represent the vodka’s Latvian roots.

Earlier this week Stoli Group announced it would only use Slovakian sources to make sure that none of its ingredients are sourced from Russia.

Officials in states from Ohio to New Hampshire have called on liquor stores to remove Russian-made or Russian-branded products from their shelves – which in most cases means vodka. Some bar owners have even dumped out Stoli vodka in protest.

These boycotts and protests are unlikely to have much impact however. Russian-made vodka accounts for a very small percentage of the roughly $7 billion in annual vodka sales according to the Distilled Spirits Council (DISCUS) a national trade organization that represents spirits makers.

In the United States less than 1% of vodka consumed is produced in Russia. More than half of all vodka consumed domestically is actually made in the US according to data from IWSR Drinks Market Analysis a global firm that tracks alcohol sales.

(Yosuke Fukudome)

Tokyo prosecutors arrested four high-ranking officials of SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. including two executive officers on suspicion of market manipulation in breach of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law.

All four arrested March 4 worked in the firm’s equity department.

The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office identified the suspects as Trevor Hill 51 a senior managing executive officer who heads the equity department; Alexandre Avakiants 44 an executive officer who serves as deputy head of the equity department; Makoto Yamada 44 who heads the equity section in the department; and Shinichiro Okazaki 56 who heads another section in the same department.

According to sources all four insisted during voluntary questioning prior to their arrests that there was nothing illegal in the transactions they were involved in.

President Yuichiro Kondo held a news conference on March 5 in which he apologized for the incident.

“We deeply reflect on and seriously accept having caused a situation that could shake trust in the market” Kondo said.

He said nothing about resigning to show responsibility.

In a statement issued March 5 the company said an investigative committee made up of three lawyers had been assigned to look into the allegations.

“We take this matter very seriously and sincerely apologize to our customers and other concerned parties for causing great concern and inconvenience” the statement added.

Prosecutors contend the four conspired to prop up the share price of five stocks including those listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s First Section between December 2019 and November 2020.

The company was involved in block trades of those stocks and the propping up of the share price was seen as an attempt to ensure that the block trades went through.

Block trades involve large-volume sales of a stock by major shareholders. Because the sale of a large number of shares at the same time could lead to a sharp drop in the share price securities firms arrange to sell the shares in smaller bundles to other investors outside of the market.

The share price for the transaction is determined by the closing price on the day the sale is to be made. But if the market share price drops the shareholder that initially put the shares for sale can request a postponement in the transaction to avoid a damaging loss.

However stopping a transaction is a step few securities firms are willing to make because of the risk of damaging the institution’s reputation and losing gains from the transaction.

Investigative sources alleged the four were involved in placing a large-volume buy order shortly before the exchanges closed to ensure the share price of the stock remained stable.

Normally those working in the equity department and trade in stock using the company’s own funds do not share information with those handling block trades so as to avoid the appearance of impropriety according to multiple sources in the securities industry.

But the investigative sources said Okazaki who was in charge of handling the block trades at SMBC Nikko contacted Yamada when he held concerns about a possible drop in the share price of a stock being traded in such a manner. Yamada would in turn use the company’s funds to place the buy order to ensure the share price did not drop precipitously sources said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjIvMDMvMjU5ODI1OTEvMTAtd2VpcmRlc3QtbXJiZWFzdC12aWRlb3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Weirdest MrBeast Videos - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/03/25982591/10-weirdest-mrbeast-videos on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjIvMDMvMjU5ODI1OTEvMTAtd2VpcmRlc3QtbXJiZWFzdC12aWRlb3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Business Bureau :

Rising prices of coal and other raw material seem to have cast a dark cloud over several businesses cutting across the categories. From steel manufacturers to packaging units and from cement manufacturers to publishers almost all are facing hardship. The current situation is also pushing up prices of other commodities and eventually affecting the common man. Soaring prices of paper is one such example that has seen record hike in the range of 25 per cent to 90 per cent in a span of just one year. Writing and printing paper price has jumped from Rs 39000-46000 per Metric Tonne (MT) (plus 12% GST) in March 2021 to Rs 75000 per MT (plus 12% GST) in March 2022. Corresponding hike in prices of other categories of paper including coated paper craft paper and newsprint was also seen over the same period. Prices of all the categories of paper are trading at all time highs.





Past President of the Federation of Paper Traders’ Association of India Mahesh Khandelwal told The Hitavada that the rising paper prices have severely affected the paper industry and even others. “We have been witnessing a sharp rise for the past few months which has affected everyone who is consuming paper and paper products” he said. Khandelwal said the current levels of paper prices are because of the tremendous hike in coal price which has recently touched its all time high. “Coal is important raw material used in paper mill. Besides the high prices of the petrochemicals and other commodities are taking up the price of paper” he said.

“Packaging units printing units newspaper industry publishers notebook manufactures and others are facing the consequences of the price rise” he said. Ashish Khandelwal President of the Nagpur Paper Traders’ Association said “There are various issues because of which all the major paper manufacturing units in the country are operating below their capacity. On the other hand demand for paper has gone up significantly as soon as the Government started easing restrictions” he said. During the corona phase there were very few takers for the writing and printing paper as people were working from their homes and schools were closed. And when the authorities started lifting restrictions demand for writing and printing paper started going up dramatically. In the meanwhile raw material shortage brought down paper production. Highlighting another point Harshit Bhansali Secretary of the Nagpur Paper Traders’ Association said non-availability of the paper waste is also impacting the pricing. “During the corona phase proper collection of paper waste could not happen and today it is in short supply. Paper waste is used to manufacture recycled paper” he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier this week the streaming service had announced that it would pause all future projects and acquisitions from Russia joining a growing list of companies that have cut ties with the country. Netflix had four Russian originals in the works including a crime thriller series directed by Dasha Zhuk which was shooting and has since been put on hold. Netflix also recently refused to carry 20 Russian free-to-air propaganda channels that it was required to host under Russian law.

Now the company is taking an additional step in shutting down its service entirely.

“Given the circumstances on the ground we have decided to suspend our service in Russia” a spokesperson for Netflix said.

The economic blowback that Russia has faced in the wake of its decision to go to war with Ukraine has been intense. Not only is the country grappling with extensive sanctions but many corporations and organizations have pulled out of Russia. Companies like Microsoft Apple and Dell have announced that they have suspended sales in the country while Ikea has closed stores and Nike has said it will no longer fulfill online orders. On the entertainment front all of the major studios have announced they will stop releasing their films in Russia.

Netflix is somewhat of a newcomer to Russia. It launched its service in 2016 and has a relatively small presence with roughly one million subscribers. The streamer boasts 222 million subscribers globally. It operates through a service provider agreement with Russia’s National Media Group.

Popular on Variety

Netflix also recently announced that it would make its 2015 documentary “Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom” available to watch for free. The non-fiction film centers on the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine which were sparked by former president Viktor Yanukovych’s decision not to sign an agreement with the European Union and instead choose to strengthen ties to Russia. Those protests ultimately resulted in Yanukovych’s ouster. It also exacerbated tensions with Russia with Vladimir Putin using the overthrow as a pretext for invading and annexing the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.

""Given the circumstances on the ground we have decided to suspend our service in Russia"" a spokesperson said Sunday afternoon.

The Russian market makes up a relatively small percentage of Netflix's overall numbers. The company has just under 1 million subscribers in Russia CNBC previously reported compared to its 222 million total paid memberships across the globe.

The streaming service previously stopped projects and acquisitions in Russia after the country began its invasion of Ukraine. It had four Russian-language series in production and post-production. Netflix also declined to comply with Russian rules to carry news channels.

Companies from tech giants to retailers have started to take hard stances against Russia either pulling service or barring sales. Sunday's move makes Netflix one of the latest media companies to suspend service in Russia following the start of the war.

Disney announced early last week it was pausing all film debuts in the country including the new Pixar film ""Turning Red."" Warner Bros.  Sony  Paramount Pictures and Universal all followed.

“Given the circumstances on the ground we have decided to suspend our service in Russia” Netflix spokesperson Emily Feingold said in a statement to The Verge.

Last week Netflix said it wouldn’t comply with a new Russian law that requires large streamers to host 20 Russian propaganda channels such as NTV and the state-backed Channel One. The streaming giant later announced that it’s halting all productions and acquisitions in Russia — Netflix had been working on four Russian originals at the time.

Adam Reynolds is reportedly a chance of making a shock comeback from Covid-19 in time to make his Broncos debut in Round 1.

Reynolds and teammate Kobe Hetherington were ruled out of the Rabbitohs clash after returning a positive PCR test result.

However News Corprevealed on Friday that the duo could take their place in Brisbane’s 17.

After serving the mandatory government-issued seven-day isolation period NRL players can undergo further testing on the eighth day effectively making Reynolds and Hetherington unavailable for Round 1.

But the NRL has no restrictions on when a player returns after serving the seven days — instead that call is in the hands of each club according to News Corp.

The Broncos implemented an 11-day program for players that test positive this season in January however football director Ben Ikin confirmed to News Corp that Reynolds could be in the mix for Round 1.

Meanwhile a Cowboys assistant coach has revealed the plans for superstar Jason Taumalolo and there’s mixed news for the Roosters..

Read below for Foxsports.com.au’s Round 1 team tips!!

THURSDAY MARCH 10

Penrith Panthers vs Manly Sea Eagles at Bluebet Stadium 8.05pm

Predicted Panthers team: 1. Dylan Edwards 2. Charlie Staines 3. Stephen Crichton 4. Izack Tago 5. Brian To’o 6. Jarome Luai 7. Nathan Cleary 8. Moses Leota 9. Apisai Koroisau 10. James Fisher-Harris 11. Viliame Kikau 12. Liam Martin 13. Isaah Yeo 14. Mitch Kenny 15. Scott Sorensen 16. Spencer Leniu 17. J’maine Hopgood

TEAM TIPS: The Panthers will be sweating on their star halfback Nathan Cleary after he underwent shoulder surgery during the off-season. Cleary is desperate to play in Round 1 but should coach and dad Ivan decide to take it slow it’ll be new recruit Sean O’Sullivan stepping in to replace him. After starting last season on the wing and then being axed Charlie Staines who played fullback in the trial against the Sharks is expected to get another chance on the wing with Stephen Crichton shifting back to his native centre role after Paul Momirovski’s departure. Young gun Izack Tago is tipped to replace Matt Burton in the centres while youngster J’maine Hopgood could snatch a spot on the bench. Viliame Kikau will also return to the starting team after playing an explosive role off the bench late last season. Dylan Edwards and James Fisher-Harris will be back to full fitness after carrying injuries in the grand final. Preston Riki is out until mid-season with a hip injury.

Predicted Sea Eagles team: 1. Tom Trbojevic 2. Jason Saab 3. Brad Parker 4. Morgan Harper 5. Reuben Garrick 6. Kieran Foran 7. Daly Cherry-Evans 8. Taniela Paseka 9. Lachlan Croker 10. Martin Taupau 11. Ethan Bullemor 12. Karl Lawton 13. Jake Trbojevic 14. Dylan Walker 15. Sean Keppie 16. Andrew Davey 17. Toafofoa Sipley

TEAM TIPS: Haumole Olakau’atu injured his elbow in the final trial and is expected to miss Round 1 which will see Broncos recruit Ethan Bullemor into the starting side and Andrew Davey on the bench. Josh Schuster will miss the opening rounds due to an ankle injury with Karl Lawton tipped to come into the back row. Josh Aloiai will miss the season-opener due to a three-game suspension. Kieran Foran pairs Daly Cherry-Evans in the ever-solid Manly halves while Lachlan Croker retains his No.9 jersey. The versatile Dylan Walker will once again play the important bench utility role after being re-signed in the off-season and Toafofa Sipley will be on the bench. Tom Trbojevic will be wearing the fullback jersey after he made a brilliant first appearance in the trial win over the Tigers with speedster Jason Saab on one wing and goal-kicker Reuben Garrick on the other.

FRIDAY MARCH 11

Canberra Raiders vs Cronulla Sharks at GIO Stadium 6.00pm

Predicted Raiders team: 1. Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad 2. Nick Cotric 3. Jarrod Croker 4. Matthew Timoko 5. Semi Valemei 6. Jack Wighton 7. Brad Schneider 8. Josh Papalii 9. Josh Hodgson 10. Joe Tapine 11. Hudson Young 12. Elliott Whitehead 13. Adam Elliott 14. Tom Starling 15. Ryan Sutton 16. Corey Horsburgh 17. Corey Harawira-Naera

TEAM TIPS: Coach Ricky Stuart said he wants to ease teenage sensation Xavier Savage into the NRL which means Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad will start at fullback in Round 1. But it remains a very tough call for Stuart. That selection should see veteran Jarrod Croker start in the centres following his career-saving knee operation in October. Elliott Whitehead is due back in the trials and is expected to play in Round 1. All eyes will be on the Raiders’ new-look halves combination come Round 1 after a cruel injury to recruit Jamal Fogarty which will see young gun Brad Schneider slot into halfback. “I am going to play Brad Schneider” Stuart told News Corp. “I promised these kids that if they give us an opportunity to develop them I will give them an opportunity to play NRL and show me they are NRL players. Adam Elliott also made the move to Canberra over the off-season and is expected to start at lock. Despite the club’s decision not to offer Josh Hodgson a new deal beyond this season coach Ricky Stuart is still expected to start the veteran and then shift him to lock when Tom Starling comes on to run amok out of dummy-half. Meanwhile Corey Horsburgh has returned to contact training after shoulder surgery and is aiming to be fit for the Raiders’ first game. Nick Cotric is a welcomed return after one season with the Bulldogs and will slot back in on the wing with Harley Smith-Shields out for the season with an ACL injury. Flyer Semi Valemei will come onto the wing for the suspended Jordan Rapana who is out until Round 3. Raiders recruit Peter Hola suffered suspected medial ligament damage against the Roosters and faces time on the sidelines.

Predicted Sharks team: 1. Will Kennedy 2. Ronaldo Mulitalo 3. Connor Tracey 4. Jesse Ramien 5. Sione Katoa 6. Matt Moylan 7. Nicho Hynes 8. Toby Rudolf 9. Blayke Brailey 10. Braden Hamlin-Uele 11. Briton Nikora 12. Siosifa Talakai 13. Dale Finucane 14. Luke Metcalf 15. Andrew Fifita 16. Aiden Tolman 17. Royce Hunt

TEAM TIPS: Skipper Wade Graham has a fresh injury and will miss the first month of the season. Graham was only just back to full fitness after missing a chunk of last season due to repeated concussions but suffered a syndesmosis injury in the club’s final pre-season clash. A careless high tackle in the first trial against the Panthers cost playmaker Braydon Trindall his shot at partnering Nicho Hynes in the halves in Round 1. Trindall is suspended for the first two rounds which will see Matt Moylan wear the No. 6 jumper with Luke Metcalf coming off the bench. Versatile utility Siosifa Talakai suffered a head knock against the Panthers but should be fit for Round 1. It’s a new era for the Sharks under rookie NRL coach Craig Fitzgibbon. He’ll have the handy additions of Hynes and Dale Finucane though to help make his first season in the Shire a success. Fitzgibbon has already confirmed that Hynes was signed as a half despite a breakout season at fullback last year for the Storm. Cameron McInnes will miss the first month of the season after undergoing a minor operation on the same knee that required reconstructive surgery last year. Finuncane will play lock allowing prop Braden Hamlin-Uele to come into the starting side and Andrew Fifita to grab a spot on the bench while Royce Hunt also makes the pine after impressive form in the trials. Fitzgibbon recently hinted at a Ronaldo Mulitalo-Connor Tracey combination on an edge while we’re tipping Sione Katoa to beat recruit Matt Ikuvalu for a spot on the wing. Blayke Brailey will be the hooker.

Brisbane Broncos vs South Sydney Rabbitohs at Suncorp Stadium 8.05pm

Predicted Broncos team: 1. Selwyn Cobbo 2. Corey Oates 3. Kotoni Staggs 4. Herbie Farnworth 5. Jamayne Isaako 6. Billy Walters 7. Albert Kelly 8. Ryan James 9. Jake Turpin 10. Payne Haas 11. Kurt Capewell 12. Jordan Riki 13. Patrick Carrigan 14. Cory Paix 15. Rhys Kennedy 16. TC Robati 17. Keenan Palasia

TEAM TIPS: Superstar recruit Adam Reynolds and young gun Kobe Hetherington have tested positive to Covid-19. They were ruled out of the game however News Corp reports there’s still a chance Reynolds could play. Meanwhile Herbie Farnworth Tyson Gamble and Albert Kelly must be cleared by Brisbane medicos to play Round 1 according to News Corp. Should he recover in time and pass protocols Kelly and Billy Walters loom as the most likely halves pairing for Round 1. Tesi Niu will miss the opening rounds of the season due to injury which will see trials standout Selwyn Cobbo start the season-opener at fullback. Jake Turpin is tipped to start at hooker withCory Paixon the bench. There’s a big question mark over Brisbane’s halves pairing with the No.6 jersey already up for grabs — plus Reynolds’ covid result. Albert Kelly’s experience should get him into the side but coach Kevin Walters said last week he could take family out of the decision which could open the door for his son Billy. There’s also teen gun Ezra Mam in the mix. “There’s a battle on there (for the No.6); I’ve got some ideas in my head but nothing’s over the line. You take the family side out of it; normally I’m a very fair person and I’ll be fair across the board.” Thomas Flegler and one-game rookie Brendan Piakura won’t play Round 1 due to suspensions while Xavier Willison is looking at a mid-season return from a knee injury. New recruit Ryan James will likely fill in for Flegler. Patrick Carrigan returned against the Titans after tearing his ACL in Round 9 last season while Payne Haas (ankle) is set to be fit to play after returning against the Cowboys in the Broncos’ final trial.

Predicted Rabbitohs team: 1. Blake Taffe 2. Alex Johnston 3. Jaxson Paulo 4. Campbell Graham 5. Josh Mansour 6. Cody Walker 7. Lachlan Ilias 8. Mark Nichols 9. Damien Cook 10. Tevita Tatola 11. Keaon Koloamatangi 12. Jai Arrow 13. Cameron Murray 14. Siliva Havili 15. Jacob Host 16. Thomas Burgess 17. Michael Chee-Kam

TEAM TIPS: South Sydney’s new captain Cameron Murray is touch-and-go after undergoing the same surgery Nathan Cleary did during the off-season. Murray is “confident” he’ll be back for Round 1 but just like Cleary he doesn’t want to rush it either. With Latrell Mitchell out suspended until Round 2 Blake Taaffe will hold onto the No.1 jumper while Jaxson Paulo will likely get the first opportunity to nail down Dane Gagai’s vacant centre spot. Josh Mansour will take Paulo’s spot on the wing. Jacob Gagai impressed in the trial against the Cowboys and should debut at some point in 2022 but it is unlikely to be in Round 1. New head coach Jason Demetriou has confirmed Lachlan Ilias will replace Adam Reynolds in the halves. Versatile forward Jai Arrow will come into the back row for the departed Jaydn Su’A while recruit Michael Chee-Kam will likely replace Liam Knight on the bench with the latter missing the first month of the competition after undergoing three off-season surgeries. Recruit Siliva Havili will likely play the utility role that Taaffe is tipped to switch to when Mitchell returns. Isaiah Tass is due back from a back injury in Round 1 but is unlikely to make the 17.

SATURDAY MARCH 12

Sydney Roosters vs Newcastle Knights at Sydney Cricket Ground 3.00pm

Predicted Roosters team: 1. James Tedesco 2. Daniel Tupou 3. Paul Momirovski 4. Joseph Manu 5. Kevin Naiqama 6. Luke Keary 7. Sam Walker 8. Jared Waerea-Hargreaves 9. Connor Watson 10. Lindsay Collins 11. Angus Crichton 12. Sitili Tupouniua 13. Victor Radley 14. Adam Keighran 15. Siosiua Taukeiaho 16. Naufahu Whyte 17. Naufahu Whyte

TEAM TIPS:Luke Keary will return in Round 1 to partner Sam Walker in the halves. Keary explained he could have played in the club’s final pre-season trial. “I have had a really good last month. I did the full block pre-Christmas then I had three weeks off the start of January and back into it so I feel good” Keary told reporters on Wednesday. Walker must overcome a head knock suffered in the second trial. Joey Manu will make his return from a facial fracture in the centres. Kevin Naiqama is set to fill Brett Morris’ vacant No.5 jersey with Joseph Suaalii not due back from a foot injury until the early rounds. “I haven’t got a time frame yet but I know I will be back in the early rounds” Suaalii said. “I’m just being patient with my recovery and I should be back in the early rounds. I’m back running and in full training and everything I am supposed to be doing but I’m just giving myself time to get my body right and come back for the season ready to go.” The Roosters have a wave of players returning from injury however first-choice hooker Sam Verrills will miss Round 1 due to a suspension. Ben Marschke seems like the natural replacement however because he’s on a development contract he can’t play NRL before Round 11. New recruit Connor Watson will likely play hooker in Round 1 but is tipped ot play the bench utility role this season when Verrills returns. The quality signings of Watson and Paul Momirovski will show their skills in their new Tricolour jersey and the former Panthers centre slots into the centres to replace the retired Josh Morris. Forward recruit Renouf Atoni is unlikely to force his way into the side for Round 1 with Naufahu Whyte likely to take Egan Butcher’s bench spot after he was ruled out for a month with stress fractures in his foot. Prop Lindsay Collins waslucky to avoid suspension in the trials for a cannonball tackle on Tigers star Jackson Hastings and makes his way into the side after suffering the same ACL injury as Keary last year. Robinson may opt for the versatility of Adam Keighran on the bench in Round 1 if Watson does play hooker.

Predicted Knights team: 1. Kalyn Ponga 2. Enari Tuala 3. Dane Gagai 4. Bradman Best 5. Hymel Hunt 6. Jake Clifford 7. Adam Clune 8. Jacob Saifiti 9. Chris Randall 10. Daniel Saifiti 11. Tyson Frizell 12. Lachlan Fitzgibbon 13. Mitch Barnett 14. Kurt Mann 15. David Klemmer 16. Jirah Momoisea 17. Brodie Jones

TEAM TIPS: David Klemmer was demoted to the bench for much of last season in favour of the Saifiti brothers but on what he produced in the first trial against the Bulldogs he looks intent on getting his starting spot back in 2022. Klemmer had 92 metres a tackle bust an offload a linebreak assist and a try assist in a superb stint after starting for the Knights. The departure of veteran halfback Mitchell Pearce sees the Knights form a new-look halves combination of Jake Clifford and former Dragons playmaker Adam Clune. Dane Gagai also returns to Newcastle slotting into the centres to make a lethal pairing with young gun Bradman Best. Hymel Hunt will assume his spot outside of Best while Enari Tuala will likely take the other wing. However Edrick Lee fresh off signing a new one-year deal with the club could leapfrog Tauala if he can get his body right. Dominic Young is another option on the flank. After a devastating pre-season injury to Jayden Brailey Chris Randall will likely be the Knights’ starting hooker for the foreseeable future. Sauaso Sue will miss the opening round due to suspension meaning Mitch Barnett will likely shift to lock. Lachlan Fitzgibbon will come into the second row after recovering from a shoulder injury. Brodie Jones Jirah Momoisea and Kurt Mann — who will be Knights’ all-important utility round out the bench. Jack Johns is set to return from a shoulder injury in Round 1 but is unlikely to make the final 17.

New Zealand Warriors vs St George Illawarra Dragons at Sunshine Coast Stadium 5.30pm

Predicted Warriors team: 1. Channel Harris-Tavita 2. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak 3. Jesse Arthars 4. Rocco Berry 5. Marcelo Montoya 6. Kodi Nikorima 7. Shaun Johnson 8. Addin Fonua-Blake 9. Wayde Egan 10. Bunty Afoa 11. Eliesa Katoa 12. Euan Aitken 13. Bayley Sironen 14. Josh Curran 15. Jazz Tevaga 16. Ben Murdoch-Masila 17. Aaron Pene

TEAM TIPS: The biggest question for the Warriors in Round 1 is who will replace the suspended Reece Walsh who is out until Round 2 after he had the All Stars game counted as one of the games in his suspension. Channel Harris-Tavita is a leading candidate after he spent time at fullback in the trial win over the Storm. Harris-Tavita was solid while Kodi Nikorima outshone Ash Taylor at five-eighth and is the leading contender to partner Shaun Johnson in the halves. Their second trial against the Titans was cancelled due to the floods in Queensland so coach Nathan Brown didn’t get a second look at the problem. The team will look a little different in Round 1 with Walsh and Matt Lodge both suspended. Bunty Afoa is tipped to move into the starting side to replace Lodge. Centre Jesse Arthars has joined the club on a one-season loan deal and could start alongside Rocco Berry in Round 1 after impressing against the Storm. Another who impressed against Melbourne Bayley Sironen will likely start at lock while skipper Tohu Harris recovers from a knee injury that is expected to sideline him until mid-season.

Predicted Dragons team: 1. Tyrell Sloan 2. Cody Ramsey 3. Moses Suli 4. Zac Lomax 5. Mikaele Ravalawa 6. Talatau Amone 7. Ben Hunt 8. Francis Molo 9. Andrew McCullough 10. Aaron Woods 11. Jack Bird 12. Tariq Sims 13. Jack de Belin 14. Moses Mbye 15. Jaydn Su’A 16. George Burgess 17. Blake Lawrie

TEAM TIPS: It’s time for the Dragons’ next generation to make their mark. Tyrell Sloan and Cody Ramsey will battle for the No.1 jersey but we’re tipping coach Anthony Griffin to give Sloan the first shot and play Ramsey on the wing despite the pair switching in the trials. New recruit Moses Suli will join Zac Lomax to form a lethal centre pairing while the Feagai twins will keep the pressure on Mikaele Ravalawa throughout the season. However Max Feagai was forced off with an ankle injury in the first trial and is unlikely for Round 1. Talatau Amone is the frontrunner for five-eighth after some sensational form in the trials which will see new recruit Moses Mbye become the Red V’s supersub and Jayden Sullivan drop out of the 17. Ben Hunt returns from a broken arm that wiped him out of the final five games of last season. Griffin will add his recruits Aaron Woods Jaydn Su’A George Burgess and Francis Molo to the forward pack with plans to play Jack Bird as a second-rower or lock. Josh McGuire will be forced to watch on from the sidelines until Round 6 due to a lengthy ban.

Wests Tigers vs Melbourne Storm at CommBank Stadium 7.35pm

Predicted Tigers team: 1. Daine Laurie 2. David Nofoaluma 3. Oliver Gildart 4. James Roberts 5. Ken Maumalo 6. Jackson Hastings 7. Luke Brooks 8. Stefano Utoikamanu 9. Jake Simpkin 10. Alex Twal 11. Kelma Tuilagi 12. Luciano Leilua 13. Tyrone Peachey 14. Luke Garner 15. Joe Ofahengaue 16. Thomas Mikaele 17. Zane Musgrove

TEAM TIPS: Gun fullback Daine Laurie is back in action after suffering a nasty ankle injury in Round 20. The outside backs are set for some changes this season with English recruit Oliver Gildart joining the club as well new signing Starford To’a also in the mix. Gildart will likely come right into centres while veteran winger Ken Maumalo could be pushed into the centres too given other centre options Adam Doueihi and Tommy Talau are sidelined until mid-season with injuries. That would allow 21-year-old T’oa to play on the wing with Asu Kepaoa also sidelined until mid-season. Jackson Hastings starred in the second trial and will make his NRL return at five-eighth while Doueihi recovers from an ACL injury. The rumours about Luke Brooks joining the Knights are all but over and he will wear the No.7 jersey for the Tigers. Jacob Liddle will miss the first four-six weeks of the season after suffering a knee injury meaning Jake Simpkin will start while James Tamou will miss Round 1 after taking the early guilty plea for a dangerous tackle. Luke Garner will return to the line-up after suffering injuries late last season pairing Thomas Mikaele in the front row. The versatility of new recruit Tyrone Peachey won’t cost him a starting spot with the former Titan set to play at lock. Shawn Blore is out for the season with an ACL injury with his place on the bench set to be taken by Alex Seyfarth. Tigers rookie Brandon Webster-Mansfield suffered a hamstring injury against Manly but was unlikely to play in Round 1 anyway.

Predicted Storm team: 1. Nick Meaney 2. George Jennings 3. Reimis Smith 4. Justin Olam 5. Xavier Coates 6. Jayden Nikorima 7. Jahrome Hughes 8. Jesse Bromwich 9. Brandon Smith 10. Christian Welch 11. Felise Kaufusi 12. Tom Eisenhuth 13. Kenneath Bromwich 14. Trent Loiero 15. Josh King 16. Nelson Asofa-Solomona 17. Tepai Moeroa

TEAM TIPS: The Storm have been boosted by the availability of Brandon Smith after the NRL allowed him to serve his one match ban during the All Stars game in a loophole that was also exploited by Latrell Mitchell and Reece Walsh. Smith is set to play No.13 in 2022 but will likely play hooker in Round 1 due to Harry Grant’s suspension. The Storm will be starting third-string playmaker Jayden Nikorima at No. 6 after Cooper Johns hurt his shoulder in their final trial. That will see Tyran Wishart slot in at No. 9 with the always reliable Tom Eisenhuth to come into the back row. Young talent Sua Fa’alogo is another option in the halves. Fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen is in doubt for the start of the season and was recently spotted in a moon boot as Craig Bellamy confirmed he is looking at other options for Round 1. New recruit Nick Meaney will come in for Papenhuyzen while Bellamy flagged possibly playing Cameron Munster at fullback when he returns from suspension in Round 2. The Storm have several omissions for Round 1 including superstar five-eighth Munster and Chris Lewis who will all serve their one-match suspension for the infamous white powder incident during the off-season. Harry Grant is also suspended due to a crusher tackle in last season’s preliminary final. Tui Kamikamica has been stood down after being charged with assault. New signing Josh King is tipped to appear off the bench. Fellow new recruit Xavier Coates who scored on debut against the Warriors in the trial is expected to get first shot at replacing departed wingerJosh Addo-Carr buthe must overcome a head knock suffered in the second trial.

SUNDAY MARCH 13

Parramatta Eels vs Gold Coast Titans at CommBank Stadium 4.05pm

Predicted Eels team: 1. Clint Gutherson 2. Sean Russell 3. Will Penisini 4. Waqa Blake 5. Bailey Simonsson 6. Dylan Brown 7. Mitchell Moses 8. Reagan Campbell-Gillard 9. Reed Mahoney 10. Junior Paulo 11. Shaun Lane 12. Isaiah Papali’i 13. Nathan Brown 14. Ray Stone 15. Makahesi Makatoa 16. Oregon Kaufusi 17. Ryan Matterson

TEAM TIPS:Haze Dunster suffered a season-ending knee injury from a hip drop tackle which saw Dragons player Tyrell Fuimaono suspended. He will likely be replaced by Sean Russell with Maika Sivo out until mid-season. Marata Niukore won’t appear in Round 1 due to suspension. New signing Bailey Simonsson will slot onto the wing. Coach Brad Arthur often started Shaun Lane and used Ryan Matterson as an injection of energy off the bench last season and he will likely employ that tactic again. Ray Stone will play the utility role while Makahesi Makatoa will come onto the bench in Niukore’s absence. Dylan Brown and Mitchell Moses will make up the halves pairing coming into the season on the back of dominant trial form and Nathan Brown will again play lock. Reed Mahoney is expected to be good to go for Round 1 after returning from a shoulder injury in the trials.

Predicted Titans team: 1. Jayden Campbell 2. Phillip Sami 3. Brian Kelly 4. Patrick Herbert 5. Corey Thompson 6. AJ Brimson 7. Toby Sexton 8. Isaac Liu 9. Erin Clark 10. Moeaki Fotuaika 11. Kevin Proctor 12. David Fifita 13. Tino Fa’asuamaleaui 14. Tanah Boyd 15. Jarrod Wallace 16. Sam Lisone 17. Beau Fermor

TEAM TIPS:David Fifita (rib cartilage) has been cleared of any serious damage from the All Stars clash and will play in Round 1. AJ Brimson has confirmed his switch to five-eighth to allow room for young gun Jayden Campbell to line up at fullback. Brimson will partner four-game rookie Toby Sexton in a new-look halves combination. Tanah Boyd looked impressive at hooker in the trial against the Broncos and that could mean he takes the No.14 jersey over new recruit Will Smith who has been used as a utility in the past at the Eels. Erin Clark will slot into hooker and by all reports Phillip Sami has been impressive at training and is a good chance at cementing his spot on the wing. New recruit Isaac Liu could force veteran prop Jarrod Wallace to be bumped to the bench.

North Queensland Cowboys vs Canterbury Bulldogs at Queensland Country Bank Stadium 6.15pm

Predicted Cowboys team: 1. Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow 2. Kyle Feldt 3. Valentine Holmes 4. Peta Hiku 5. Murray Taulagi 6. Tom Dearden 7. Chad Townsend 8. Coen Hess 9. Reece Robson 10. Jordan McLean 11. Tom Gilbert 12. Heilum Luki 13. Jason Taumalolo 14. Jake Granville 15. Reuben Cotter 16. Mitchell Dunn 17. Connelly Lemuele

TEAM TIPS: Star back-rower Jason Taumalolo missed his side’s final trial but the Cowboys expect him to be fit for Round 1. “He has got a hamstring niggle” Cowboys coach Todd Payten said. “If it was Round 1 he would be right to play. But given his importance to our team it is not worth the risk. But he will be right against the Bulldogs in a couple of weeks time.” Meanwhile Cowboys assistant coach Dean Young told Sky Sports Radio’s Big Sports Breakfast that Taumalolo that the superstar will definitely play lock and return to playing big minutes after a disrupted 2021 which included coach Todd Payten trying to reduce his game time. “Last year Jason had a very disrupted season” Young said. “Jason’s best footy is when he gets his motor running and he’s going to be playing lock forward and playing a lot of minutes.” Valentine Holmes will make the permanent switch to left centre to allow Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow to carve up at fullback. It serves as a reality check for Holmes who joined the Cowboys on a bumper deal after a stint in the NFL. New recruit Peta Hiku will slot in at right centre while Mr. Reliable Kyle Feldt will sit on one wing and the Cowboys’ 2021 Player’s Player Murray Taulagi will line-up on the other. One of coach Todd Payten’s biggest decisions to make will be on his halves pairing. It’s expected big-money signing and premiership-winning $2 million halfback Chad Townsend will wear the No.7 jersey with Tom Dearden and Scott Drinkwater battling it out for the No.6. Todd Payten dropped the biggest hint yet that Dearden may get the nod with the former Broncos star starting the final trial match before the NRL season where he impressed in the No.6 jersey.

The Cowboys’ reigning Player of the Year Coen Hess will start up front after transitioning from an edge last season. Tom Gilbert and Heilum Luki are tipped to be the second row pair for Round 1. Connelly Lemuele impressed in the second row in the trial against the Rabbitohs and could find himself coming off the bench in the role in Round 1. Veteran Jake Granville will be North Queensland’s supersub with Reuben Cotter Mitchell Dunn and Ben Condon will be fighting for spots off the bench. Cotter was one of the Cowboys’ best last season before suffering a long-term foot injury and is pushing for a starting spot which could see Payten do some reshuffling to accommodate the future star. Jeremiah Nanai should see plenty of games this year but may have to bide his time.

Predicted Bulldogs team: 1. Matt Dufty 2. Josh Addo-Carr 3. Brent Naden 4. Aaron Schoupp 5. Jayden Okunbor 6. Matt Burton 7. Jake Averillo 8. Paul Vaughan 9. Jeremy Marshall-King 10. Luke Thompson 11. Jack Hetherington 12. Tevita Pangai Jr 13. Josh Jackson 14. Bailey Biondi-Odo 15. Corey Waddell 16. Ava Seumanufagai 17. Max King

TEAM TIPS:Matt Burton impressed in his side’s second trial and will wear the No.6 jersey but his halves partner is less known with Jake Averillo and Kyle Flanagan struggling in the trials. Brandon Wakeham showed plenty of spark but is down the halves pecking order at this stage. Averillo is the frontrunner to partner Burton at this stage. New recruits Matt Dufty Josh Addo-Carr Brent Naden Paul Vaughan and Tevita Pangai Jr all come into the 17. Wakeham and Bailey Biondi-Odo will push for the bench utility role. Raymond Fataila-Mariner is eyeing a Round 3 return from a long-term foot injury but given he hasn’t played since Round 2 last year. He’ll likely be eased back in off the bench when he does return meaning Corey Waddell gets the nod. Jack Hetherington was impressive when he got a taste of the second row in the final rounds of last season and coach Trent Barrett has since confirmed he’ll likely start the season there. Workhorse prop Ava Seumanufagai bounced between the starting side and the bench last year but Vaughan’s addition will likely see him come off the bench in Round 1. Max King Jackson Topine Chris Patolo and Joe Stimson will battle for a spot on the bench but King’s ability to cover prop lock and second row on top of his experience could edge him out as the winner. Aaron Schoupp underwent shoulder surgery during the off-season but will be right for Round 1 however second-rower Matt Doorey won’t be in the mix until later this season as he recovers from an ACL injury.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvcXVlc3RuZXdzL3Nwb3J0L2xhbmdlci10cm9waHktbGl2ZXN0cmVhbS1vZi1xdWFsaWZpZXJzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMTNlZGJhNmJmNGU4NWM3Mjc3NDVjNjRhMDRmZTA5OTDSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY291cmllcm1haWwuY29tLmF1L3F1ZXN0bmV3cy9zcG9ydC9sYW5nZXItdHJvcGh5LWxpdmVzdHJlYW0tb2YtcXVhbGlmaWVycy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzEzZWRiYTZiZjRlODVjNzI3NzQ1YzY0YTA0ZmUwOTkwP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Live stream: Schoolboys league ready for early kick off,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/sport/langer-trophy-livestream-of-qualifiers/news-story/13edba6bf4e85c727745c64a04fe0990 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvcXVlc3RuZXdzL3Nwb3J0L2xhbmdlci10cm9waHktbGl2ZXN0cmVhbS1vZi1xdWFsaWZpZXJzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMTNlZGJhNmJmNGU4NWM3Mjc3NDVjNjRhMDRmZTA5OTDSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY291cmllcm1haWwuY29tLmF1L3F1ZXN0bmV3cy9zcG9ydC9sYW5nZXItdHJvcGh5LWxpdmVzdHJlYW0tb2YtcXVhbGlmaWVycy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzEzZWRiYTZiZjRlODVjNzI3NzQ1YzY0YTA0ZmUwOTkwP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Going to be hard knowing I won’t see him again’: Devastated Border in tears over ‘top shelf’ Warne,"Allan Border has remembered Shane Warne as a “top shelf” man and Australia’s greatest bowler. Photo: News Corp

Shane Warne’s first Test captain Allan Border says the late spinner was Australia’s greatest bowler.

The world has been rocked by Warne’s sudden passing overnight.

Border - one of Australia’s greatest captains and a man who carried the side through their darkest era and into a bright new dawn - was notified of Warne’s death in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Unable to sleep the Queensland and Australian great spent the entire morning pacing around his home in Brisbane.

Border says he has been rocked to the core and is in disbelief so soon after Rod Marsh a modern great who changed the way wicket-keepers play the game also passed away on Friday after suffering a heart attack late last month.

“I’ve shed some tears over the last couple of days with Rod Marsh. It’s going to be hard getting through the next couple of days finally realising I’m not going to see Shane again” Border said.

“It’s just so sad.”

Border played a pivotal role in shaping Warne’s career.

The Australian skipper handed him his debut in 1992 against India before throwing him the ball against Sri Lanka when Warne had struggled and the game was on the line.

After taking just one wicket in his first two-and-a-half Tests Border on the back of Greg Matthews’ suggestion called on Warne in Colombo when Sri Lanka was on track for a famous win.

The inspired piece of captaincy worked wonders as Warne took 3-11 from 5.1 overs to see Australia defeat Sri Lanka by 16 runs.

From then Warne was off and running.

“Greg Matthews was bowling well and I think it was he who prompted me and said ‘Why don’t you give the leg-spinner a go?’ I thought upon it and said ‘yeah OK’” Border recalled.

“I threw Warnie the ball and boom boom boom three wickets in a couple of overs and job done and we won the Test match we shouldn’t have won.

“I think from that point Warnie gained a lot of confidence.

“He talks about that being the real turning point as a cricketer.

“He wasn’t sure how good he was. Well we soon found out didn’t we?”

Although Warne could get people out “even before they walked to the crease” Border says initially that was far from the case.

“He was just your basic club leg-spinner but could really land them and really spun them hard” Border said.

“Initially he was just very naive but it didn’t take long I’m talking in 12 months he just got better and better and the psychological side of his game started to come to the fore.

“He was a smart guy Warnie. He knew how to push buttons. Some guys were out before they even went out to bat.

“He was a special special character and cricketer and a great man off the field don’t worry about the public persona that’s Warnie doing his thing. But he was a top shelf man.”

While Donald Bradman is widely regarded as the game’s greatest cricket for his average of 99.94 Warne was named as one of Wisden’s cricketers of the 20th century despite only being halfway through his career when he was selected.

The other cricketers were Bradman Garfield Sobers Jack Hobbs and Viv Richards.

Border who played alongside Dennis Lillee and Glenn McGrath says Warne topped the charts.

“He’s on that (Bradman) level” Border said.

“Sir Donald Bradman was a batsman he’s our best batsman.

“But who’s our best bowler? That starts an interesting debate: Lillee and McGrath but Warne’s got to be our best bowler ever.

“When Shane Warne was in the Australian cricket team Australia wins Test matches. It was the same with Bradman.”

REACTION: Cricket world reacts with shock and sorrow as ‘Warney’ dead at 52

Warne took 708 Test wickets with 195 of them coming in Ashes matches.

Border turned to the leg-spinner at Old Trafford after England had got off to a strong start in response to Australia’s first-innings score of 289 in the first Test in 1993.

With the home side 1-79 Warne broke through with his first ball on English soil by bowling Mike Gatting for four. The ball instantly became known as the Gatting Ball.

“Warne to Gatting how good is that” Border recalled.

“That’s his first ball he’s ever bowled in England incredible. I knew from that moment we were going to win the series.”

Border said Warne revitalised his Test captaincy and made leading fun.

“It just refreshed my captaincy” Border said.

“We went through that period and era where we didn’t have any real strong options we had a few but when Warne came along it was a fun time to be the captain.

“Every time you threw Warne the ball you knew something was going to happen.

“It was just special as a captain to be able to make positive decisions out on the field rather than try to plug holes. He was great for me as a captain and great for the game.”

More than the wickets that he took and the matches he won Border said recalling the joy and memories of the past was the “secret” to getting past the tragedy.

He described Warne was a “top-shelf man”.

“I’ve done it tough” Border said a day after Marsh’s passing.

“We’re talking about two of the very top shelf of people and cricketers and to go back-to-back it’s knocked everyone about.

Adam Reynolds is reportedly a chance of making a shock comeback from Covid-19 in time to make his Broncos debut in Round 1.

Reynolds and teammate Kobe Hetherington were ruled out of the Rabbitohs clash after returning a positive PCR test result.

However News Corprevealed on Friday that the duo could take their place in Brisbane’s 17.

After serving the mandatory government-issued seven-day isolation period NRL players can undergo further testing on the eighth day effectively making Reynolds and Hetherington unavailable for Round 1.

But the NRL has no restrictions on when a player returns after serving the seven days — instead that call is in the hands of each club according to News Corp.

The Broncos implemented an 11-day program for players that test positive this season in January however football director Ben Ikin confirmed to News Corp that Reynolds could be in the mix for Round 1.

Meanwhile a Cowboys assistant coach has revealed the plans for superstar Jason Taumalolo and there’s mixed news for the Roosters..

Read below for Foxsports.com.au’s Round 1 team tips!!

THURSDAY MARCH 10

Penrith Panthers vs Manly Sea Eagles at Bluebet Stadium 8.05pm

Predicted Panthers team: 1. Dylan Edwards 2. Charlie Staines 3. Stephen Crichton 4. Izack Tago 5. Brian To’o 6. Jarome Luai 7. Nathan Cleary 8. Moses Leota 9. Apisai Koroisau 10. James Fisher-Harris 11. Viliame Kikau 12. Liam Martin 13. Isaah Yeo 14. Mitch Kenny 15. Scott Sorensen 16. Spencer Leniu 17. J’maine Hopgood

TEAM TIPS: The Panthers will be sweating on their star halfback Nathan Cleary after he underwent shoulder surgery during the off-season. Cleary is desperate to play in Round 1 but should coach and dad Ivan decide to take it slow it’ll be new recruit Sean O’Sullivan stepping in to replace him. After starting last season on the wing and then being axed Charlie Staines who played fullback in the trial against the Sharks is expected to get another chance on the wing with Stephen Crichton shifting back to his native centre role after Paul Momirovski’s departure. Young gun Izack Tago is tipped to replace Matt Burton in the centres while youngster J’maine Hopgood could snatch a spot on the bench. Viliame Kikau will also return to the starting team after playing an explosive role off the bench late last season. Dylan Edwards and James Fisher-Harris will be back to full fitness after carrying injuries in the grand final. Preston Riki is out until mid-season with a hip injury.

Predicted Sea Eagles team: 1. Tom Trbojevic 2. Jason Saab 3. Brad Parker 4. Morgan Harper 5. Reuben Garrick 6. Kieran Foran 7. Daly Cherry-Evans 8. Taniela Paseka 9. Lachlan Croker 10. Martin Taupau 11. Ethan Bullemor 12. Karl Lawton 13. Jake Trbojevic 14. Dylan Walker 15. Sean Keppie 16. Andrew Davey 17. Toafofoa Sipley

TEAM TIPS: Haumole Olakau’atu injured his elbow in the final trial and is expected to miss Round 1 which will see Broncos recruit Ethan Bullemor into the starting side and Andrew Davey on the bench. Josh Schuster will miss the opening rounds due to an ankle injury with Karl Lawton tipped to come into the back row. Josh Aloiai will miss the season-opener due to a three-game suspension. Kieran Foran pairs Daly Cherry-Evans in the ever-solid Manly halves while Lachlan Croker retains his No.9 jersey. The versatile Dylan Walker will once again play the important bench utility role after being re-signed in the off-season and Toafofa Sipley will be on the bench. Tom Trbojevic will be wearing the fullback jersey after he made a brilliant first appearance in the trial win over the Tigers with speedster Jason Saab on one wing and goal-kicker Reuben Garrick on the other.

FRIDAY MARCH 11

Canberra Raiders vs Cronulla Sharks at GIO Stadium 6.00pm

Predicted Raiders team: 1. Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad 2. Nick Cotric 3. Jarrod Croker 4. Matthew Timoko 5. Semi Valemei 6. Jack Wighton 7. Brad Schneider 8. Josh Papalii 9. Josh Hodgson 10. Joe Tapine 11. Hudson Young 12. Elliott Whitehead 13. Adam Elliott 14. Tom Starling 15. Ryan Sutton 16. Corey Horsburgh 17. Corey Harawira-Naera

TEAM TIPS: Coach Ricky Stuart said he wants to ease teenage sensation Xavier Savage into the NRL which means Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad will start at fullback in Round 1. But it remains a very tough call for Stuart. That selection should see veteran Jarrod Croker start in the centres following his career-saving knee operation in October. Elliott Whitehead is due back in the trials and is expected to play in Round 1. All eyes will be on the Raiders’ new-look halves combination come Round 1 after a cruel injury to recruit Jamal Fogarty which will see young gun Brad Schneider slot into halfback. “I am going to play Brad Schneider” Stuart told News Corp. “I promised these kids that if they give us an opportunity to develop them I will give them an opportunity to play NRL and show me they are NRL players. Adam Elliott also made the move to Canberra over the off-season and is expected to start at lock. Despite the club’s decision not to offer Josh Hodgson a new deal beyond this season coach Ricky Stuart is still expected to start the veteran and then shift him to lock when Tom Starling comes on to run amok out of dummy-half. Meanwhile Corey Horsburgh has returned to contact training after shoulder surgery and is aiming to be fit for the Raiders’ first game. Nick Cotric is a welcomed return after one season with the Bulldogs and will slot back in on the wing with Harley Smith-Shields out for the season with an ACL injury. Flyer Semi Valemei will come onto the wing for the suspended Jordan Rapana who is out until Round 3. Raiders recruit Peter Hola suffered suspected medial ligament damage against the Roosters and faces time on the sidelines.

Predicted Sharks team: 1. Will Kennedy 2. Ronaldo Mulitalo 3. Connor Tracey 4. Jesse Ramien 5. Sione Katoa 6. Matt Moylan 7. Nicho Hynes 8. Toby Rudolf 9. Blayke Brailey 10. Braden Hamlin-Uele 11. Briton Nikora 12. Siosifa Talakai 13. Dale Finucane 14. Luke Metcalf 15. Andrew Fifita 16. Aiden Tolman 17. Royce Hunt

TEAM TIPS: Skipper Wade Graham has a fresh injury and will miss the first month of the season. Graham was only just back to full fitness after missing a chunk of last season due to repeated concussions but suffered a syndesmosis injury in the club’s final pre-season clash. A careless high tackle in the first trial against the Panthers cost playmaker Braydon Trindall his shot at partnering Nicho Hynes in the halves in Round 1. Trindall is suspended for the first two rounds which will see Matt Moylan wear the No. 6 jumper with Luke Metcalf coming off the bench. Versatile utility Siosifa Talakai suffered a head knock against the Panthers but should be fit for Round 1. It’s a new era for the Sharks under rookie NRL coach Craig Fitzgibbon. He’ll have the handy additions of Hynes and Dale Finucane though to help make his first season in the Shire a success. Fitzgibbon has already confirmed that Hynes was signed as a half despite a breakout season at fullback last year for the Storm. Cameron McInnes will miss the first month of the season after undergoing a minor operation on the same knee that required reconstructive surgery last year. Finuncane will play lock allowing prop Braden Hamlin-Uele to come into the starting side and Andrew Fifita to grab a spot on the bench while Royce Hunt also makes the pine after impressive form in the trials. Fitzgibbon recently hinted at a Ronaldo Mulitalo-Connor Tracey combination on an edge while we’re tipping Sione Katoa to beat recruit Matt Ikuvalu for a spot on the wing. Blayke Brailey will be the hooker.

Brisbane Broncos vs South Sydney Rabbitohs at Suncorp Stadium 8.05pm

Predicted Broncos team: 1. Selwyn Cobbo 2. Corey Oates 3. Kotoni Staggs 4. Herbie Farnworth 5. Jamayne Isaako 6. Billy Walters 7. Albert Kelly 8. Ryan James 9. Jake Turpin 10. Payne Haas 11. Kurt Capewell 12. Jordan Riki 13. Patrick Carrigan 14. Cory Paix 15. Rhys Kennedy 16. TC Robati 17. Keenan Palasia

TEAM TIPS: Superstar recruit Adam Reynolds and young gun Kobe Hetherington have tested positive to Covid-19. They were ruled out of the game however News Corp reports there’s still a chance Reynolds could play. Meanwhile Herbie Farnworth Tyson Gamble and Albert Kelly must be cleared by Brisbane medicos to play Round 1 according to News Corp. Should he recover in time and pass protocols Kelly and Billy Walters loom as the most likely halves pairing for Round 1. Tesi Niu will miss the opening rounds of the season due to injury which will see trials standout Selwyn Cobbo start the season-opener at fullback. Jake Turpin is tipped to start at hooker withCory Paixon the bench. There’s a big question mark over Brisbane’s halves pairing with the No.6 jersey already up for grabs — plus Reynolds’ covid result. Albert Kelly’s experience should get him into the side but coach Kevin Walters said last week he could take family out of the decision which could open the door for his son Billy. There’s also teen gun Ezra Mam in the mix. “There’s a battle on there (for the No.6); I’ve got some ideas in my head but nothing’s over the line. You take the family side out of it; normally I’m a very fair person and I’ll be fair across the board.” Thomas Flegler and one-game rookie Brendan Piakura won’t play Round 1 due to suspensions while Xavier Willison is looking at a mid-season return from a knee injury. New recruit Ryan James will likely fill in for Flegler. Patrick Carrigan returned against the Titans after tearing his ACL in Round 9 last season while Payne Haas (ankle) is set to be fit to play after returning against the Cowboys in the Broncos’ final trial.

Predicted Rabbitohs team: 1. Blake Taffe 2. Alex Johnston 3. Jaxson Paulo 4. Campbell Graham 5. Josh Mansour 6. Cody Walker 7. Lachlan Ilias 8. Mark Nichols 9. Damien Cook 10. Tevita Tatola 11. Keaon Koloamatangi 12. Jai Arrow 13. Cameron Murray 14. Siliva Havili 15. Jacob Host 16. Thomas Burgess 17. Michael Chee-Kam

TEAM TIPS: South Sydney’s new captain Cameron Murray is touch-and-go after undergoing the same surgery Nathan Cleary did during the off-season. Murray is “confident” he’ll be back for Round 1 but just like Cleary he doesn’t want to rush it either. With Latrell Mitchell out suspended until Round 2 Blake Taaffe will hold onto the No.1 jumper while Jaxson Paulo will likely get the first opportunity to nail down Dane Gagai’s vacant centre spot. Josh Mansour will take Paulo’s spot on the wing. Jacob Gagai impressed in the trial against the Cowboys and should debut at some point in 2022 but it is unlikely to be in Round 1. New head coach Jason Demetriou has confirmed Lachlan Ilias will replace Adam Reynolds in the halves. Versatile forward Jai Arrow will come into the back row for the departed Jaydn Su’A while recruit Michael Chee-Kam will likely replace Liam Knight on the bench with the latter missing the first month of the competition after undergoing three off-season surgeries. Recruit Siliva Havili will likely play the utility role that Taaffe is tipped to switch to when Mitchell returns. Isaiah Tass is due back from a back injury in Round 1 but is unlikely to make the 17.

SATURDAY MARCH 12

Sydney Roosters vs Newcastle Knights at Sydney Cricket Ground 3.00pm

Predicted Roosters team: 1. James Tedesco 2. Daniel Tupou 3. Paul Momirovski 4. Joseph Manu 5. Kevin Naiqama 6. Luke Keary 7. Sam Walker 8. Jared Waerea-Hargreaves 9. Connor Watson 10. Lindsay Collins 11. Angus Crichton 12. Sitili Tupouniua 13. Victor Radley 14. Adam Keighran 15. Siosiua Taukeiaho 16. Naufahu Whyte 17. Naufahu Whyte

TEAM TIPS:Luke Keary will return in Round 1 to partner Sam Walker in the halves. Keary explained he could have played in the club’s final pre-season trial. “I have had a really good last month. I did the full block pre-Christmas then I had three weeks off the start of January and back into it so I feel good” Keary told reporters on Wednesday. Walker must overcome a head knock suffered in the second trial. Joey Manu will make his return from a facial fracture in the centres. Kevin Naiqama is set to fill Brett Morris’ vacant No.5 jersey with Joseph Suaalii not due back from a foot injury until the early rounds. “I haven’t got a time frame yet but I know I will be back in the early rounds” Suaalii said. “I’m just being patient with my recovery and I should be back in the early rounds. I’m back running and in full training and everything I am supposed to be doing but I’m just giving myself time to get my body right and come back for the season ready to go.” The Roosters have a wave of players returning from injury however first-choice hooker Sam Verrills will miss Round 1 due to a suspension. Ben Marschke seems like the natural replacement however because he’s on a development contract he can’t play NRL before Round 11. New recruit Connor Watson will likely play hooker in Round 1 but is tipped ot play the bench utility role this season when Verrills returns. The quality signings of Watson and Paul Momirovski will show their skills in their new Tricolour jersey and the former Panthers centre slots into the centres to replace the retired Josh Morris. Forward recruit Renouf Atoni is unlikely to force his way into the side for Round 1 with Naufahu Whyte likely to take Egan Butcher’s bench spot after he was ruled out for a month with stress fractures in his foot. Prop Lindsay Collins waslucky to avoid suspension in the trials for a cannonball tackle on Tigers star Jackson Hastings and makes his way into the side after suffering the same ACL injury as Keary last year. Robinson may opt for the versatility of Adam Keighran on the bench in Round 1 if Watson does play hooker.

Predicted Knights team: 1. Kalyn Ponga 2. Enari Tuala 3. Dane Gagai 4. Bradman Best 5. Hymel Hunt 6. Jake Clifford 7. Adam Clune 8. Jacob Saifiti 9. Chris Randall 10. Daniel Saifiti 11. Tyson Frizell 12. Lachlan Fitzgibbon 13. Mitch Barnett 14. Kurt Mann 15. David Klemmer 16. Jirah Momoisea 17. Brodie Jones

TEAM TIPS: David Klemmer was demoted to the bench for much of last season in favour of the Saifiti brothers but on what he produced in the first trial against the Bulldogs he looks intent on getting his starting spot back in 2022. Klemmer had 92 metres a tackle bust an offload a linebreak assist and a try assist in a superb stint after starting for the Knights. The departure of veteran halfback Mitchell Pearce sees the Knights form a new-look halves combination of Jake Clifford and former Dragons playmaker Adam Clune. Dane Gagai also returns to Newcastle slotting into the centres to make a lethal pairing with young gun Bradman Best. Hymel Hunt will assume his spot outside of Best while Enari Tuala will likely take the other wing. However Edrick Lee fresh off signing a new one-year deal with the club could leapfrog Tauala if he can get his body right. Dominic Young is another option on the flank. After a devastating pre-season injury to Jayden Brailey Chris Randall will likely be the Knights’ starting hooker for the foreseeable future. Sauaso Sue will miss the opening round due to suspension meaning Mitch Barnett will likely shift to lock. Lachlan Fitzgibbon will come into the second row after recovering from a shoulder injury. Brodie Jones Jirah Momoisea and Kurt Mann — who will be Knights’ all-important utility round out the bench. Jack Johns is set to return from a shoulder injury in Round 1 but is unlikely to make the final 17.

New Zealand Warriors vs St George Illawarra Dragons at Sunshine Coast Stadium 5.30pm

Predicted Warriors team: 1. Channel Harris-Tavita 2. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak 3. Jesse Arthars 4. Rocco Berry 5. Marcelo Montoya 6. Kodi Nikorima 7. Shaun Johnson 8. Addin Fonua-Blake 9. Wayde Egan 10. Bunty Afoa 11. Eliesa Katoa 12. Euan Aitken 13. Bayley Sironen 14. Josh Curran 15. Jazz Tevaga 16. Ben Murdoch-Masila 17. Aaron Pene

TEAM TIPS: The biggest question for the Warriors in Round 1 is who will replace the suspended Reece Walsh who is out until Round 2 after he had the All Stars game counted as one of the games in his suspension. Channel Harris-Tavita is a leading candidate after he spent time at fullback in the trial win over the Storm. Harris-Tavita was solid while Kodi Nikorima outshone Ash Taylor at five-eighth and is the leading contender to partner Shaun Johnson in the halves. Their second trial against the Titans was cancelled due to the floods in Queensland so coach Nathan Brown didn’t get a second look at the problem. The team will look a little different in Round 1 with Walsh and Matt Lodge both suspended. Bunty Afoa is tipped to move into the starting side to replace Lodge. Centre Jesse Arthars has joined the club on a one-season loan deal and could start alongside Rocco Berry in Round 1 after impressing against the Storm. Another who impressed against Melbourne Bayley Sironen will likely start at lock while skipper Tohu Harris recovers from a knee injury that is expected to sideline him until mid-season.

Predicted Dragons team: 1. Tyrell Sloan 2. Cody Ramsey 3. Moses Suli 4. Zac Lomax 5. Mikaele Ravalawa 6. Talatau Amone 7. Ben Hunt 8. Francis Molo 9. Andrew McCullough 10. Aaron Woods 11. Jack Bird 12. Tariq Sims 13. Jack de Belin 14. Moses Mbye 15. Jaydn Su’A 16. George Burgess 17. Blake Lawrie

TEAM TIPS: It’s time for the Dragons’ next generation to make their mark. Tyrell Sloan and Cody Ramsey will battle for the No.1 jersey but we’re tipping coach Anthony Griffin to give Sloan the first shot and play Ramsey on the wing despite the pair switching in the trials. New recruit Moses Suli will join Zac Lomax to form a lethal centre pairing while the Feagai twins will keep the pressure on Mikaele Ravalawa throughout the season. However Max Feagai was forced off with an ankle injury in the first trial and is unlikely for Round 1. Talatau Amone is the frontrunner for five-eighth after some sensational form in the trials which will see new recruit Moses Mbye become the Red V’s supersub and Jayden Sullivan drop out of the 17. Ben Hunt returns from a broken arm that wiped him out of the final five games of last season. Griffin will add his recruits Aaron Woods Jaydn Su’A George Burgess and Francis Molo to the forward pack with plans to play Jack Bird as a second-rower or lock. Josh McGuire will be forced to watch on from the sidelines until Round 6 due to a lengthy ban.

Wests Tigers vs Melbourne Storm at CommBank Stadium 7.35pm

Predicted Tigers team: 1. Daine Laurie 2. David Nofoaluma 3. Oliver Gildart 4. James Roberts 5. Ken Maumalo 6. Jackson Hastings 7. Luke Brooks 8. Stefano Utoikamanu 9. Jake Simpkin 10. Alex Twal 11. Kelma Tuilagi 12. Luciano Leilua 13. Tyrone Peachey 14. Luke Garner 15. Joe Ofahengaue 16. Thomas Mikaele 17. Zane Musgrove

TEAM TIPS: Gun fullback Daine Laurie is back in action after suffering a nasty ankle injury in Round 20. The outside backs are set for some changes this season with English recruit Oliver Gildart joining the club as well new signing Starford To’a also in the mix. Gildart will likely come right into centres while veteran winger Ken Maumalo could be pushed into the centres too given other centre options Adam Doueihi and Tommy Talau are sidelined until mid-season with injuries. That would allow 21-year-old T’oa to play on the wing with Asu Kepaoa also sidelined until mid-season. Jackson Hastings starred in the second trial and will make his NRL return at five-eighth while Doueihi recovers from an ACL injury. The rumours about Luke Brooks joining the Knights are all but over and he will wear the No.7 jersey for the Tigers. Jacob Liddle will miss the first four-six weeks of the season after suffering a knee injury meaning Jake Simpkin will start while James Tamou will miss Round 1 after taking the early guilty plea for a dangerous tackle. Luke Garner will return to the line-up after suffering injuries late last season pairing Thomas Mikaele in the front row. The versatility of new recruit Tyrone Peachey won’t cost him a starting spot with the former Titan set to play at lock. Shawn Blore is out for the season with an ACL injury with his place on the bench set to be taken by Alex Seyfarth. Tigers rookie Brandon Webster-Mansfield suffered a hamstring injury against Manly but was unlikely to play in Round 1 anyway.

Predicted Storm team: 1. Nick Meaney 2. George Jennings 3. Reimis Smith 4. Justin Olam 5. Xavier Coates 6. Jayden Nikorima 7. Jahrome Hughes 8. Jesse Bromwich 9. Brandon Smith 10. Christian Welch 11. Felise Kaufusi 12. Tom Eisenhuth 13. Kenneath Bromwich 14. Trent Loiero 15. Josh King 16. Nelson Asofa-Solomona 17. Tepai Moeroa

TEAM TIPS: The Storm have been boosted by the availability of Brandon Smith after the NRL allowed him to serve his one match ban during the All Stars game in a loophole that was also exploited by Latrell Mitchell and Reece Walsh. Smith is set to play No.13 in 2022 but will likely play hooker in Round 1 due to Harry Grant’s suspension. The Storm will be starting third-string playmaker Jayden Nikorima at No. 6 after Cooper Johns hurt his shoulder in their final trial. That will see Tyran Wishart slot in at No. 9 with the always reliable Tom Eisenhuth to come into the back row. Young talent Sua Fa’alogo is another option in the halves. Fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen is in doubt for the start of the season and was recently spotted in a moon boot as Craig Bellamy confirmed he is looking at other options for Round 1. New recruit Nick Meaney will come in for Papenhuyzen while Bellamy flagged possibly playing Cameron Munster at fullback when he returns from suspension in Round 2. The Storm have several omissions for Round 1 including superstar five-eighth Munster and Chris Lewis who will all serve their one-match suspension for the infamous white powder incident during the off-season. Harry Grant is also suspended due to a crusher tackle in last season’s preliminary final. Tui Kamikamica has been stood down after being charged with assault. New signing Josh King is tipped to appear off the bench. Fellow new recruit Xavier Coates who scored on debut against the Warriors in the trial is expected to get first shot at replacing departed wingerJosh Addo-Carr buthe must overcome a head knock suffered in the second trial.

SUNDAY MARCH 13

Parramatta Eels vs Gold Coast Titans at CommBank Stadium 4.05pm

Predicted Eels team: 1. Clint Gutherson 2. Sean Russell 3. Will Penisini 4. Waqa Blake 5. Bailey Simonsson 6. Dylan Brown 7. Mitchell Moses 8. Reagan Campbell-Gillard 9. Reed Mahoney 10. Junior Paulo 11. Shaun Lane 12. Isaiah Papali’i 13. Nathan Brown 14. Ray Stone 15. Makahesi Makatoa 16. Oregon Kaufusi 17. Ryan Matterson

TEAM TIPS:Haze Dunster suffered a season-ending knee injury from a hip drop tackle which saw Dragons player Tyrell Fuimaono suspended. He will likely be replaced by Sean Russell with Maika Sivo out until mid-season. Marata Niukore won’t appear in Round 1 due to suspension. New signing Bailey Simonsson will slot onto the wing. Coach Brad Arthur often started Shaun Lane and used Ryan Matterson as an injection of energy off the bench last season and he will likely employ that tactic again. Ray Stone will play the utility role while Makahesi Makatoa will come onto the bench in Niukore’s absence. Dylan Brown and Mitchell Moses will make up the halves pairing coming into the season on the back of dominant trial form and Nathan Brown will again play lock. Reed Mahoney is expected to be good to go for Round 1 after returning from a shoulder injury in the trials.

Predicted Titans team: 1. Jayden Campbell 2. Phillip Sami 3. Brian Kelly 4. Patrick Herbert 5. Corey Thompson 6. AJ Brimson 7. Toby Sexton 8. Isaac Liu 9. Erin Clark 10. Moeaki Fotuaika 11. Kevin Proctor 12. David Fifita 13. Tino Fa’asuamaleaui 14. Tanah Boyd 15. Jarrod Wallace 16. Sam Lisone 17. Beau Fermor

TEAM TIPS:David Fifita (rib cartilage) has been cleared of any serious damage from the All Stars clash and will play in Round 1. AJ Brimson has confirmed his switch to five-eighth to allow room for young gun Jayden Campbell to line up at fullback. Brimson will partner four-game rookie Toby Sexton in a new-look halves combination. Tanah Boyd looked impressive at hooker in the trial against the Broncos and that could mean he takes the No.14 jersey over new recruit Will Smith who has been used as a utility in the past at the Eels. Erin Clark will slot into hooker and by all reports Phillip Sami has been impressive at training and is a good chance at cementing his spot on the wing. New recruit Isaac Liu could force veteran prop Jarrod Wallace to be bumped to the bench.

North Queensland Cowboys vs Canterbury Bulldogs at Queensland Country Bank Stadium 6.15pm

Predicted Cowboys team: 1. Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow 2. Kyle Feldt 3. Valentine Holmes 4. Peta Hiku 5. Murray Taulagi 6. Tom Dearden 7. Chad Townsend 8. Coen Hess 9. Reece Robson 10. Jordan McLean 11. Tom Gilbert 12. Heilum Luki 13. Jason Taumalolo 14. Jake Granville 15. Reuben Cotter 16. Mitchell Dunn 17. Connelly Lemuele

TEAM TIPS: Star back-rower Jason Taumalolo missed his side’s final trial but the Cowboys expect him to be fit for Round 1. “He has got a hamstring niggle” Cowboys coach Todd Payten said. “If it was Round 1 he would be right to play. But given his importance to our team it is not worth the risk. But he will be right against the Bulldogs in a couple of weeks time.” Meanwhile Cowboys assistant coach Dean Young told Sky Sports Radio’s Big Sports Breakfast that Taumalolo that the superstar will definitely play lock and return to playing big minutes after a disrupted 2021 which included coach Todd Payten trying to reduce his game time. “Last year Jason had a very disrupted season” Young said. “Jason’s best footy is when he gets his motor running and he’s going to be playing lock forward and playing a lot of minutes.” Valentine Holmes will make the permanent switch to left centre to allow Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow to carve up at fullback. It serves as a reality check for Holmes who joined the Cowboys on a bumper deal after a stint in the NFL. New recruit Peta Hiku will slot in at right centre while Mr. Reliable Kyle Feldt will sit on one wing and the Cowboys’ 2021 Player’s Player Murray Taulagi will line-up on the other. One of coach Todd Payten’s biggest decisions to make will be on his halves pairing. It’s expected big-money signing and premiership-winning $2 million halfback Chad Townsend will wear the No.7 jersey with Tom Dearden and Scott Drinkwater battling it out for the No.6. Todd Payten dropped the biggest hint yet that Dearden may get the nod with the former Broncos star starting the final trial match before the NRL season where he impressed in the No.6 jersey.

The Cowboys’ reigning Player of the Year Coen Hess will start up front after transitioning from an edge last season. Tom Gilbert and Heilum Luki are tipped to be the second row pair for Round 1. Connelly Lemuele impressed in the second row in the trial against the Rabbitohs and could find himself coming off the bench in the role in Round 1. Veteran Jake Granville will be North Queensland’s supersub with Reuben Cotter Mitchell Dunn and Ben Condon will be fighting for spots off the bench. Cotter was one of the Cowboys’ best last season before suffering a long-term foot injury and is pushing for a starting spot which could see Payten do some reshuffling to accommodate the future star. Jeremiah Nanai should see plenty of games this year but may have to bide his time.

Luke Thompson 11. Jack Hetherington 12. Tevita Pangai Jr 13. Josh Jackson 14. Bailey Biondi-Odo 15. Corey Waddell 16. Ava Seumanufagai 17. Max King

TEAM TIPS:Matt Burton impressed in his side’s second trial and will wear the No.6 jersey but his halves partner is less known with Jake Averillo and Kyle Flanagan struggling in the trials. Brandon Wakeham showed plenty of spark but is down the halves pecking order at this stage. Averillo is the frontrunner to partner Burton at this stage. New recruits Matt Dufty Josh Addo-Carr Brent Naden Paul Vaughan and Tevita Pangai Jr all come into the 17. Wakeham and Bailey Biondi-Odo will push for the bench utility role. Raymond Fataila-Mariner is eyeing a Round 3 return from a long-term foot injury but given he hasn’t played since Round 2 last year. He’ll likely be eased back in off the bench when he does return meaning Corey Waddell gets the nod. Jack Hetherington was impressive when he got a taste of the second row in the final rounds of last season and coach Trent Barrett has since confirmed he’ll likely start the season there. Workhorse prop Ava Seumanufagai bounced between the starting side and the bench last year but Vaughan’s addition will likely see him come off the bench in Round 1. Max King Jackson Topine Chris Patolo and Joe Stimson will battle for a spot on the bench but King’s ability to cover prop lock and second row on top of his experience could edge him out as the winner. Aaron Schoupp underwent shoulder surgery during the off-season but will be right for Round 1 however second-rower Matt Doorey won’t be in the mix until later this season as he recovers from an ACL injury.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvcXVlc3RuZXdzL3Nwb3J0L2xhbmdlci10cm9waHktbGl2ZXN0cmVhbS1vZi1xdWFsaWZpZXJzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMTNlZGJhNmJmNGU4NWM3Mjc3NDVjNjRhMDRmZTA5OTDSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY291cmllcm1haWwuY29tLmF1L3F1ZXN0bmV3cy9zcG9ydC9sYW5nZXItdHJvcGh5LWxpdmVzdHJlYW0tb2YtcXVhbGlmaWVycy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzEzZWRiYTZiZjRlODVjNzI3NzQ1YzY0YTA0ZmUwOTkwP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Live stream: Schoolboys league ready for early kick off,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/sport/langer-trophy-livestream-of-qualifiers/news-story/13edba6bf4e85c727745c64a04fe0990 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvcXVlc3RuZXdzL3Nwb3J0L2xhbmdlci10cm9waHktbGl2ZXN0cmVhbS1vZi1xdWFsaWZpZXJzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMTNlZGJhNmJmNGU4NWM3Mjc3NDVjNjRhMDRmZTA5OTDSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY291cmllcm1haWwuY29tLmF1L3F1ZXN0bmV3cy9zcG9ydC9sYW5nZXItdHJvcGh5LWxpdmVzdHJlYW0tb2YtcXVhbGlmaWVycy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzEzZWRiYTZiZjRlODVjNzI3NzQ1YzY0YTA0ZmUwOTkwP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Going to be hard knowing I won’t see him again’: Devastated Border in tears over ‘top shelf’ Warne,"Allan Border has remembered Shane Warne as a “top shelf” man and Australia’s greatest bowler. Photo: News Corp

Shane Warne’s first Test captain Allan Border says the late spinner was Australia’s greatest bowler.

The world has been rocked by Warne’s sudden passing overnight.

Border - one of Australia’s greatest captains and a man who carried the side through their darkest era and into a bright new dawn - was notified of Warne’s death in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Unable to sleep the Queensland and Australian great spent the entire morning pacing around his home in Brisbane.

Border says he has been rocked to the core and is in disbelief so soon after Rod Marsh a modern great who changed the way wicket-keepers play the game also passed away on Friday after suffering a heart attack late last month.

“I’ve shed some tears over the last couple of days with Rod Marsh. It’s going to be hard getting through the next couple of days finally realising I’m not going to see Shane again” Border said.

“It’s just so sad.”

Border played a pivotal role in shaping Warne’s career.

The Australian skipper handed him his debut in 1992 against India before throwing him the ball against Sri Lanka when Warne had struggled and the game was on the line.

After taking just one wicket in his first two-and-a-half Tests Border on the back of Greg Matthews’ suggestion called on Warne in Colombo when Sri Lanka was on track for a famous win.

The inspired piece of captaincy worked wonders as Warne took 3-11 from 5.1 overs to see Australia defeat Sri Lanka by 16 runs.

From then Warne was off and running.

“Greg Matthews was bowling well and I think it was he who prompted me and said ‘Why don’t you give the leg-spinner a go?’ I thought upon it and said ‘yeah OK’” Border recalled.

“I threw Warnie the ball and boom boom boom three wickets in a couple of overs and job done and we won the Test match we shouldn’t have won.

“I think from that point Warnie gained a lot of confidence.

“He talks about that being the real turning point as a cricketer.

“He wasn’t sure how good he was. Well we soon found out didn’t we?”

Although Warne could get people out “even before they walked to the crease” Border says initially that was far from the case.

“He was just your basic club leg-spinner but could really land them and really spun them hard” Border said.

“Initially he was just very naive but it didn’t take long I’m talking in 12 months he just got better and better and the psychological side of his game started to come to the fore.

“He was a smart guy Warnie. He knew how to push buttons. Some guys were out before they even went out to bat.

“He was a special special character and cricketer and a great man off the field don’t worry about the public persona that’s Warnie doing his thing. But he was a top shelf man.”

While Donald Bradman is widely regarded as the game’s greatest cricket for his average of 99.94 Warne was named as one of Wisden’s cricketers of the 20th century despite only being halfway through his career when he was selected.

The other cricketers were Bradman Garfield Sobers Jack Hobbs and Viv Richards.

Border who played alongside Dennis Lillee and Glenn McGrath says Warne topped the charts.

“He’s on that (Bradman) level” Border said.

“Sir Donald Bradman was a batsman he’s our best batsman.

“But who’s our best bowler? That starts an interesting debate: Lillee and McGrath but Warne’s got to be our best bowler ever.

“When Shane Warne was in the Australian cricket team Australia wins Test matches. It was the same with Bradman.”

Warne took 708 Test wickets with 195 of them coming in Ashes matches.

Border turned to the leg-spinner at Old Trafford after England had got off to a strong start in response to Australia’s first-innings score of 289 in the first Test in 1993.

With the home side 1-79 Warne broke through with his first ball on English soil by bowling Mike Gatting for four. The ball instantly became known as the Gatting Ball.

“Warne to Gatting how good is that” Border recalled.

“That’s his first ball he’s ever bowled in England incredible. I knew from that moment we were going to win the series.”

Border said Warne revitalised his Test captaincy and made leading fun.

“It just refreshed my captaincy” Border said.

“We went through that period and era where we didn’t have any real strong options we had a few but when Warne came along it was a fun time to be the captain.

“Every time you threw Warne the ball you knew something was going to happen.

“It was just special as a captain to be able to make positive decisions out on the field rather than try to plug holes. He was great for me as a captain and great for the game.”

More than the wickets that he took and the matches he won Border said recalling the joy and memories of the past was the “secret” to getting past the tragedy.

He described Warne was a “top-shelf man”.

“I’ve done it tough” Border said a day after Marsh’s passing.

“We’re talking about two of the very top shelf of people and cricketers and to go back-to-back it’s knocked everyone about.

“Cricketers are doing it tough because they’re special people in our lives.

“And top shelf cricketers not second or third shelf it’s the top shelf we’re going to with these two blokes. It’s not been a good time.”"

If you’re a competitive runner carbon fiber has been the way to go. With its newest training and racing shoe Nike is thinking a bit differently about the material — and about runners themselves.

The new ZoomX Streakfly is designed specifically with 5k and 10k distances in mind. Taking athlete feedback into account the brand identified a gap in its racing line between what it offered for the full and half marathon and what it offered for competition on the track. The ZoomX Streakfly fills that gap. Here’s what you need to know about this innovative new shoe.

Cutting Carbon

By opting to insert just a midfoot plate as opposed to a full-length strip of carbon fiber Nike was able to stuff more lightweight ZoomX foam into the shoe resulting in a springy aggressive ride. “Compared to our other road racing models the lower stack height of the Streakfly provides more connection to the ground” adds Nike Running Footwear Product Manager Elliott Heath. The shoe is super-light too just 6.5 ounces.

NiSource plans and works on better-informed decisions throughout to expand its footprint inviting more diverse and inclusive thinking into the company.

The HR Digest: Is there any ‘rule of life’ you follow to keep things running around you?

Melanie: As a working mom with a busy job and life outside of work managing my time is critically important. I try to be somewhat judicious with my time and ensure I prioritize things appropriately (kids work and exercise) to ensure balance and that I can be as present as possible within each realm of my life.

The HR Digest: Do you think we are a long way to manage conflicts taking place at work? How do you handle conflicts in a workplace?

Melanie: Conflict at work has taken on a different meaning since Covid-19. The pandemic has created a more virtual work environment. Our employees bring more of themselves to work as many have had to adjust to work life compounded with taking care of children or parents in an isolated work place. Of course we still have many of our employees that are in the field and are servicing our customers. So given where we are our focus on employee health and wellness takes center stage. We are sensitive to our employees and have provided leaders with the tools they need to provide job related feedback while also supporting the needs employees might have at home.

The HR Digest: What do you like the most about being a CHRO?

Melanie: I can’t believe I have been a learner within the HR space for 30 years. I’m in my fourth CHRO role and am so excited to have joined NiSource 6 months ago.

We are committed to creating an enviable employee experience. To do this I must know our business industry trends and our company culture to ensure we develop a talent roadmap that is designed to anticipate the needs of the business over the next 10 years.

Given the backdrop of the Great Resignation I continually work with our executive team and our Board to ensure we have a compelling value proposition to not only attract but to retain our talent.

The HR Digest: What is the most challenging part of being the Human Resources Officer according to you?

Melanie: The most challenging element of the CHRO role is to ensure that your personal values align with the Board CEO and executive team. I have worked in environments where I felt I was pushing a boulder uphill to attempt to do the right thing in the organization—that becomes an unsustainable situation and the older I get the more unacceptable.

The HR Digest: How do you think technology is playing a part in leading the HR industry into a better professional world?

Melanie: We went live with Workday at the start of 2022. We know having the HCM platform allows us to not only drive to a manager/employee self-service environment but also to better incorporate talent insights into our thinking and strategic planning. For instance having a detailed view of our current workforce through a DE&I lens allows us to make better-informed decisions on how we expand our footprint to invite more diverse and inclusive thinking into our company.

The HR Digest: What’s next on NiSource’s goals list?

Melanie: I was delighted to present our three year talent roadmap to the Board in October. We are in the midst of our HR Transformation and changing our service delivery model (along with the WD technology).

Norfolk Southern Amtrak and federal authorities are working together to fully restore passenger rail service on the Northeast corridor after 20 loaded coal cars derailed 20 miles north of Baltimore early Saturday morning.

NS (NYSE: NSC) said it is working to restore service as quickly as possible NS spokesman Connor Spielmaker told FreightWaves. The train was hauling 130 railcars altogether when the cars derailed at 2:00 a.m. ET he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2FsbC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8wNS9jb25mbGljdHMtd2l0aC1ub3Jmb2xrLXNvdXRoZXJuLW90aGVyLWhvc3QtcmFpbHJvYWRzLXRyaWdnZXJpbmctbnVtZXJvdXMtZGVsYXlzLW9uLWFtdHJhay1pbi1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conflicts with Norfolk Southern other host railroads triggering numerous delays on Amtrak in Pennsylvania,"On Feb. 19 Valerie Metzler was riding the westbound Amtrak Pennsylvanian which was on time through Huntingdon when it began to slow until it stopped at Bellwood.

The conductor told passengers that a disabled Norfolk Southern freight train was blocking the station platform in Altoona.

By the time Norfolk Southern removed the train and the Pennsylvanian discharged its riders it was almost two hours late according to Metzler who lives in Altoona.

Delays are common on the Pennsylvanian and while that one was longer than normal it illustrates the kind of conflicts that frequently hold up passenger trains. It also illustrates the value of a proposed agreement between Norfolk Southern and PennDOT for right-of-way improvements to alleviate those conflicts and allow for a second daily round-trip Pennsylvanian.

Amtrak’s recent Host Railroad Reports and Host Railroad Report Cards show that delays caused by Norfolk Southern are typically worse than those of the five other major freight railroads.

Norfolk Southern is trying to do better according to a spokesman.

“At times as in the case of the disabled locomotive (that held up Metzler recently) there are impediments to both passenger and freight traffic that have to be worked through” wrote spokesman Connor Spielmaker in an email.

That is “especially true in areas of the network that are single track” Spielmaker wrote.

Amtrak’s Host Railroad Report for 2021 pegs Norfolk Southern as responsible for about 1500 minutes of passenger train delays per 10000 train miles.

The next most problematic Amtrak host was Union Pacific with less than 1200 minutes followed by CSX BNSF Canadian National and Canadian Pacific — which each caused less than 900 minutes of delays per 10000 train miles last year.

Causes of delays

Causes of host-related delays include temporary orders to reduce speed interference from passing trains orders to divert or re-route maintenance-of-way work and detours according to the report.

Norfolk Southern delayed Pennsylvanian in 2021 at the rate of 1396 minutes per 10000 miles above the “target” maximum of 900 minutes.

The Pennsylvanian was more than 15 minutes late 34% of the time station-to-station in 2021 the report said.

A listing of on-time percentages for the Pennsylvanian which runs on both Amtrak-owned and Norfolk Southern-owned tracks versus the Keystone trains which run only on lines owned by Amtrak shows that since 2017 the Pennsylvanian was late 28% of the time compared with 10% for the Keystone trains.

Interference problem

“Freight trains are still the No. 1 cause of delay to Amtrak passengers” states a note on the Amtrak 2020 Host Railroad Report Card. “While the law has required railroads to provide preference to passengers over freight for nearly 50 years freight trains caused 700000 minutes of delay in 2020 alone.”

The Pennsylvanian actually received a passing grade with 82% of riders boarding or arriving within 15 minutes of their scheduled times according to the report card.

Most of Amtrak’s network consists of host lines “owned maintained and dispatched” by freight railroads.

The biggest cause of delay freight train interference is typically the result of freight railroads requiring an Amtrak train to wait so its freight trains can proceed first the report card said.

Sometimes dispatchers force an Amtrak train to follow a much slower freight train for as much as 100 miles and sometimes dispatchers make an Amtrak train park in a siding while a freight train that is too long for the siding goes first according to the report card.

Amtrak was created in 1971 by Congress to relieve freight railroads of their obligation to provide passenger service on which they lost money.

Congress required that Amtrak retain access to the freight companies’ lines and that Amtrak trains would receive preference over freight trains.

Only the U.S. Department of Justice can enforce the preference law “and it has brought only one enforcement action against a freight company in Amtrak’s history — and that was over 40 years ago” according to the report card web page.

Norfolk Southern is working to improve in hopes of helping to make passenger rail on its line “a more reliable and sustainable transportation alternative according to Spielmaker.

The company is also “constantly monitoring where the system is seeing extra stress and moving or adjusting resources to match” he wrote. And The difficulties in single track areas make the proposed Norfok Southern-PennDOT agreement “a critical next step” Spielmaker wrote.

Norfolk Southern doesn’t acknowledge however that it is in violation of the passenger priority requirement.

“We follow the law and grant preference to passenger trains on our network” Spielmaker wrote.

The Western Pennsylvanians for Passenger Rail is an advocate for more reliable service.

“On-time performance is an important factor in maintaining and increasing passenger rail ridership” stated Mark Spada president of the WPPR of which Metzler is a member.

The organization is hopeful for improved performance both near- and long-term.

The right-of-way improvements that could result under the proposed Norfolk Southern-PennDOT agreement should help according to Spada.

Metzler an archivist and historian in private practice has traveled on the Pennsylvanian every month to work for a client in Philadelphia since 2014.

She also goes on the Pennsylvanian to watch Philadelphia Union soccer games.

She was “elated” recently to learn about the proposed agreement.

She likes traveling by rail because it’s more “environmentally friendly” and she can work or nap along the way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYXIybmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2ZyZWlnaHQtdHJhaW4tZGVyYWlscy1pbi1hYmVyZGVlbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freight train derails in Aberdeen,"ABERDEEN Md. — Norfolk Southern federal authorities and Amtrak are working together to restore service to a train track in Aberdeen after a freight train derailment Saturday morning.

Since the exacerbation of bandits’ activities around the far northern part of Zamfara State which borders the eastern part of Sokoto State residents became gripped by fear and began to take steps to protect their communities from the encroaching fire engulfing nearby communities. In the past five to six years’ they had witnessed how the rampaging bandits ran down village after another in the neighbouring Zurmi and Shinkafi local governments like elsewhere in Zamfara State with some of the displaced persons running to them for cover.

The communities constituted a loosely organized volunteer security outfit known as Yan Sakai to provide protection and wade off the bandits. But this did not stop the incursion. Soon the bandits moved from isolated hit and run attacks to more daring raids with members of the community volunteer force as the prime targets. By now dozens of villages in Isa Sabon Birni and other neighbouring local governments in Sokoto State have been either completely or partially engulfed by the bandits.

Alhaji Ibrahim Aliyu Gangara the district head of Gangara in Sabon Birni Local Government whose community was sacked by the bandits in September recalls the gradual encroachment into his area of jurisdiction and how the bandits turned the town into a logistic recharging base before they overran it eventually.

“The problem started some three years ago. They started by coming at night to rob residents then they moved into kidnapping for ransom. They came one day about two years ago and killed 37 persons in Gangara town and rustled cattle. After the incident soldiers were deployed to help protect us. That made them (the bandits) to stop coming into the town but were still waylaying people on the way for abduction and killing those who resisted. The soldiers and vigilantes were patrolling the town.

“Then all of a sudden they came and launched this massive attack. It was on the Saturday that they sacked the security base in Dama that they came to Gangara. Someone was harvesting cowpea inside his sorghum farm when he cited them discussing on when to launch the attack. He ran to tell the soldiers what was happening and the gunmen came on his trail and engaged the soldiers in firefight. Luckily they didn’t kill any soldier but they killed two civilians.

“Then they returned on Tuesday at dawn and launched a heavy attack on the town. That day all the people had to leave. They torched shops and rustled animals. They took everything they wanted. The soldiers withdrew also and that made it dangerous for anyone else to remain in the town since our trust was in God and in the protection from the soldiers. This was how for four days they kept coming back raiding house to house and taking whatever they wanted and setting others ablaze.”

But after they had sacked Gangara the bandits realized it was a strategic mistake and now began move to woo the people back. They depended on the locals for many of their daily needs especially provision materials.

“They began calling on people to get back to harvest their farms and they appointed one Hassan Dankwaro to be there to ensure that the people harvested the farms without any hindrance they said everyone who had any complaint should report to him.”

It was the end of a complete take over.

In Tara district under the same local government the district head Alhaji Rabiu Sarakin Tara said at least 12 villages under his domain have been sacked by the bandits with displaced persons migrating to places far and near in search of succor.

The experience of villagers in this area which is consistent with the experiences of other people in other parts of the six northern states of Zamfara Sokoto Katsina Kaduna Kebbi and Niger is what made Dr Abubakar Siddique-Mohammed of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria to liken the banditry menace to malignant cancer. He warned while the problem was still at early stage seven years ago that it would go out of control if nothing was done to curtail it.

“I remember when I was making my presentation I had a picture of a tissue attacked by cancer and I said this thing is like malignant cancer already there are towns and villages on the map of Nigeria that have disappeared because bandits have taken over and driven the people away” he said.

From petty crimes to mass atrocities

The rural criminality called banditry which is fast evolving has become perhaps the most challenging security threat for Nigeria at the moment overtaking the insurgency in the North East in terms of human costs for the conflict especially in recent months.

Aside banditry and the Boko Haram insurgency in the North East Nigeria is struggling with pockets of other armed insurrections.

In 2021 alone 9423 Nigerians were killed in the orgy of violence in different parts of the country with the six states afflicted by banditry recording 4104 deaths according computation of data collected by Council on Foreign Relations’ Nigeria Security Tracker.

Militia groups formed initially by youths of Fulani stock have grown into cantankerous gangs engaging in cattle rustling arson mass killings and kidnapping for ransom. They are aided by collaborators and soldiers of fortune who act as informants suppliers of various items of needs gun runners and marabouts.

The bandits’ attacks and abductions occur at random at places of wish as they move from villages to highways and schools. Some 10 schools were ransacked by the bandits in Katsina Zamfara Kaduna Kebbi and Niger states within a year abducting 1170 students in 11 raids in less than a year.

Their indulgence in these crimes is aided by their access to small and light weapons which some of them like Auwal Daudawa the kingpin who orchestrated the first bandits-led school abduction compared access to weapons with purchasing bread. He also said the arms come from across the border with Niger and from the southern Nigeria arriving by sea.

These arms range from the more common AK-47 rifle to more sophisticated general purpose machine guns and rocket launchers.

Using these sophisticated arms the bandits have been terrorising communities leaving trails of blood and toil. Many rural dwellers in the affected states have bitter tales to tell as hundreds of women have been widowed and thousands of kids orphaned. Though researchers lament paucity of data on the human cost of the conflict in a June 2020 report a security think tank International Crisis Group estimates that since 2011 when the menacing rural banditry began to escalate into a full-blown armed criminality some 8000 persons had been killed mainly in Zamfara State while about 200000 were displaced from their homes with about 60000 of them fleeing into the neighbouring Niger Republic.

But a researcher on the conflict Dr Murtala Ahmed Rufa’i of the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Sokoto estimated that some 70000 persons have been killed in about dozen years since the banditry crisis began.

A young girl Hauwa from Tsafe in Zamfara State watched as her parents were murdered in her presence by attackers who looted their home after shooting her father and mother. She escaped the attack but now lives under the care of a man who has become a father to many fatherless victims like Hauwa Alhaji Muhammadu Bako Sarkin Gabas in Sunami area of Gusau the Zamfara State capital.

“I ran away after my mother and my father were killed. Our father was wealthy they came to him and asked that he gives them money or they would kill him. He said he didn’t have. They killed him along with our mother and left with my elder siblings” she said.

Beyond the killings and abductions the Emir of Bungudu Alhaji Hassan Attahiru said over 80 percent of the people’s source of income had been cut down.

“We have at least 80% of where the food is grown and where the herders operate peacefully in those days we have at least 80% of them that have been affected and affected in almost absolute terms whereby they could hardly do anything.”

The roots of the problem

Experts have various explanations for explosion of the security problem in the affected northern state with Zamfara as the epicenter. At the root however is a fierce competition for resources exacerbated by severe impact of climate change on arable land grazing areas and water points. The contraction of these natural resources and worsening cases of rural crimes of cattle rustling led to what Senator Saidu Dansadau described as “depletion of herds of cattle of the Fulani” and made many of the cattle owners to go further afield searching for pasture often in conflict with farmers who also desert their farms rendered barren for more fertile grounds.

Added to these are the twin issues of ungoverned or neglected spaces and vast open borders that make it possible for criminals to move and smuggle arms undetected.

Commenting on the open border Katsina State Governor Aminu Bello Masari said; “it is an open border that is harbouring the same communities with same culture and same religion. So obviously it poses a threat and a big challenge in terms of securing the borders. And you know cumulations of many problems in Libya Chad Mali so arms and ammunition finding their way into Nigeria. How do they come into Nigeria? They have to come through Niger Republic.

Illicit drugs and intoxicants also find their way into Nigeria through Niger Republic.

“Now the ungoverned space of Libya Chad and Mali have become collection and distribution centres of arms and ammunition. When you look at them all which one has the highest market? Is it not Nigeria? So the target is Nigeria. So it has put a lot of pressure on border control and intelligence gathering”.

The Emir of Bungudu in Zamfara State Alhaji Hassan Attahiru blamed foreign herders from Guinea and Mali who moved into Nigeria years ago for introducing violence to the local herders.

Residents who had grown up alongside Fulani settlements in these areas say the herders lived a cordial life with them for years inviting them for their social events and even storing their harvested grains in the towns occupied by mainly Hausa farmers.

Senator Saidu Dansadau whose community forms the epicenter of the rural banditry recalls with nostalgia: “When the Fulani settle in an individual farm if they are having naming ceremony they invite the indigenous farmers to the naming ceremony we used to spend the whole day in the ruga of the Fulani drinking fura with nunu eating the kind of rice they cook normally when they cook rice they put milk inside it very nice very unique so it was quite a smooth and cordial relationship.”

But researchers and followers of the conflict say the seed of the violent uprising today was sowed from those days of seeming peace as injustice by local leaders eroded trust and bred disaffection.

Dr Siddique-Mohammed recalls one instance of such injustice which occurred over 40 years ago around Batsari area of Katsina State where herders were arrested for coming through a sold off cattle path which was converted to farmland.

“They didn’t know but they were arrested charged for trespass and thieves were hired to go to their hamlets and steal whatever they had. This happened around 1976-77” he said.

Experiences like this and years of neglect of the hard-to-reach rural communities over years experts say further compounded the situation.

A 2019 report commissioned by Zamfara State Government identifies many remote and immediate factors that created the atmosphere for the conflict. Some of the identified factors include: Unemployment due to non-functional education system abject poverty and lack of jobs; Passive and ineffective criminal justice systems; Over-bloated population growth all over the country and most especially in Zamfara state at the rate that far outstrips its resources and other socio-economic facilities; unchecked influx of settlement of illegal aliens from neighboring countries; Lack of proper and adequate measures in dispute settlement mechanisms at all levels; general declined of values/morals of society at all levels; outright violation of Land Use Act

Othe factors identified by the report include deliberate institutional failure and blatant betrayal of trust by various political leaders traditional rulers security officers judicial officers as well as high ignorance and low level of education of members of public; outright violation of human rights by illegal arrests and detentions of innocent people by unscrupulous members of Government Security Agencies and other non-state security actors (vigilantes Yansakai and civilian JTF) and ethnic rivalries.

The report which was produced by a committee headed by a former inspector-general of police Mohammed D. Abubakar also blames unlawful forfeiture and confiscation of properties; corruption and unaccountability of government institutions such as the judiciary security agencies traditional rulers civil and public servants in conducting their duties; rampant injustice suppressive oppressive treatment with impurity by some traditional rulers; and breakdown of Intelligence and intelligence failures for the conflict.

Most of the issues highlighted in this report according to researchers like Dr Murtala Ahmed Rufai of the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Sokoto are more pronounced among the largely itinerant pastoral communities the Fulani.

One of the oldest bandits operating out of Zamfara State Shehu Rekeb re-echoes some of these issues.

“This whole agitation is caused by lack of education. None of us here is educated. Only in isolated cases do you have someone who would go and settle in another place and go to school. They are very few. Anyone you see that has gone to school it is possible it was because a minister or someone important is married to his sister and brought him close. The rest of us in the bushes are not educated. But there is also adult education and other trainings for trade. The law says they should empower the citizens and secure them and their property. None of that happens. We are not being secured. We don’t have anything to depend on; it is only us and the trees that are here and the gun we are wielding.

“We are also deprived of keeping cattle because of lack of grazing areas. They have taken over the grazing areas; even the grazing routes are no longer there. Soldiers would take over our cattle vigilante would confiscate and gunmen would rustle. We have been rendered poor.”

While older bandits like Shehu Rekeb and a few others were engaged in low scale criminal activities mostly cattle rustling and armed robbery the communities evolved a self-help measure to contain the criminals.

“Vigilante groups sprang up in those areas to deal with the armed robberies. Initially what they did was to identify ‘thieves’ in those areas and killed them. After killing them they then moved into the bush and attacked Fulani hamlets; people had nothing to do with the conflict. The only crime they committed was to be Fulani they attacked them and many of them were killed.

“It is a pattern we were able to establish across North West. We interviewed many people it is the same pattern; Yan sakai taking the laws into their own hands. They happen to be the police they happen to be prosecutors and they also happen to be the judges. It is the trigger for this violence we see” Rekeb said.

Most of the things outlined by Rekeb resembles the views expressed by a notorious kingpin Bello Turji who recounts his victimhood in an interview with Daily Trust on Sunday.

The escalation of the current wave of violence however is traceable to the 2011 murder of the Fulani community leader Alhaji Ishe at Chilin Village of Dansadau district in Zamfara State.

“The murder of Ishe was not one of the causes but like you said it inflamed the situation it inflamed it there is no doubt about that because Ishi was like a Fulani activist and to be fair to him he was a fairly honest person because whenever there was misunderstanding between Fulani and farmers he used to go and assess the situation.

“If a Fulani is wrong he will tell the Fulani you are wrong and he made the Fulani to pay compensation to farmers and if farmers are wrong they also tell the farmers they are wrong and if the farmer is notorious Ishi will lead the victim from the Fulani to court to the extent that sometimes he will go and hire lawyers in order to protect the Fulani.

“Not only that if a traditional ruler is also oppressing the Fulani he also confronts him and in fact investigation of recent has shown clear insight into what actually led to his murder. It was this his activism confronting traditional rulers that led to his murder.

“People are blaming the vigilante group; in fact the truth of the matter is that the vigilante groups were hired. The vigilante groups in my village were offered N600000 to murder Ishe and they declined they refused and some others were hired elsewhere and they came and they murdered him.”

In the aftermath of Ishe’s murder and retaliatory attacks by Fulani youths armed with sophisticated guns the murderous uprising spilled into all the states neighbouring Zamfara: Katsina in the east Kaduna and Niger in the south Sokoto in the north-west and Kebbi in the west.

Some of the bandits have also established presence and sleeper cells in places far away from Zamfara; as far away as Taraba and Adamawa states.

“It keeps on moving. It is a moving conflict” says Dr Rufa’i.

The volunteer force called the Yan Sakai armed ostensibly to protect communities from the bandits’ aggression became a balancing force for the carnage combining with the bandits to create something of a Hobbesian state with bloodbath increasing every day.

With fingers pointed at traditional rulers as alleged enablers of the early conflict and persons with potential solutions in their hands the Emir of Bungudu Alhaji Hassan Attahiru says the allegations against the traditional rulers was exaggerated as their powers were long eroded following the local government reforms in mid 1970s.

The emir reputed for his role in reigning in the violence in his domain experienced the menace first hand when he was abducted from a scene of a highway kidnapping by the bandits along Kaduna-Abuja Road in August 2021.

The emir who goes by the title of Sarkin Fulanin Bungudu admits that bad eggs abound in all sections including the traditional rulers and accused the Yan Sakai disregarding the authorities.

Chairman of the Vigilante Group of Nigeria in Sabon Birni Local Government Adamu Muhammad (aka Bulaki) said the acts by groups like his own were in direct response to atrocities committed by the bandits who he accused of being callous and disproportionate in their use of fire power.

For many years security forces are engaged in operations to root out the bandits including through aerial bombardments with mixed results.

Several bandits and their collaborators were also arrested at different times.

With results from military operation taking long coming governments in the affected states adopted various approaches to containing the violence

The Zamfara and Katsina state governments went into dialogues with some of the key bandits and offered amnesty in exchange for ceasefire. But all the past talks have collapsed for what experts attribute to the bandits’ erratic nature and lack of diligent processes and sincerity on the parts of the governments.

Last year the federal government declared the bandits as terrorists following a court order to that effect but experts argue that tackling the menace would require a more holistic approach by addressing some of the issues at the root of the crisis.

It could conceivably alter the way some people think about investing too.

At least that’s the view of two analysts with Citi who argue that the height of social responsibility at this moment requires putting your investment money into the stocks of companies that make weapons.

“Defending the values of liberal democracies and creating a deterrent which preserves peace and global stability” is so important that weapons makers should be included in funds that carry an E.S.G. or “environmental social and governance” label the two analysts Charles J. Armitage and Samuel Burgess wrote.

That labeling seems utterly bizarre for some E.S.G. investors however.

It certainly does to Andrew Behar the chief executive of As You Sow an advocacy and research group that frequently files shareholder proxy proposals on E.S.G. issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L3J1c3NpYS1oYXMtbG9zdC1pdHMtcG93ZXItb3Zlci1uYXNhLWFuZC1pbi10aGUtc3BhY2UtYnVzaW5lc3MtZXhwZXJ0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia has lost its power over NASA and in the space business: experts,"Russia continues to degrade its role in the space industry alienating itself from international customers it has long supplied space resources to because President Vladimir Putin refused to back down from the attack on Ukraine.

Since Russia began its invasion last week the head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin refused to launch a UK-satellite company’s payloads and stopped supplying Russian-built rocket engines to US customers and threatened to cut ties with its International Space Station partners including NASA.

The most delicate ongoing space policy issue is the International Space Station.

For over 20 years NASA and Russia worked together to build and maintain the orbiting laboratory 200 miles above Earth. The first modules were American and Russian. The first two astronauts to enter the space station when the lights were turned on were an American and Russian cosmonaut together an intentional choice by STS-88 mission Commander Robert Cabana.

When the space shuttle program ended the US lost its ride to space for American astronauts. It began purchasing seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft for more than $80 million for nine years until SpaceX began launching astronauts under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.

Since Elon Musk’s company began launching Americans from Florida in May 2020 NASA had purchased fewer seats from Russia and was negotiating for a cosmonaut to launch on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon when the Ukraine invasion began.

Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with The Post’s live coverage.

Rogozin has threatened to pull out of the ISS altogether and ended on-orbit science activities between cosmonauts and their international astronaut counterparts.

University of Central Florida space policy expert Roger Handberg said Russia has lost its upper hand.

“They’re not getting money because a good part of their space program had been selling seats on Soyuz missions to the United States” Handberg said. “The Russians have lost their leverage as you say over the United States because they provided the access. Now we have independent access.”

In April NASA Astronauts Mark Vande Hei is set to undock from the space station with two cosmonauts and return to Earth on a Russian spacecraft landing in Kazakhstan. He may be the last American to fly on a Russian vehicle if the relationship deteriorates.

Secondly the US Europe and Japan are working to extend the life of the ISS until 2030 but Russia has only committed to 2024 and those negotiations were also underway.

If Russia drops out by 2030 that’s where things get complicated.

“Does that mean we have to disassemble and take their modules off? That’s the kind of complicated question. We’re not there yet” Handberg said.

5 Russia’s space program has promised to maintain the International Space Station until 2024. NASA

Since the end of the shuttle program the ISS has depended on Russian spacecraft to lift the space station and move it in debris avoidance maneuvers.

However the Northrop Grumman cargo spaceship Cygnus might be capable of taking on that job. A recently docked Cygnus at the ISS will conduct the first US reboost test while in orbit potentially providing an alternative option.

If Russia chooses to take immediate action and sever ties with its International Space Station partners it’s unclear how that would work. The ISS was not designed to be divided.

“Many things are intertwined. So are we no longer allowed to use the Russian modules on this space station? Or vice versa we don’t allow them to use our modules” Handberg said.

“In the confined circumstances they’re in that gets pretty bizarre.”

Handberg believes Russia is locked into the ISS until 2024 but there is always uncertainty with Putin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BhY2Utcm9ja2V0LWxhYi1uZXV0cm9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A little-known U.S. spaceport shoots into the big rocket scene,"Rocket Lab has selected Wallops Island Flight Facility in Virginia to build and launch Neutron its fully reusable and return-to-launchpad rocket.

On Wallops Island a remote community on Virginia’s Eastern Shore a press corps assembled camera tripods in an open field and waited for the countdown on wind-chilled metal bleachers.

Off in the distance was a rocket appearing no bigger than a grain of rice. One member of the party noted that the marshy grasses skirting the view on this February day were much taller than at the last launch.

A smoke plume enveloped the Antares rocket but only for a moment. The bleachers a couple of miles from the launchpad vibrated — a drumroll for the capsule headed to the International Space Station. The rocket soon emerged from the cloud scaling the sky until it shrank out of sight.

Quite a 21st-century fireworks show for a bucolic area of Victorian farmhouses and roaming wild ponies. How did the tiny barrier island of all places become a NASA launch site a newcomer asked Patrick O'Neill an International Space Station spokesman.

""I really don't know"" he said. ""My assumption is when you are on a coastline like this when you launch out you're not doing it over top of a heavily populated area.""

Perhaps little-known to the space fans accustomed to rockets blasting off from Cape Canaveral Florida or the Central California coast Wallops Island has been a steadfast force since the waning days of World War II. It began as a small testing range for guided missiles a decade before NASA formed. Today its bread and butter are sounding rockets (small research rockets that only briefly visit space) drones and high-altitude scientific balloons that float to the edge of space. Uncrewed cargo missions for the space station provided by Northrop Grumman fly from the site about twice a year.

But in the coming years Wallops will play a greater role in the blooming commercial spaceflight industry. The Virginia site is NASA’s only owned rocket launch range for suborbital and orbital rockets. Over the next eight years the space agency expects the facility to grow from flying two or three orbital launches per year to over 20. The complex is bracing for the Artemis missions to the moon which will launch directly to the lunar surface and support astronauts.

Through new commercial partnerships it could even go interplanetary hosting the first private missions to Venus.

Rocket Lab picked the little-known Wallops Island Flight Facility for its new Neutron rocket's factory location and launchpad. Credit: Rocket Lab

This week Rocket Lab a New Zealand-based company nipping at the heels of SpaceX announced it would build a 250000-square-foot factory at the Virginia outpost for its new Neutron rocket a 130-foot medium-lift vehicle designed to return to its launchpad and be fully reused.

The company has dubbed it a rocket for 2050. Reams of carbon composite material for the rocket will be made with robotics.

That’s a far cry from the scrappy early days of Wallops 70 years ago when the only way to get on the island was by ferry. The launch platform consisted of a 50-by-50-foot concrete slab with an observation station covered in sandbags. ""Offices"" were little more than five wooden shacks and some sheds.

The Neutron pad will be in addition to the company’s other new Wallops-based pad for the Electron rocket a smaller 59-foot vehicle intended for launching small satellites. The Electron is expected to fly from Virginia soil later this year while Neutron’s maiden voyage is planned for 2024.

The Neutron deal will come with about $45 million in assistance from the state and Virginia Space the state-established entity that runs the commercial activity at Wallops.

""We love Wallops actually"" Peter Beck CEO of Rocket Lab told Mashable. ""You know up at Cape [Canaveral] it’s a very very busy launch site. Having quite a bit of a quieter place to go about your businesses is certainly a huge advantage.""

""Having quite a bit of a quieter place to go about your businesses is certainly a huge advantage.""

The schedule isn’t the only advantage for turning around quick orders for Rocket Lab’s defense and commercial customers. Beck wanted a launch site where he could also set up a rocket manufacturing facility. The eventual goal is to launch a rocket a month. Amid the new Space Age boom the buildable areas around the busier launch sites are already crowded he said.

""A rocket is generally sized by the lowest bridge between California and the launch site of California — and [for] Florida"" he said. ""To me that was never a good engineering constraint to labor upon yourself the height of a bridge built in the 1950s. So the way to solve that problem was just build the factory beside the launch site.""

Neutron is designed to carry an eight-ton payload and might one day fly astronauts something that its small predecessor Electron could never do. It’s made of a carbon composite shell that is lightweight and durable for the heat and pressure of repeated spaceflights. It's bulkier at the base than other sticklike rockets so that it can both balance on its own legs before launch and when it lands. That eliminates the need for launch towers.

The new shape isn’t about looking cool. It’s about cost Beck said. Landing on a barge at sea could take three days to tow back. Bringing the vehicle directly to the launchpad reduces the time and money needed to service the rocket for the next order.

""This is going to have a lasting impact for years and years and years to come.""

Rocket Lab brings with it the prestige of being involved with CAPSTONE a precursor mission for NASA’s Artemis moonbound flights. The space agency selected Rocket Lab’s spacecraft to test out the lunar orbit where it wants Gateway a planned space station to serve lunar missions to reside. Wallops was originally slated to host that mission but it is still awaiting a key NASA certification.

What's more Rocket Lab has an exciting planetary mission fast approaching: The company will carry out the first privately funded mission to Venus next year. Through a collaboration with MIT Georgia Tech Caltech Purdue University and the Planetary Science Institute the expedition will send a 55-pound probe on an Electron rocket for a five-month voyage. The spacecraft will dip into the thick Venusian clouds for a few minutes. Scientists are interested in the chemistry occurring in Venus’ atmosphere following a controversial study that suggested phosphine a possible sign of microbial life lurked in the clouds.

Though that launch could take off from New Zealand like the lunar orbit mission the Virginia site is in the mix Beck said. The decision will largely hinge on scheduling and how busy the launchpads are.

So things may not stay ""quiet"" at Wallops for long. Having Rocket Lab as an anchor tenant of the adjacent research business park will draw more companies said David Pierce NASA director of the flight facility.

The state investments into building the new launch pad and control center for Neutron will be able to serve other customers too. With 6000 acres at the Wallops complex there’s room for more development.

""This is going to have a lasting impact for years and years and years to come"" Pierce said.

One of those impacts will be the addition of rocket return viewings around the little island a spectacle that is expected to be far less noisy than when the vehicle vaults into the sky.

Neutron only needs one engine to light just before it lands. It won’t even require a braking burn on the way down because of its aerodynamic shape and features. Beck guarantees the addition of rocket landings to Wallops will remain ""quiet.""

""We would hope that it would be very graceful"" Beck said."

The new 1200 guest Vista was floated out at the Fincantieri shipyard in Sestri Ponente Italy this week.

The ship will launch in April 2023 in Rome before heading later that year for cruises to Panama Canal and the Caribbean.

“Vista is Oceania Cruises’ most anticipated ship in the history of our company and I am thrilled to be here with our partners from Fincantieri as the ship morphs from blueprints and steel into reality. Vista is truly a ship of dreams and we cannot wait to welcome her inaugural season guests next year” stated Howard Sherman President and CEO of Oceania Cruises.

The ship includes 12 dining concepts four of which are brand-new for the company; that’s along with eight bars lounges and entertainment venues; an Aquamar Spa and Vitality Center; and what the company calls the “most spacious standard staterooms at sea” measuring more than 290 square feet.

“Ten years have passed since we delivered Riviera to our friends at Oceania Cruises from the same Sestri shipyard” said Luigi Matarazzo general manager of the Merchant Ships Division of Fincantieri. “The launch of this new ship therefore represents an important milestone not only of her construction but also in the consolidation of the relationship with the shipping company. I am sure that Vista will give life to a new class of ships that will stand out for its refinement and technological advances.”

Oceania a culinary and destination-focused cruise line has a fleet of seven small-ship vessels.

The company is owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2NydWlzZS1uZXdzLXVwZGF0ZS1tYXJjaC01LTIwMjIvNjcwNTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise News Update: March 5 2022,"Find out what’s been happening across the major cruise lines from the past week. In this cruise news update we’ve got the big headlines from Royal Caribbean’s new Wonder of the Seas to the port of call cancellations in Russia.

It’s another busy week in the cruise industry and we’ve got tons to update you on including the literally big news that Wonder of the Seas the world’s largest cruise ship has departed on her maiden voyage.

There is also news on Carnival Cruise Line resuming from Mobile Alabama Carnival ship itinerary changes Disney Cruise line mask policy change a gratuity increase by Norwegian Cruise Line and the latest on the cruise line cancellations to Russia.

Wonder of the Seas Maiden Voyage

No doubt you already know that Royal Caribbean’s Wonder of the Seas the world’s largest cruise ship has departed on her maiden voyage. The giant vessel departed Fort Lauderdale Florida after a slight delay on Friday evening March 4 for the first time with guests onboard. It’s a major highlight of the year as the cruise industry continues to push forward and grow despite the global pandemic.

The vessel first arrived in the US on February 20 with huge anticipation and received a warm welcome in Florida. Since then the ship has been preparing for the maiden voyage by doing a short sailing to Royal Caribbean’s private island Perfect Day at Cococay in the Bahamas for the crew and family members.

Wonder of the Seas is currently sailing toward the first call at Labadee in Haiti Royal Caribbean’s private destination the ship will also be calling at San Juan Puerto Rico; Nassau Bahamas and the final call at Perfect Day at CocoCay. The maiden voyage will end back in Florida on March 11.

Wonder of the Seas’ last voyage from Fort Lauderdale for this spring will sail on April 15. Between April 20 and May 8 the ship will be repositioning to her summer homeports in Spain and Italy with Mediterranean cruises through October 30 2022.

In November 2022 the Royal Caribbean cruise ship will arrive at her new homeport of Port Canaveral. From the world-famous cruise port she will sail 7-night itineraries to the eastern and western Caribbean.

The fifth Oasis-class vessel is 236857 gross tons and measures 1188 feet. There is a guest capacity of 5734 at double occupancy and 2300 international crew members.

Carnival Cruise Line Resumes from Mobile

Today marks the first Carnival cruise ship to resume operations out of Mobile Alabama. The Carnival Ecstasy arrived at the port on Thursday March 3 to prepare to resume sailings today March 5. It’s the first cruise sailing with guests for two years since the industry-wide suspension first started in March 2020.

Carnival Ecstasy will be heading out for a special “Sailabration” cruise in honor of Carnival Cruise Line’s 50th birthday celebration. This sailing will include a “Fun Ship Meetup” at sea for birthday greetings between vessels where Carnival Ecstasy will meet up with other ships in the fleet.

Carnival Breeze Carnival Ecstasy Carnival Glory Mardi Gras Carnival Pride Carnival Sunrise and Carnival Vista are set to meet between Cozumel and Costa Maya Mexico on Monday March 7. This is the largest of the Fun Ship meetups among the fleet.

Carnival Ecstasy meanwhile will also retire from the Fun Ship fleet but not before enjoying the spring and summer season offering 5-night Western Caribbean itineraries that will visit Cozumel and either Costa Maya or Progreso depending on the sailing date.

Carnival Ship Itinerary Changes

In the latest update to booked guests there are adjustments for the Carnival Spirit out of Jacksonville and the Carnival Magic based from Port Canaveral. In total five sailings are impacted but the majority are just minor changes including arrival and departure times.

For the Carnival Magic the cruise line has removed a port for the December 23 eight-day Eastern Caribbean voyage. The call to Grand Turk in the Turks & Caicos Islands on December 23 has been replaced with Amber Cove in the Dominican Republic. The ship will arrive at the alternative port of call at 7:00 AM and depart at 3:00 PM.

All other ports during the voyage remain the same including St. Maarten St. Kitts and San Juan. Carnival has informed guests that any pre-purchased shore excursions through the cruise line will automatically be refunded and that tour options for Amber Cove will be available in the coming week.

There is also a change for the Carnival Spirit but they are minor and no ports have been removed. For the ship’s five-day departures on March 7 and 21 she’s now scheduled to arrive back home to Jacksonville Florida at 9:30 AM.

For the five-day March 26 sailing to the Bahamas Carnival Spirit will now depart the Port of Jacksonville at 8:30 PM. The later departure does not impact the voyage. On April 9 Carnival Spirit will leave at 8:00 PM the final voyage from Jacksonville before redeploying to Seattle.

Carnival Magic and Spirit changes are relatively minor compared to other recent ones. The most impactful is likely the removal of Grand Turk as it’s such a popular port of call. The cruise line did not provide a reason for the change but could be due to scheduling conflicts or port agreements.

Disney Cruise Line Mask Policy

In updated protocols on its website Disney Cruise Line has announced that it will be relaxing its onboard mask mandate for sailings departing from U.S. ports as of March 11 2022.

The guidelines state “For sailings originating from a U.S. port of departure beginning March 11 2022 face coverings will be optional in most indoor locations throughout our ships.”

There are exceptions however. All guests ages 2 and up including guests who are fully vaccinated must continue to wear masks in the Walt Disney Theater. This theater is often filled to capacity so it makes sense that precautions would continue to be in place at the venue as social distancing will be impossible.

Prior to March 11 all guests ages 2 and up regardless of vaccination status must wear masks in all indoor areas except in their staterooms or while actively eating and drinking.

Because children under 5 years old are not eligible to be vaccinated at this time there are still mask requirements onboard for the youngest Disney Cruise Line travelers even after March 11. Guests under 5 years old are still required to wear face coverings in Youth Activity spaces.

Guests who have not been vaccinated including young cruisers ineligible for vaccinations are still encouraged though not required to wear masks in indoor areas after March 11.

Norwegian Cruise Line Gratuity Increase

Norwegian Cruise Line has sent out a letter informing guests and travel agents that gratuities will be increased from April 1 2022. The amount will go up by at least 50 cents depending on which category cabin guests are booked in.

For guests booked in a balcony stateroom or below the daily service charge will be increased to $16.00 per person. Currently the charge is $15.50 per person per day. For guests in a Club Balcony suite the amount will remain the same at $18.00 per person per day.

Guests booked in The Haven & Suite will have their daily gratuities increased to $20.00. Currently the rate for that category is $18.50 per person per day. This will be a $1.50 increase that will go into effect from April 1 2022.

Norwegian Cruise Line offers guests to take advantage of the current lower rate. Guests who make a reservation on or before March 31 2022 can pre-pay their gratuities at the current rate. This will need to be done before the sailing date. If guests have already paid the service charge before their cruise nothing will be changed.

Cruise Lines Remove Russia Calls

Due to the worrying situation which is developing in Ukraine the cruise industry is abandoning cruise ship visits to Russia including the popular cruise destination of St Petersburg. So let’s take a look at what each of the major cruise lines is doing.

Carnival Corporation stated that its cruise brands were working through changing itineraries and coming up with alternative ports of call.

Princess Cruises which is one of the Carnival brands has stated that 24 sailings will remove calls to Russia impacting the Enchanted Princess Sky Princess and Island Princess. Alternative ports are in Sweeden and Poland.

Holland America Line confirmed on March 4 that six itineraries are modified that were originally scheduled to visit Russian ports this year. AIDA Cruises confirmed that it was removing ship visits to the country too and those baltic sailings during the summer would be adjusted.

Norwegian Cruise Line was among the first cruise lines to state that it was removing all calls to Russia. In fact parent company Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has canceled Russia for all of 2022 across its three cruise brands.

Royal Caribbean has also decided to remove St Petersburg from Voyager of the Seas sailings the only ship in the fleet that was scheduled to visit the country this year. The cruise line was one of the slowest to confirm the cancellations and it came after some backlash due to originally not committing to complete removal.

Carnival’s 50th Birthday

Can you believe it? Carnival Cruise Line has been sailing for half a century ever since the original Mardi Gras set sail from PortMiami on March 11 1972. To mark the historic event the cruise line celebrated with an event onboard the Carnival Conquest while docked in Miami the cruise capital of the world and also the home base for “Amerca’s Cruise Line.”

The celebration was attended by Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy along with Carnival Corp. Chairman Micky Arison and Carnival Corp. CEO Arnold Donald.

We’ve seen many Carnival 50th birthday cakes these last few days but none of them have been as big as the one featured on stage during the event. Christine Duffy and Micky Arison cut the cake to mark a significant milestone in the cruise line’s history.

It’s been a busy month for Carnival with its ship meet-ups at sea as part of its sailabrations tons of events and specials onboard ships and even milestones with ports and ships resuming operations. Terminal F also had its milestone on March 11 with the topping off of the building in anticipation of completion and the ribbon-cutting ceremony this fall.

Since the first voyage back in 1972 Carnival Cruise Line has grown to employ over 40000 team members across 120 different nationalities. Carnival cruise ships have carried more than 90 million passengers since its inception and six million passengers each year across its 23 vessels from 14 US homeports.

Sailing on her first cruise on March 12 Carnival Paradise already arrived in Tampa on March 11 where she docked at the Port Tampa Bay Cruise Terminal 3 which was also the same day as Carnival’s official 50th Birthday. The Fantasy-class ship will be sailing on 4- 5- and 6-day Western Caribbean cruises.

The Carnival ship is departing today on a 5-day voyage to the Western Caribbean which includes two sea days a call at Mahogany Bay in Isla Roatan Honduras and a visit to Cozumel in Mexico. The ship will return to Tampa on March 17.

Carnival Launches VeriFLY

In an effort to make the health screening before the cruise a lot simpler and quicker Carnival Cruise line has now rolled out VeriFLY for all sailings from all US homeports. Guests aboard the January 22 sailing of Mardi Gras from Port Canaveral were the first to use the VeriFLY app which proved to be a great success.

The time taken to complete the entire health assessment process including checking test results verifying health questionnaires and verifying personal details will be cut in half using the app.

The use of the app has already proven popular with guests on recent sailings that have used the new streamlined process. In January 85% of the 2000 guests downloaded and used it on the first test on the Mardi Gras departure.

Available from both the Google Play store and the Apple App store guests first set up a secure profile from their mobile device. The app will then prompt the trip details such as the cruise any flight information proof of vaccination and a negative test.

Carnival Removes Bubble Tours

Carnival Cruise Line has updated its Have Fun. Be Safe protocols on its website and also sent communications to booked guests and travel agents regarding the changes.

The cruise line has now relaxed its shore excursion restrictions effective immediately allowing unvaccinated guests to choose any Carnival tour rather than only a “bubble” tour. The update applies to sailings through December 31 2022.

Previously before the March 8 update unvaccinated guests could only book a bubble tour through Carnival Cruise Line. These tours offered a safe environment and ensured the residents remained protected with extra protocols in place.

If guests did not comply with the rules of a bubble tour Carnival had warned they could have been removed. Guests were not allowed to go ashore without booking a bubble tour which was limited to a small number for each port of call.

There are no restrictions for vaccinated guests which is the majority. Guests can book tours through the cruise line and arrange their own sightseeing ashore. There is no limit and vaccinated guests can go ashore to explore by themselves.

MSC Cruises From New York

The cruise line is expanding its offering in the US by basing its MSC Meraviglia cruise ship out of New York City the first time for MSC Cruises. Plans have been revealed to homeport the vessel from the city year-round out of the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal starting in April 2023.

The ship will offer a range of six- to 11-night itineraries to the Caribbean Bermuda along with Canada and New England. Caribbean options include six or eight-night sailings including calls to Nassau and the cruise line’s private island Ocean Cay MSC Marine Reserve in the Bahamas.

The cruises to Bermuda will be for six nights and include three days docked at King’s Wharf combined with several relaxing days at sea. Cruises to Canada and New England are for ten or 11-nights and include calls to Boston Massachusetts; Portland Maine; Charlottetown Prince Edward Island; Halifax and Sydney Nova Scotia; and Saint John New Brunswick. (11-night itineraries include an additional call in Newport Rhode Island).

It’s a big move for MSC Cruises which has only been based out of Florida and the Caribbean. MSC is the fastest-growing cruise line globally and just recently started operations out of Port Canaveral for the very first time. MSC added Port Canaveral in 2021 as a permanent homeport offering a mix of three four and seven-night cruises.

Eaker Air Force Base opened during World War II was home to multiple bomber groups that brought thousands of people to the town and generated thousands of civilian and non-civilian jobs.

When the base closed in 1992 it started a trend of de-population and slowing of economic growth in the county which abuts Interstate 55 and the Mississippi River. Local officials began a push to lure manufacturing jobs to the county and it worked. Nucor and Big River Steel (BRS) built massive plants in the county transforming it into the largest steel producing county in the country.

Steel jobs are high paying but there was only one problem. Each proceeding generation attempted to live near where they worked. This new generation is different Mississippi County Judge John Alan Nelson told Talk Business & Politics. Many workers in its high paying steel industry sector commute or live in temporary housing during their work week and return home when they finish Mississippi County Economic Development President Clif Chitwood said.

Workers in the plants come from as far away as Atlanta Nashville Tulsa Little Rock and other places. Many work four 12-hour shifts and then return home to their families for the next four days. They rent apartments with others lease houses or stay in local trailer and RV parks.

“What we’ve found is that younger people don’t have a problem traveling to work” Nelson said. “What we’ve had to do is re-focus our efforts.”

BRS now owned by U.S. Steel recently announced it will expand and open a $3 billion mill the largest industrial investment project in Arkansas history. The new mill will be located on land adjacent to the BRS plant and will directly and indirectly employ about 900 workers starting in 2024. The average wage for workers will be about $100000 annually. Payroll at the new plant will exceed $100 million per year and property taxes from the plant will provide about $10 million to local coffers Chitwood said. Construction on the new plant has already begun.

The new plant will provide a golden opportunity to reset population loss in the county Nelson said.

Mississippi County is set to launch its “Work Here Live Here” initiative. The program will pay for 10% of any new home bought in the county by any worker in the manufacturing sector. The home has to be in the $200000 to $500000 range Nelson said. To qualify for the program a worker must obtain a construction loan from a local bank. Once the house is built a second mortgage with the 10% will be implemented. If the worker remains employed in the county for at least four years the county will pay off that second mortgage.

The county plans to use funds from its half-cent economic development sales tax to pay for the program. Nelson said he was skeptical about how popular the program would be with workers. After floating the idea in public several bankers talked with Nelson about interest in the program.

“I’ve been pleasantly surprised. It’s far more people than I thought” he said.

Workers living in the county are vital for its survival Nelson said. Not only does it generate economic growth for local businesses and expand the sales tax base which impacts all residents it makes their own lives better.

“Traveling to work. … I just can’t see how that’s sustainable for family life” he added.

Mississippi County has had trouble luring workers to live in the county but has transformed itself into the dominant manufacturing county in the region. Nucor built the largest steel mill in the Western Hemisphere in the county and then ancillary industries began to populate nearby. Soon economic developers set their sights on another massive steel mill project.

When U.S. Steel was searching nationwide for a site the county already had a prime site to offer one that would have been classified as a certified site if the designation was in use back then Chitwood said. The property located just outside of Osceola not far from the Mississippi River was under option meaning it could be bought if the steel mill wanted it.

The county poured $200000 into the original BRS site conducting soil water and cultural studies to ensure the property could support a steel plant. The property acquired for the expansion plant is similar in terms of water and soil compositions so it will work to support the new project he added. Cultural studies have identified a couple of Native American sites on the property that will have to be avoided but there are no tribal mounds on the land.

The new optimized steel production facility is expected to feature two electric arc furnaces (EAFs) with 3 million tons per year of advanced steel making capability a modern endless casting and rolling line and advanced finishing capabilities. Upon completion the project will apply to become LEED certified the company said.

State economic developers convinced the legislature to add $50 million to the Quick Action Closing Fund — a fund controlled by the governor — for site infrastructure. That money was moved from a reserve account during the special session.

Lawmakers also had to adapt recycling tax credits for the steel industry during the session. The credits will cost the state an average of $11 million a year for 14 years and $8.8 million a year if the state buys back the tax credits at a 20% discount. The legislation passed creates a new project type for steel manufacturers to qualify for an income tax credit for waste reduction reuse or recycling equipment.",,,,,,,,,,,,
NVDA,Nvidia,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbWFsd2FyZS1ub3ctdXNpbmctbnZpZGlhcy1zdG9sZW4tY29kZS1zaWduaW5nLWNlcnRpZmljYXRlcy_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlcGluZ2NvbXB1dGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NlY3VyaXR5L21hbHdhcmUtbm93LXVzaW5nLW52aWRpYXMtc3RvbGVuLWNvZGUtc2lnbmluZy1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0ZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Malware now using NVIDIA's stolen code signing certificates,"Threat actors are using stolen NVIDIA code signing certificates to sign malware to appear trustworthy and allow malicious drivers to be loaded in Windows.

This week NVIDIA confirmed that they suffered a cyberattack that allowed threat actors to steal employee credentials and proprietary data.

The extortion group known as Lapsus$ states that they stole 1TB of data during the attack and began leaking the data online after NVIDIA refused to negotiate with them.

Lapsus$ messages about the NVIDIA attack

The leak includes two stolen code-signing certificates used by NVIDIA developers to sign their drivers and executables.

As part of the #NvidiaLeaks two code signing certificates have been compromised. Although they have expired Windows still allows them to be used for driver signing purposes. See the talk I gave at BH/DC for more context on leaked certificates: https://t.co/UWu3AzHc66 pic.twitter.com/gCrol0BxHd — Bill Demirkapi (@BillDemirkapi) March 3 2022

A code-signing certificate allows developers to digitally sign executables and drivers so that Windows and end-users can verify the file's owner and whether they have been tampered with by a third party.

To increase security in Windows Microsoft also requires kernel-mode drivers to be code signed before the operating system will load them.

NVIDIA certificates used to sign malware

After Lapsus$ leaked NVIDIA's code-signing certificates security researchers quickly found that the certificates were being used to sign malware and other tools used by threat actors.

According to samples uploaded to the VirusTotal malware scanning service the stolen certificates were used to sign various malware and hacking tools such as Cobalt Strike beacons Mimikatz backdoors and remote access trojans.

For example one threat actor used the certificate to sign a Quasar remote access trojan [VirusTotal] while someone else used the certificate to sign a Windows driver [VirusTotal].

Quasar RAT signed by NVIDIA certificate

Security researchers Kevin Beaumont and Will Dormann shared that the stolen certificates utilize the following serial numbers:

43BB437D609866286DD839E1D00309F5 14781bc862e8dc503a559346f5dcc518

Some of the files were likely uploaded to VirusTotal by security researchers but others appear to be used by threat actors for malware campaigns [1 2].

While both stolen NVIDIA certificates are expired Windows will still allow a driver signed with the certificates to be loaded in the operating system.

Therefore using these stolen certificates threat actors gain the advantage of making their programs look like legitimate NVIDIA programs and allowing malicious drivers to be loaded by Windows.

Signed Quasar RAT sample

To prevent known vulnerable drivers from being loaded in Windows David Weston director of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft tweeted that admins can configure Windows Defender Application Control policies to control what NVIDIA drivers can be loaded.

WDAC policies work on both 10-11 with no hardware requirements down to the home SKU despite some FUD misinformation i have seen so it should be your first choice. Create a policy with the Wizard and then add a deny rule or allow specific versions of Nvidia if you need — David Weston (DWIZZZLE) (@dwizzzleMSFT) March 3 2022

However using WDAC is not an easy task especially for non-IT Windows users.

Due to the potential for abuse it is hoped that the stolen certificates will be added to Microsoft's certificate revocation list in the future to prevent malicious drivers from loading in Windows.

However doing so will cause legitimate NVIDIA drivers to be blocked as well so we will likely not see this happening soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL252aWRpYS10by1zdG9wLWFsbC1wcm9kdWN0LXNhbGVzLXRvLXJ1c3NpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Stops All Product Sales to Russia,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-to-stop-all-product-sales-to-russia on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL252aWRpYS10by1zdG9wLWFsbC1wcm9kdWN0LXNhbGVzLXRvLXJ1c3NpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L252aWRpYV9zdG9sZW5fY2VydGlmaWNhdGUv0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL0FNUC8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L252aWRpYV9zdG9sZW5fY2VydGlmaWNhdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leaked stolen Nvidia key can sign Windows malware,"The private key of an Nvidia code-signing certificate was among the mountain of files stolen and leaked online by criminals who ransacked the GPU giant's internal systems.

At least two binaries not developed by Nvidia but signed this week with its stolen key making them appear to be Nvidia programs have appeared in malware sample database VirusTotal.

This leak means sysadmins should take steps or review their security policies and defenses to ensure code recently signed by the rogue cert is detected and blocked as it is most likely going to be malicious. This can be done through Windows configuration network filtering rules or whatever you use to police your organization.

Computer security bod Bill Demirkapi – who we've featured before on these pages – tweeted a warning about the certificate key potentially being used to sign Windows kernel-level driver files:

As part of the #NvidiaLeaks two code signing certificates have been compromised. Although they have expired Windows still allows them to be used for driver signing purposes.

In later tweets he added that Windows will accept drivers signed with certificates issued prior to July 29 2015 without a timestamp. Microsoft's Windows driver signing policy corroborates this stating the operating system will run drivers ""signed with an end-entity certificate issued prior to July 29th 2015 that chains to a supported cross-signed CA"".

The leaked Nvidia certificate key is just such a creature having expired in 2014. Code signed with this key will in the right conditions be accepted by Windows even though the key has expired. Another Nvidia cert was leaked though expired after the cut-off date.

We asked Microsoft what steps would it be willing to take to ensure Windows blocks all code signed by the 2014 cert since its leak. A spokesperson told us: ""We are looking into these new claims and we will do what is necessary to keep our customers protected.""

Infosec bod Kevin Beaumont spotted some folks have been signing their own driver code with Nvidia's private 2014 key and uploading it to VirusTotal to check if antivirus scanners accepted it. He posted on Twitter:

VirusTotal search if you want 'em

The move to allow such drivers was a backwards compatibility effort (per an MSDN post from 2015 introducing Windows 10 build 1607) to prevent a then-new Windows 10 feature from causing problems with previously unsigned drivers.

We note that a good number of antivirus scanners tested by VirusTotal on uploaded samples are now seemingly catching code signed by the rogue Nvidia certificate so it may be that your AV engine will automatically block it.

The crooks who compromised Nvidia's internal systems to steal and leak the certificate key – among many other files including credentials secret source code and documentation – call themselves Lapsus$ and are seemingly trying to blackmail Nvidia into removing cryptomining limit from its GPU firmware. Last year for its RTX 30-series graphics cards Nvidia introduced a technology into their drivers called Lite Hash Rate or LHR for short.

LHR cripples cryptocurrency mining. By nerfing the cards' cryptomining performance Nvidia hoped to make its graphical processing units less attractive to miners leaving more hardware available to gamers in theory and others who actually want graphics performance rather than pure hash rates.

Lapsus$ according to the group's Telegram page are threatening Nvidia with the public release of more internal materials and details of chip blueprints unless the company promises to remove LHR. It seems wholly implausible that Nvidia would give in to such blackmail. The gang also wants Nvidia to open-source its drivers for Macs Linux and Windows PCs.

According to Have I Been Pwned within the leaked data are ""over 70000 employee email addresses and NTLM password hashes many of which were subsequently cracked and circulated within the hacking community.""

In a statement Nvidia previously said: ""We are aware that the threat actor took employee passwords and some Nvidia proprietary information from our systems and has begun leaking it online. Our team is working to analyze that information.""

Microsoft also said it would halt “new” sales of Microsoft products. Nvidia said Friday that it has halted sales to Russia as well.

On Thursday morning AMD said it was halting all chip shipments. By Thursday afternoon Intel had joined AMD with a similar statement. Microsoft added its own statement on Friday morning.

According to AMD the chip ban extends to Belarus which Russia has used as a staging ground for its attacking forces. “Based on sanctions placed on Russia by the United States and other nations at this time AMD is suspending its sales and distribution of our products into Russia and Belarus” an AMD representative said in an email. “It is all AMD products and products we power (PCs etc) in Russia and Belarus.”

Intel too said it had suspended shipments. “Intel condemns the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and we have suspended all shipments to customers in both Russia and Belarus” Intel said in a statement on its Web site. “Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by this war including the people of Ukraine and the surrounding countries and all those around the world with family friends and loved ones in the region.”

Intel said that it had begun to raise funds for relief efforts too.

“We are working to support all of our employees through this difficult situation especially those with close ties to this region” Intel added. “We have launched an employee donation and matching campaign through the Intel Foundation that has already raised over $1.2 million for relief efforts and we are proud of the work our teams in surrounding areas including Poland Germany and Romania are doing to aid refugees. We will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine and the global community in calling for an immediate end to this war and a swift return to peace.”

For its part Microsoft said that it would halt sales of all “new” Microsoft products. “We are announcing today that we will suspend all new sales of Microsoft products and services in Russia” Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith wrote. “In addition we are coordinating closely and working in lockstep with the governments of the United States the European Union and the United Kingdom and we are stopping many aspects of our business in Russia in compliance with governmental sanctions decisions.”

It wasn’t clear whether Microsoft would leave in place ongoing subscription services. Microsoft also said that it continues to protect Ukrainian web sites from Russian attacks. “Our single most impactful area of work almost certainly is the protection of Ukraine’s cybersecurity” Smith added. “We continue to work proactively to help cybersecurity officials in Ukraine defend against Russian attacks including most recently a cyberattack against a major Ukrainian broadcaster.”

On Friday an Nvidia spokesman said simply “We are not selling into Russia.”

Finally clear statements in favor of Ukraine

On Feb. 24 the U.S. Department of Commerce implemented a new Commerce Control List-based license requirement for Russia. This requirement restricts exports to the country for key industries including “microelectronics” avionics navigation equipment and more. Essentially the new export rules blacklist Russia and businesses operating there from legally buying the restricted goods.

To date however the chip industry has been somewhat vague in how it has reacted to the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

On Feb. 26 for example an Intel representative merely said that “Intel complies with all applicable export regulations and sanctions in the countries in which it operates including the new sanctions issued by OFAC and the regulations issued by BIS.” At the time the representative declined to comment further when asked if that indicated a specific ban on sales to Russia. A source close to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) the world’s largest and most important fab told the Washington Post that the foundry has suspended all sales to Russia and to third parties that supply products to Russia. On the record however a TSMC representative told the paper that it would simply comply with the new export rules.

Compared to the overall market however chip sales to Russia represent a small fraction of total sales. On Feb. 24 the Semiconductor Industry Association released a statement that characterized Russia as “not a significant direct consumer” of semiconductors.

“While the impact of the new rules to Russia could be significant Russia is not a significant direct consumer of semiconductors accounting for less than 0.1% of global chip purchases according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization” the SIA said in a statement. “The broader Russian ICT market totaled only about $50.3 billion out of the $4.47 trillion global market according to 2021 IDC data.

“In addition the semiconductor industry has a diverse set of suppliers of key materials and gases so we do not believe there are immediate supply disruption risks related to Russia and Ukraine” the SIA added.

The AMD representative echoed what the SIA said specifically regarding its own supply chain. “Currently we do not believe that the conflict will impact our ability to provide products support and services to our partners and customers” the AMD representative said in his email.

Representatives for Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

For the first time in nearly 24 years we will be seeing GPU releases from three companies in the next few months. A summary of those releases has been put together by 3DCenter.

Intel ARC by end of Q2 2022

Intel is finally expected to launch its Arc Alchemist graphics cards for laptops by the end of this month and then desktop GPUs by the end of June (second quarter). While the company did not confirm the names of its upcoming desktop products it is commonly believed that the flagship model will adopt a name of Arc A780 featuring the full DG2-512EU GPU and 16 GB of GDDR6 memory. It is expected to compete in the upper mid-range segment with Radeon RX 6700 and GeForce RTX 3070 series.

Probably a bit sooner Intel might release its low-end DG2-128EU based Arc A300 GPUs (A350/A380) those cards have a chance to compete with Radeon RX 6500 and GeForce RTX 3050 series in the entry-level space. All those cards are officially coming by the end of the second quarter.

NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti in March

NVIDIA will be releasing its flagship RTX 3090 Ti on March 29th claims the rumor from Chiphell. This model has been on a schedule for a few weeks now after NVIDIA failed to deliver an update on this SKU since the CES 2022 announcement. What is important to note is that the March release date has not been confirmed yet. However at this moment it is the only NVIDIA RTX 30 card now on a launch schedule after alleged cancellation of RTX 3070 Ti 16 GB SKU.

AMD Radeon RX 6_50XT refresh coming in April

AMD will be refreshing its RDNA2 desktop models led by Radeon RX 6950XT featuring faster 18 Gbps memory and increased TDP. While this model is considered a direct response to NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti the RX 6750XT and RX 6650XT should offer competitive performance against Intel Arc GPUs. The RX 6950XT should launch in April but the launch date of the mid-range XT SKUs is currently unknown.

AMD NVIDIA and Intel will definitely give us a lot of new hardware to discuss in the next couple of weeks and that’s right before we switch to next-gen GPU architectures in the third and fourth quarter of this year.

Now it's time to win,"Michael Crow

opinion contributor

The COVID-19 pandemic has both revealed and confirmed vulnerabilities in America’s established systems practices and institutions – things we knew before and things we didn’t. Public health care education transportation and the global supply chain are just a few of the more prominent examples.

Our challenge today is to tighten gaps and to develop more resilient systems. Our mission to do this work is a shared responsibility.

One obvious area – and one in which the solution is achievable – is the microchip shortage that has impacted the supply of everything from automobiles and household appliances to the digital devices that keep us connected informed and productive in our work.

The pandemic has contributed to our awareness of this as consumers but it has only made more obvious what was already true – the United States has a semiconductor manufacturing capability gap.

America let itself fall behind on semiconductors

This is not something that happened to us. It is a consequence of our action and inaction.

In the late 1940s and 1950s America led the world in semiconductor manufacturing. Today only 12% of semiconductors are made in America; 80% are made in Asia. And none of the most advanced semiconductors are manufactured on U.S. soil.

The answer requires a whole-nation approach to rebuild the semiconductor and microchip manufacturing industry in the United States.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree that robust investments in semiconductor research design and manufacturing are critical to regaining American semiconductor leadership. In fact the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives have each advanced a $52 billion spending package to boost the R&D manufacturing and workforce that underpin the U.S. semiconductor industry.

It is imperative that Congress act swiftly to send a negotiated final bill to the president for his signature.

This is a giant opportunity for Arizona

Not only is this a critical agenda item for the country but it also represents an extraordinary economic opportunity for Arizona. Once these investment dollars are allocated plants will be built new companies will be born workers will be needed and high-paying jobs will be created.

The competition to be engaged will be as intense domestically as will be the competition globally to be the world’s industry leader.

We must reassert American technology dominance – and we must aim for nothing short of that. Dominance. That means driving all things forward to maximize American competitiveness. It means beating China and it also means competing vigorously with companies around the world especially in Asia and Europe.

Arizona has long been the place for high-tech industry focused on the manufacturing of electronics and aerospace products. These high-tech activities were primary drivers of the Arizona post-World War II economy continuing well into the 1980s.

Even as American manufacturing scaled back Arizona has kept a foothold and in 2022 there is new momentum. Today Intel headquartered in California is a global leader in technology innovation and is expanding its local facilities with a $20 billion investment.

TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world is making a $12 billion investment in a new chipmaking plant in north Phoenix and bringing suppliers with it. NXP Semiconductors chose to locate its new Gallium nitride fab in Chandler now home to the most advanced fab producing 5G cellular communication amplifiers in the United States.

ASU is ready to make this happen. Are others?

This doesn’t mean we’ve won the race – it means we are in the race. The work is just beginning.

The state is well positioned to reap the benefits of America’s renewed focus on the semiconductor industry and Arizona State University is prepared to put the full force of its resources including the nation’s largest engineering school to work to help make things happen. ASU is already the largest supplier of employees to Intel.

Fueled by unprecedented federal investment there is much more the university can do to make Arizona the global hub for semiconductors. Last fall ASU added to its Fulton Schools of Engineering opening a new School of Manufacturing Systems and Networks.

At ASU’s Research Park the university has established Macro Technology Works a world class fab that advances research and development and is an asset to companies innovating in the microelectronics industry.

ASU brings not only the talent pipeline that a growing industry will need but it also provides the resources of one of the country’s top research universities. ASU ranks sixth for total research expenditures by institutions without a medical school exceeding $673 million in 2020 in use-inspired research. ASU also excels in working with startups and entrepreneurs a top 10 university in patents issued and ranked fourth in startups launched.

The university in its service to the people of Arizona is ready to do its part.

Arizona’s elected officials our economic development organizations our business and education leaders and citizens engaged across the state must advocate for Congress to act swiftly to fund America’s semiconductor manufacturing renaissance.

Returning to a dominant position globally in the advancement of technology is a call to the competitor in all of us.

It’s winning time. Let’s work together and make it happen.

The world-famous car event known as America’s Greatest Hot Rod Show takes over Detroit’s Huntington Place (TCF/Cobo Center) on Friday March 4 through Sunday March 6.

Detroit Autorama welcomes 800 of the most amazing chopped channeled dumped and decked hot rods and custom cars in the world to the motor city with builders from across the country competing for the highest honor in hot rodding The Ridler Award.

Among the highlights of this year’s Autorama is the appearance of the most famous car builder on the custom car scene today Chip Foose from TV’s “Overhaulin” who will meet fans and sign autographs. Chip first gained national attention when he won his first Ridler Award in 2002. Since then Chip has returned to Autorama with his breathtaking creations and won the Ridler three more times more than any other builder ever. He will be at Autorama to greet fans and sign autographs Friday March 4 from noon to 6 p.m.

Among the special features of this year’s Autorama is a unique display of some of the most famous and zany hot rods in history – the 50th Anniversary of the Zingers. The Zingers are full sized toy vehicles. That is they are based on the MCP model cars but built to full size. They combine the body from a 1/43 scale plastic kit with the engine and wheels from a much larger 1/25 kit with a full-size look of exaggerated cartoon proportions. They bring a smile to all onlookers and have become icons of hot rod culture. These wonderful vehicles were built by the local Michigan builder with an outsized national reputation the legendary Chuck Miller. Five of the original Zingers will be at Autorama this year in a special display: VW Bug Dune Buggy Dragster Dodge A100 Van and Corvette.

On Saturday March 5 the AEW Wrestling Star and WWE Hall of Famer Sting will greet fans and sign autographs from 12 to 3 p.m.

David Ankin from the TV show ""Toymakerz"" will greet fans and sign autographs on Saturday March 5 from 4 to 8 p.m.

Danny Koker and Kevin Mack from Counts Kustoms will greet fans and sign autographs on Sunday March 6 from 1 to 4 p.m.

Detroit Autorama is the most revered hot rod-custom car show in North America and attracts visitors from across the U.S. and the globe. The calling card of this renowned show is the presentation of the Ridler Award presented by Meguiar's the most coveted award in hot rodding. For 59 years the auspicious award has been presented to the most outstanding new custom car shown for the first time anywhere. Because of this distinction the show attracts the finest custom car builders in North America to unveil their amazing vehicles for the first time at the famous show.

Detroit Autorama is typically an annual winter ritual that brings the most devout gear heads and just plain curious folks up close and personal with the autos that appear in hot rod and custom car magazines. The cars brought by backyard car jockeys as well as the top customizers in the country compete for top awards in numerous classes. These auto gems vie for awards and prizes in the Summit Racing Equipment Show Car Series. In addition Autorama participants vie for the prestigious Ridler Award sponsored by Meguiar's for the best vehicle first time shown. Some 30 cars that qualify are first judged for the pared down BASF Great 8. Each great 8 finalist is awarded a check for $1000. It all culminates with the announcement of the Ridler Award Winner chosen from the Great 8 and Meguiar's presents $10000 cash plus a custom trophy and jacket to the grand winner.

Additional highlights include the 2022 Preservation Award Recipient presented by Steele Products. This year it is The Khrome Shop Special – the 1934 Ford Coupe that is the 1984 past Ridler Winner and currently owned by Anthony Pisano.

There will also be a special 90th Anniversary of the 32 Ford Tribute Exhibit featuring 12 of the most beautiful and significant 32 Fords. Another special exhibit will show off one of the most famous customs of all time the Hirohata Merc worth 2 million dollars.

More than 200 of the most outrageous pinstripers from across the country will be in Detroit during all three days of Autorama to apply their artistry to items of every variety. They will demonstrate for the crowds and auction the items throughout the event with all proceeds going to Leader Dogs for the Blind. Demonstrations are ongoing. The live auction times are Friday March 4 at 4 p.m. to 5 p.m..; Saturday March 5 at noon to 1:30 p.m. 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Sunday March 6 at noon to 1:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.

This year more than 3000 middle school high school and trade school automotive students from nearly 50 Michigan schools will converge on Autorama on Friday March 4 at 9 a.m. for morning presentations by key hot rod builders and industry leaders to learn about career opportunities in this growing field. After hearing from industry leaders students will have the opportunity to visit the show and view the millions of dollars’ worth of hot rods and customs.

Other features at this year's Autorama include the 29th Annual Toy-A-Rama and the Pedal Car Challenge presented by Summit Racing Equipment.

Drive One educates students in fields such as automotive technology welding/fabrication automotive design and machine operation according to its website.

“This vehicle underwent a complete restoration from the ground on up” said Brandon Tregembo Jr. Roseville auto tech instructor and Drive One vice president.

The program has been part of Autorama’s colorful celebration of hot rods muscle cars trucks motorcycles and other four-wheeled contraptions for decades but this year presented a novel problem.

“The challenge of this one was because of COVID-19 it took us longer than it normally would have” Tregembo said Thursday. “It was scheduled to be done a year ago. The lost time to covid really stretched out the completion of the project.”

Returning after a COVID-19-caused one-year cancellation the 69th Annual Meguiar’s Detroit Autorama presented by O’Reilly Auto Parts takes over much of Huntington Place (formerly known as TCF Center/Cobo Center) Friday-Sunday.

The famed car event — billed as America’s Greatest Hot Rod Show — gives gearheads up-close looks at 800 custom autos from across the United States.

“Detroit Autorama was the first and is the most revered hot rod custom car show in the country” Peter Toundas president and owner of Championship Auto Shows Inc producer of Detroit Autorama said in a news release.

Dozens of Macomb County hot rodders will have the fruits of their efforts on display along with numerous other vehicles.

Organizers said one of the most popular additions is Autorama Extreme on the lower level of Huntington Place. It will feature more than 200 traditional rods customs and bobber bikes inspired by the 1950s entertainment by rockabilly bands and the Miss Autorama Retro Pin Up Girl Contest.

Several celebrities are scheduled to appear including Chip Foose from TV’s “Overhaulin;'” David Ankin from the TV show “Toymakerz;” AEW star and WWE Hall of Famer Sting; and Danny Koker and Kevin Mack from Counts Kustoms.

Detroit Autorama will be held at Huntington Place 1 Washington Boulevard. Hours are noon-10 p.m. Friday 9 a.m.-10 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Sunday.

Icahn critical of Occidental's outbidding of Chevron in a May 2019 deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum with $10 billion of financing from Warren Buffett had been campaigning for the ouster of CEO Vicki Hollub for almost a year when Occidental's shares plunged in March 2020 — allowing Icahn to boost his stake to 10% from 2.5% according to the Journal.

Now Occidental's shares are surging more than quintupling in value since they sank below $10 per share in 2020 largely thanks to the recent rise in oil prices. Its shares closed Friday at $56.15 apiece; that's just below where they were before the Anadarko deal was finalized according to the Journal.

Recently Icahn has been cutting his position in Occidental and he sold the rest of it in recent days according to a letter Icahn sent to Occidental's board on Sunday. Icahn's two representatives on the Occidental board will also resign the letter noted as required by a settlement agreement he had reached with the company two years ago this month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS9jYXJsLWljYWhuLWV4aXRzLW9jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtLXdzai0yMDIyLTAzLTA2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Activist investor Carl Icahn exits Occidental Petroleum after nearly three years -WSJ,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/carl-icahn-exits-occidental-petroleum-wsj-2022-03-06/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS9jYXJsLWljYWhuLWV4aXRzLW9jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtLXdzai0yMDIyLTAzLTA2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDUvYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LXJldmVhbHMtNS1iaWxsaW9uLXN0YWtlLWluLW9pbC1naWFudC1vY2NpZGVudGFsLXBldHJvbGV1bS5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDMvMDUvYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LXJldmVhbHMtNS1iaWxsaW9uLXN0YWtlLWluLW9pbC1naWFudC1vY2NpZGVudGFsLXBldHJvbGV1bS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berkshire Hathaway reveals $5 billion stake in oil giant Occidental Petroleum,"In his annual letter to shareholders released less than one week ago Warren Buffett complained he could ""find little that excites us"" in the equity markets.

However a new SEC filing from Friday night revealed that someone at Berkshire Hathaway either Buffett himself or his portfolio managers is very excited about Occidental Petroleum.

As of Friday Berkshire owns 91.2 million common shares of the oil giant. They're worth $5.1 billion at tonight's close of $56.15. The stock gained 18% today and 45% this week.

It's been moving sharply higher along with the price of oil which has soared to around $115 barrel in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

And as Occidental was rallying Berkshire was buying.

More than 61 million of the shares now in its portfolio were purchased on Wednesday Thursday and today at prices ranging from $47.07 to $56.45.

The other 29 million shares were purchased this year on or before Tuesday. (Berkshire reported holding no OXY shares as of December 31 in its latest 13F filing.)

Berkshire did not respond Friday night to CNBC's request for comment.

We don't know exactly when it bought or what Berkshire paid for those 29 million shares because it had not yet hit the 10% ownership level that requires new purchases be disclosed within day after they are made.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDYvaG93LXRvLWtub3ctd2hlbi1vaWwtcHJpY2VzLXdpbGwtY2F1c2UtYS1yZWNlc3Npb24td2hhdC10by1pbnZlc3QtaW4uaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzAzLzA2L2hvdy10by1rbm93LXdoZW4tb2lsLXByaWNlcy13aWxsLWNhdXNlLWEtcmVjZXNzaW9uLXdoYXQtdG8taW52ZXN0LWluLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to know when oil prices will cause a recession and what to invest in,"In this article .SPX

With the national average for a gallon of gas hitting its highest price since 2008 and the stock market on edge with the first land war in Europe since WWII being waged by one of the world's biggest crude oil producers crude oil prices and energy stocks are an area of focus for investors. It is hard for stock market participants to avoid the question are energy stocks which have had a huge run since the pandemic bottom still a buy given the geopolitical premium? But the related question could stop them in their tracks before continuing: will oil prices cause a recession? Bespoke noted last week that as of Friday morning WTI crude oil was up just over 20% within the week one of five periods where crude rallied more than 20% in a week. It noted that three of the prior four periods where prices spiked occurred during recessions. Rystad Energy one of the top global energy sector consulting and research firms expects a plunge in Russian oil exports of as much as 1 million barrels per day — and limited Middle Eastern spare capacity to replace these supplies — to result in a net impact that oil prices are likely to continue to climb potentially beyond $130 per barrel and relief measures such as releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve can't make up the difference. There is of course disagreement and contrarian takes. Citi's commodities team wrote last week it is becoming ""probable"" that oil prices have peaked already or could soon consolidate near a top. But that would require a de-escalation in the Russia invasion of Ukraine and progress on Iran talks. U.S. inventories are at or near lows but Citi says stock builds are on the way in 2Q'22.

For Nicholas Colas co-founder of DataTrek Research this is a good time to look at the value of energy stocks in a diversified portfolio and how to think about the risk of oil prices causing a recession.

When the price of oil signals a recession and how close we are to it

As an analyst covering the auto sector earlier in his career Colas remembers the presentation decks used by economists employed by the ""Big Three"" automakers three decades ago which they had been using since the 1970s oil shocks. ""The rule of thumb I learned from auto industry economics in the 1990s is that if oil prices go up 100% in a one-year period expect a recession"" he says. A year ago crude oil was $63.81 (March 4 2021) a barrel. Double that and that is the strike price for a recession. On Friday WTI crude was at $115 — by Monday crude oil had touched the $130 level as talks between the U.S. and allies about a ban on Russian oil imports picked up. ""We are close and getting there fast"" Colas said.

""We're at the point now where prices at the pump are higher on the way home from work than on the way in"" Bespoke wrote in a note to clients on Friday. But Colas added oil prices would need to be persistently over that doubling staying at $130 rather than merely spiking and pulling back quickly to be concerned. ""A day or two is OK but a few weeks is not"" he said. A big caveat: the evidence isn't deep. ""Recessions don't come along that often so we're talking three periods since 1990"" Colas said. Other market analysis argues that this is not the 1970s and oil represents a much smaller part of GDP and economic consumption than it did then. A JPMorgan analysis from last fall made the case that equity markets would hold up in an environment even with oil prices as high as $130 to $150.

Consumer demand gas usage and the economy

Still underneath it all oil prices drive gas prices and the consumer is 70% of the U.S. economy. ""When you take that much money out of their pocket it has to come from somewhere else"" Colas said. The spike in oil and gasoline prices comes just as commuting is returning to normal again as well with more companies calling back workers across the country as the omicron wave of Covid has declined. Office occupancy is currently running at 35%-37% and there is about to be much more commuting and miles driven with as much as 65% of workers currently at home for at least part of the week needing to commute in which will increase pressure on gas prices. Gas usage in the U.S. has been climbing steadily near 8.7 million barrels and trending up quickly.

The return to offices is not necessarily a bad thing for the economy as urban growth relies on it but at the same Colas says a broader economic environment with oil prices persistently above a 100% annual increase likely outweighs those benefits to GDP: ""Can we grow if oil prices stay here at 100%? Recent history says no."" He said there is evidence from recent periods when spikes in oil prices didn't spell doom for the economy but there was a key difference between those periods and today. Previous periods which were close to recession-inducing levels but when no economic contraction occurred include 1987 (+85%) and 2011 (81%). ""The issue here is that oil prices may have risen quickly but they were nowhere near unusually high levels relative to the recent past. Consumers in other words had already mentally budgeted for those levels and while they were certainly unwelcomed they were not a complete surprise"" Colas wrote in a recent note to clients. ""In 1987 we got a large spike on a percentage basis but not on an absolute basis versus the prior few years. From 2011 – 2014 the percent change off the 2009 – 2010 bottom hit 80 percent but on an absolute basis WTI was in line with the immediate pre-crisis past.""

The S&P 500 history of oil companies

The past decade has not been kind to the energy sector of the S&P 500 and most investors are underweight energy stocks. As of now the energy sector is 3.8% of the U.S. stock market. Even as energy stocks have bounced since the pandemic low of March 2020 their overall market profile has not risen. Consider that Apple (7%) Microsoft (6%) and Alphabet (4.2%) each have larger weights in the U.S. stock market than the entire energy sector. Farther back energy was 29% of the S&P 500 in December 1980 after a decade of oil shocks and huge gas price spikes. It was more or less what technology represents in the U.S. stock market today. Energy is a fundamental underweight and the reason for that has been understandable: energy has been either the worst-performing or second-worst performing sector in seven of the past 10 years. Nevertheless Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently doubled down on its Chevron investment (increased by about 30%) and last week revealed a $5 billion stake in Occidental Petroleum . It is possible that even if oil prices are a probable cause of a recession right now energy stocks — represented by sector ETFs such as XLE — are still buys.

This doesn't mean energy stocks would avoid the pain of a recession. The best thing for energy stocks isn't a rapid spike in oil prices like the one the economy is experiencing now but a gradual rise. Stocks in the sector may not even be positive in a recession but they may still outperform other sectors. ""All correlations go to one if the VIX is at 50"" Colas said referring to a measure of market volatility that would signal a crash. But he noted that the equity market so far doesn't want to crash based on its rebound from spikes in the VIX into the 30s as recently as last week. And the current geopolitical events and overall supply-demand imbalance in the crude market suggest that current oil prices are sustainable. Combined with the energy sector's diminished weight in the S&P 500 the sector's valuation as a whole ""is just ridiculous"" Colas said.

And it’s one that could serve the Monarchs well next week.

C.J. Keyser scored 16 points and ODU came from behind in the final minutes in a 68-64 upset win over first-place Middle Tennessee at Chartway Arena in the regular-season finale for both teams.

The fifth-seeded Monarchs (13-18 8-10 Conference USA) will open the league tournament Wednesday in Frisco Texas. And they’ll do so with a helpful confidence boost.

Austin Trice’s follow-up dunk to a Keyser layup gave ODU a 66-64 lead with 20 seconds left and Jaylin Hunter coolly followed a Blue Raiders miss with a pair of game-icing free throws with four seconds to go.

Old Dominion forward Austin Trice left celebrates with teammate Mekhi Long after Trice scored on a dunk to put the Monarchs ahead against Middle Tennessee late in Saturday’s game.

It was the kind of victory that can buoy a team at just the right time.

“It’s a lot of emotions” said Keyser one of three seniors honored before the game. “It feels good to get this last win in Chartway. I know I cried in the locker room. Everybody else cried in the locker room. It just feels good to get a momentum gain before our tournament.”

Donovan Sims scored 18 points for Middle Tennessee (22-9 13-5) which clinched first place in C-USA East last week. The Blue Raiders lost despite shooting 45.7% from the field to ODU’s 40%.

The Monarchs held Middle Tennessee scoreless for the final 2:11.

Leading by 10 ODU weathered a 12-0 run that gave the Blue Raiders a 48-46 lead midway through the second half.

It was a reversal of fortunes that might have doomed the Monarchs in other games this season.

Old Dominion guard Mekhi Long drives in for a dunk against Middle Tennessee guard Teafale Lenard during Saturday’s game at Chartway Arena.

“I think we regrouped” coach Jeff Jones said. “We talked about just how hard we had to play to just keep hanging in there and not hang our heads. We had to be stingy defensively make sure we rebounded the basketball and continued to take care of it.”

Middle Tennessee led 64-61 with two minutes left before the Monarchs closed with the game’s final seven points.

A three-point play by ODU forward Kalu Ezikpe tied the game at 64 with 1:48 remaining.

Ezikpe scored 14 points for the Monarchs who got double figures from four players.

Camryn Weston added 15 points for Middle Tennessee which made 8 of 21 from 3-point range.

The dreads-sporting Trice’s decisive dunk came after Keyser penetrated drew two defenders and threw up a shot that bounded off the back of the rim. When Trice threw it down the announced crowd of 5230 erupted as did Keyser.

It’s a micro-memory Keyser won’t soon forget.

“I just see 20 dreadlocks flying everywhere two people getting dunked on” Keyser said. “It was like a movie man. I couldn’t control myself at that point.”

Old Dominion guard Jaylin Hunter goes up for a shot against Middle Tennessee defenders Justin Bufford (4) and Josh Jefferson (11) during Saturday’s game at Chartway Arena.

Neither team led by more than five in a seesaw first half. The Monarchs took a 35-32 lead into halftime after shooting 42.3% and forcing five turnovers.

ODU last won the C-USA tournament in 2019. Saturday’s win over one of the league’s best teams offered evidence that anything is possible in Frisco though it’s far from a done deal..

“It’s one thing saying it. It’s one thing knowing it” Jones said. “It’s another thing to do it and that’s the challenge in front of us.”

MURFREESBORO Tenn. – The Old Dominion women's basketball team lost 62-44 at Middle Tennessee in the final regular season contest for both sides.



""We started the game and we were so anxious"" head coach DeLisha Milton-Jones said. ""We were so anxious that we weren't taking what was obviously there. At one point of the game we settled in but we had too many holes defensively.""



Brianna Jackson paced the Monarchs (22-8 12-6 C-USA) with 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting with four rebounds and a steal. Mariah Adams had nine points and three boards.



The Lady Raiders (22-6 14-4) led 9-4 after a defensive first quarter. The game did not see its first points scored until nearly the midway point of the quarter when Anastasiia Boldyreva scored to start a 7-0 run by the hosts. Ashanti Barnes-Williams put the first points on the board for ODU at the 1:29 mark and Mariah Adams closed out the quarter with a late jumper.



Barnes-Williams was active early in the second quarter as the Monarchs pulled to within a point. The freshman from Norfolk Virginia corralled an offensive rebound then kicked it out for a 3-pointer by Kaylen Nelson. Barnes-Williams then attacked the rim aggressively drew two foul shots and hit one to make it a 9-8 score with 7:31 to play in the half. Courtney Whitson and Adams then traded jumpers before Middle Tennessee went on an 8-0 run to take a 19-10 lead with 3:23 to go. The ODU deficit reached 10 points twice before Aziah Hudson hit a 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer to make it a 24-17 game after 20 minutes.



Brianna Jackson began the second half with a personal 5-0 run to bring the Monarchs back to within a possession. She converted an old-fashioned 3-point play just 19 seconds into the half before knocking down a baseline jumper less than a minute later to pull Old Dominion to within two 24-22. MTSU hit three 3-pointers in the third and led by 10 37-27 at the end of the frame.



The Lady Raiders sank four more 3-pointers in the fourth and ended the game with 10 triples. Whitson had three as part of a game-high 16 points.



With the loss on Saturday the Monarchs drop to third place in the Conference USA East Division and will play in the second round of the C-USA Tournament on Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. ET. The Monarchs will draw the winner of Tuesday's first round matchup between No. 6 UTEP and No. 7 UTSA. The complete championship bracket will be released later on Saturday night.

Now it's time to win,"Michael Crow

opinion contributor

The COVID-19 pandemic has both revealed and confirmed vulnerabilities in America’s established systems practices and institutions – things we knew before and things we didn’t. Public health care education transportation and the global supply chain are just a few of the more prominent examples.

Our challenge today is to tighten gaps and to develop more resilient systems. Our mission to do this work is a shared responsibility.

One obvious area – and one in which the solution is achievable – is the microchip shortage that has impacted the supply of everything from automobiles and household appliances to the digital devices that keep us connected informed and productive in our work.

The pandemic has contributed to our awareness of this as consumers but it has only made more obvious what was already true – the United States has a semiconductor manufacturing capability gap.

America let itself fall behind on semiconductors

This is not something that happened to us. It is a consequence of our action and inaction.

In the late 1940s and 1950s America led the world in semiconductor manufacturing. Today only 12% of semiconductors are made in America; 80% are made in Asia. And none of the most advanced semiconductors are manufactured on U.S. soil.

The answer requires a whole-nation approach to rebuild the semiconductor and microchip manufacturing industry in the United States.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree that robust investments in semiconductor research design and manufacturing are critical to regaining American semiconductor leadership. In fact the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives have each advanced a $52 billion spending package to boost the R&D manufacturing and workforce that underpin the U.S. semiconductor industry.

It is imperative that Congress act swiftly to send a negotiated final bill to the president for his signature.

This is a giant opportunity for Arizona

Not only is this a critical agenda item for the country but it also represents an extraordinary economic opportunity for Arizona. Once these investment dollars are allocated plants will be built new companies will be born workers will be needed and high-paying jobs will be created.

The competition to be engaged will be as intense domestically as will be the competition globally to be the world’s industry leader.

We must reassert American technology dominance – and we must aim for nothing short of that. Dominance. That means driving all things forward to maximize American competitiveness. It means beating China and it also means competing vigorously with companies around the world especially in Asia and Europe.

Arizona has long been the place for high-tech industry focused on the manufacturing of electronics and aerospace products. These high-tech activities were primary drivers of the Arizona post-World War II economy continuing well into the 1980s.

Even as American manufacturing scaled back Arizona has kept a foothold and in 2022 there is new momentum. Today Intel headquartered in California is a global leader in technology innovation and is expanding its local facilities with a $20 billion investment.

TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world is making a $12 billion investment in a new chipmaking plant in north Phoenix and bringing suppliers with it. NXP Semiconductors chose to locate its new Gallium nitride fab in Chandler now home to the most advanced fab producing 5G cellular communication amplifiers in the United States.

ASU is ready to make this happen. Are others?

This doesn’t mean we’ve won the race – it means we are in the race. The work is just beginning.

The state is well positioned to reap the benefits of America’s renewed focus on the semiconductor industry and Arizona State University is prepared to put the full force of its resources including the nation’s largest engineering school to work to help make things happen. ASU is already the largest supplier of employees to Intel.

Fueled by unprecedented federal investment there is much more the university can do to make Arizona the global hub for semiconductors. Last fall ASU added to its Fulton Schools of Engineering opening a new School of Manufacturing Systems and Networks.

At ASU’s Research Park the university has established Macro Technology Works a world class fab that advances research and development and is an asset to companies innovating in the microelectronics industry.

ASU brings not only the talent pipeline that a growing industry will need but it also provides the resources of one of the country’s top research universities. ASU ranks sixth for total research expenditures by institutions without a medical school exceeding $673 million in 2020 in use-inspired research. ASU also excels in working with startups and entrepreneurs a top 10 university in patents issued and ranked fourth in startups launched.

The university in its service to the people of Arizona is ready to do its part.

Arizona’s elected officials our economic development organizations our business and education leaders and citizens engaged across the state must advocate for Congress to act swiftly to fund America’s semiconductor manufacturing renaissance.

Returning to a dominant position globally in the advancement of technology is a call to the competitor in all of us.

It’s winning time. Let’s work together and make it happen.

On Thursday Taiwan's state-run Xingda power plant experienced a failure that affected a large portion of the island's residents and businesses. It caused power decreases and grid failures across the nation and hit several regions that are home to Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturers. TSMC is currently assessing the impact after observing voltage drops lasting between 400ms and 1000ms at some locations.

The Xingda plant run by Taipower supplies an estimated one-seventh of Taiwan's total electrical output. The outage lasted 90 minutes and affected an estimated five million households. The cause of the incident was attributed to a failure in the station's turbine room which triggered an emergency shutdown to avoid further damage. It resulted in cascading blackouts across the island and a 10.5MW drop in total power supply.

Several of Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturers were affected and continue to assess the situation. The most notable companies affected were the well-known Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Innolux which is currently Taiwan's largest display panel manufacturer. According to UMC another semiconductor manufacturer in the region there was a manageable impact on their UMC Nanke plant.

TSMC's initial assessment states that any production problems resulting from these power fluctuations should be negligible. However the overall effect of the 90-minute incident is still being assessed. Innolux is also continuing to assess the impact to their production operations and as of Friday the company's facilities were still running on backup generators.

Despite TSMC's claims of little to no impact the delays stemming from the 90-minute incident could cascade down and ultimately extend the already hobbled semiconductor industry's chip shortage. For decades semiconductor manufacturers have relied on lean manufacturing a manufacturing methodology that focuses on providing customers with what they need when they need it. That means low to no additional inventory or surplus and almost no room for error during manufacturing and delivery. Any delays in this type of environment can result in missed or delayed shipments affecting both TSMC's upcoming deadlines as well as deadlines for customers that rely on those nodes for their own products.

But the decisions didn’t come unprompted. Ukraine has lobbied the major tech companies in the same way it sought assistance from the European Union NATO and the US government.

Facing the largest military action in Europe since the second world war Ukraine appealed directly to big tech companies as though they were nation states. It’s a reminder that in today’s world these giants are major players on the geopolitical stage.

So what impact could the tech-related sanctions have?

The Big 5’s response

Google’s response to the crisis has come in two parts. The first has been finance-related. The company has limited the use of Google Pay in Russia for customers or merchants that use a sanctioned bank.

It has also stopped selling online advertising in Russia across its services and has removed the ability for Russian state media outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik to monetise content on YouTube (which is owned by Google). RT and Sputnik have also been blocked in Europe.

Foxtel has removed RT in Australia but it’s still available on YouTube with ads in the livestream. That means RT can earn direct revenue from advertising in Australia but no advertising revenue from YouTube. Google Search and Maps both remain available in Russia.

Apple has gone several steps further than Google. The company has suspended all product sales in Russia and Apple Pay and other services have been limited. It has also blocked RT and Sputnik from the Apple App Store everywhere outside of Russia.

Meta has removed access to RT and Sputnik on both Facebook and Instagram (which it owns) and has removed the option for state media to monetise content on any of its platforms. It is also demoting posts that contain links to Russian state-controlled media websites on Facebook.

Amazon has taken the path of supporting cybersecurity efforts in Ukraine and offering logistical support as announced on Twitter by chief executive Andy Jassy. However Amazon hasn’t yet taken any action to reduce the revenue it receives from Russia.

Microsoft has also helped on the cybersecurity front. It identified a potential Russian cyber attack in Ukraine on February 24 helping efforts to thwart it. In addition it has banned all advertisements from RT and Sputnik across its ad network and blocked access to both channels in the European Union.

(Almost) no chips for Russia

Two of the largest US semiconductor (microchip) manufacturers Intel and AMD have ceased supplies to Russia. Although the official US sanctions prohibit the export of “dual use” devices with both military and non-military purposes Intel and AMD have gone a step further and halted all supplies at this stage.

Perhaps more importantly the major Taiwanese supplier TMSC has stopped supplies. TMSC makes chips for Russian manufacturers such as the Russian Scientific and Technical Centre Module Baikal Electronics and Marvel Computer Solutions. There are no alternative semiconductor fabrication plants in Russia.

Samsung Electronics another major chip manufacturer also announced on Saturday that it would suspend shipments. Samsung leads mobile phone supplies in Russia and prior to the suspension on Saturday would have stood to benefit from Apple’s decision to stop sales in the country.

But not all tech companies have given in to political pressure. South Korean chip fabricator SK Hynix has not yet decided to limit supplies (as of when this article was written).

It seems the South Korean government wants to continue supplying semiconductors to Russia as it has sought exemptions from the US in respect to actions that could negatively impact its semiconductor industry.

Other consequences

Apart from the more directly imposed restrictions Some Meta and Google services were also blocked after users subverted them for political messaging. For example social media users across the globe began using Google reviews of restaurants in Moscow and St Petersburg to send information to Russian citizens.

As a result new reviews in Russia and Ukraine have now been restricted by Google. That is Google has acted to avoid delivering potential disinformation from either side.

And both Meta and Google have restricted some of their location-based services in Ukraine to limit potential military use.

What’s the immediate impact?

The actions of Meta and Google and any loss of ad revenue they previously afforded will have an immediate but relatively small impact on the Russian state – much smaller than the impact from direct financial sanctions.

And not being able to use Google Pay or Apple Pay is still not as inconvenient for Russian citizens as being unable to use ATMs – many of which have run out of notes.

On the other hand the loss of access to Apple hardware could have a much more lasting impact on Russian consumers.

The overall effect of the various sanctions will be a slowing down of the Russian economy – especially the digital economy which is reliant on semiconductors. However this too will have a small immediate impact.

Corporate decisions

There was no legal or regulatory obligation for chip manufacturers and tech companies to limit the export of goods and services to Russia. Instead the move seems to have been prompted by two key incidents.

First was the very public and direct appeal by Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov to the tech companies asking them to take action.

Second was the need to meet stakeholders’ expectations. This can be characterised as “corporate social responsibility” or as social licence.

Both Apple and Google responded to calls for help from members of the Ukrainian government. Google’s philanthropic arm and its employees are directly contributing US$15 million to relief efforts in Ukraine.

While the US sanctions didn’t demand for the tech companies to stop trading with Russia entirely the signalling from both the US government and Ukrainian officials provided a persuasive context.

It has raised the spectre of multinational tech companies deciding which “side” to support based on a stakeholder perspective rather than a legislated one. It seems in the end stakeholder views are still the chief driver of Big Tech’s response to ethical dilemmas.

Cyberwarfare has been an increasingly contentious aspect of many cyberattacks especially in recent years and this campaign by Russia has been pivotal in shaping the future of IT security in warfare.

In response to the unfortunate situation in Ukraine a new wave of hacking activities has started. In fact the cyber-crime rate has tripled in Ukraine since Russia’s recent interference. Many security-related companies have stepped up their effort to combat this issue.

Furthermore software development companies are getting out of Russia and choosing to conduct business with countries that support Ukrainian cyber-freedom rather than supporting Russian aggression.

Cisco Supporting Ukraine

Due to ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia Cisco along with several other tech companies decided to stand with Ukraine.

Second of two parts

A descriptive or generic word can only be registered as a trademark when the word has acquired a secondary meaning or if the descriptive or generic word is attached to another word to make up a trademark.

But there are also originally legally protected trademarks but have been genericized and have lost their legal status after becoming generic terms. These include “Aspirin” which was a trademark but declared generic in the US “Cellophane” also genericized in the US and “Escalator” which was originally a trademark of Otis Elevator Co. Other brand names that have become generic words for a type of product and has in some cases resulted in companies losing their trademarks would include “Kleenex” which has become interchangeable with tissue “Bubble Wrap” “Thermos” which lost its trademark after being declared generic in 1963 “Frisbee” “Popsicle” “Laundromat” “Taser” “Yo-yo” “Kerosene” “Jacuzzi” “Jeep” “Ping Pong” “Zipper” “Band-Aid” and “Jet Ski” which is a trademark still maintained by Kawasaki but which may soon lose the battle to preserve its exclusive use just like in the case of “Velcro” which is registered to the company with the same name.

Colors and shapes are by themselves also not capable of being registered as trademarks in the Philippines under present laws unless the colors are defined by a given form or part of a composite mark but there should be a disclaimer and the person who registers them as part of a mark will not acquire ownership thereto.

Trade dress or the look and feel of a product or place may be registered as trademarks only upon showing of proof of acquired distinctiveness according to Bureau of Trademarks director Jesus Antonio Ros.

Aside from serving as means to indicate the origin of the goods to which they are attached to guarantee the standard of quality of the goods and to advertise the goods trademarks can also be very valuable intangible assets.

Among the most valuable brands in the world are the trademark “Amazon” which is valued at $220 billion “Google” ($160 billion) “Apple” ($140 billion) “Microsoft” ($170 billion) and “Samsung” ($94 billion).

When Jollibee Foods Corp. acquired Mang Inasal Philippines Inc. from Injap Investments Inc. Jollibee paid about P700 million for tangible assets and P3 billion for IP-related assets which includes Mang Inasal’s trademark.

There is now a bill pending in Congress that seeks to amend the IPC that would expand the list of what marks can be registered as trademarks and therefore can be appropriated exclusively use of a business.

Presently marks are limited to visible signs and there is a proposal to remove the word “visible” which would allow the registration of non-traditional trademarks like color alone smell sound and taste.

In other jurisdictions colors by themselves are registrable. Some of the colors registered as trademarks abroad would include Barbie Pink 3M Yellow Louboutin Red Coca-Cola Red to name a few.

There are also registered sounds in other countries like Netflix’s “Da Dum” sound ESPN’s “DaDaDa-DaDaDa” or even Darth Vader’s “breathing” sound or the distinct sound produced by lightsabers when wielded retracted or swung which are trademarked by Lucasfilm.

Awareness in terms of the importance of trademark registration has increased especially during the pandemic.

In the US it is said that in December 2020 alone the USPTO received 92608 applications an increase of 172 percent over Dec. 2019. In China trademark applications increased 20 percent in 2020 over 2019. For 2021 European Union IPO trademark filings increased 23 percent compared to 2020. United Kingdom trademark applications also increased 31 percent in 2020. In many countries including the Philippines notable also was the increase in new filings from small and medium-sized enterprises as well as individuals.

Worldwide the World Intellectual Property Office said that around 13.4 million trademark applications were filed in 2020 up 16.5 percent compared to pre-pandemic 2019 which WIPO said is striking since many countries experienced economic downturn. Eleven trademark offices recorded double-digit growth with Indonesia posting a 44.3 percent increase.

The increase WIPO noted may also be due to the fact that enterprises have brought new products and services to the market and also because many anticipate a strong recovery. The IP office of China accounted for 73.1 percent of the 2020 increase in global trademark filings followed by the US with 9.6 percent.

These indeed are interesting times which might even turn into a golden era for IP.

Security efficiency has increased by 80% and the university is on track to achieve a zero trust architecture.

NWU security team faced an array of threats from ransomware and cyber espionage to file less attacks and damaging data breaches.

To resolve the issue Martin Venter NWU Manager of Systems and his team conducted a rigorous proof of concept (POC) analysing five different endpoint security technologies including Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR in a controlled sandbox environment.

Cortex XDR outperformed the other endpoint security platforms in almost every respect.

The requirements included the ability to:

Understand and track user identity information.

Simplify and streamline security operations automating processes where possible.

Move NWU towards a zero trust security architecture.

Safeguard large complex legacy Windows server estate including around 250 servers.

Minimise the mean time to detect and respond to vulnerabilities.

Adopt security posture based on behavioural analytics not scripts.

Today NWU’s Cortex XDR platform blocks advanced malware exploits and file less attacks using behavioural threat protection artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based analysis. Seamless integration with the ML-Powered NGFW has created an effective and complete cyber security portfolio – and moved the university forward on its journey to becoming a zero trust enterprise.

Palo Alto Networks in partnership with KHIPU has simplified NWU’s security operations with the below benefits:

The unified portfolio offers safety and security;

Improved student and staff experience;

Increased operational efficiency;

Enhanced security agility and productivity; and

Provides a simple intuitive experience.

“KHIPU is one of the most professional and forward-thinking technology partners I have ever encountered. Their professionalism proactive approach and expertise enabled NWU to get value from the endpoint security solution almost immediately. They are also always looking ahead identifying innovations to help NWU stay in front of change” said Venter.

n A team from TA competed in the UAB Blazer42 Capture the Flag Cyber Security Competition on Feb. 25. The competition was sponsored by the UAB Department of Criminal Justice and Palo Alto Networks.

The team consisted of Jesse Wells Sam Zito Sam Daly and Jonas Schanz.

There were six teams from across the state. Each team was composed of four members. The contest began at 9:30 a.m. and lasted until 2:30 p.m. A full day of focusing on a task and working together as a team to solve problems.

The contest consisted of a world map with clues to help capture flags to various countries. The questions and clues were ranked easy medium and hard. The TA team was the first to score. They went on to capture flags from several countries. In addition to capturing they had to defend their captured flag. Questions had them analyze data find hidden or deleted files find clues encrypted in images etc.

The TA team finished in second place. As the second place team they won $8000 in scholarship offers from UAB.

The shortcoming resides in a Linux kernel feature called control groups also referred to as cgroups version 1 (v1) which allows processes to be organized into hierarchical groups thereby making it possible to limit and monitor the usage of resources such as CPU memory disk I/O and network.

Tracked as CVE-2022-0492 (CVSS score: 7.0) the issue concerns a case of privilege escalation in the cgroups v1 release_agent functionality a script that's executed following the termination of any process in the cgroup.

""The issue stands out as one of the simplest Linux privilege escalations discovered in recent times: The Linux kernel mistakenly exposed a privileged operation to unprivileged users"" Unit 42 researcher Yuval Avrahami said in a report published this week.

The man page for cgroups explains its function as follows –

Whether or not the release_agent program is invoked when a particular cgroup becomes empty is determined by the value in the notify_on_release file in the corresponding cgroup directory. If this file contains the value 0 then the release_agent program is not invoked. If it contains the value 1 the release_agent program is invoked. The default value for this file in the root cgroup is 0.

Specifically the Palo Alto Networks threat intelligence team noted that the bug is a consequence of a missing verification to check whether the process setting the release_agent file had administrative privileges thereby making it ripe for potential exploitation.

In other words should this release_agent file be overwritten by an attacker the kernel can be forced into calling an arbitrary binary configured in the release agent with the highest possible permissions – a scenario that could effectively allow a complete takeover of the machine.

It's however worth noting that only processes with ""root"" privileges can write to the file meaning that the vulnerability solely permits root processes to escalate privileges.

""At first glance a privilege escalation vulnerability that can only be exploited by the root user may seem bizarre"" Avrahami explained. ""Running as root doesn't necessarily mean full control over the machine: There's a gray area between the root user and full privileges that includes capabilities namespaces and containers. In these scenarios where a root process doesn't have full control over the machine CVE-2022-0492 becomes a serious vulnerability.""

Although containers running with AppArmor or SELinux are protected from the flaw users are recommended to apply the patches in light of the fact that it could be abused by other malicious host processes to elevate privileges.

This is far from the first time release_agent has resurfaced as an attack vector. In July 2019 Google Project Zero researcher Felix Wilhelm demonstrated a ""quick and dirty"" proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit leveraging the feature to break out of privileged Kubernetes and Docker containers.

Then in November 2021 cloud native security firm Aqua disclosed details of a cryptocurrency mining campaign that used the exact same container escape technique to drop the XMRig coin miner on infected hosts making it the first recorded instance of real-world exploitation.

""CVE-2022-0492 marks another Linux vulnerability that can be exploited for container escape"" Avrahami concluded. ""Fortunately environments that follow best practices are protected from this vulnerability. Environments with lax security controls hosting untrusted or publicly exposed containers are unsurprisingly at high risk.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbW96aWxsYS1maXJlZm94LTk3MDItZml4ZXMtdHdvLWFjdGl2ZWx5LWV4cGxvaXRlZC16ZXJvLWRheS1idWdzL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbW96aWxsYS1maXJlZm94LTk3MDItZml4ZXMtdHdvLWFjdGl2ZWx5LWV4cGxvaXRlZC16ZXJvLWRheS1idWdzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mozilla Firefox 97.0.2 fixes two actively exploited zero-day bugs,"​Mozilla has released Firefox 97.0.2 Firefox ESR 91.6.1 Firefox for Android 97.3.0 and Focus 97.3.0 to fix two critical zero-day vulnerabilities actively exploited in attacks.

Both zero-day vulnerabilities are ""Use-after-free"" bugs which is when a program tries to use memory that has been previously cleared. When threat actors exploit this type of bug it can cause the program to crash while at the same time allowing commands to be executed on the device without permission.

These bugs are critical because they could allow a remote attacker to execute almost any command including the downloading of malware to provide further access to the device.

The zero-day vulnerabilities fixed by Mozilla are:

CVE-2022-26485 : Use-after-free in XSLT parameter processing - Removing an XSLT parameter during processing could have lead to an exploitable use-after-free. We have had reports of attacks in the wild abusing this flaw.

: Use-after-free in XSLT parameter processing - Removing an XSLT parameter during processing could have lead to an exploitable use-after-free. We have had reports of attacks in the wild abusing this flaw. CVE-2022-26486: Use-after-free in WebGPU IPC Framework - An unexpected message in the WebGPU IPC framework could lead to a use-after-free and exploitable sandbox escape. We have had reports of attacks in the wild abusing this flaw.

As Mozilla's security advisory explains the Firefox developers are aware of ""reports of attacks in the wild"" actively exploiting these vulnerabilities.

While Mozilla has not shared how threat actors use these zero-day vulnerabilities in attacks it was likely done by redirecting Firefox users to maliciously crafted web pages.

These vulnerabilities were discovered and disclosed to Mozilla by Chinese cybersecurity company Qihoo 360 ATA.

Due to the critical nature of these bugs and they are being actively exploited it is strongly recommended that all Firefox users update their browsers immediately.

You can also download the latest version of Mozilla Firefox for Windows macOS and Linux from the following links:

Users can manually check for new updates by going to the Firefox menu > Help > About Firefox. Firefox will then automatically check for and install the latest update and prompt you to restart your browser.",,,

It’s been a dramatic couple of weeks in the entertainment and media sphere as the soon-to-be Warner Bros. Discovery grappled with an abrupt leadership change atop CNN ViacomCBS rebranded as Paramount Global and Netflix and the other Hollywood studios pulled out of Russia amid Vladimir Putin’s escalating war on Ukraine. Puck founding partners Matthew Belloni and William D. Cohan break down what it all means for Wall Street and the future of entertainment in the post-Covid post-streaming post-everything era.

Matt Belloni: Bill you floated in a column that the recently exited CNN president Jeff Zucker might be a good fit to run Paramount Global (the former ViacomCBS). Not sure I agree with that. Zucker had some stumbles as C.E.O. of NBC Universal from 2007-2011. I remember when he put the erratic Ben Silverman in charge of NBC which everyone knew would be a disaster. (It was.)

Zelenskyy described the awful toll of the conflict on people in Ukraine and called for governments to provide military aid so that the Ukrainian army would be able to repel Russia’s invasion. He saved his strongest words for ordinary citizens who have the power he said to turn the tide of the conflict.

“We know that regular people around the world can hear us can understand us better than any politician” Zelenskyy said. “Politicians always follow people so please speak up I beg you to speak about Ukraine go to the main squares of your cities. Support us show your strong position show your support to Ukraine.”

He added: “We all are people of this world. We should be together we should be strong and show solidarity.”

Ukraine has been calling on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to “close the skies” or create a “no-fly zone” over the country but heads of states have so far declined because that would entail shooting down Russian planes and escalating the conflict into a global war. In his message Zelenskyy called instead for additional military equipment and supplies so that Ukraine itself would be able to impose the “no-fly zone.”

Stopping Russia’s fighter jets is paramount according to Zelenskyy because they have caused the most damage with aerial bombardments destroying infrastructure reducing whole city blocks to rubble and killing countless people.

“If Western politicians are scared we are saying: Let us do it” he said. “Give us the Ukrainians warplanes and fighter jets which we can use to protect ourselves our children our friends our parents our cities our memory our architecture. Give Ukraine anti-missile defense to guarantee that no one will blast [a] nuclear power plant and Ukraine and all of Europe won’t be destroyed. What else [is there] to think about?”

Zelenskyy warned that the rest of the world is at risk as long as the Russian invasion continues.

Efforts are being made to halt the conflict. The United Nations with support from governments and organizations around the world is providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine and working around the clock to secure a ceasefire and achieve peace.

But in the course of a little over a week the Russian invasion has caused catastrophic harm.

While exact figures are still hard to discern it’s estimated that hundreds of civilians and thousands of soldiers have died and more have been wounded since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24. More than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine with additional people internally displaced within the country.

Apartment buildings schools and hospitals have been bombed. Vital infrastructure such as energy centers metro stations and water systems have been damaged and even destroyed. As a result people in Ukraine have lost access to shelter health services food water education and other basic needs putting them at risk of extreme poverty.

Meanwhile Russian troops have occupied a nuclear power facility that if harmed could dwarf the devastating impact of the 1986 Chornobyl nuclear disaster.

The Ukrainian military has mounted a determined resistance against Russian forces to protect towns and cities and repel the invasion. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers have taken up arms to protect their homes. Zelenskyy himself has set an inspiring example by joining the front lines vowing to stay in Ukraine until the very end.

But the world must stand together to demand the only just outcome: the immediate withdrawal of the Russian army from Ukraine. Take action with us now to support the people impacted by the invasion of Ukraine rally for lifesaving aid and call for peace.

Read the full transcript of Zelenskyy's call to action below:

You all know what terrorism is: taking hostages blasting airplanes.

But now you see something even more horrible — it is not individual not a one-man terror not some marginal terrorist organization. You see the state the terrorist state the state which planned to destroy cities of Ukraine with cruise missiles aero bombs artillery; the state which allows itself striking nuclear power plants with tanks.

No other terrorist has done that before. The world should react decisively and most importantly — fast.

The world has to stop the government of Russia stop Russia has to stop shelling everyday bombing.

If western politicians are scared we are saying: let us do it.

Give us the Ukrainians warplanes and fighter jets which we can use to protect ourselves our children our friends our parents our cities our memory our architecture.

Give Ukraine anti-missile defense to guarantee that no one will blast nuclear power plant and Ukraine and all of Europe won’t be destroyed.

What else to think about?

Imagine yourself an ordinary hospital for example in Paris. I don’t wish for this but imagine for a second. Either a school in Chicago or a residential area in the center of Berlin.

What would you do if terrorists destroyed them completely with missiles with air raids with bombshells as it is happening here in Ukraine in our Kharkiv in our Chernihiv in our Mariupol in Odesa you all know the city of Odesa? And other cities!

This happens in Ukraine every day every single day.

Thousands of peaceful civilian objects destroyed. We know that regular people around the world can hear us can understand us better than any politician.

Politicians always follow people so please speak up I beg you to speak about Ukraine go to the main squares of your cities.

Support us show your strong position show your support to Ukraine.

It’s impossible to bear it when terrorists kill. It’s impossible to make concessions all the time they are terrorists!

It’s important to help the victims of terror. It’s important to help oneself. Because a terror doesn’t recognize borders. Borders don’t exist for terrorists. Terror always seeks new victims.

We all are people of this world. We should be together we should be strong and show solidarity.

Always and especially now humanity should make demands to the terrorists and not the other way around.

Ukraine should have a right to defend itself. Protect our own life with your help.

Close the Ukrainian sky. Or help us close it by ourselves with your warplanes which you have but keep on the ground.

For us your help will be a survival a salvation in the sky. So that life remains on our ground. Together we should choose life.

And we should do it now."

In the third quarter Minnesota’s Jordan McLaughlin got a steal and had an easy layup coming in transition- or so it appeared.

Two members of the arena’s clean-up crew were mopping the court while McLaughin came sprinting toward the hoop and he ran right into one of them leading to a missed layup. Minnesota missed a putback attempt and Oklahoma City then headed the other way in transition.

The Timberwolves announcers for Bally Sports North couldn’t believe that play was allowed to continue on:

The best defense we’ve seen from Oklahoma City all season.

""Under the current circumstances we are suspending PayPal services in Russia"" Dan Schulman PayPal's CEO said in a letter addressed to the Ukrainian government.

The letter was posted on Twitter by Ukraine's minister of digital transformation Mykhailo Fedorov who has pressured businesses including Apple to Microsoft to cut ties with Russia.

""So now it's official: PayPal shuts down its services in Russia citing Ukraine aggression"" Fedorov tweeted Saturday. ""Thank you @PayPal for your supporting!""

A PayPal spokesperson confirmed the company was shutting down in Russia. The company will ""continue work to process customer withdraws for period of time ensuring that account balances are dispersed in line with applicable laws and regulations"" the spokesperson told CNBC.

The payment processor had already discontinued domestic services in Russia in 2020. This latest action relates to its remaining business in the country including send and receive functions and the ability to make international transfers via PayPal's Xoom remittances platform.

Russians were prevented from opening new PayPal accounts earlier this week the company said.

PayPal is the latest payment organization to sever ties with Russia which now faces a barrage of sanctions from the West over President Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.

Sanctions saw SWIFT the global interbank messaging network bar several Russian banks while Visa and Mastercard this week said they would also block Russian financial institutions from their networks.

""It's now basically impossible to send money to any individual in Russia"" said Charles Delingpole CEO of ComplyAdvantage a fintech start-up that helps firms with regulatory compliance.

Mastercard and Visa are also reportedly halting operations there.

In a statement Saturday PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said the company ""supports the Ukrainian people and stands with the international community in condemning Russia's violent military aggression in Ukraine.""

""PayPal has been working closely with governments and partners to actively comply with all applicable laws and sanctions"" Schulman said. A PayPal spokesperson added that the company will temporarily continue processing customer withdrawals to make sure account balances are dispersed in line with relevant laws.

PayPal had discontinued domestic services in Russia in mid-2020 but still allowed cross border transactions. Earlier this week it suspended the creation of new accounts. The company is also suspending its international money transfer service Xoom in Russia.

A key part of the West's response to the invasion has involved efforts to place economic pressure on Russia by disconnecting it from the international financial system. Late last month the US and its allies agreed to kick some Russian banks off the SWIFT secure messaging network a system that financial institutions worldwide use to send and receive money transfer orders.

Earlier in March Mastercard and Visa said they'd stopped processing transactions for Russian-sanctioned banks and later Saturday the Associated Press reported that the companies said they're suspending operations in the country. Mastercard cards issued by Russian banks won't be supported and cards issued outside the country won't work at Russian ATMs or stores. Visa transactions will stop in the coming days the company told the AP.

A number of tech companies have also stopped selling products and services in Russia as a response to the invasion which could make everything from iPhones to computer chips to video games harder to acquire in the country. Apple for instance has stopped online transactions there including limiting Apple Pay in addition to halting sales of its devices.

In the latest of an ever-growing number of companies making the same decision PayPal shut down its services in Russia. The move was a direct reaction to Russia's unprovoked war with Ukraine.

Ukraine's minister of digital transformation Mykhailo Fedorov posted a letter from PayPal on Saturday confirming the news. ""PayPal supports the Ukrainian people and stands with the international community in condemning Russia's violent military aggression in Ukraine"" the letter read.

Countless companies and service providers have cut off Russia in response to the war including tech giants like Microsoft Apple and Google. Cogent Communications the country's second-largest internet provider shut down in Russia this weekend.

Between massive companies ditching the country and devastating sanctions from the international community Russia is becoming increasingly isolated from the rest of the world.

PayPal is obviously a major financial service and it's not the only one to ditch Russia. Both Visa and Mastercard suspended operations in the country as well along with American Express. ""It’s now basically impossible to send money to any individual in Russia"" said Charles Delingpole CEO of ComplyAdvantage in an interview with CNBC covering the PayPal news.

It's unclear when if ever these major companies will return to Russia."

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson

McDonald's and PepsiCo along with many others are being urged to end their business in Russia.

New York state's comptroller wrote to several companies calling for action per Reuters.

British politician John Mann has made similar requests.

McDonald's and PepsiCo are among the food and drink companies facing calls from political figures to cut business ties with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

In a letter Friday Thomas DiNapoli New York state comptroller urged companies to rethink their Russian business operations because they face ""significant and growing legal compliance operational human rights and personnel and reputational risks"" Reuters reported.

He added that suspending or ending business in Russia ""would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market"" and play a key role in ""condemning Russia's role in fundamentally undermining the international order.""

McDonald's and PepsiCo did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

Other companies including Estee Lauder Kimberly-Clark Corp Coty Inc Mondelez International Inc Fortinet Inc Bunge Ltd Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and Trimble Inc were also asked in the letter to boycott business in Russia per Reuters.

Since Russian President Vladamir Putin invaded Ukraine in an unprovoked attack scores of companies have taken action by ending or limiting their commercial dealings with Russia.

Ikea Spotify and Nike were among the major companies that recently severed business ties with Russia. Some retail brands including Publix and Kroger also showed their solidarity with Ukraine by removing Russian vodka from store shelves.

British politician John Mann called for similar action to DiNapoli. In a tweet he said: ""If Mcdonalds and Starbucks continue to sell in Russia then an international boycott of their products should be instigated.""

Social media users have also called for company boycotts with McDonald's facing particular scrutiny.

One user who posted a photo of open McDonald's stores in Russia said: ""Guess who is doing business as normal in #Russia no surprise #BoycottMcDonalds.""

Another said: ""@McDonalds Leave #Russia or lose loyal customers the choice is yours. #BoycottMcDonalds.""

Three Ukrainian supermarket chains announced they are removing Coca-Cola products from their store shelves and the hashtags #BoycottCocaCola #BoycottPepsi and #BoycottMcDonalds were trending on Twitter over the weekend as customers vowed to shun their products so long as they continue to do business with Russia.

Dozens of big corporations including Apple and Netflix have halted operations in the country in the 10 days since President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine.

But while many firms have taken a stand several food and drink companies have stayed silent and refused to cut ties with Russia.

Major players including McDonald’s Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are now coming under increasing pressure from both political figures and social media users to pull their business from the country.

Ukrainian supermarket chain Novus said on Friday that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products – including Coca-Cola Fanta Schweppes and BonAqua mineral water – slamming the company as “shameless” for continuing to “work for the invaders in full strength”.

“Our supermarket chain no longer cooperates with the Coca-Cola company which continues to operate in the territory of the aggressor” the company said in a Facebook post.

“We are abandoning all products belonging to the brand.”

Supermarket chain Fozzy Group also said it was pulling products from shelves and stopping all future deliveries.

“From today we are removing all products from the shelves of Silpo Fora FOZZY Cash&Carry Market super Thrash (Thrash) stores and stop all future deliveries” the company said according to Interfax-Ukraine.

Varus also joined in the boycott citing the “official position of the Coca-Cola company to continue its activities in the market of the aggressor country”.

The boycott came after Russian state-owned media source TASS reported on Thursday that the company had pledged to keep business open in the country.

A spokesperson for Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company – the bottling company that has exclusive rights to distributing its products in Russia and other countries – allegedly told the outlet that “all operational production and logistics facilities of Coca-Cola in Russia are working”.

“We are fully responsible to partners society and thousands of our employees in Russia. Our top priority is the safety of our employees” the spokesperson reportedly said.

The Coca-Cola Company has not denied the statement.

On Thursday the company released a statement saying it was donating €1m to support the Red Cross movement in Ukraine as well as donations to Red Cross organizations in the neighboring nations of Romania Hungary Slovakia and Poland.

“While these are our actions today we will continue to monitor the situation closely” the company said.

The company did not mention Russia in the statement and called for “peace in the region”.

Meanwhile neither McDonald’s nor PepsiCo have released statements on Russia’s war on Ukraine.

New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli sent a letter to several major companies including McDonald’s and PepsiCo on Friday calling on them to halt operations in Russia.

He warned the companies that they face “significant and growing legal compliance operational human rights and personnel and reputational risks” by continuing to do business in the country.

A boycott from them would play a major role in “condemning Russia’s role in fundamentally undermining the international order” he wrote according to Reuters.

The letter was also sent to other major businesses including beauty giants Estee Lauder Cosmetics and Coty confectionery giant Mondelez and FMCG company Kimberly-Clark.

McDonalds has 847 restaurants in Russia with the country accounting for around 9 per cent of its total revenues according to the company’s website.

For PepsiCo Russia made up around 4 per cent of its global revenues last year with the company claiming to be the largest food and beverage manufacturer in the country.

Mountain Dew Legend is a black-colored soda that was designed by the companies to elevate Buffalo Wild Wings’ sauces burgers and other bar-food favorites. Mountain Dew says the flavor of Legend combines its classic soda with notes of blackberry citrus and ginger. It’s not to be confused with Mountain Dew Pitch Black a similarly hued special offering that first debuted in 2004.

Mountain Dew Legend is available at a select number of Buffalo Wild Wings locations now with a nationwide roll out planned for all locations by mid-May. The drink is the first exclusive PepsiCo beverage to be served at Buffalo Wild Wings similar to partnerships the soda giant has done with Taco Bell KFC and other chains.

There is no word on if the flavor is for a limited time or a permanent addition to Buffalo Wild Wings menu.

PepsiCo

This is not the only new offering from Mountain Dew to land in recent months. The brand has also released a boozy line of its sodas coming in four flavors: classic Mountain Dew Black Cherry Watermelon and the beloved Baja Blast.

Hard Mountain Dew is currently available in Florida Iowa and Tennessee but the company says more states will be added to the list throughout 2022.

You’ll also find new soda varieties from Pepsi and Coca-Cola both of which will be available in stores nationwide and not exclusive to a restaurant or specific states.

New Nitro Pepsi is the first nitrogen-infused cola to hit the market and the brand says it’s actually “softer than a soft drink.” It’s described as creamy and smooth with smaller bubbles than typical soda all topped off by a frothy foam made possible by a widget that’s placed inside each can. You’ll find it in two flavors Draft Cola and Vanilla Draft Cola beginning March 28.

Meanwhile Coca-Cola’s new Starlight flavor is currently available everywhere you’ll find Coke. The first limited-edition sparkling beverage from Coca-Cola Creations it has zero sugar and the brand says it has “flavors of unknown stars” that twirl together with the taste of CocaâCola. The can itself only describes Coca-Cola Starlight as being “Space flavored.”

What’s your favorite special flavor Mountain Dew has unleashed over the years?

But such outcomes heavily rely on the human side of the equation that until now tech hasn’t been able to crack: the patient’s decision-making process. With all the breakthrough tools and skilled doctors at our disposal actually acting on a recommended course of action whether a needle jab or an operation lies entirely in the patient’s hands.

And alongside inflated operational costs a patient’s nonadherence in health behavior such as refusal of treatment plays a deceptively significant role in health outcomes today. Those who experience good communications and have their personal concerns understood are more likely to adhere to health recommendations research by the Institute for Healthcare Communications shows. Of course beyond the macro outcomes for entire populations not acting upon certain recommended health behaviors has a detrimental effect on individuals themselves too.

None have recognized this more than MedOrion which recently unveiled the industry’s first AI-based Health-Behavior-Management (HBM) platform. Based in Tel Aviv the company’s core mission through innovating the patient journey is to guide health plans’ members toward better health decisions.

Using artificial intelligence MedOrion’s HBM platform moves beyond the traditional engagements existing systems health organizations currently use toward a focus on real long-term behavioral change. The company’s system analyzes each members’ claims as well as clinical and demographic information to create insights into members’ concerns regarding a variety of measures including medications vaccines and cancer screening.

One of the company’s early successes was working to increase HPV vaccination rates among 14-year-old children in a large HMO composed of more than 2.5 million members. By addressing each parent’s health decision barrier when it came to vaccinating their adolescents it was able to see a 6-12% increase in vaccination uptake. And after winning Pfizer’s Vaccines Global Innovation Challenge which was launched to find innovative approaches that address both patient education and access to vaccination MedOrion’s potential to affect better healthcare outcomes has seriously begun turning heads in the industry. Psychiatric medication illustrative (credit: Wikimedia Commons)

Today’s approaches have so far relied on the probability that an individual would be motivated by a certain message. Instead by understanding a health member’s barriers to adherence MedOrion turns the focus and asks why for example someone is not adhering to their medication. Is it because of side effects cost concerns? Or perhaps underestimating how much it could help?

Understanding individual member’s real-world concerns like these in turn empowers health providers to provide real-life actionable insight towards affecting positive health-related decisions. The company’s predictive behavior model can then personalize member communications across all active channels with each unique member dataset containing engagement habits insights from digital interaction and clinical history.

From its findings MedOrion states that its HBM platform by enabling health plans to create an end-to-end and nonabrasive member experience from day one yields providers a 20% rise in yearly revenues with member engagement also 30% less than existing solutions.

But perhaps more importantly one of the more heartwarming effects of MedOrion’s mission is in seeing as Adi Jacobson marketing vice-president at MedOrion puts it “the transformational journey health plan members undergo who respond profoundly to having their concerns understood and addressed.” Advertisement

Simply by learning to “see” people through the perspective of behavioral science and inserting the “why” into healthcare MedOrion has unearthed a fascinating new frontier for healthcare to affect better outcomes. And with global recognized entities like Pfizer giving its stamp of approval it’s only a matter of time before others in the health space latch on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd3lhdC5uZXQvMjAyMi8yNjc2ODcvcGZpemVyLXBheGxvdmlkLW1hbGF5c2lhLWNvbmRpdGlvbmFsLWFwcHJvdmFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Malaysia Gives Conditional Approval For Pfizer's Paxlovid COVID-19 Drug (UPDATED),"UPDATE (5 MAR / 4:20 PM): Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin has confirmed that Malaysia will receive 110000 patient-courses of Paxlovid in two weeks. As for the treatments from Merck and AstraZeneca the government also has plans to buy them but it has not been finalised yet.

ORIGINAL STORY (4 MAR / 1:25 PM):

Director-General of Health Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah has announced that the Drug Control Authority (DCA) has given conditional approval for the Paxlovid COVID-19 treatment drug made by pharmaceutical firm Pfizer. The product registration holder is Pfizer Malaysia and it is only approved for use on adults over 18 with a high risk of contracting severe symptoms from the virus.

Paxlovid is a combination treatment using nirmatrelvir and ritonavir taken orally and has been shown in clinical trials to be highly effective at preventing hospitalisation and death. Dr Noor Hisham reminded the public that the treatment is not a replacement for the vaccine and people should still do their best to follow SOPs.

The Ministry of Health (MoH) had already announced back in December that it was planning to procure the drug for use here but did not reveal how many courses will be purchased. Aside from Paxlovid Malaysia also plans to buy treatment drugs from AstraZeneca and Merck although the latter will only submit its pill for approval sometime this year. Another COVID-19 treatment called Ronapreve is also already in use in Sarawak.

The Pfizer treatment has already been approved in the US UK the European Union Israel South Korea Canada China and Singapore. The price of the drugs have not been revealed but for reference it cost the US government US$530 (~RM2200) for each five-day course which is cheaper than Merck’s molnupiravir at US$700 (~RM2900) for a five-day course.

Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh has said if the population does not show an interest in using the recently received Pfizer vaccines it would have an effect on TT receiving additional vaccines.

Speaking at the ministry’s virtual media briefing on Saturday Deyalsingh said the gift of vaccines from the US came with a proviso.

“We recently had to dump 260000 of the previously gifted vaccines. If we don’t use the 75000 doses or show an appetite to use all or significant portion of these we would be jeopardising our ability to receive any more vaccines especially the second part of the tranche of 150000. I just want to put that on the table that these Pfizer vaccines that the population was clamouring for at one time are here let us use them.”

He said the rollout of the newly received Pfizer vaccines began at mass vaccination sites on Saturday.

He said the rollout for the 12-18 age group would restart on March 14 as the ministry would be analysing why the uptake had been so low. He said at this point in time boosters are not needed for this age group.

“Our Extended Programme on Immunization (EPI) unit manager Grace Sookchand officials at the ministry and at a ministerial level with Minister Nyan Gadsby-Dolly and myself we want to do a little analysis as to why the uptake was so low. It is committing a lot of resources to do ten vaccines a day and so on.Nurse Sookchand along with her counterpart at the Education Ministry are doing a technical deep-dive into the issue and based on what we learn we are going to restart the programme in a better place from March 14.”

Deyalsingh said Tobago had asked for and received 1200 doses as an initial shipment.

Half of the third promised tranche of Pfizer vaccines – 75000 – arrived on Thursday making it a total of 684570 received from the US. This batch expires in June.

Last August the US donated 305370 doses of the Pfizer vaccine while last December 304200 doses were donated.

Last month Deyalsingh told a ministry briefing that the remaining balance of Pfizer due to TT from the US was about 286000 doses.

He had said with TT's Pfizer stock expiring at the end of February the government would get a fresh donation of 150000 doses from the US government to be delivered in two tranches of 75000 doses each the first due within a month which turned out to be Thursday.

In January Deyalsingh said TT was also seeking to acquire special paediatric doses of Pfizer vaccine for children 5-11. Dr Rowley said on Friday that vaccines had been acquired and he was looking forward to their arrival.

Deyalsingh said on Saturday that while there is no firm date for the receipt of covid19 vaccines for children 5-11 at this time the ministry would be asking parents to bring their children to be vaccinated as was done with the 12-18 age group.

As of Saturday just over 700000 people out of the 1.4 million population are vaccinated with either a single dose or two doses of a two-dose covid19 vaccine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hhcnAuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvcGZpemVyLW1ybmEtdmFjY2luZS1kbmEtZmFjdHMv0gE-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVjaGFycC5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9wZml6ZXItbXJuYS12YWNjaW5lLWRuYS1mYWN0cy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Pfizer Vaccine Combine With DNA In Liver Cells?!,"Spread the love

Did scientists prove that the Pfizer mRNA vaccine combined with the DNA of liver cells?!

Take a look at the viral claim and find out what the facts really are!

Claim : Pfizer mRNA Vaccine Combined With DNA In Liver Cells!

Anti-vaccination and ivermectin proponents have gone bananas over the new study from the Lund University in Sweden.

They are sharing it as evidence (finally!) of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine actually integrating with our DNA and changing our genome as they had always claimed.

Let that shock and horror sink in for a minute… and then let me explain to you what the facts really are in the next section…

Truth : Pfizer mRNA Vaccine Did NOT Combine With DNA In Liver Cells!

This is yet another example of vaccine fake news based on accidental / intentional misinterpretation of a single scientific study.

Here is what you really need to know about this Lund University study…

Fact #1 : Study Did NOT Say Pfizer Vaccine Alters Our DNA

First things first – the Lund University study is called Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line and you can read it in its entirety here.

If you read just the discussion you will note that the study authors actually pointed out that their study does NOT show that the Pfizer vaccine integrates with the liver cell DNA or alters it in any way.

At this stage we do not know if DNA reverse transcribed from BNT162b2 is integrated into the cell genome.

To be clear the study offers no evidence that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine alters our DNA in any way or form.

Fact #2 : It Was A Laboratory Study

I should also point out the obvious fact that this was an in-vitro study – a laboratory study not a clinical study.

In-vitro studies are important but they cannot be extrapolated to make any conclusion about what actually happens in a human body.

For example in-vitro studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have an inhibitory effect on the SARS-CoV-2 virus; but once tested in actual human beings – they are shown to have no clinical benefit.

In other words – what works in a laboratory may not work in an actual human being.

Fact #3 : Study Was Based On Liver Cancer Cells

The casual reader of the Lund University study will not realise that Huh7 (or Huh-7) cells are not ordinary liver cells that you or I have.

Huh7 cells were derived from the liver tumour of a 57 year-old Japanese man and are special because :

they are immortal liver cancer cells that can keep multiplying

they are highly-susceptible to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection

they are genetically different  with an abnormal number of chromosomes (between 55 and 63 normal human cells have 46)

The Huh7 cell line is useful for the study of liver cancer and Hepatitis C as well as drugs that may combat HCV; but it is important to understand that Huh7 cells are not representative of normal human cells.

Fact #4 : Huh7 Liver Cells Were Cultured In Plates

For a “more physiologically relevant study of viruses“ these Huh7 cells have to be cultured in a NASA-designed 3D Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor.

These RWV bioreactors create 3D aggregates of Huh7 cells that are more “similar in structure and function” to their in vivo counterparts with “completely altered gene expression and differentiation patterns“.

In other words these RWV-grown Huh7 cells look and behave differently more like regular human cells compared to plate-cultured Huh7 cells.

For the record the Lund University study used plate-cultured Huh7 cells and not RWV-grown Huh7 cells.

There is nothing wrong with that but we should keep in mind that these cells are not an ideal representation of human cells.

Fact #5 : Normal Human Cells Don’t Produce LINE-1 Enzyme

The scientists chose to use these Huh7 cells because like many cancerous cells they express (produce) the LINE-1 enzyme.

LINE-1 is a reverse transcriptase that converts mRNA into DNA so it is not surprising that the study would show it converting mRNA from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine into DNA. That is literally what it is meant to do.

Normal human cells have the LINE-1 gene but it is not expressed. Normal human cells do not produce the LINE-1 enzyme which is why they could not use regular human cells in this study.

That is also why it is inappropriate to use the Huh7 cell culture to evaluate how mRNA vaccines would actually work or behave in humans.

Fact #6 : Transcribed DNA Did Not Enter Nucleus

The study only looked at whether mRNA from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine can be transcribed into DNA by the LINE-1 enzyme.

As the study showed – yes it can… because that’s what the LINE-1 enzyme does. But the study does not show that the transcribed DNA entered the cell nucleus and altered human DNA.

While that is plausible it would require another enzyme called integrase that viruses produce to move that DNA into the cell nucleus itself.

Without the integrase enzyme the DNA transcribed by the LINE-1 enzyme will only float outside and will never integrate with the DNA inside the cell nucleus.

Fact #7 : mRNA Vaccines Do Not Modify Our Genes

An mRNA vaccine only contains a limited number of lipid nanoparticles containing those delicate mRNA instructions. So only a limited number of cells are involved in the vaccination process.

Even if it is somehow possible for the mRNA instructions from the vaccine to enter the cell nucleus and integrate with the DNA inside it will only affect those cells.

Our cells die and are replaced by new cells all the time so even if hypothetically the vaccine “infects” and modifies the DNA of a few hundred thousand cells those cells will eventually die and be replaced by new cells without the modified DNA.

It is simply not possible for mRNA vaccines to modify our genes.

Fact #8 : Viruses Integrate With Cell DNA

Viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 (diagram below) integrate their genes with the host cell DNA to hijack the cell and use it to produce copies of itself.

You can see how a typical RNA virus would infect a host cell convert its RNA into DNA which is moved into the cell nucleus using the integrase enzyme.

Once inside the viral DNA integrates with the host cell DNA which gets transcribed into instructions for the cell to produce copies of the virus.

This is the same way how the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects our cells to produce copies of itself to infect even more cells.

If you are truly worried about anything modifying your cell’s DNA you should try to avoid viral infections like COVID-19. Better still – vaccinate yourself and get protected against COVID-19!

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvamF6ei9uZXdzL2VuZC1zZWFzb24tZ3JhZGVzLWV2YWx1YXRpbmctamF6ei1rZXlvbnRlLWdlb3JnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of Season Grades: Evaluating Jazz PG Keyonte George,"Despite the Utah Jazz going just 31-51 on the year there were plenty of memorable and enjoyable pieces to the season. One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”"

We had a fantastic time at West Mountain for the Eastern Regional Championships. We started with a great day of training on Thursday running from the top of the Cure to the bottom on a GS course. What a treat. We managed to get our training in before the rain started which was a huge bonus. Thursday night it rained hard enough that I questioned whether it was monsoon season. The surface set up firm enough that we were able pull off the SG with a nice solid surface. (some may dispute nice when we describe the solid surface but it was a good race surface).



The GS and SL races for Saturday and Sunday were sunny and bright and the surfaces were once again nice and race solid.



We had some great hot competition among racers coming from five different regional Masters groups across the East and Rockies including SARA (Southern) New England NY Mid-Atlantic and Rocky Mountain. We had racers from many different states. Tennessee Utah Ohio NY NJ CT MA NH VT Delaware Virginia and Pennsylvania. A great showing from a broad set of locations.

Ochai Agbaji was the unanimous selection in earning Kansas’ 11th Big 12 Player of the Year honor while Baylor’s Scott Drew collected his third-consecutive Big 12 Coach of the Year accolade in the 2021-22 Phillips 66 All-Big 12 men’s basketball awards chosen by the head coaches.



For the first time in Conference history three players tied for Defensive Player of the Year as Baylor’s Jonathan Tchamwa Tchatchoua Oklahoma State’s Moussa Cisse and West Virginia’s Gabe Osabuohien shared the honor. Iowa State claimed first-year awards as Izaiah Brockington picked up Newcomer of the Year and Tyrese Hunter claimed Freshman of the Year. Kansas State’s Nijel Pack was voted as Most Improved Player while BU’s Jeremy Sochan was recognized with the Sixth Man Award.



The All-Big 12 First Team consisted of Agbaji Brockington and Pack in addition to the Bears’ James Akinjo and Texas Tech’s Bryson Williams. Agbaji and Williams were unanimous selections.



Agbaji was the league’s leading scorer in overall (19.8 ppg) and conference games (19.65 ppg). He was third in all games in field goal percentage (.477/208-436) second in 3-point field goal percentage (.411/86-209) second in 3-pointers made per game (2.87) and seventh in free throw percentage (.767/92-120). The senior guard averaged more minutes per game (35.2) than any other Big 12 player and led the Conference with 17 20-point games. Agbaji was a four-time Big 12 Player of the Week this season.



Tchamwa Tchatchoua is fifth in the league with 6.8 rebounds per game. He averaged 8.4 points and had nine blocks and 17 steals before suffering a season-ending injury on February 12. Cisse is the Big 12’s top shot-blocker with 54 for an average of 1.86 per game. He is sixth in the Conference with 6.52 rebounds and also averages 7.2 points while connecting on 55.9 percent (80-143) of his field goal attempts. Osabuohien averages 5.0 points and 5.5 rebounds good for 14th in the Conference. He also has 35 steals and 17 blocks.



In his first season with the Cyclones Brockington ranks third in the Big 12 in both points (17.55) and rebounds (7.23). He is also fourth in field percentage (.469/207-441) sixth in free throw percentage (.773/99-128) and second in minutes played (34.63). The senior guard earned four Big 12 Player of the Week honors and two as the top Newcomer.



Hunter started all 31 of Iowa State’s games in his rookie campaign. He was second on the team in scoring (10.8 ppg) and led the squad in total assists (155) and steals (59). His 5.0 assist and 1.9 steals averages were third in the Big 12 while his assist/turnover ratio (1.58) was seventh.



Sophomore guard Pack leads the Wildcats in nearly every offensive category including scoring (17.4 ppg) 30-point games (3) 20-point games (7) double-digit scoring games (27) and 3-point field goals made (92). He currently ranks 14th nationally and first in the Big 12 in 3-point field goals per game (3.29) while he is seventh in the nation and first in the league in 3-point field goal percentage (.436/92-211).



True freshman Sochan is a key contributor off the bench for the Bears. Playing 24.4 minutes a game he averages 8.7 points and 6.1 rebounds with totals of 45 assists 34 steals and 18 blocks. His rebounding average is 10th in the Conference.



Drew has guided Baylor to a second-consecutive Big 12 regular season title sharing this year’s crown with Kansas after both finished with 14-4 league records. The Bears are 26-5 overall and ranked No. 3 nationally in the AP Poll heading into the Phillips 66 Big 12 Men’s Basketball Championship. BU is ranked fourth in the NET and its 11 Quad 1 wins are the most in the nation.

Follow along for live updates between the Wildcats and Sooners.

PREGAME:

As expected K-State will be without Markquis Nowell who is not suited up due to a hamstring injury.

K-State's starting five: Nijel Pack Ish Massoud Selton Miguel Mark Smith and Mike McGuirl.

FIRST HALF:

15:24 OU 12 KSU 5: Oklahoma has gotten off to a hot start connecting on four 3-pointers early. Umoja Gibson has been big for the Sooners with nine of the 12 points for the visitors. Mark Smith has been K-State's only bright spot as the senior has all five Wildcat points.

11:50 OU 17 KSU 15: K-State's offense has started to click as some unlikely sources in Davion Bradford and Luke Kasubke each have a bucket. The 'Cats have hit their last three FGs and are within two.

8:26 OU 25 KSU 20: A 6-0 run from Oklahoma forces a Bruce Weber timeout. With Nijel Pack sitting with two fouls K-State will need some players to step up on offense.

7:07 OU 25 KSU 25: The Wildcats respond as a 5-0 run from K-State forces a Porter Moser timeout. Ish Massoud has given the 'Cats some great energy as the junior had a steal and layup on the possession before the timeout.

1:20 OU 38 KSU 34: After a long stretch without a dead ball we've finally got a stoppage in play and the Wildcats trail by four. However the Sooners have scored the games last eight points.

HALF: K-State trails Oklahoma at the half 38-37. McGuirl and Smith have carried the Wildcats as each have scored double figures.

SECOND HALF:

15:18 OU 47 KSU 47: Tanner Groves hit a 3-pointer on the Sooners' first possession but Oklahoman turned it over on its next three trips down the court allowing K-State to take a brief lead. However Oklahoma settled down and scored a few buckets tying the game at 47.

11:04 OU 54 KSU 49: A 30-13 rebound differential in favor of Oklahoma has really killed K-State. The Wildcats have hit just one of their last seven FGs.

6:35 OU 62 KSU 56: Nijel Pack recently picked up his fourth foul on a terrible call. Weber needs to get him off the bench and back in the game as his team is down by six. The officiating has been bad both ways but K-State has been on the short end of the stick as of late.

4:10 OU 70 KSU 62: K-State calls a timeout following an Ish Massoud 3-pointer which cut the deficit to eight points. K-State will have to play flawlessly over the final minutes if it wants a chance to squeak out a W.

2:20 OU 73 KSU 67: Mike McGuirl hit a layup and then both teams traded 3-pointers. Timeout Oklahoma who will have the ball.

15.8 OU 77 KSU 71: This one is all but over as K-State is down by six.

FINAL OU 78 KSU 71: The Wildcats fall to 14-16 on the season and 6-12 in the Big 12.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYmlnMTJzcG9ydHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi8zLzUvbWVucy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWthbnNhcy1iYXlsb3Itc2hhcmUtYmlnLTEyLXJlZ3VsYXItc2Vhc29uLXRpdGxlLmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kansas & Baylor Share Big 12 Regular Season Title,"Wednesday March 9 No. 8 K-State vs. No. 9 West Virginia (ESPNU) 6:00 p.m.

PXD,Pioneer Natural Resources,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L3RoZXNlLTMtb2lsLXN0b2Nrcy1hcmUtY2FzaGluZy1pbi1hcy1jcnVkZS1wcmljZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 3 Oil Stocks Are Cashing in as Crude Prices Top $100 a Barrel for the First Time in Years,"Higher oil prices are a boon for these oil stocks.

Oil prices continue their ascent this year recently topping $100 a barrel as Russia invaded Ukraine. They could push even higher if global governments place direct sanctions on Russia's oil industry. That would make an already tight oil market -- fueled by growing demand following the pandemic and years of underinvestment -- even tighter.

These higher oil prices are benefiting oil producers. Three oil stocks currently cashing in on triple-digit crude prices are Chevron (CVX 1.28%) Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN 0.63%). Here's why they're ideal options for investors who want to play the return of triple-digit oil prices.

Using the gains wisely

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Chevron): When U.S.-integrated energy giant Chevron reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings they were nothing short of impressive. Revenues came in at $48.1 billion with earnings of $5.05 billion or $2.63 per share. That was well above Q4 2020 when the company lost $0.33 per share on revenues of $25.2 billion. The big driver of the year-over-year improvement was basically rising oil prices. Given that oil prices continue to rise first-quarter 2022 results are likely to be just as impressive.

So clearly Chevron is cashing in on the high price of oil right now. But that's not what's most interesting here. What's more important is what Chevron is doing with this windfall and that's investing for the future -- only not the future of oil the future of cleaner alternatives. The company just announced plans to buy Renewable Energy Group (REGI). This $3.15 billion all-cash deal brings with it a collection of refining assets that use things like used cooking oil waste animal fats and vegetable oils as feedstocks. These renewable fuels allow Chevron to stick to its core as it greens its business.

Notably Chevron has been slow to shift toward cleaner alternatives which has aggravated ESG-inclined investors. However it is now proving that it has the scale and thanks to oil price increases the financial capacity to quickly get into emerging clean energy areas via acquisitions. So not only is Chevron benefiting mightily from higher oil prices but it's making sure that it makes good use of the opportunity that high prices are affording it.

A gusher of cash flow and dividends

Matt DiLallo (Pioneer Natural Resources): Pioneer Natural Resources made two bold moves when oil prices were lower setting it up to cash in on a future rebound in the oil market. In late 2020 it bought Parsley Energy for $7.6 billion. Last year it followed that up by spending $6.2 billion on DoublePoint Energy. The deals expanded its oil production and scale while reducing its costs.

These acquisitions enabled Pioneer Natural Resources to cash in on higher oil prices last year. The oil producer hauled in a record $3.2 billion in free cash in 2021. That included $1.9 billion in Q4 fueled by oil prices that averaged $76.38 per barrel in the period. Pioneer returned $1.9 billion of that money to shareholders via dividends and its share-repurchase program.

With crude oil recently topping $100 a barrel Pioneer will generate an even bigger cash flow gusher this year. That sets the company up to pay out an enormous amount of dividends given its unique framework. In addition to its base dividend -- which Pioneer recently increased by 25% -- it pays a variable dividend of up to 75% of its excess free cash flow each quarter. At $100 a barrel Pioneer could pay out up to $27 per share in dividends this year. That implies a potential dividend yield of more than 11% at the recent share price in the $240s. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) the U.S. oil-price benchmark was recently above $110 a barrel. The rise in crude prices will give Pioneer even more free cash flow to pay out in dividends.

That dividend framework makes Pioneer Natural Resources a great way for investors to cash in on higher crude prices this year.

Expect big dividends as oil prices rise

Neha Chamaria (Devon Energy): Given the unprecedented rally in oil prices investors in Devon Energy can expect a windfall. That's not an exaggeration. Devon Energy's war chest must be swelling with every rise in oil price and the company wants to return a large chunk of those incremental cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends. In other words as Devon cashes in on higher oil prices so should its investors.

Mid-February Devon reported stunning numbers for 2021. Its operating cash flow tripled in the year and the company generated its highest-ever free cash flows all thanks to higher commodity prices. The company didn't just boost its dividend but also its share-repurchase program.

Wait. To say Devon simply boosted its dividend would be an understatement. The thing is Devon pays a fixed as well as a variable dividend under a new dividend policy it initiated in 2021. So far every quarter Devon was paying a fixed dividend of $0.11 per share and a variable dividend equal to 50% of the extra cash flow it's left with after covering its capital expenditure and fixed dividend.

That policy has brought in solid passive income to shareholders so far including a record total dividend of $1.00 per share they're about to receive based on the company's stellar Q4 cash flow growth.

Now Devon has increased its fixed quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share. At the same time its variable dividend component should zoom now that crude oil has surpassed $100 per barrel. With Devon's lower cost production also rising after its merger with WPX Energy in early 2021 it's a win-win time to be a shareholder in this 4.5%-yielding stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzMwYjIyOTg2LTg1ZmQtNDUwZi05ZTYyLTIyYjRmYzYxMTIyY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil price rises to highest level since 2008 on talk of Russia oil sanctions,"Print this page

Simply sign up to the Oil & Gas industry myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

The price of Brent oil soared to almost $140 a barrel its highest price since 2008 in early trading on Monday after reports that western countries were discussing a possible embargo on crude supplies from Russia the world’s second-biggest exporter.

The price spike came after US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Sunday that Washington was in “very active discussions” with European allies about a ban on Russian oil exports.

The move would signify a new escalation in the west’s efforts to punish Russia — whose economy remains heavily dependent on oil and gas exports — for its invasion of Ukraine. It also marks a reversal for the White House which has repeatedly said new sanctions would not target Russian oil and gas flows.

Russia exports almost 5m barrels a day of crude or about 5 per cent of total world demand and is a crucial supplier of refined petroleum products to Europe and elsewhere.

Analysts have said the loss of Russian supplies could push prices to record highs by removing barrels from an oil market that has been left exceptionally tight by rising post-pandemic consumption and tepid supply growth.

“This rocket ride for crude shows that despite the rhetoric by a few that the world can go without some or all Russian crude in the near term the market disagrees” said Jamie Webster a fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.

Blinken told NBC on Sunday that he had spoken to US president Joe Biden and the cabinet about the possible new sanctions on Russia’s oil.

International benchmark Brent hit $139.13 a barrel in early trading on Monday almost 20 per cent above its settlement price on Friday as traders reacted to Blinken’s remarks. Brent’s surge took it to within about $6 of its all-time high in July 2008. US crude oil futures also soared trading above $130. Both benchmarks pared some of their gains later with Brent falling back beneath $130.

Banning imports of Russian oil into the US and allies could be less significant than a move to impose a blanket international embargo on Russian supplies through secondary sanctions say analysts. But uncertainty about the severity or range of new measures amid a growing political clamour in the US for more punitive sanctions has spooked global crude markets.

Shippers of Russian crude were last week forced to sell at steep discounts in an effort to secure buyers that are now concerned about counterparty risk and legal jeopardy. Oil supermajor Shell was among the buyers taking advantage of the discount last week.

The US and other International Energy Agency member countries last week announced that they would release more than 60mn barrels of oil stored in emergency stockpiles in a bid to prevent oil supply shortages and cool prices. The US and other countries are also negotiating a nuclear pact with Iran that could lift sanctions on Iranian crude oil exports.

Slower-than-expected progress in talks with Iran over the weekend also helped push up oil prices on Monday morning.

Petrol prices have surged in consumer countries in the recent weeks on the back of the spiking oil price with the average price paid in the US now above $4 a gallon close to the record high set in 2008.

The Banks Say It's Not Their Problem. (Published 2022),"Justin Faunce lost $500 to a scammer impersonating a Wells Fargo official in January and hoped that the bank would reimburse him. Mr. Faunce was a longtime Wells Fargo customer and had immediately reported the scam — involving Zelle the popular money transfer app.

But Wells Fargo said the transaction wasn’t fraudulent because Mr. Faunce had authorized it — even though he had been tricked into transferring the money.

Mr. Faunce was shocked. “It was clearly fraud” he said. “This wasn’t my fault so why isn’t the bank doing the right thing here?”

Consumers love payment apps like Zelle because they’re free fast and convenient. Created in 2017 by America’s largest banks to enable instant digital money transfers Zelle comes embedded in banking apps and is now by far the country’s most widely used money transfer service.

He was 87.

Known to many as Gil Hudson descended from a line of philanthropists. His grandfather’s brother was J.L. Hudson the self-made founder of the J.L. Hudson Company who started many Detroit-based initiatives and donated substantial funds to different causes.

Born in Buffalo New York he earned a Bachelor of Arts from Yale University in 1956 served in the U.S. Air Force for two years and then relocated to metro Detroit to work at J.L. Hudson Company.

Hudson in 2015 told Our State of Generosity a Michigan philanthropy archive that his family’s legacy was a significant factor in his initial curiosity about formal philanthropy which fueled his interest in joining the organizations that would become the Hudson-Webber Foundation while working for the J.L. Hudson Company.

In 1973 Hudson led three family foundations which merged in 1984 to become the Hudson-Webber Foundation a private independent grantmaking organization created to support organizations and institutions that help move the city of Detroit forward.

He led the foundation until his retirement in 1999 and continued his service as chair of the board until 2005 and as a trustee until the time of his death. The foundation governed by a 15-member board of trustees with assets of approximately $200 million has contributed more than $200 million to improve the quality of life in Detroit.

“While my father will be dearly missed our family is comforted by the legacy he leaves behind” said daughter Jennifer Hudson-Parke chair of Hudson-Webber Foundation’s Board of Trustees. “Gil’s lifetime of service was characterized by humility intellectual rigor and an enduring commitment to the revitalization of the city of Detroit. He left an indelible mark on the many leaders and organizations that he supported brought together and worked alongside.”

Hudson was a lifelong golfer gardener skilled bridge player and Detroit sports fan but his greatest joy was family. He was a caring and supportive father who was particularly delighted by his grandchildren and took great interest in their lives family members said.

""Gil was always up for a game — backgammon golf flying a kite. He had a quick wit but was a better listener"" said grandson Joe Parke who is also a trustee of the Hudson-Webber Foundation. ""His generosity and selflessness are an inspiration for all of us.""

A philanthropic leader and community builder Hudson provided counsel to numerous community organizations with long-standing dedication to Council of Michigan Foundations Children’s Hospital of Michigan Detroit Local Initiatives Support Corporation and United Way for Southeastern Michigan to name a few.

“Gil not only shaped the trajectory of the Hudson-Webber Foundation but through his extraordinary service and civic engagement helped shape modern philanthropy in the state of Michigan"" said Melanca Clark CEO of the Hudson-Webber Foundation. “I’ll be forever grateful to have had the benefit of his kind and wise counsel during my leadership of the Foundation.”

Hudson was married to Anne Rouse Hudson for 52 years before her death in 2009.

He is survived by the couple’s three children Jennifer (Joseph) Parke Elizabeth (Thomas) Griffith and Susan (Bradley) Laffrey; seven grandchildren; two great-grandchildren and his partner of 12 years Anne LaSalle.

A memorial service is scheduled for 11 a.m. May 14 at Grosse Pointe Memorial Church 16 Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Farms.

Memorial gifts in Gilbert Hudson’s name can be made to Children’s Hospital of Michigan Foundation and to Grosse Pointe Memorial Church.

POOL,Pool Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY29ycGdvdi5sYXcuaGFydmFyZC5lZHUvMjAyMi8wMy8wNS93b21lbi1pbi10aGUtYm9hcmRyb29tLTIwMjItdXBkYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women in the Boardroom: 2022 Update,"Is the world making reasonable progress towards increasing the proportion of women on boards? The data indicates not. Women occupy just 20% of board seats globally and continue to be excluded from the highest levels of corporate leadership.

In 2011 when the Deloitte Global Boardroom Program began researching how many women served on corporate boards globally the conversation about achieving gender equity among the highest leadership ranks was just starting to percolate. Since then increasing women’s representation at the boardroom table has become something of a movement: More and more countries have developed initiatives to address gender parity the conversation has vastly expanded and consequently numbers have risen. Some countries such as France have really upped their numbers in a substantial way following government-mandated gender quotas. More than 40% of board seats among French companies are now occupied by women.

Deloitte’s report this year showed that progress is happening albeit slowly. The global average of women on boards sits at just under 20% (19.7%) an increase of just 2.8 percentage points since the last report published in 2019 (figure 1). At this pace the world will not reach parity until at least 2045 over twenty years from now. While this is still unacceptably slow the pace of change has accelerated slightly: Deloitte’s last report showed parity being reached by 2052 indicating a timeline that has been reduced by almost a decade.

A pronounced ripple effect

As was seen in previous editions this year’s report revealed a clear correlation between women in top leadership roles and women in the boardroom. The most diverse boards tend to be found at companies with women chief executive officers (CEOs) or chairs. Companies with women CEOs have significantly more balanced boards than those run by men—33.5% women versus 19.4%. The statistics are similar for companies with female chairs (figure 2).

Similarly a Deloitte series that focuses on women leaders in the financial services industry found strong evidence at the organizational level of what it calls the multiplier effect—adding one woman to the C-suite resulted in three women joining senior management roles. The series also pointed to mentorship and sponsorship programs as ways to boost the number and tenure of women financial services leaders.

Requiring more women to join boards through quotas or other rules is clearly one way to bolster numbers but it doesn’t address another area: women’s tenure or how long they tend to stay in their board roles. Once again this year’s report shows a clear disparity between the tenure of women and men on corporate boards around the world. In 2021 there was a difference of two and a half years in average tenure among men and women. Women held their board positions an average of 5.1 years while men averaged 7.6 years. These figures were similar to what was seen in 2018 (figure 3) and were nearly the same for boards with women chairs and men chairs revealing little to no causal effect. What is causing this difference in tenure? Are women choosing to pursue other board- or executive-level opportunities? Is it because many women have only recently been added to boards so naturally they haven’t been there as long as their male peers have? The topic of tenure deserves further exploration.

The usual suspects? Diving deeper into talent pools for women

Another key issue the report uncovered is that companies often select from a pool of “the usual suspects”—a very small list of women who are well-known and well-connected—to fill board roles. When some countries instituted quotas there was concern—and criticism—that the same women would be picked to serve on a large number of boards. And because of the insularity of this same small group of women boards would end up being less diverse than they would appear to be. In France journalists named these women “jupes dorées”—golden skirts—and pointed to a small highly connected group of women who had been asked to join many of the newly opened board seats.

In 2016 Deloitte set out to see if this criticism held up in practice. Deloitte developed our own metric—the stretch factor—to evaluate how many board seats an individual holds in a particular market. The higher the stretch factor the greater the number of board seats occupied by the same director in a given country. So countries with the highest stretch factors had boards that were pulling from the shallowest pools of leadership talent. Globally the stretch factor for women has increased slightly from the previous edition from 1.26 to 1.30 (although remains relatively unchanged from 2016 [1.31].) Men by comparison have a stretch factor of 1.17.

It turns out that countries with the highest stretch factors for women—Australia (1.43) the United States (1.34) and New Zealand (1.33)—have all eschewed quotas in favor of voluntary approaches. In fact European countries that were early adopters of quotas such as Norway have much lower stretch factors. Why this should be the case is a bit of a mystery. Have countries with voluntary approaches taken the easy way out recruiting most women from familiar talent pools? Or have countries with quotas been forced to cast a wider net? Both are possible explanations.

Overall this year’s findings reveal that companies around the globe still need to drastically step up efforts to recruit and retain more women (and other directors from underrepresented groups) in boardrooms if they want to prioritize diversity equity and inclusion initiatives throughout their organizations and at the highest levels. Gender equity in the boardroom will only be achieved if/when most companies across geographies take these critical steps.

Working at Babel Street a data-to-knowledge company with artificial intelligence linguistics requires intensive thinking Senior Vice President of Application Development Bryan O’Neill said so the company brought in games to boost morale and create a more enjoyable workplace atmosphere.

“People come in work all day and then go into the break room to play pool or video games have a couple of beers and just relax” O’Neill said. “That’s an important part of the job — ensuring your employees are happy. Happy employees do good work.”

Babel Street was the first tenant to sign on in 2019 when the Mississippi State University Research and Technology Corporation Downtown Innovation HUB purchased the old Cadence Bank building on Main Street. After Cadence moved to its new location on Russell Street RTC renovated the building to create office space for growing companies wishing to locate downtown.

The HUB installed new signage this past week signifying the completion of renovations to the building.

“When the bank moved out in June 2021 we started renovations in December” RTC Director Marc McGee said. “The whole premise is to bring innovative economic development downtown. What we have in the research park and those technology-based companies that we have we would like to see some of those companies downtown.”

RTC a company-development nonprofit is a separate entity from the university that assists MSU in research and development. Having reached its maximum capacity for businesses at the Thad Cochran Research and Economic Development Park McGee said RTC needed to find a space to house new research companies.

MSU Provost and Executive Vice President David Shaw pitched the idea of purchasing the downtown building which McGee said the university quickly supported. Renovations to the building included replacing teller stations with segregated suites creating and replacing bathrooms adding a completely new ceiling and bringing the building up to Americans with Disabilities Act standards and fire codes.

“We kept the bank’s original vault door because we wanted to keep the aesthetics and character of a bank” McGee said. “That’s part of it. We wanted a new look while also keeping some of the bank’s original aspects.”

The HUB has space for four total tenants with Cadence Wealth Management a non-retail banking operation and Babel Street taking the first two spots.

Needing to move somewhere with additional space O’Neill took a tour of the Main Street building and said he knew it would be a sufficient place for Babel Street’s employees to work. Since the company moved in O’Neill said Babel Street not only uses its space for everyday work but also to host meetings with employees from other branches.

“We liked the location” O’Neill said. “It didn’t feel like a high-tech software company when we first looked at it so we asked for some renovations to the building. … We have a great space. It’s beautiful.”

Mayor Lynn Spruill said she has long wanted a stronger “town and gown” relationship with the university and the HUB is part of the process to make that happen. She also said this is one step in creating a more pedestrian-friendly downtown that the city hopes to develop in the coming years.

“There are a lot of opportunities associated with research being downtown” Spruill said. “There are a lot of things that allow us to create some synergy and entrepreneurship in future growth and development for the city and in keeping students in our downtown area which is critical to me for our future and success.”

McGee said RTC has been in discussion with the Greater Starkville Partnership Development about partnering for events especially at the building’s large outdoor plaza area. He said he would love for the city to host events there not only to show individuals RTC’s new location but also continue to create a partnership among the university city and RTC.

“Having this building here will create jobs and having those jobs will allow for people to invest in our downtown community through buying meals and shopping” McGee said. “There’s a lot of synergy that I think can be had between what we’ve done and through the city and Main Street.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvdmFkb2RhcmEvd2hlbi12bWMtcnVsZXJzLW9wcG9zaXRpb24tZGFzaGVkLWZvci1hLWNsb3NlZC1wb29sL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwMDA0MTUwLmNtc9IBggFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L3ZhZG9kYXJhL3doZW4tdm1jLXJ1bGVycy1vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWRhc2hlZC1mb3ItYS1jbG9zZWQtcG9vbC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTAwMDQxNTAuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When VMC rulers opposition dashed for a closed pool,Vadodara: It seemed like a rush on Friday for the Rajiv Gandhi Swimming pool among Vadodara Municipal Corporation VMC ) elected members despite it being closed for years now.On Friday morning leader of opposition Congress party in VMC Ami Ravat informed the media that she would be going to the swimming pool. But standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel pulled a fast one by reaching there before Ravat.Ravat said that she had been receiving complaints regarding the pool that remained frequently closed between 2014 and 2018 and never opened for use after 2018. Users of the pool also approached the Gujarat high court in 2019.“I had announced to the media that I will be going there on Friday morning. Seems the chairman came to know of this and reached there too” said Ravat.Patel however said that he was there coincidentally. “The work on repairing the pool has been completed. The filtration plant too has been attended to and the pool will become functional in 10 days” he said.Patel claimed that it was known that the pool would open soon and work had been completed. “There was no reason to try to create an issue at this stage” he said. Even before 2014 the pool has had its set of woes. It remained close time and again due different reason. The latest issue was seepage from the pool and that it could not retain water.,,,

Late last month the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit against Rehoboth Beach-based Bell Rock Capital LLC and its principal M. Cassandra Toroian for allegedly operating a multi-year “cherry-picking scheme.”

The SEC’s complaint alleges that from at least January 1 2011 through December 31 2015 Toroian traded securities in Bell Rock’s master trading account and delayed allocating the securities to specific client accounts until after she had observed the securities’ performance over the day.

Toroian denied the allegations and issued a lengthy statement to the Cape Gazette vowing to fight the lawsuit until her name is cleared. Bell Rock is based in Rehoboth Beach and has offices in Florida New Jersey and the Philadelphia suburbs.

She allegedly disproportionately allocated profitable trades to accounts that belonged to her and her family members and allocated less profitable and losing trades to client accounts.

According to the SEC’s complaint the securities that Toroian allocated to accounts held by Toroian and her family members increased in value by more than 2% or a gain of over $1 million between the time Toroian purchased them and when she allocated them.

By contrast the securities that Toroian allocated to her clients’ accounts decreased in value by -more than 1.3% or a loss of over $1 million between the time Toroian purchased them and when she allocated them.

The complaint further alleges that Bell Rock and Toroian misrepresented to clients that all trades would be allocated fairly and that Bell Rock and Toroian would not put their interests before their clients’ interests. The complaint also alleges that Bell Rock failed to implement policies and procedures designed to prevent Toroian’s cherry-picking.

The SEC seeks injunctive relief disgorgement of Toroian’s gains with prejudgment interest and civil penalties.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzNWNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9vaGlvLXBvbGl0aWNzL3Byb2N0ZXItYW5kLWdhbWJsZS1oZWlyZXNzLXByb3Bvc2VzLWJpbGwtdG8tc3RvcC10aGUtdHlwZS1vZi1hbmltYWwtdGVzdGluZy1wLWctaGFzLWRvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter and Gamble heiress proposes bill to stop type of animal testing,"COLUMBUS Ohio — The heiress of Procter and Gamble a multi-billion dollar consumer goods company is proposing legislation in the Ohio House to stop cosmetics testing on animals. P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

Californians need quality public health and schools access to affordable housing and clean water and safe roads and neighborhoods along with many more services to live and thrive – no matter one’s zip code. Accordingly the state’s tax and revenue system must raise adequate revenue to cover the services provided by state and local governments and make ongoing investments to meet the needs of Californians. However policy choices of the past and present shape whether revenues are equitably raised and who is contributing a fair share of their income to California’s revenue. State policymakers can make the tax and revenue system more equitable by strengthening taxation of Californians with high incomes and wealth while providing more support to Californians with low incomes and Californians of color who have been blocked from income- and wealth-building opportunities.

This 5 Facts explains main concepts associated with tax equity and illustrates how elements of California’s tax and revenue system further or impede the goals of economic and racial equity for households communities and the state.

1. Taxes Can Be Progressive Proportional or Regressive — Depending on How They Impact People Across Income Levels

A key aspect to tax equity is how a tax — or a tax system as a whole — impacts households across income levels. One way to measure this is by comparing effective tax rates —meaning the share of one’s income paid in a tax — of people in different income groups. A tax is considered progressive when households with higher incomes have higher effective tax rates than those with lower incomes. The opposite of a progressive tax is a regressive tax. With regressive taxes people with lower incomes have higher effective tax rates than people with higher incomes. Finally a tax is considered proportional when people at all income levels have the same effective rates. Progressive taxes are the most equitable taxes since they ask the most from people who have the most ability to pay.

People with lower incomes must spend larger shares of their income just to meet their basic needs leaving them with less ability to pay taxes. For example almost 6 in 10 low-income California households spend more than half of their income on housing alone compared to just 2% of high-income California households. In other words after covering the basics Californians with lower incomes have much smaller portions of their total incomes available to pay taxes than higher-income Californians. It follows that a fair tax system should take a smaller fraction of the income of low-income households.

2. California’s Personal Income Tax Is Highly Progressive Asking the Most from Those with the Highest Ability to Pay

Californians with higher incomes pay a larger percentage of their income in personal income taxes than people with lower incomes because higher portions of income are subject to higher tax rates. In other words high-income people face the highest effective tax rates with regard to the personal income tax. Additionally the state has two refundable tax credits the California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC) and the Young Child Tax Credit that provide refunds to families with very low incomes creating a negative effective tax rate for them. The personal income tax is the state’s largest revenue source.

The progressive structure of the personal income tax also improves racial equity since Latinx and Black Californians have lower average incomes than white Californians due to racist policies and practices in employment education and every other facet of society. As a result the effective state personal income tax rate is lower on average for Latinx and Black families (3.6% and 4.0% respectively) than for white families (5.0%).

3. California’s Sales and Excise Taxes Are Regressive Asking the Most from Those with the Least Ability to Pay

In contrast to the personal income tax the sales and use tax is regressive. This is because people with lower incomes need to spend larger shares of their income to cover basic needs so sales taxes take up larger shares of low-income households’ budgets. The sales and use tax is the state’s second-largest revenue source.

Excise taxes which are taxes on specific goods including gasoline alcohol and tobacco are also highly regressive. Like sales taxes excise taxes hit people with lower incomes hardest since any money they spend on items subject to excises taxes will generally make up a larger share of their overall budgets compared to high-income people. In addition since excise taxes are generally based on the volume of the purchase rather than the price people at all income levels pay the same tax on a given amount of a product whether they buy an economical brand or a more expensive brand.

The 20% of California families with the lowest incomes pay 7.4% of their incomes in combined state and local sales and excise taxes compared to 0.8% for the richest 1%. Again because Black Latinx and many other Californians of color are more likely to have low incomes than white Californians regressive taxes like sales and excise taxes exacerbate racial inequity.

4. California’s State and Local Tax System Could Be More Progressive

The overall impact of the state and local tax system on Californians is determined by the combination of the progressive personal income tax and regressive sales and excise taxes as well as other taxes levied by the state and localities — most notably local property taxes and corporate income taxes. The combined impact is a state and local tax system that is regressive for people with lower incomes and progressive for people with very high incomes. The richest 1% of California tax filers pay the largest share of their income in state and local taxes (12.3%) but the 20% of filers with the lowest incomes pay the next highest share (11.4%). While the richest Californians pay a smaller portion of their income in sales excise and property taxes than any other group it is made up for by the larger share of their income that goes to income taxes. Conversely while the bottom 20% of Californians on average get money back from the personal income tax system via refundable tax credits this is not enough to make up for paying larger shares of their income in sales excise and property taxes.

5. California’s Tax System Rewards Wealth but Doesn’t Tax Wealth

Wealth inequality is even more pronounced than income inequality and racial wealth gaps are larger than racial income gaps. Many state tax policies contribute to wealth inequality and racial wealth gaps by providing substantial tax benefits to families who have assets like homes and retirement plans — such as the deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes the partial tax exemption on the proceeds of home sales and tax-privileged retirement accounts. Black Latinx and other people of color receive less of these tax benefits because — due to structural racism and discrimination — they are less likely to be homeowners to be in jobs with access to employer-sponsored retirement plans and to have the financial means to save or invest in assets. At the same time accumulated or inherited wealth is not taxed in California. Policymakers can eliminate or limit tax benefits that most advantage wealthy families and explore other options to better tax Californians who have amassed large amounts of wealth. The resulting revenues could then be directed to investments that help families who have been shut out from wealth-building opportunities achieve economic security and build wealth.

“ California policymakers can make the tax and revenue system more equitable. ”

Conclusion

There are many dimensions to ensuring that a tax system equitably generates the revenue needed for Californians to care for their families build healthy communities and contribute to a strong economy. Policymakers need to consider how any tax policy could have disparate effects on Californians by income wealth and race/ethnicity — as well as other factors not discussed in this fact sheet such as gender family structure and income source.

The state’s current tax and revenue system is not fair for all Californians. People with the lowest incomes should not be paying larger shares of their incomes in state and local taxes than most other income groups and the state’s tax policies should work to narrow racial wealth gaps not widen them.

California policymakers can make the tax and revenue system more equitable. This includes ensuring that Californians with high incomes and wealth pay their fair share to support critical state services providing further support for Californians with low incomes — such as by increasing and expanding refundable tax credits and making other tax credits refundable to benefit more low-income households — and eliminating or reforming tax benefits that primarily help wealthy Californians. Moving toward more robust taxation of Californians with higher income and wealth would also generate revenues that can be spent equitably to help more low-income households and Californians of color live and thrive and expand opportunities to build wealth for themselves their children and their communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0dWMtY3NpLm9yZy9JVFVDLXJlcG9ydC1GYWlyLWZpbmFuY2luZy1vZi1zb2NpYWwtcHJvdGVjdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ITUC report: Fair financing of social protection through progressive taxation maximises returns,"Building on previous ITUC research Investments in social protection and their impact on economic growth: tax financing options shows the economic benefits of social protection by examining the different financing options that states have at their disposal in order to strengthen and extend their social protection systems.

The study simulated the effects of different tax-financing scenarios for social protection on household income employment and overall GDP. The analysis was carried out in Bangladesh Colombia Costa Rica Georgia Ghana India Rwanda and Serbia.

The report found that financing social protection through progressive forms of taxation – such as progressive income tax corporate tax and capital tax – generates positive social and economic outcomes debunking the myth that such forms of taxation are a drag on employment and growth.

Increased progressive taxation:

generates positive GDP growth rates;

increases employment levels over time; and

has a higher positive impact on the poorest households reducing overall income inequality.

On the other hand financing through regressive taxation – such as consumption and sales taxes – could even offset the positive changes generated by social protection transfers. This result was found in all countries studied.

Regressive forms of taxation:

generate dramatic negative impacts on GDP in all countries;

reduce employment over time; and

cause an additional rise in prices reducing real income for all households.

ITUC General Secretary Sharan Burrow affirmed: “This study offers evidence for a fair increase in social-protection domestic spending. Current levels of expenditure are still very low and leave more than half of the world’s population uncovered.

“Adequate and comprehensive social protection systems are needed now more than ever. The climate crisis together with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global impacts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is making the case for urgently expanding social protection coverage.

“Social protection builds resilience and equips countries with the necessary tools to respond to shocks and achieve just transitions.

“Governments have a variety of means at their disposal to start expanding social protection coverage. This report makes a clear case that those who can afford to pay more should be paying more and that governments should move away from regressive forms of taxation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YWxsYWhhc3NlZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvb3Bpbmlvbi8yMDIyLzAzLzA2L2Zsb3JpZGFzLXJlbnRlcnMtbmVlZC1yZWxpZWYtc2VjdXJpdHktZGVwb3NpdC1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZXMtY2FuLWhlbHAtb3Bpbmlvbi85MzY3NDg4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida's renters need relief - Security deposit alternatives can help | Opinion,"Adam Kovacevich

Your Turn

Over the course of last year Floridians saw rent prices increase about 29% — the highest spike in costs across the entire country. Inflation-driven price hikes are only getting worse while the state faces a loss of around 1200 affordable housing units each year.

For many low- and middle-income residents sharply rising rent means staying in a current lease is unaffordable and affording to move seems near impossible. Florida's policymakers need to think outside traditional methods to provide relief or face a continued housing crisis of emergency proportions.

Luckily a new option may provide some relief.

For Florida the rental market is being crowded by would-be buyers unable to close on homes in the booming housing market and a record-level influx of residents moving from coastal cities. New residents moving from expensive rental markets are used to paying inflated rental rates pushing prices up further and continuing to price existing residents out of the market.

When a low- or middle-income Florida renter manages to find a suitable apartment within their budget—a feat in itself—they then must afford the astronomical up-front cost of moving: buying furniture (prices up nearly 12% last year) renting a van purchasing packing supplies and perhaps most costly paying a security deposit that's often several times their new monthly rent.

Considering nearly six in 10 Americans don't have enough savings to afford a $500 surprise expense it's safe to say scraping together one thousand dollars or more for a security deposit is harder than ever before.

Miami is already getting creative with housing support establishing a new crypto assistance fund for renters. It's time for state policymakers to think outside the (packing) box as well.

Offered by a handful of companies like Rhino security deposit insurance gives renters a low-rate policy of $5 to $10 per month in lieu of an up-front security deposit that can cost thousands of dollars. Some landlords in Florida are already accepting it as an alternative way to secure an apartment.

Legislation under consideration by the Florida Legislature is poised to expand flexible options for security deposits. Specifically the bill will give landlords the option to offer security deposit insurance lowering the upfront cost barriers to moving for low- and middle-income tenants.

Even for renters not looking to move the ability to switch to insurance could free up much-needed cash. An estimated $45 billion is tied up nationwide in security deposits. At an average of $1400 per renter that money can provide necessary relief for a working family.

Of course just passing legislation won't solve the complex issue of affordable housing. But for many Floridians the availability of such insurance could make the difference in keeping a roof over their heads. There's no excuse for lawmakers to pass up a new tool to help restore housing affordability across the state.

(DTN/Progressive Farmer photo by Jim Patrico)

AJ and Kellie Blair are fixing a large wooden fencepost on the corner of a harvested cornfield. A few weeks ago a combine driver backed into the post and knocked it over. With harvest done the young couple finally has time to repair the damage before setting up an electric fence and turning cattle into the cornstalks.

They brought three work vehicles to the field with them: a front loader to do the heavy work a side-by-side to carry electric fenceposts and tools and an ATV to get the Blairs where they need to go in a hurry.

Sure enough they forgot a tool and AJ hops onto the Polaris Sportsman 450 H.O. EPS to hustle back to the shop.

""I thought we might be moving away from the ATV when we bought the side-by-side three or four years ago"" AJ says later. ""But the four-wheeler is just so handy to hop on and go.""

ATV FOR ALL SEASONS

Seems the Blairs always need to get somewhere in a hurry on their diversified farm in central Iowa near Dayton. They use an ATV for checking cattle in their feedlot and cow-calf operations. They put it in the back of the pickup when cropping chores take them to the far reaches of the farm and Kellie uses it for scouting fields during the growing season.

All of these uses and more make the Blairs the perfect farm couple to test the Polaris which they did for about three months in 2021 through harvest and into the late fall.

Bottom line for them Kellie says: ""This particular Polaris was a basic model without a lot of bells and whistles which is fine because we don't need a lot of bells and whistles. We want something that will get us from one place to another and this one worked really well for us.""

MACHINE SPECIFICS

Here are some facts on the Sportsman 450 H.O. EPS for model year 2022.

-- VALUE. It's one of the smaller ATVs in the Polaris lineup and the company advertises it as a ""value"" model.

-- ENGINE. The Sportsman 450 H.O. has a liquid-cooled Prostar 4-Stroke SOHC single-cylinder engine that generates 33 hp and is fed by an electronic fuel-injection system. It uses a Polaris Variable Transmission (PVT) which is designed to change gears depending on vehicle power engine output and variable load condition. An in-line shifter is located on the right side of the body. The Sportsman 450 features on-demand all-wheel drive which is activated with a switch on the handlebar.

-- SUSPENSION. Polaris is proud of the Sportsman 450's suspension system which has sealed MacPherson front struts with an 8.2-inch travel. The independent rear suspension system features dual A-arms with a 9.5-inch travel. With standard 25-inch 6-ply tires ground clearance is 11.5 inches."

In November 2018 the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) released the Prudential Standard CPS 234 in direct response to the escalating attack landscape in the financial sector. APRA has understood these threats to be the direct result of banking services moving to more complex and heavily used digital platforms. The new Standard emerged as an offshoot to the Notifiable Data Breach Scheme which came into effect in early 2018. With the advent of online services and new entities such as neobanks these controls have now become critical. CPS 234 ensures that APRA-regulated entities have implemented sufficient protections to guarantee information security across the computing platform.

CPS 234 applies to any entity that is regulated by APRA. These include:

Banking organizations neobanks credit unions or any other Authorized Deposit Institutions (ADI).

Insurance companies.

Superannuation Funds.

Private health insurance companies.

Non-operating holding companies.

Life companies and friendly societies.

CPS 234 is not limited to domestic entities. It is applicable to foreign entities as well namely:

Foreign ADIs

Foreign General and Eligible Foreign Life Insurance Companies (EFLICs)

CPS 234 commenced in July 2019. This means that if an organization’s information assets are managed by a third party they must make sure any new contracts are CPS 234 compliant. For any existing contracts organizations were given a one-year grace period to move those contracts into compliance.

Who Is Responsible for CPS 234 Compliance?

The responsibility to ensure compliance with CPS 234 ultimately falls on the Board of Directors of these APRA-regulated entities. This means that the Board must ensure that the entity maintains information security in a manner consistent with the size and extent of the threats to its information assets.

What Are the Key Requirements?

Some of the broader requirements of CPS 234 are:

Identify implement and maintain information security controls that are proportional with the threat posed against organizations.

Clearly define information security-related roles and responsibilities.

Implement controls to protect information assets and undertake regular testing along with assurance of the controls implemented.

Timely notification to APRA of material information security incidents.

One point worth noting is that Clause 13 of the requirement states that the Board of an APRA-regulated entity is ultimately responsible to enforce CPS 234 compliance. This means that APRA have recognized information security to be a business concern not solely a technology problem. This is critical in defining how these organizations approach the implementation of such controls as non-compliance is not an option and carries heavy fines and sanctions.

CPS 234 does not prescribe the level of granularity or the classification method to these controls; this is left entirely to the regulated entity to implement and categorize.

These broader requirements can be broken into 9 compliance areas:

Roles and Responsibilities: All regulated entities MUST clearly define roles and responsibilities across all aspects of their information security strategy starting at the Board and Senior Governance committees. Information Security Capabilities: Within an organization Information Security capabilities that are directly commensurate with the threat posed to the entity must be implemented and maintained. Policy Framework: The entity must define an Information Security policy framework. This framework will serve to articulate the necessary controls and provide guidance and validation regarding information security. Information Asset Identification and Classification: All information assets hardware or software must be identified and classified to define their criticality and sensitivity. Implementation of Controls: The regulated entity must have information security controls to protect its information assets. These include all assets managed by related third parties as well. These controls include: Addressing vulnerabilities and threats to information assets Labeling the criticality and sensitivity of information assets The life-cycle stage of an information asset and The potential repercussion or consequence of a security breach or incident. Incident Management: A clearly defined incident management plan must be established reviewed and tested annually. Testing Control Effectiveness: Control effectiveness must be regularly tested through a degree of standard assurance processes to provide a degree of assurance that vulnerabilities and threats are duly managed and identified across an information asset’s lifecycle. Internal Audit APRA Notification: APRA must be notified within 72 hours of any incident impacting their information assets. The regulated entity must also notify APRA within 10 business days of any control weakness the organization cannot remediate in a timely manner.

How Can Companies Be Best Prepared for Audits of CPS 234? What Are Some Best Practices for Companies to Consider?

Roles and Responsibilities

Complying with CPS 234 can be daunting but it need not be. Achieving compliance as with any other information security framework will require the appropriate technical controls. The biggest challenge to compliance can be a lack of guidelines as well as practical application when dealing with third parties.

There’s a lot to do to comply with in CPS 234. The easiest requirement to fulfill is to ensure roles and responsibilities of all security staff are clearly defined articulated and communicated organization-wide. This simple requirement is not dependent on any technology or strategy and it is something most organizations tend to achieve by default. Bear in mind that roles and responsibilities need to be articulated for third-party vendors as well and stipulated in their contracts.

APRA Notification

Point 9 of the regulation mandates that organizations must have a streamlined process of notifying APRA of an incident impacting their information assets. The scope of the incident as well as the extent can be determined in parallel. Often an assessment or internal investigation will take place to determine the type of data that’s been compromised and whether it contains any customer information. For such requirements there’s a chance this requirement might overlap with other frameworks such as GDPR or Australia’s notifiable Data Breach Scheme. The challenge here would be to assess each incident on its impact and subsequently establish a time threshold required to report these breaches. Entities also need to establish a chain of command and an internal reporting process for such breaches.

Third-Party Vendor Compliance

Another challenge is to manage and gain visibility on information security features and processes of third-party vendors and how they would correspond to the potential consequences of a security incident. First and foremost a contract must be established between the entity and the third-party vendor to ensure these requirements are maintained. If the third-party vendor does not have the appropriate security measures entities need to consider an effective yet secure way of doing business either by enforcing controls through their own processes or technologies (limiting access to a network as an example) or providing guidance to the third party to bring it to an acceptable level of security posture before business can be conducted.

Any shortcomings in third-party security controls must be reflected in the master contract.

Policy Framework Internal Audits and Implementation of Controls

Perhaps the most challenging and arduous requirement of CPS 234 is to achieve compliance against a policy framework and implementation of controls on information assets. Depending on the scale of an organization’s asset map achieving compliance can become a repetitive error-prone and resource-intensive process. Moreover constant changes to information assets can render them non-compliant quickly. This leads to compliance drift where the entity's information assets deviate from the desired state of compliance due to a lack of central monitoring of configuration and policies.

All these challenges would apply to any financial entity regardless of which compliance framework they adopt as well as which systems need to be monitored for configuration assessments and vulnerability assessments.

How Tripwire Can Help

Tripwire is synonymous with change monitoring compliance configuration assessment and vulnerability assessment. Besides these capabilities Tripwire can help entities achieve other aspects of CPS 234 namely being able to discover and identity information assets supporting internal audit as well support SOC teams for the purpose of incident management.

As an example Tripwire Enterprise can help organizations achieve a level of compliance to their adopted policy framework by running scans across their IT assets and documenting where the entity passes or fails to comply with these granular checks. This can be achieved centrally on all IT assets regardless of being physical virtual or cloud-based. Tripwire Enterprise can also help to ensure that entities comply with popular configuration baselines such as CIS or NIST and that they drastically reduce their attack surface by securely configuring their IT assets. The ability to understand change across all IT assets enriched by context allows entities to understand changes across their IT environment to distinguish between good bad authorized and un-authorized changes.

Another requirement that Tripwire can fulfill is to ensure entities can run a robust vulnerability assessment program providing insights into undetected threats and vulnerabilities before they become an issue. Entities can also tag all discovered assets based on configurable labels around business context role sensitivity and criticality of assets.

The intention and structure of CPS 234 have been established to promote and encourage good security practices within financial institutions and put due responsibility and accountability on the Board. However experience has shown us that complying with such guidelines can be cumbersome and daunting if not supported with the right solution and process model.

CPS 234 isn’t about enforcement; the intention here is to create a compliant and resilient security posture and at the same time reduce the attack risk surface industry wide. In today’s world of an ever-expanding and fast-evolving landscape of the financial sector where crypto and micro banks have become the new normal this is a good place to start.

Questionable moving practices are on the rise industry experts say. It's a problem heightened by the global COVID-19 pandemic. In the spring of 2021 more Canadians moved to another province than any other time since 1991 according to Statistics Canada.

Watch the full Marketplace investigation anytime on YouTube.

Ontario's Ministry of Government and Consumer Services received 59 complaints about moving companies in 2021 up from 36 the year before. In the last two years at least 24 complaints were related to the group of companies in the Marketplace investigation which includes Safe Bound Moving Roadway Moving O Canada Movers and Move Me Again Transportation. These companies conduct moves across the country and are operated by friends Dogan Celik and Cemal Ozturk.

To document the companies' contracts sales tactics and quoting practices a CBC Marketplace producer went undercover posing as a customer of Roadway Moving. The company was hired to transport the contents of a one-bedroom apartment from Toronto to Sudbury Ont.

What Marketplace uncovered mirrored the claims of some former customers who say that after getting a quote based on an estimated weight of their items and putting down a non-refundable $200 deposit they felt pressured to sign a new contract with a higher flat-rate weight on moving day.

Once the movers drive away the company sends an invoice with a higher total price. In some cases customers say they're told their belongings will be withheld until the new price is paid.

""It is definitely the scam of the season"" said Nancy Irvine president of the Canadian Association of Movers (CAM) whose organization receives complaints from the public about moving companies and different types of alleged scams.

Irvine says CAM has received many complaints connected to the family of companies in the Marketplace investigation. These companies are not affiliated with her association which has a rigorous certification process. In fact CAM issued a warning about the companies on its consumer alerts page in June 2021.

Weight what?

Roadway Moving first quoted the Marketplace producer $895 to move 1000 pounds based on what the company calls an ""industry standard"" weight. It then sent an inventory spreadsheet for the producer to tally up the weight of her belongings. Each piece of furniture and size of box on the list had an estimated weight. According to the spreadsheet the Marketplace producer's belongings added up to 3050 pounds.

Based on the new estimated weight the company sent another quote for $1495 before tax but said in an email that ""you will be invoiced for less if you are less in weight.""

The items in Marketplace's move weighed 1280 pounds but Roadway Moving charged a flat rate of 4000 pounds. (CBC)

But when movers arrived to pick up the items they brought out a new contract pressuring the undercover producer to sign off on a flat rate of 4000 pounds.

The contract also had a different company name at the top — O Canada Movers.

Tracking the movers — a customer’s weight estimate goes from 1000 to 4000 pounds Duration 2:48 While Marketplace producers waited in Sudbury for their delivery GPS trackers hidden inside boxes on the moving truck showed the company completing an entirely different move first. That customer Darlene Sherrington had her same-day move quote increase from 1000 pounds to a flat rate of 4000 pounds.

The movers said the office wouldn't conduct a move of that size for less than 5000 pounds but would cut the undercover producer a deal by offering a 4000 pounds flat rate. In previous correspondence the company said the minimum was only 1000 pounds.

The movers said that if the producer had her belongings weighed it could result in a charge of more than 4000 lbs. They steered her into choosing the flat-rate option instead.

This contract also listed some charges such as a ""destination area surcharge"" and a ""fuel surcharge"" but not the total price for the move at a weight of 4000 pounds.

According to Irvine that's a red flag.

""You should have your contract well in advance of moving day"" she said. ""And you should know your fees right up front.""

Irvine said it's normal for a move like this to be invoiced by weight — but the company should actually go to a scale not guess how much a customer's items weigh and get them to sign off on that amount.

About three hours after the movers left the company called to say the total was $3234.65 which included a $500 ""over allocation fee.""

Marketplace had initially taken the items to a certified scale and knew the total weight was only 1280 pounds — less than a third of what the company claimed.

Roadway Moving and O Canada Movers are directed by Dogan Celik. All of these companies appear to operate out of the same office and warehouse in Scarborough Ont.

Company promises ""full review""

In an email statement Celik said his companies value customers and treat them with respect and that his companies will be ""doing a full review of all of our operations and procedures to ensure that the companies are following these important company values.""

When Marketplace visited the Scarborough office to get answers to its specific questions Celik said: ""Everything it's on confirmation emails.""

For the Marketplace move the company sent a confirmation email that said: ""If no inventory is provided any estimated quotations cannot be guaranteed. A flat rate will only be provided to you by the mover."" The email also said that over allocation fees could apply.

Yet Marketplace producers did fill out the inventory sheet and sent it back but the movers still pushed a flat rate and included an ""over allocation fee"" on the final invoice.

A move gone wrong

It's not the first time these companies exaggerated the weight of a move.

Sherri Watson hired Safe Bound Moving which is also directed by Dogan Celik to transport the contents of her four-bedroom home from Brampton Ont. to Sudbury Ont. in May 2021. She and her family planned to spend the summer in their motorhome while shopping for a new home. Watson chose Safe Bound because it offered eight weeks of free storage.

Sherri Watson (left) her husband Neil and their nine-year-old son David sold their house in spring 2021. They planned to live in their motorhome for the summer while looking for a new home in Sudbury. (Submitted)

Safe Bound originally quoted Watson $1780 before tax to move 6000 pounds of items. The company asked Watson to fill out a spreadsheet too but she says she had trouble opening the file. Instead Watson sent emails listing items in her move. Safe Bound told Watson that if she didn't send the inventory sheet back the quote could not be guaranteed.

But according to Irvine that's not enough. ""The only way someone can actually give you any kind of a reasonable estimate is to come to the house (or do a virtual survey by video call on the phone)"" she said in an email.

""And if they refuse to do it? Dollars to doughnuts they're scams.""

Watson's move ended up spanning three days and three different contracts. She says that each day once the movers loaded the truck they asked her to sign another contract this time with a different company name — Move Me Again Transportation.

Contract confusion

On the first day Watson said the movers told her they overloaded the truck and they'd be forced to dispose of her belongings if they took the vehicle to a scale. So she agreed to a flat rate of 22000 pounds instead.

""I thought he had done me a huge favour by knocking (the weight) down so they didn't have to throw out my things"" she said.

Watson's home in Brampton. Move Me Again charged her for 36500 pounds of belongings but scale tickets later showed her belongings retrieved from its storage unit only weighed 16420 pounds. (Submitted)

The following day Watson says she was asked to sign a second contract. She says she understood the contract was to ensure her belongings would be stored with the first load of items. But this contract set out a flat rate of an additional 13000 pounds for that day's belongings. The contract she was given on the final day of the move had a flat rate of an additional 1500 pounds.

For Watson's lawyer Rocco Scocco bringing out a new contract at this stage of a move is too late.

""Her stuff's already in the truck what is she expected to do? To tell them to unload the truck after spending a whole day lifting?"" he said. ""It's a high-pressure situation. She was not able to renegotiate"" which he argues goes against Ontario's Consumer Protection Act.

Like in the Marketplace move none of the contracts indicated a total price.

A few days later Watson received three separate invoices. The company was charging her for a combined flat rate weight of 36500 pounds of belongings. She'd also incurred several ""space allocation exceeded"" fees and now owed $19874.60.

The company also charged her 10 cents more per pound than her quote.

This was all in addition to a $200 booking fee Watson had paid to secure the move and two e-transfer deposits of $1500 sent to the company during the move.

""I was in disbelief at first"" Watson said. ""I was convinced that it was a mistake … somebody hit the wrong numbers on the keyboard.""

Cancer diagnosis

Watson says Safe Bound told her to pay — or her belongings would be thrown away.

She hired Scocco to help get her belongings back. In September she was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

""It is very tough. You know they potentially took away my last summer with my family"" she said.

After months of back and forth with the companies' legal representative Scocco negotiated the release of her belongings from the warehouse in Scarborough.

Watson says some of the items were missing and damaged. Others were covered in rodent droppings or had been chewed.

Watson's belongings were also weighed at a certified scale. The items retrieved from storage were 16240 pounds — more weight than the company's original estimate but nowhere near the 36500 pounds the companies claimed on the invoices.

What needs to change?

Ontario's Ministry of Government and Consumer Services (MGCS) has the power to investigate and lay charges against companies that violate the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). While Scocco claims the companies' practices are contrary to the CPA that remains unclear.

MGCS only lists four moving companies on its Consumer Beware List and none appear to be associated with the companies in the Marketplace investigation.

WATCH | Hidden cameras catch movers pushing inflated weight estimates:

Hidden cameras catch movers pushing inflated weight estimates Duration 2:10 Roadway Moving first quoted the Marketplace producer $895 to move 1000 pounds. After filling out an inventory spreadsheet that number jumped to $1495 before tax to move 3000 pounds. But on moving day the estimated weight went up again.

Companies make this list if they don't respond to the government's questions about a customer complaint or the business has been charged or convicted in relation to the CPA.

In an email statement the ministry said it doesn't release information related to investigations to the public but that there are several ways the ministry takes action against businesses that are not complying with the CPA including mediation compliance orders and educating businesses and consumers on their rights.

Scocco says consumer protection laws need to be strengthened. He would like to see some form of licensing for moving companies too.

""Our laws are not in place to do anything about [these issues] except through the courts and that's a personal expense that consumers will have to incur.""

Tips for screening movers

Many of the people Marketplace spoke with said that they thought they'd done their research into the company they hired. It can be tricky to find the facts. Here are a few tips from the Canadian Association of Movers lawyers and investigative journalists who've covered this topic:",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pictured is a facility on Leverington Avenue in Manayunk. Read more

Combining households renovating your living room or turning that spare bedroom into an office often means clearing out your possessions. But not all home projects have to involve a Marie Kondo-style purge. What about items that are still a part of your life but that just need a temporary home? That’s where self-storage comes in.

You don’t have to look far to find a storage facility these days: In 2021 there were 50523 in the United States up from 44149 in 2017 according to the 2022 Self-Storage Almanac which tracks industry statistics. And self-storage is popular with record occupancies of 94.5% last year.

“People turn to self-storage usually because of some sort of life transition such as moving or downsizing. It’s not just that you have too much stuff” says McKall Morris spokesperson for Extra Space Storage one of the largest self-storage companies with more than 2000 properties nationwide. “Our typical customer is new to self-storage renting for two years or less — usually about three months — and storing personal belongings. We’re also seeing small businesses rent space for extra storage of inventory or equipment.”

Here’s what to consider when selecting a self-storage facility.

Interior vs. exterior storage. An interior unit is like a supersized walk-in closet. You’ll typically bring your items to a load-in area transfer them to a dolly and move them to your unit. Many facilities have multiple stories so you may need to take an elevator. Some locations are designed so you can drive up to your unit. Interior spaces are protected from the elements but there can be drawbacks.

“Self-storage facilities typically have nice wide hallways and large individual unit doors but you still may have to squeeze through one or more standard-size doors to access the hallway to your unit” says Mark Aselstine who used several storage units for his former business Uncorked Ventures in California.

An exterior unit is akin to a garage. You can drive up to the door and load items directly into your unit. “While it is often more convenient and accessible for loading I often found my unit blocked by trucks” Aselstine said “and it seems like people are always milling outside exterior units.”

Customer service. Store managers should be professional knowledgeable and familiar with the property. If they can’t answer your questions keep looking Morris says. Take note that some independent facilities are not staffed. With these you can rent a unit online or contact a call center and work with an agent to choose and lease space. There should be a property manager on-call in case an issue arises but the person doesn’t work on-site.

Size. The biggest mistakes renters make are either overestimating or underestimating the space they need so they either pay too much or have to rent two units Morris says. “Know what you are going to store” she says. “Create an informal list and take some pictures you can show to the facility manager.” Look online for size guides to get an idea of what a unit will hold. For example a 10-by-10-foot unit can generally store the contents of two bedrooms or a full living room.

The unit itself. Do your research and tour the facility advises real estate agent Ken Pozek who rented space for a year while waiting for his house to be built in Orlando. “You need to see the exact unit you intend to rent: what it looks like what it smells like does it live up to your standards” he says. Assuming there is more than one option in your area it can also pay to compare prices.

Access. Assess your schedule to determine how often you will need to access the unit — and when. Is the facility open 24/7 or does it have limited hours? A place that is open only 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. may not fit your schedule.

Climate control. A number of self-storage properties do not have air-conditioning or heating. If your location gets extremely hot cold humid or dry you should consider upgrading to a climate-controlled facility. By moderating temperature climate control can keep your items from growing mold rusting freezing or disintegrating. Some self-storage brands also offer specialty climate-controlled options for art electronics and wine.

Security. A facility should be equipped with 24-hour video surveillance door alarms. and keypad entry gates. Is there someone on-site most of the time or is the facility unprotected? Look for ample lighting and perimeter fencing. High-tech locations may use an app for opening gates and doors. Also check the type of locks used on units. The best is a cylinder lock that is fully embedded in the door so it can’t be cut.

Price. Self-storage pricing is location-specific and based on the number of available units the size whether it’s climate-controlled and whether it’s a drive-up facility. According to the Self-Storage Almanac in 2021 a 10-by-10-foot unit without climate control rented for $111.67 a month on average; a unit with climate control was $146.72. With few exceptions contracts are month to month. Although you may get an enticing introductory offer brace yourself for a rate increase every few months. Be sure to ask about the company’s rent-increase practices. To save a few bucks switch to a smaller unit once you start moving out items.

Insurance. Although the contents of your unit may be covered by your homeowners policy it’s a good idea to buy self-storage insurance. That way if anything happens to your belongings — a fire or burglary for example — you receive money to replace what’s damaged or lost. The easiest way to buy this insurance is to do so when you rent your unit because self-storage companies usually sell it as an add-on to your lease. Pricing can be as little as $9 a month for $2500 of coverage says James Appleton of MiniCo Insurance Agency one of the largest self-storage insurers. Because customer storage (sometimes called “tenant”) insurance is a temporary policy anyone can buy it regardless of credit score; there is usually no deductible; and losses aren’t reported to your regular insurance carrier so you don’t incur a rate increase.

Restrictions. For the most part self-storage companies prohibit food perishable goods nonworking vehicles and anything flammable or combustible such as car batteries propane tanks or gasoline. And said Morris: “You can’t store yourself. You can’t live in a unit or use it as a recreational facility.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXVyYmFuaXN0Lm9yZy8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L21pY3Jvc29mdC1oZWxwcy1mdW5kLTIzNS1hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWhvbWVzLW5lYXItYmVsbGV2dWVzLWVhc3QtbWFpbi10cmFuc2l0LWRpc3RyaWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Helps Fund 235 Affordable Homes Near Bellevue’s East Main Transit District,"A collaboration between SRM Development and the nonprofit Downtown Action to Save Housing (DASH) is set to bring 235 homes near the future East Main Link light rail station in Bellevue. The 4.55 acre site is currently the home of a partially-constructed hotel building which by the end of 2024 will be converted into 100 units of housing available to those earning less than 60% of area median income (AMI). A second building set to provide 135 units of housing for those earning between 80% and 100% AMI will begin construction later this year and is slated to open by the end of 2023.

The $72 million dollar project is facilitated by a $25 million loan from Microsoft’s Affordable Housing Initiative a plan from the corporation to invest $750 million into affordable housing projects throughout the Puget Sound region. In particular the loan comes from the Expanded Land Acquisition Program — a partnership between the corporation and the state’s Housing Finance Commission that provides developments in East King County with loans that can cover up to 75% of a project’s land value in exchange for a 35-year affordability guarantee.

According to reporting from the Puget Sound Business Journal the property was purchased in December for $32.5 million meaning that land acquisition costs represent over 45% of the project’s forecasted budget. A purchase of over $7 million per acre for a soon to be residential site both adjacent to I-405 and in a firmly business-oriented corridor not only reflects the tech-fueled growth the city is experiencing but also the scarcity of land available for multi-family developments. Because over 75% of Bellevue’s land is zoned for single-family development and stated city policy is to concentrate growth in limited areas the limited growth that happens outside of these areas comes at a premium.

Construction is proceeding on a Public Storage facility immediately to the south of the site. Continuing south along 118th Avenue SE leads to Mercer Slough which limits development potential. (Photo by author)

For future residents wanting the urban experience of being able to meet their daily needs by walking the development’s location likely represents a mixed bag. With I-405 to the east and Mercer Slough Nature Park to the southwest further development opportunities near the site are limited. Parcels immediately to the south of the site are zoned for light industrial use and construction is currently underway on a new five-story Public Storage facility — meaning a rezone and redevelopment are unlikely to happen anytime soon. Office space to the north of the site will likely provide little in the way of day-to-day uses that residents might need such as grocery stores or childcare.

Future tenants however will have access to reasonable multimodal connections to other areas of Bellevue. Although the development’s interstate-adjacent location is not ideal residents will have frequent daytime transit connections to Downtown Lake Hills and the Eastgate Park and Ride when King County Metro’s Route 220 begins service in 2023. As a low traffic street 118th Avenue SE’s painted bike lanes can provide a connection for confident riders towards Eastrail and the I-90 Trail to the south although bike connections to the north including the crossing of SE 8th Street definitely need to be improved. With the road designated as a priority bicycle corridor by the City of Bellevue it’s likely it will be prioritized for further infrastructure improvements increasing accessibility to more riders. And with East Main Station Link light rail station located three-quarters of a mile away improved bike facilities would transform what would otherwise be a rather long walk to light rail into a manageable trip.

With the recent rezone of the East Main Transit Oriented District that could bring 1500 homes into that area it’s likely that redevelopment in that area will provide some of the amenities that residents of this future housing will need. So although much more work is needed in order to close Bellevue’s gap in affordable housing especially for people earning less than 50% AMI this project is a net benefit to a city rapidly becoming unaffordable to all but the most affluent.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Portland thieves steal 70 signed guitars worth $130K; instruments used by Oregon Music Hall of Fame to fund m,"A nonprofit dedicated to the preservation of Oregon’s musical heritage is reeling after thieves busted into its storage locker and stole 70 autographed guitars.

The heist caused an estimated loss of $130000 for the Oregon Music Hall of Fame which had planned to auction off the instruments to support college scholarships and its childhood arts programming.

“I’m just astounded. That’s the first time I’ve actually said that number out loud” Janeen Rundle the organization’s director of music programs and scholarships said of the estimated value of the guitars. “It’s a huge huge loss.”

While perhaps best known for its annual induction ceremony honoring notable Oregon artists albums producers and impresarios the nonprofit also presents musical assemblies to Oregon and southwest Washington youth and provides four $2500 scholarships to college-bound students each year.

Rundle says it’s “going to be really tough” for the organization’s arts programming to continue without new fundraising.

The Hall of Fame said it has given 63 scholarships totaling $115500 to music students since 2007. The majority of those funds came from selling signed guitars according to the nonprofit.

“These guitars will go for $2000 apiece at auction because number one it goes to music education” Rundle said. “Some of these guitars were really expensive.”

Rundle said it appears the nonprofit wasn’t specifically targeted as the thieves jimmied open several units at a Public Storage facility in Portland after dark on Feb. 20. The organization said it didn’t learn of the theft until Feb. 27.

Some of the stolen guitars were signed by The Monkees George Clinton Lucinda Williams Arlo Guthrie and Portugal The Man while others were jointly autographed by the Hall of Fame inductees and slated to be displayed at the Youth Music Project’s exhibit space in West Linn.

Rundle hopes instrument traders and Portland-area pawn shop workers will keep their eyes open for anyone reselling an autographed guitar.

“We’re not encouraging anybody to tackle anyone” she said. “But if you can get a physical description of the person possibly a license plate or a screen capture if you see it online — that’s what we’re looking for.”

Anyone with information that leads to the return of the pilfered instruments will be rewarded with an autographed guitar and a pair of tickets to the Hall of Fame’s next induction ceremony Oct. 8 at Southeast Portland’s Aladdin Theater.

Rendering of planned geothermal plant at Michaelibad Munich (source: SWM)

Alexander Richter 6 Mar 2022

The city of Munich is pushing ahead on plans for its 7th geothermal heating plant that would be providing heat to 75000 inhabitants of the city by 2029.

The regional energy utility Stadtwerke Munich (SWM) has announced further steps on its energy transition efforts. SWM already operates six geothermal plants in and around Munich. The utility now announces wanting to build the seventh from 2024 on the grounds of the Michaelibad (swimming pools) in the south-east of Munich. After completion it should provide enough heat for around 75000 residents of Munich.

The project has now reached a first milestone in the approval process. In its preliminary decision the local building commission approves the construction of the geothermal plant. The justification also referred to the special public interest in the climate-neutral conversion of Munich’s district heating. It makes specifications among other things for noise protection and tree protection.

Michaelibad: Optimal location in the south-east of Munich

While Munich’s youngest (and Germany’s largest) geothermal system is being tested at the southern energy location on Schäftlarnstrasse SWM is already preparing for the next one: They are planning to build a geothermal system on the western lawn of the Michaelibad-System with up to four conveying and four reinjection lines. The Berg am Laim and Ramersdorf-Perlach district committees as well as the residents were informed several times in advance of the approval process and their wishes and suggestions were recorded. More on the project can be found here.

From the point of view of SWM the Michaelibad location is ideally suited for the use of geothermal energy because:

there is a high thermal potential in the subsoil

a connection to the district heating network can be easily implemented

there is a high demand for heat in the vicinity of the planned system – not least the pool itself the heat supply of which could therefore be CO2-neutral in the future.

In addition to technical and operational requirements the needs of nature the people in the immediate vicinity and the outdoor pool guests also play a role in the ongoing preparations: after all the disruptions to the construction and operation of the facility should be as small as possible. The specifications of the local building commission were therefore not surprising and were already taken into account in the planning.

The geothermal system will consist of two structural parts and will be built in the north-west corner of the outdoor pool area. The visualization on the right shows a first schematic representation of the position of the geothermal wells (on the lawn on the right) and the heat station (right in the middle of the picture). The exterior design will only be determined during further planning. Public participation is also planned.

Old no longer used storage and service buildings of the pool at this point will be dismantled in advance so that these areas are available for the geothermal system. As a result bathers will be able to use most of the sunbathing lawn again after the end of the construction work.

SWM’s plans are aimed at keeping disturbances to the neighborhood as low as possible protecting the stock of trees and the sunbathing area and at the same time increasing the attractiveness of the pool in the long term. Here too ideas should be developed together with citizens and incorporated into the concrete implementation.

Next steps

The technical planning for the geothermal wells and the heating station are currently being pushed ahead. Only the dismantling of the no longer used storage and operating buildings is currently visible on site.

Public participation for the exterior design of the facility and for increasing the attractiveness of the Michaelibad will start this year. The selected ideas then flow into the technical execution planning.

At the same time the project is going through the regular building permit process in which among other things the public is again involved.

The construction site is expected to be separated from the sunbathing area and set up in 2023.

According to previous plans concrete work on the drilling site and heating station is to begin in 2024. Drilling is expected to begin in early 2025.

Commissioning could take place in 2029.

With this geothermal system the renewable share of Munich’s district heating continues to increase. And Ramersdorf will become a “hotspot” in the truest sense – not only for outdoor and indoor pool fun but also for the success of the heat transition.

SWM are working on the success of the warming transition

SWM supplies around 40 percent of Munich households with environmentally friendly heat via a district heating network that is around 900 kilometers long. Their vision: by 2040 at the latest SWM wants to cover Munich’s district heating requirements in a climate-neutral manner. To achieve this they rely primarily on deep geothermal energy.

A successor to the tech company’s Find X3 Pro from last year the new X5 carries a very similar design aesthetic utilizing a thin lightweight body with a raised camera cluster on the top rear left of the device. On the front sits a 6.7-inch WQHD+ curved AMOLED screen that covers 100% of the P3 color gamut displaying more than one billion colors and a peak brightness of 1300 nits all protected by a Gorilla Glass Victus layer. The processor comes in the form of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip heralded as one of the most powerful Android chips currently available on the market and its battery pack also gets an increased capacity of 5000mAh.

Much like its predecessor however the new model also places its focus on its cameras. Retaining a three-lens setup on the back the X5 carries a 50-megapixel ultrawide with a maximum aperture of f/2.2 and a 110-degree FOV a second 50-megapixel wide camera supporting f/1.7 a 77% color accuracy five-axis image stabilization and a 13-megapixel telephoto lens opening up to f/2.4. For those who fancy a selfie for social media there’s also a front-facing camera with a 32-megapixel sensor.

For those interested OPPO’s new flagship Find X5 Pro will be available from March 14 for €1300 EUR (approximately $1422 USD).

Back in January we told you that MediaTek's top-of-the-line chipset the Dimensity 9000 had topped Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and the Exynos 2200 on Geekbench. The latter is a benchmark site that scores the CPU (and starting in version 4) and GPU on smartphones and other devices for comparison purposes.





With a multi-core score of 4474 and a single-core score of 1287 the only one of the widely used mobile Application Processors (AP) that topped the Dimensity 9000 was the Apple-designed A15 Bionic which produced a Geekbench score of 4885 (multi-core) and 1750 (single-core).

One research firm says MediaTek was the most popular chip designer on U.S. Android phones in Q4









MediaTek not only beat the top chipsets made by Qualcomm and Samsung on this benchmark test but it also topped Qualcomm to become the most popular chip designer in the U.S. for Android phones during the fourth quarter of last year. Data from research firm IDC shows MediaTek beating out Qualcomm 48% to 44% for the last three months of the year.





Some point to Google's new Tensor chip as the reason for this stunning development. Instead of using off-the-shelf Snapdragon silicon for the Pixel 6 series Google debuted its own Tensor chipsets which certainly had to impact Qualcomm's Android market share during the fourth quarter of 2021. Or did it?







Counterpoint Research another company that keeps tabs on all of the important numbers related to the mobile industry saw things a little differently in Q4. Counterpoint said that Qualcomm had a controlling 55% of the U.S. Android market from October through the end of December compared to MediaTek's 37%.







Nonetheless MediaTek has been making a strong case for its silicon and the fabless chip designer (who is a major TSMC customer) surprised again when tipster Ome #Suriya$ tweeted a chart of Geekbench results showing that MediaTek's Dimensity 8100 SoC nearly beat the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset with the multi-core Geekbench test. Realme phones were used on all three of the tests with the upcoming realme GT Neo3 representing the Dimensity 8100.

Dimensity 8100 puts up a valiant effort against Qualcomm's top chip in Geekbench test







MediaTek's Dimensity 8100 is part of the company's upper mid-range line and perhaps the most interesting part of these test results is that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is manufactured by TSMC using its 4nm process node while the Dimensity 8100 is produced using the foundry's 5nm node. Generally speaking lower process nodes usually produce chips that are strikingly more powerful and more energy-efficient.







The Dimensity 8100 scored multi-core and single-core results of 3801 and 924 respectively. That compares to the multi-core score of 3810 and the single-core score of 1200 delivered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. The latter has the advantage of sporting ARM's Cortex X1 super core which the MediaTek chip does not have.





Some other Geekbench 5 results show the Dimensity 8100 actually beating out the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in the multi-core tally. Regardless of which result you use there is no denying that MediaTek is making great strides in the industry.





Qualcomm is expected to soon ship the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+ which will be produced by TSMC using its 4nm node. For the record the non-plus version of the chipset the variant that has been used on flagship Android phones since the start of the year is built by Samsung Foundry using its 4nm node. TSMC's 4nm process node is considered superior to the 4nm node used by Samsung Foundry.





MediaTek is headquartered in Taiwan and was founded in 1997. As of the third quarter of 2021 (the most recent data available) the company was the fourth largest fabless chip designer with revenue of based on sales after Qualcomm Broadcom and Nvidia. The company collected $4.7 billion in revenue during that quarter.





A fabless company like MediaTek Qualcomm and Apple do not own the facilities needed to manufacture chips. Instead such firms design the chips that they send to foundries to manufacture. Apple for example uses TSMC to build its silicon components.





TSMC and Samsung Foundry are the two largest independent foundries in the world.

But should you buy an original charger or does fast charging also work with other models? We answer the most important questions about current technologies like USB-PD Quick Charge Dart VOOC and others.

How convenient is it to be able to half-charge your phone in just a few minutes before leaving the house thanks to a fast charger? Warp Charge Super VOOC and Quick Charge are important technologies but manufacturers have also caused quite a bit of chaos in the battle for the best charging technology. In the following table you can see which manufacturer uses which technology with which performance:

But do Oppo OnePlus and Xiaomi really outperform popular manufacturers like Samsung and Apple or are there reasons against the fast technologies? To understand this let's consider what actually happens during fast charging.

Cell phone fast charging: How does it work?

Lithium-ion batteries are used in smartphones. The capacity of the battery which is usually between 3000 and 7000 mAh can supply the various components of the phone with power for several hours or days. If the battery is empty i.e. all the lithium ions have migrated from the negative electrode to the positive this process can be reversed by an external power supply and the battery recharged.

Almost all phones nowadays use non-user-replaceable batteries / © Parilov/Shutterstock

This is exactly where the wheat is separated from the chaff when it comes to fast charging technologies. That's because modern fast-charging technologies turn on the tap when it comes to the charger's wattage the voltage in volts and the current in amps. Oppo's SuperVOOC 125 uses a 125-watt charger and charges at a maximum of 20 volts at 6.25 amps.

At the same time the manufacturer splits the required battery power between two batteries allowing it to power both halves separately. So instead of filling a large pool through a single faucet two pools are filled with two faucets. Without increasing the load on each individual battery the speed is thus doubled.

Unfortunately smartphone manufacturers have developed their own standards and have increasingly deviated from the former USB-PD and Qualcomm's Quick Charge standards in recent years. Therefore you definitely have to pay attention to whether your charger supports the required protocols even if it supports the technical requirements for charging. Of course we will also take a look at that.

Current fast charging standards in a nutshell

USB-PD: An important requirement

Every Android phone offers a USB port for charging and data transfer and thus the maximum charging speeds always depend on the USB standard. With USB-PD (USB Power-Delivery) there has been an attempt for several years to bring the standardize on the USB plug for portable electronic chargers.

Nowadays not only smartphones but also notebooks and larger gadgets can be charged with one power supply at high speeds. USB-PD is usually offered in combination with USB-C. Since more and more devices support this standard you can for example charge a Google Pixel 6 Pro with the same adapter used with the MacBook Air while still using the fast charging option.

In 2021 the USB-IF - USB Implementers Forum - announced revision 3.1 of the USB-PD specification which added three new voltage options for the USB-C spec: 28 V 36 V and 48 V allowing charger output to reach 140 W 180 W and 240 W. These were not necessarily designed for phones but could theoretically be used for our mobiles.

As usual with a new USB specification comes (lots of) new logos! / © USB-IF

While USB-PD primarily offers advantages when charging multiple devices simultaneously via a USB plug there is also the USB-PPS protocol. The ""Programmable Power Supply"" standard isn't directly related to charging faster but impacts efficiency and safety while charging.

When charging using a compatible device and adapter the phone (or tablet PC etc.) can periodically request changes in voltage and current to the charger which can be raised when the batteries are cool or lowered when the device starts to get too warm. This level of control may not offer the fastest charging speeds possible but can potentially prolong the lifespan of the battery.

Qualcomm's Quick Charge

The chip manufacturer Qualcomm offers the ""Quick Charge"" standard which can be found in most Android smartphones in the last few years. This is because Qualcomm is one of the biggest suppliers of phone processors and was one of the first companies to propose a fast-charging standard still back in the old micro-USB days.

Largely interoperable with USB-PD and PPS Quick Charge 5 promises more than 100 watts at 20 volts and 5+ amps. The QC5 standard can be found on devices like the Asus ROG Phone 5 Xiaomi 11T Pro and Nubia RedMagic 6 Pro usually with lower wattages. You can find a complete list of compatible devices and chargers on the linked Qualcomm page.

Oppo's SuperVOOC / OnePlus' WarpCharge / Realme's DartCharge / IQOO FlashCharge

Oppo or rather the brands Oppo Realme OnePlus and Vivo that belong to BBK decided early on to develop their own standard and were able to establish ultra-fast charging of phones as a trademark for themselves and compete against Xiaomi at the same time. The latest SuperVOOC works with up to 240 watts and fully charges a 4500 mAh battery in nine minutes with a 50% charge in 3min30s.

Both the UltraVOOC 240 and Realme's UltraDart 200 also announced during MWC 2022 have no release date yet. Both companies however announced a 150 W version coming in the second quarter of 2022.

It is worth pointing out that to use Oppo/OnePlus/Realme/Vivo/iQOO fast charging standards you need to use a compatible adapter which only those brands supply.

Xiaomi HyperCharge

After years of not using any kind of branding for its fast chargers Xiaomi decided to challenge BBK's brands and announced the Xiaomi 11T Pro in 2021 with its HyperCharge adapter. With up to 120 W the 11T Pro was fully charged in just 17 minutes in our review. Curiously the same phone is also listed on Qualcomm's official Quick Charge 5 support list keeping Xiaomi's tradition of offering standards-compliant phones and chargers.

Apple's fast charging via Lightning

Since a few iPhone generations you can also charge Apple smartphones about halfway in half an hour - and that although the manufacturer from Cupertino still sticks to its Lightning standard instead of switching to USB-C as well. However this only applies to the charging ports on the iPhone models themselves; Apple equips its own power adapters and also its iPads with USB-C.

If you want to fast-charge your iPhone Apple recommends power adapters with at least 20 watts and also advises to only use Apple's own USB-C to Lightning cables. This is especially relevant when you use a MacBook with a USB-C charger. Since these offer at least 61 watts fast charging also works via this. You can also use third-party chargers with the required power output. This is especially important since the iPhone 12 because Apple decided to remove the charger from the phone's retail box.

MediaTek's Pump Express 4.0

Not to skip over Qualcomm's rival the Taiwanese SoC manufacturer also announced its own fast-charging standard. But outside of a blog post in 2018 and a hot site the initiative doesn't seem to have caught off with phone brands...

Is fast-charging harmful to the battery?

After we have only discussed a look at the advantages of super-fast charging of smartphone batteries so far we should consider whether the whole thing is so useful at all. When do you charge your phone? Do you wait until it's really empty or does the phone go to the charger every night?

Do you charge your phone at night or when its needed? When I sleep my phone charges too!

I charge it whenever my phone asks me to. (Only one selection allowed) View results VOTE!

Personally I charge my phone every evening. Since I work a lot with my smartphone it's usually very necessary. But I don't care how quickly the phone gets full when I'm lying in the next room (cue digital detoxing) and sleeping. In order not to strain the battery I usually simply turn off fast charging - but is that even necessary?

Especially now that Android brands are promising more than two years of software support for their phones the usual benchmark for which batteries are generally tested may not be enough for the lifespan of the phones.

We have talked to specialists about whether fast charging actually damages our phones and the answers didn't seem to ease the NextPit Community. Read the linked article and if you are still not comfortable with using fast charging the feature can usually be turned off on most phones.

Is fast charging also possible wirelessly?

If your phone has an integrated QI coil and you have already equipped your home with corresponding charging stations you certainly do not want to return to the wired charging world. Wireless charging is finding its way into many more phones and could even work over several meters in the near future. Aside from the increased distance however it's in the increased efficiency that the future of wireless charging lies.

Oppo (again) offers up to 50 W wireless charging in the Find X5 Pro / © NextPit

Wireless charging in commercial devices has also developed away from industry standards while the ubiquitous Qi specification goes up to 15 W. We can find phones capable of charging way faster than that but for that again we have to look at the Chinese brands.

Oppo for example announced its AirVOOC 65 W charger but offers up to 50 W with its current (in 2022) flagship Find X5 Pro a wattage already found on the Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra released in 2020. Similar to the wired chargers both models require special charging pads to reach those numbers so you cannot benefit from the higher speed in charging stations integrated into IKEA lamps.

Affiliate offer Anker Foldable 3-in-1 Station with Power Adapter

While this is all very convenient you should consider the efficiency of wireless charging. Because not only is this strongly dependent on the positioning of the charging coils but energy is also always lost during inductive charging. Thus it is not really efficient to place the phone on a Qi charging station in the evening.

Early benchmark scores of the Dimensity 9000 were found to be higher than that of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and as if that wasn’t enough the Qualcomm flagship has now apparently been beaten by the Dimensity 8100 as well.

Tipster Digital Chat Station today shared Geekbench results of the Dimensity 8100 Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and the Snapdragon 888 where the MediaTek chip easily beat the other two on the multi-core test. Devices used were all from realme with the RMX3562 being the upcoming realme GT NEO3.

1 of 3

But the D9000 ranked last in the single-core test due to the presence of a super-powerful Cortex-X1 core on both the Qualcomm chips.

Regardless it’s still remarkable to see a chip that isn’t even MediaTek’s best for this year beat two flagship processors from Qualcomm. MediaTek’s flagship solution for 2022 is actually the Dimensity 9000 chip and the Dimensity 8000 series is only aimed at upper-mid-range smartphones. On top of that the Dimensity 8000 chips use an older 5nm process compared to the cutting-edge 4nm process employed by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.

But Qualcomm does have another card up its sleeve. Another flagship processor from the chipmaker has been making rounds lately and judging by its SM8475 model number it will most likely be an upgraded Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 likely a Plus version. This one will be manufactured using TSMC’s superior 4nm process as opposed to Samsung’s 4nm process used for the first-gen 8 Gen 1. It will thus be interesting to see how well the upgraded version stacks up against rivals.

His starting wage as a deputy with the Macomb County Sheriff’s Office was nowhere close to amount his friends were making in the automotive industry but he was planning for the future.

“I knew I wasn’t going to make a lot of money but the pension was good. It was something my wife and I could bank on” said Gelios who will be turning 69 in a few weeks.

During his career as a deputy Gelios worked to protect and serve the people of his county including his wife Karen and their two children now grown and with families of their own. As a veteran he was offered assignments that might have eased his burdens but for him being a deputy required a total commitment which sometimes meant dropping everything he was doing off duty in order to assist those on duty.

After 25 years of service Gelios retired.

He was 48 and looking forward to a life of leisure. However a year later when Michael Koehs took on the role of clerk for Macomb Township and asked Gelios to serve as his deputy clerk he decided to return to the workforce.

It’s lucky he did.

In 2011 shortly after he started working again a new retirement pension tax was enacted by Gov. Rick Snyder changing the income that he and his wife had planned on getting in their golden years.

“It wasn’t right” said Gelios who retired permanently after serving as a clerk for 14 years. “I was still working at that point so I didn’t feel it as much as other people I knew who didn’t return to work and had to pay it. I feel the seniors work all their lives and calculate what money they will have available when they retire like I did. Then he passed this tax and robbed the seniors of any cushion they may have had.”

Others agree and now there is a bill to phase it out.

Repealing the tax

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is supporting legislation that would eliminate the state’s so-called “pension tax” of 4.25% enacted in 2011 under Gov. Rick Snyder to help fill a $930 million budget shortfall created by other state cuts.

The proposal would replace on average $1000 a year taken from the pockets of 500000 Michigan households by exempting public pensions and restoring deductions for private retirement income including private-sector pensions withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and the portion of a 401K account subject to an employer match.

The move is due in part to the billions in pandemic relief funds the state received from the federal government.

“In May of 2020 we were projecting a $3 billion deficit” Whitmer said during a roundtable discussion held in Detroit. “Today we have a $7 billion surplus. Some of this is one-time money and some of it is ongoing money. We have to be smart about how we utilize it. This is an opportunity for us to right a wrong that has been on the books for 10 years.”

She said inflation has made things difficult for Michigan pensioners who are on a limited and fixed income adding “we can afford to do it now and I think giving seniors relief should be our top priority right now.”

According to the Senate Fiscal Agency the governor’s proposal to be phased-in over four years would have an estimated $495 million General Fund budget impact by the end of 2025.

Since 2012 the tax on Michigan pension income received across the state’s 147 state- and locally-administered public pension systems has added up to more than $5 billion according to the Michigan State Employee Retirees Association.

What does it mean?

Beginning this year under the governor’s proposal Michigan pensioners age 65 and over born before 1958 would be able to claim 25% of their retirement income as tax-exempt.

In 2023 those 62 and older born before 1962 would be able to claim 50% of their pension income as tax-exempt and in 2024 those age 59 and older born before 1966 would be able to claim 75% of their pension income as tax-exempt.

In tax year 2025 all Michiganders with pension income no matter their age or date of birth would be able to claim 100% of that income as tax-exempt.

Alan C. Young managing director of Detroit-based Alan C. Young and Associates who joined Whitmer’s roundtable discussion attended by retirees from the Detroit area said the impact of repealing the pension tax is important if you want to make Michigan a destination state.

His public accounting firm works with thousands of retirees in Michigan and across the country.

“When you have a situation where you’re taxing pension income in Michigan but not in other states that becomes an issue that needs to figure itself out” he said. “It’s important if you want to make Michigan a destination state for retirees. I’m all for putting money back in the pockets of retirees. You’re taxing them from birth to death and that’s not how we want to handle our seniors.”

In the 2019 tax a total of 1074890 state individual income tax returns had $24.9 million worth of taxable pensions and annuities according to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data.

A majority of those pensioners reported total adjusted income of between $25000 to $50000. That year a total of 1.3 million state income tax filers were age 60 and older according to IRS data.

Young said he supports the proposal but added there needs to be a long-term budget strategy to make sure this proposed tax cut and the state revenue lost as a result can be sustained even without a surplus of federal dollars.

“What’s also important is how have their fixed costs risen due to inflation?” asked Young. “They are losing money and if they can get a break wherever they can including with the pensions it’s a start. We need to try to give relief to our seniors. The timing is an important factor here…this law is unfair.”

Paula Cunningham AARP Michigan director said in a statement that the organization supports the phasing out of the state’s tax on pensions that egregiously pulled the rug out from under a large swath of Michigan retirees who planned and counted on a pension not diminished by taxation.

Michael LaBuhn 73 of Washington Township said he always thought it was odd the way it was done.

“It depends on your age not how much you made” said LaBuhn whose teaching career spanned 40 years four of which were spent as a representative for several teacher’s unions.

“In my opinion it was one more piece of disrespect for educator workers unionism and seniors” he said. “They were giving more tax breaks to the big companies.”

He believes repealing the tax would be a nice step in righting a wrong.

About the tax

For decades Michiganders with pension income were not taxed on that limited income which averages about $24609 per year.

That all changed in 2011 leaving many Michigan retirees feeling blindsided and short changed having worked most of their lives only to have their pension income taxed.

Before February 2011 Michigan was one of 14 states that did not tax retirees on their pensions. The state’s pension tax was part of a major rewrite of Michigan’s state tax code under Gov. Snyder. It also replaced the Michigan Business Tax with the 6% Corporate Income Tax and reduced various credits.

Currently pension income is taxed in a three-tier system depending on the taxpayer’s date of birth including:

Michigan retirees born before 1946 about ⅔ of all Michigan pensioners are unaffected and whose public pensions are fully tax-exempt.

Retirees born between 1946 and 1952 can deduct the first $20000 of pension income for single taxpayers and $40000 for married couples filing jointly prior to age 67. When they turn 67 they are able to claim those same exemptions against all income regardless of the source.

Michigan retirees born in 1953 or after cannot deduct any retirement income until they turn 67 when they can also claim more limited $20000- and $40000-income tax exemptions.

In June 2011 one week after the legislation was signed into law Snyder asked for an advisory opinion concerning the constitutionality of the pension tax from the Michigan Supreme Court. That November in a 4-3 decision along party lines the Michigan Supreme Court upheld the pension tax on public employee retirees born after 1945.

Even though the new law softened the impact on those born before 1946 younger seniors and pensioners were estimated by the Michigan House and Senate Fiscal Agencies to have paid $528 million more in state taxes in 2012 alone.

In Macomb County a total of 102234 households receive retirement income averaging $21982 annually according to 2019 U.S. Census Bureau data the most recent data available.

The 139404 Oakland County households that receive retirement income see an average of $27865 per year while the 184844 Wayne County retirement income households see an average of $23897 per year.

Proposed legislation

Over the past year eight pieces of legislation have been introduced in the State Senate and House that propose in some form repealing the state’s tax on pension income.

This week while speaking to a group of retirees in Detroit Whitmer said it’s important the state has tax policy that is fair and that doesn’t put an undue burden on Michigan seniors.

Whitmer said any legislative efforts towards phasing out the tax on pension income she views as positive adding she’s eager to have negotiations with legislative leaders and get moving down that path.

“Obviously the legislature is one leg of the stool and getting my signature is another” she said.

Earlier this month State Rep. Pat Outman (R- Six Lakes) introduced House Bill 5770 that aims to repeal the state’s tax on pension income. Under his bill Michigan seniors would no longer pay state taxes on retirement income they have earned or saved beginning Jan. 1 2023.

“With many seniors and retirees living on a fixed income this bill would give them more flexibility in their budgets and more money in their pockets to live more comfortably during their golden years” he said.

In January 2021 Sen. Tom Barrett (R-Clarklake) introduced Senate Bill 24 which also aims to repeal the pension tax.

Following the governor’s State of the State Address Jan. 26 in which she said eliminating the tax on pension income was one of her top policy priorities for 2022 Barret said he appreciated the governor’s bipartisan support to provide Michigan seniors with this overdue tax relief.

“This legislation can make an enormous difference for our seniors” he said. “It is unfair to those on a fixed income to bear this additional burden of taxation on previously earned benefits.”

Sen. Paul Wojno (D-Center Line) has also introduced legislation Senate Bill 0002 to repeal the tax.

On Thursday the House Appropriations and Tax Policy Committees approved House Bill 5054 which provides a total of $1.5 billion in one-time tax relief to reduce debt and improve the finances of public employee retirement systems.

Most of the funding would go to pension plans for local governments and road commissions with an additional $350 million to improve financing in the Michigan State Police retirement system.

Raymond James & Associates’ Lisa Stella of Bloomfield Hills has been helping seniors from Macomb and Oakland counties with their financial planning for more than 25 years and while none of her clients have said anything about the possibility of the repeal it doesn’t mean they’re not concerned.

“It may be they just don’t know about it – because it’s just one of many factors that figure into their retirement plan” Stella said.

No matter how good the plan might be a tax repeal could not have come at a better time she added.

“The way costs are rising even to maintain one’s purchasing power requires more money” she said. “So I think it’s particularly attractive now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlkZHQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDYvd3dlLXNwb3RsaWdodC10aGUtdW5zdG9wcGFibGUtbW9tZW50dW0tb2YtYmlhbmNhLWJlbGFpci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE Spotlight: The unstoppable momentum of Bianca Belair,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvcmFtcy9uZXdzL2xvcy1hbmdlbGVzLW9kZWxsLWJlY2toYW0tanItcmVzaWduLWxlcy1zbmVhZC1zZWFuLW1jdmF5LXNjb3V0aW5nLWNvbWJpbmUtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rams Re-Sign Odell Beckham Jr? 'Mutual Interest',"The Los Angeles Rams are looking to add in Odell Beckham Jr. for the 2022 season and Beckham wants to return as well

Los Angeles Rams receiver Odell Beckham Jr. played a vital role in Sean McVay's offense before suffering a torn ACL in Super Bowl LVI. Now he's hopeful his final play at SoFi Stadium won't be his last donning a Rams' uniform.

Beckham has interest in returning to Los Angeles for the 2022 season. After undergoing surgery to repair his ligaments doctors expect him to make a full recovery and be available for the second half of next season.

Rams general manager Les Snead told reporters via Zoom Wednesday that the organization is hoping to keep the core together of another season. Los Angeles is also working on extensions for quarterback Matthew Stafford and defensive lineman Aaron Donald after their Super Bowl heroics.

McVay also expressed interest in keeping Beckham around for another season telling NFL Network's Adam Schein that the 29-year-old is someone he wants to work with for the foreseeable future.

""I can't say enough about him as a teammate as a person"" McVay said on Sirius XM's Mad Dog Sports Radio. ""I really love him cherish our relationship that we were able to establish and develop and I'm hopeful that there will be many more years to come with us working together.""

Beckham rebuilt his reputation after two and a half lackluster seasons with the Cleveland Browns. In only eight games with Los Angeles Beckham snagged 27 catches for 305 yards and five touchdowns

When the postseason arrived he snagged 21 receptions for 288 yards and two touchdowns. Beckham was also dangerous in the red zone scoring six of his seven touchdowns from inside the 10-yard line.

""We definitely want to be able to get Odell back"" McVay told Schein. ""I also know that there's gonna be some other teams that probably want his services but hopefully we'll be able to convince him to come back and be a part of this thing.""

According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport the expectation is that Beckham will be ready to play at the beginning of November.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL2FmYy13ZXN0L2thbnNhcy1jaXR5LWNoaWVmcy9uZmwtd29ybGQtcmVhY3RzLXRvLXR5cmFubi1tYXRoaWV1cy10ZWxsaW5nLW1lc3NhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyrann Mathieu Posts Telling Message: NFL World Reacts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-west/kansas-city-chiefs/nfl-world-reacts-to-tyrann-mathieus-telling-message on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL2FmYy13ZXN0L2thbnNhcy1jaXR5LWNoaWVmcy9uZmwtd29ybGQtcmVhY3RzLXRvLXR5cmFubi1tYXRoaWV1cy10ZWxsaW5nLW1lc3NhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti launches late March

NVIDIA flagship RTX 3090 Ti model set to launch on March 29th a message on Chiphell forums alleges.

It has been a while since the last rumored launch date for RTX 3090 Ti has been shared. This model is NVIDIA’s upcoming enthusiast SKU featuring the full GA102 GPU silicon combined with faster 24 GB and 21 Gbps GDDR6X memory. It is reported that NVIDIA has now set a launch date for this model to March 29th after failing to deliver updates for exactly 2 months now.

The message goes further by explaining the possible reason for the card delay as a memory-related problem. Among many possible reasons for the delay such as hardware/BIOS related we have been told there were difficulties with the memory stability under some very specific scenarios. Based on the Chiphell post it is assumed that the issue required a complete replacement of the memory in order to fix this issue.

Furthermore the post claims that NVIDIA is scraping its plans for RTX 3070 Ti 16 GB which had appeared in multiple rumors and leaks in the past. This model was expected to compete with upcoming Intel Arc A780 GPU supposedly featuring 16 GB memory as well.

This is in fact the first report on the not-yet-released RTX 3090 Ti since early January when the card was first presented at CES 2022. We have not been able to confirm this rumor yet however we will provide an update should something change (again).

The hacking group has infiltrated NVIDIA's servers and now more information on Ada Lovelace is here. We have the full specs of NVIDIA's next-gen Ada Lovelace-based GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs including the AD102 AD103 AD104 AD106 and AD107 GPUs.

NVIDIA's next-gen Ada Lovelace GPU architecture is expected to be deployed later this year with the flagship AD102 GPU with the full 18432 CUDA cores and 384-bit memory bus. Next down on the list we have the AD103 GPU which should have 10753 CUDA cores and the AD104 GPU with 7680 CUDA cores. After that there's the AD106 and AD107 GPUs with 4608 CUDA cores and 3072 CUDA cores respectively.

Disclaimer: in order to provide some context the AD102 with ""12 x 6"" refers to 12 (GPC = Graphics Processing Cluster) and 6 (TPC = Texture Processing Cluster). Inside of each TPC you'll find 2 x SM (Streaming Multiprocessor). Now that we have it out of the way here are the Ada Lovelace GPU leaked specs:

AD102 : 12 x 6 + 384-bit memory bus

AD103 : 7 x 6 + 256-bit memory bus

AD104 : 5 x 6 + 192-bit memory bus

AD106 : 3 x 6 + 128-bit memory bus

AD107: 3 x 4 + 128-bit memory bus",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvbnZpZGlhLWhhY2tlcnMtdGhyZWF0ZW4tdHJhZGUtc2VjcmV0cy1ydHgtNDAtc2VyaWVzLWFsbGVnZWRseS1leHBvc2Vk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Employee Data Leaked Hackers Threaten Trade Secrets RTX 40 Series Allegedly Exposed,"



However Lapsus has made numerous demands of NVIDIA and changed its goals twice. Initially the group simply wanted to establish contact with Team Green but later it said that it wants the company to ""push an update for all 30 series firmware that remove every LHR limitations."" LHR of course stands for ""Lite Hash Rate"" and it refers to NVIDIA's practice of artificially limiting cryptographic hash rates on GeForce GPUs intended for gamers rather than crypto miners. Lapsus claims to have gamers in mind with this demand but it's hard to imagine how.









Even if Lapsus doesn't end up releasing the design files for GeForce GPUs the data that the group has released has already done plenty of damage. The employee data from NVIDIA included e-mail addresses and hashed passwords for some 71335 employees both past and present. NVIDIA is only known to have around 18000 employees at current so it's possible that that information goes back quite a ways. HaveIBeenPwned claims that the hashes have been cracked already and are being traded among the hacker community.





The standout specification is of course the L2 cache size. It's tied to the memory bus width and is sixteen times larger in Ada Lovelace than in Ampere. That's bound to have a big impact on performance but don't discount the effect of having some 71% more shader modules either. That top-end AD102 GPU is going to be absolutely massive and likely responsible for the outrageous 600W power draw claims we've seen in the past.











Another concern from the Lapsus hack is the release of NVIDIA signatures. Along with the leak a couple of signatures for expired NVIDIA certifications came out. Per cybersecurity enthusiast Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog on Twitter ) threat actors have already started using the leaked NVIDIA certs to sign their malware.





Even though they're expired Windows 10 and Windows 11 will gleefully load them as drivers at the kernel level. That opens the hatch for a flood of nasty exploits using the expired certs but thankfully security experts are already on top of the matter.

Let's go over the NVIDIA vs. Lapsus saga: On February 25th The Telegraph reported that an insider had informed them of a cyber-attack on NVIDIA. The next day Lapsus (frequently stylized as LAPSUS$) took responsibility for the hack and claimed that NVIDIA had hacked them back with a ransomware attack although supposedly it was unsuccessful.As if to prove that that same day Lapsus released ""part one"" of its ill-gotten gains from NVIDIA including proprietary source code as well as a database of employee credentials. The gang claims that this 20GB leak is just a tiny fraction of a full 1TB of data that they stole over the course of a week that they had admin access to NVIDIA's systems and that if NVIDIA doesn't acquiesce to its demands it will continue to release stolen proprietary data.Then on March 1st Lapsus added another demand: ""NVIDIA [must] commit to COMPLETELY OPEN-SOURCE (and distribute under a foss license) their GPU drivers for Windows macOS and Linux from now on and forever."" That's such a grandiose demand that it's hard to even take seriously with users in Lapsus' Telegram chat alternately cheering them for their open-source spirit and jeering them for their unrealistic expectations.Lapsus claims to have pilfered all kinds of proprietary product information including design files such as RTL and layout information for ""all recent NVIDIA GPUs including the RTX 3090 Ti and upcoming revisions."" That's the kind of information that constitutes ""trade secrets"" and certainly data that NVIDIA would prefer to keep out of the hands of its competitors—to say nothing of Chinese or Russian groups looking to create their own home-grown computer hardware. However it's very likely that the information is tightly encrypted and may ultimately be of little value outside of NVIDIA's network.That post said ""YOU HAVE UNTIL FRIDAY YOU DECIDE!"" but Friday has come and gone and the only news from Lapsus has been the leak of 204 GB of data from an unrelated Samsung hack . In fact Lapsus has said twice today that it wants people to ""GIVE US TIME"" and that asking about the NVIDIA data will result in a block on Telegram.Furthermore the driver source that Lapsus released aside from any other consequences it may have also apparently included the codenames and certain specifications for the next generation of GeForce GPUs. Thanks to hardware-heads @XinoAssassin1 @kopite7kimi  and @harukaze5719 on Twitter we were able to compile this chart that lists the known specifications of NVIDIA's upcoming Ada Lovelace GPUs and compares them against its extant Ampere series.As of the time of this writing in the mid-afternoon on Saturday in the United States Lapsus has still not released any new NVIDIA information.

The deal is not yet finalised with a plan to have the first model ready to sell in 2025.

4 Reviews

Sony and Honda have signed a memorandum of understanding that confirms their intent to partner on electric vehicles. A statement from the companies said that they plan to explore and further discuss the idea with the deal still to be finalised. If they decide to go ahead they would start the joint venture this year forecasting 2025 as the year they would begin to sell EVs.

In the partnership Honda will own the manufacturing of the first body of the vehicle while Sony uses its expertise in image sensing telecommunication network and entertainment technologies to build a mobility service platform.

This is not the first time that Sony has explored EVs; the Sony Vision-S EV concept was shown in 2020 and the Vision-S02 concept electric SUV was unveiled at CES 2022. At the same event Sony announced Sony Mobility a separate EV division of the company. It is unclear whether the company will continue with this alongside the potential joint venture.

Honda is also already involved in the EV space with plans to launch e:N Architecture an electric vehicle platform and solid-state batteries by the end of the decade. All of these projects are part of Honda’s goal to only sell electric vehicles by 2040.

For the first time in nearly 24 years we will be seeing GPU releases from three companies in the next few months. A summary of those releases has been put together by 3DCenter.

Intel ARC by end of Q2 2022

Intel is finally expected to launch its Arc Alchemist graphics cards for laptops by the end of this month and then desktop GPUs by the end of June (second quarter). While the company did not confirm the names of its upcoming desktop products it is commonly believed that the flagship model will adopt a name of Arc A780 featuring the full DG2-512EU GPU and 16 GB of GDDR6 memory. It is expected to compete in the upper mid-range segment with Radeon RX 6700 and GeForce RTX 3070 series.

Probably a bit sooner Intel might release its low-end DG2-128EU based Arc A300 GPUs (A350/A380) those cards have a chance to compete with Radeon RX 6500 and GeForce RTX 3050 series in the entry-level space. All those cards are officially coming by the end of the second quarter.

NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti in March

NVIDIA will be releasing its flagship RTX 3090 Ti on March 29th claims the rumor from Chiphell. This model has been on a schedule for a few weeks now after NVIDIA failed to deliver an update on this SKU since the CES 2022 announcement. What is important to note is that the March release date has not been confirmed yet. However at this moment it is the only NVIDIA RTX 30 card now on a launch schedule after alleged cancellation of RTX 3070 Ti 16 GB SKU.

AMD Radeon RX 6_50XT refresh coming in April

AMD will be refreshing its RDNA2 desktop models led by Radeon RX 6950XT featuring faster 18 Gbps memory and increased TDP. While this model is considered a direct response to NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti the RX 6750XT and RX 6650XT should offer competitive performance against Intel Arc GPUs. The RX 6950XT should launch in April but the launch date of the mid-range XT SKUs is currently unknown.

AMD NVIDIA and Intel will definitely give us a lot of new hardware to discuss in the next couple of weeks and that’s right before we switch to next-gen GPU architectures in the third and fourth quarter of this year.

Philippe Coutinho gave a masterclass and Danny Ings offered Southampton a painful reminder of his prowess as Aston Villa’s revival continued in style with a 4-0 hammering at Villa Park.

Ings who joined Villa from Southampton in the summer for £25million scored one and made two while Coutinho netted once claimed an assist and could have had a hat-trick as Steven Gerrard’s side made it successive victories.

Ollie Watkins and Douglas Luiz scored Villa’s other goals in their biggest win since beating Liverpool 7-2 in October 2020 while it ended Saints’ five-match unbeaten run in the Premier League.

Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster made vital saves from Watkins Coutinho and Ings to prevent an even heavier defeat.

Southampton were wearing their yellow and blue change kit to show support for Ukraine and Saints fans hung scarves of those colours to greet their team before kick-off.

But it was Villa fans who were cheering as their team took the lead in the ninth minute.

Watkins turned Oriol Romeu with ease before calmly curling home a shot after Ings provided the pass.

It was the 100th goal Watkins had scored in league football which includes 10 on loan at non-league side Weston-super-Mare and his seventh of the season.

In a rare break Southampton midfielder Stuart Armstrong curled inches wide trying to pick his spot.

Villa’s Jacob Ramsey unmarked at the far post could only head wide from John McGinn’s corner.

Watkins should have doubled Villa’s lead in the 31st minute. Coutinho provided the perfect through ball but his shot was palmed away by Forster.

The closest Southampton came to scoring was in the 33rd minute. Valentino Livramento crossed but Che Adams could only head on top of the net.

Romain Perraud drove wide for the visitors who were to regret their missed chances as Villa went on to dominate.

Coutinho twice went desperately close sandwiched in between setting up the second goal.

First Forster blocked his shot with his right leg after Watkins pulled the ball back from the left.

Then agonisingly the Brazilian curled the ball fractionally wide after Watkins’ headed flick left him in the clear.

In between Coutinho’s superb movement beat the offside trap as he latched on to Calum Chambers’ chip and unselfishly squared for Luiz to tap home in the 44th minute.

Villa made the game safe with two further goals within nine minutes of the restart.

Coutinho turned one way then the other before firing through Forster’s legs in the 52nd minute after Ings cut the ball back.

Two minutes later Ings netted with a first-time shot that swerved away from Forster into the far corner from Matty Cash’s cross.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kYXJpYS1yb3NlLWV4cGxhaW5lZC1zaGUtc3BlbnQtMTk0NzAwODE4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daria Rose Explained How She Spent $4400 to Appear on Exactly One Episode of 'The Bachelor',"

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

Finding love on reality TV isn't easy. It is also not cheap. Some fans are surprised to learn that the contestants on The Bachelor have to bring their own wardrobe and do their own hair and makeup on the show. Since most women don't have multiple ballgowns in their closet this usually means buying at least some (and often *many*) new items for the show.

In January Daria Rose a contestant on Clayton Echard's season posted a video on TikTok revealing that she spent $44000 on clothing and beauty products to prepare for her appearance on the show only to be sent home on the first night. The post quickly went viral for obvious reasons:

In a new post on Insider Daria broken down her Bachelor budget in detail complete with links to some of dresses she bought. She also offered a little extra insight into why she spent as much as she did and what she plans to do with the gowns she didn't get a chance to wear onscreen.

Let's start with the one $600 lewk that did make it to TV. Daria choose a stunning blue Sandra gown by Dress the Population (cost: $200) paired with white lace-up heels by Black designer Kendall Miles (cost: $400).

That's a lot of money but she DID look stunning:

""Some of my TikTok followers said they would have bought all of their dresses from cheap fast-fashion companies like Shein to save money"" she wrote. ""It's true that I definitely wasn't required to spend thousands of dollars but it was important to me that my fashion choices highlighted a diverse group of designers.""

Here are some of the other pricey pieces Daria says she bought for the show:

Red Illegal Halter Gown from Revolve — $219

Red x REVOLVE Allure Gown — $319

Hot Pink x REVOLVE Single Breasted Jacket and matching Boot Pant — $395

Emerald Green Alamour the Label Gown — $420

Daria says she also spent hundreds of dollars stocking up on new everyday fashion items (tops jeans athleisure wear etc). and that in total she spent $3408 on clothes to wear on her Bachelor journey.

Add in the $600 she spent on hair services and products and the more than $400 she dropped on makeup and beauty supplies and Daria's one-night Bachelor appearance ended up costing her about $4400.

""The amount each Bachelor contestant spends probably varies a lot but I'm not letting my investments go to waste"" she explained. ""I'll still make good use of the beauty products and I plan on repurposing or donating the dazzling gowns.""

Chloe Fineman took away all the wrong lessons from Netflix’s hit show “Inventing Anna” on this weekend’s “Saturday Night Live.”

After catching a few episodes of the series about the con artist Anna Sorokin who deceived New York City’s elite under the moniker “Anna Delvey” Fineman chooses to fully inhabit the scammer (played on the Netflix show by Julia Garner) to get what she wants around her workplace.

Sporting Sorokin’s signature glasses tresses and supremely bizarre accent Fineman stomps around 30 Rock and makes insane demands of her fellow cast members and host Oscar Isaac.

Upon seeing people eating “broke-ass” chips in her presence she insists that the staff invest in an upgrade. “We need something more exclusive” she declares. “More VIP. Like Nobu.” She tells an NBC page (“SNL” writers assistant Jacob Kaplan) to “run it on my card” which of course turns out to be a Metrocard.

Fineman then lets Kyle Mooney know she’s taking his couch before relieving James Austin Johnson of his role as President Joe Biden all at what she claims is the behest of “SNL” boss Lorne Michaels.

“I assure you his text is on the way. He’s in the Hamptons right now” she tells Mooney parodying Sorokin’s grift of name-dropping extremely wealthy people to open doors. “Reception is very bad very VIP.”

Fineman next sets her sights on Michael Che bluntly informing him that she’s replacing him at the “Weekend Update” desk. Che doesn’t bat an eye: “Alright bet” he says and wheels away a suitcase he’s apparently had ready to go all this time.

But after Fineman negs Isaac by telling him he looks poor ― which in the Sorokin drawl comes out sounding like “parr” “purr” and “peure” among other things ― her fellow cast member Kate McKinnon attempts to stage an intervention.

“I can’t help but notice you’ve been Delvey-ing everyone today” says McKinnon ― who may have an agenda of her own.

“You know he was a friend of mine” the former president told the athlete on speaker phone as recorded in a viral video. “I got along great with him.”

Mr Daly is a Republican and staunch supporter of Mr Trump. As the ex-president spoke to the golfer Mr Trump repeated a claim that he’s made frequently in recent weeks: that if he were still president Russia’s leader wouldn’t dare invade Ukraine.

“I’d say ‘Vladimir if you do it we’re hitting Moscow’” the one-term president bragged to Mr Daly. “I said ‘We’re gonna hit Moscow.’ And he sort of believed me like five per cent 10 per cent. That’s all you need. He never did it during my time John.”

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now in its third week. The United Nations has estimated that at least 227 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million have fled the country. On Sunday reports emerged that Russian soldiers were either intentionally or accidentally firing on evacuees.

As the invasion has progressed Mr Trump’s comments on Russia have swung wildly from glowing admiration to harsh condemnation and sometimes back again. In late February he called the war “genius” and Mr Putin as “smart” “savvy” and “brilliant”.

“I mean he’s taking over a country for two dollars’ worth of sanctions” he said on 23 February. “I’d say that’s pretty smart.”

But in a speech to Republican donors on Saturday in New Orleans Mr Trump struck a different tone.

“Are all of these nations going to stand by and watch perhaps millions of people be slaughtered as the onslaught continues?” he demanded according to CBS News. “At what point do countries say ‘No we can’t take this massive crime against humanity?’ We can’t let it happen. We can’t let it continue to happen.”

During his presidency Mr Trump repeatedly praised Mr Putin sided with him against his own intelligence agencies at a public press conference and held up a military aid package to Ukraine while demanding a public investigation of Joe Biden’s son Hunter.

“Nobody has ever been tougher on Russia than me” Mr Trump said on Saturday.

In the same speech the former president said the US should put Chinese flags on its fighter jets and “bomb the s*** out of Russia”.

“And then we say China did it we didn’t do it China did it and then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch” Mr Trump told the crowd according to a transcript from The Washington Post.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3JleC10cmFkaW5nLWNvdXJzZXMtc2VlLXN0cm9uZy0wNDU1MDA3ODguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forex Trading Courses See Strong Growth in 2021 - George Ama Explains why CK Trading Institute is Taking ...,"DELAWARE CITY DE / ACCESSWIRE / March 6 2022 / Stock markets and other financial asset markets have grown at breakneck speed in 2021 and into 2022.

The 724000-square-foot project represents a total investment by Regeneron of $1.39 billion resulting in the creation of at least 700 new full-time jobs and nearly 800 construction jobs.

“Today’s historic vote by the IDA is an important affirmation of Westchester County’s ongoing commitment to economic development and job creation. The financial incentives to be provided to Regeneron by the IDA will result in tremendous economic dividends for our County with hundreds of new construction jobs as well as hundreds of new well-paying jobs in the booming life sciences industry” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer.

“The Westchester IDA applauds Regeneron for its continued investment in our County’s economy with this major expansion of its Tarrytown campus. Today’s significant vote is yet another example of how the IDA is working to promote economic development in Westchester by creating attracting and retaining jobs” said IDA Chair Joan McDonald.

The new facility would house multiple new R&D laboratories administrative buildings and amenities supporting the company’s important work of turning groundbreaking science into much needed medicines. The project would encompass the design construction and fit‐out of up to eight buildings three parking garages and a central utility plant. The project which has received approval from the Town of Greenburgh Planning Department would begin between April and June of this year and is expected to be completed by the end of 2027.

According to an economic impact report prepared for the IDA by Camoin Associates construction of the project will result in 789 jobs during the construction phase generating $100 million in total earnings. It is estimated that approximately 70% of these new earnings will be spent within Westchester County and 25% of that spending will generate sales tax revenue for the County. A cost benefit analysis shows that Regeneron’s project will generate a return of approximately $1.62 of County tax revenue for each $1.00 of County incentives awarded which is at the top of the range of projects previously approved by the IDA.

Regeneron an industry-leading biotechnology company and Westchester’s largest private employer currently has more than 3300 full-time employees at its corporate and R&D headquarters at 777 Old Saw Mill River Road in Tarrytown. Founded and led by physician-scientists the company has nine FDA-approved treatments and numerous product candidates in development almost all of which were invented in Regeneron’s Tarrytown laboratories. Its medicines help people with eye diseases allergic and inflammatory diseases cancer cardiovascular and metabolic diseases rare diseases and infectious diseases like COVID-19 and Ebola. Last year Regeneron announced that it plans to invest about $1.8 billion over six years to expand its facilities in Westchester and the Mid-Hudson region.

Regeneron indicated that it considered alternative sites in New Jersey for the expansion noting that New Jersey has the highest concentration of scientists and engineers in the nation. Regeneron requested a sales tax exemption of approximately $47.5 million and real property tax exemption of approximately

$125.3 million. In addition to the financial assistance sought from the IDA Regeneron has been granted $100 million in other public incentives to partially defray the cost of the proposed project capital investment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzc4NTE3MzIyMDAwMTc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Genome DNA leakage of Adeno–Associated virus under freeze–thaw stress,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378517322000175 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzc4NTE3MzIyMDAwMTc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbWVyaWNrbGVhZGVyLmllL25ld3MvbW90b3JpbmctbmV3cy83NTk3ODYva2lhLWV2Ni1pcy1ldXJvcGVzLWNhci1vZi10aGUteWVhci0yMDIyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kia EV6 is Europe's Car of the Year 2022,"KIA's EV6 all-electric crossover has been named Europe’s Car of the year 2022 by a panel of European motoring journalists.

The meeting was devoted to coordinating actions in response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine as well as political economic social and humanitarian consequences of Russia’s war on a neighbouring state.

In the discussion with Secretary Blinken we raised the most important issues arising from the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine - Poland's two eastern neighbours – both for Polish-American bilateral relations and for allied cooperation within NATO as well as for the coordination of political activities in the OSCE.

Poland will never recognize territorial changes brought about by unlawful and unprovoked aggression.

The way in which Russia conducts hostilities based on the desire to break the will of Ukrainian resistance by means of attacks that terrorize civilian populations shelling residential areas nuclear power plants and non-military vehicles are war crimes under international law which are not subjected to statutes of limitation and will be prosecuted with utmost determination. I call on Russia to refrain from attacks on civilian populations. I call both parties to abide by international humanitarian law and to treat prisoners of war with dignity.

Turning over all war criminals must be considered in future peace negotiations.

Due to its own painful experiences in the past Poland will consequently demand prosecuting war criminals. This is our historic debt to the inhabitants of Guernica and Wieluń whose sacrifices can never be forgotten. Pursuing war criminals is an element of mankind’s common memory. To achieve this Poland called to life the Raphael Lemkin Center for Documenting Russian War Crimes in Ukraine. We discussed possibilities for Polish-American cooperation in this area.

I call for an end to the bloodshed and a cease fire for the duration of the talks.

In my capacity as OSCE chairman-in-office I welcomed the understanding for creating humanitarian corridors that will facilitate the evacuation of civilians from Ukrainian cities under siege. Along with the majority of OSCE countries I appealed for this from the outset of the conflict. I view this understanding as a ray of hope to prevent more Ukrainian civilians from falling victim to war. Everything possible must be done to ensure their evacuation.

Russia’s aggression in Ukraine caused a humanitarian crisis of unimaginable scale. Our priority is organizing effective aid to hundreds of thousands and soon to be millions of refugees. Poland already offered asylum to 700 thousand refugees and we will continue to do so for everyone that needs it regardless of their nationality race or religious creed.

The attack on Ukraine already transformed Europe and its sense of security. Poland decided to immediately increase its defense spending budget to 3 % of its GDP beginning next year.

As a key country for deterring and defending NATO’s eastern flank Poland wholeheartedly welcomed the Alliances’ swift reaction to the new strategic circumstances.

I conveyed to Secretary Blinken my thanks to President Biden for his effective leadership in coordinating an explicit united and effective response from the transatlantic community and the free world to Russia’s aggression.

As a host country for NATO Response Force on the eastern flank Poland plays a critical role in this reaction and we are determined to abide by it. In line with the Charter of the United Nations Poland will provide all possible support to Ukraine who is currently defending itself from unprovoked and unlawful aggression.",,,,,,,,,

The game was tied 14-14 early in the second quarter when Sands took over the game piecing together a 29-0 run that wasn't ended until late in the third quarter.

Sands led 28-14 at halftime and 48-25 at the end of the third quarter.

""We knew we had to come out and play hard"" Robert Lee head coach Brandye Wilson said. ""We had just struggled with their press and their aggressive defense. They're an amazing group of girls and we just had to try to stop that and we struggled with it today.

""But I will say this -- my girls made me super proud today. They always give everything with their whole heart and they make me proud.""

This is the first state basketball championship in Sands program history.

""It's overwhelming actually"" Lady Mustangs head coach Ben Connell said. ""The whole experience has been awesome the job that the UIL does to make this a great experience for the kids.

""I'm so happy these young ladies let me join them for the ride to experience this. I've been with the seniors for a long long time. It's kind of a little sad because you know it's your last game with them. Obviously it's my greatest moment as a coach to be able to experience this with this group.""

The Robert Lee coach talked about the 29-0 run by Sands that put the game out of reach.

""They became a little bit more aggressive I felt like"" Wilson said. ""It wasn't so much a major different look. Honestly we haven't seen a defense like that all year so I think it threw us off a little bit and frustrated some of my girls especially the younger ones and caused a little bit of a problem for us.""

No. 4-ranked Robert Lee had won 23 straight games and was chasing its first state title since 1978. The Lady Steers ended their season with a 35-3 record.

No. 1 Sands finished 37-3 and ended the year on a 19-game winning streak. It was the Lady Mustangs' first appearance at the state tournament since 1961.

The Lady Mustangs were relentless with their trap defense which caused 36 Robert Lee turnovers. Sands only had seven.

Tournament MVP Elysa Martinez scored a game-high 22 points on 8-of-18 shooting including 2-of-4 from three-point range.

Landry Morrow (20) and Bianca Plata (10) also scored in double digits for the Lady Mustangs.

Senior guard Braylee Hood paced the Lady Steers with 14 points on 4-of-10 shooting and sophomore center/forward Kailey Freeman and senior forward/center Paige Immel scored eight apiece.

Hood reflected on the season as a whole.

""I guess I'm gonna remember all the leadership we've had all year"" Hood said while trying to fight off tears. ""This is the best team I've played on.""

Wilson spoke about the adjustments the Lady Steers made at the half.

""We talked about not stopping"" the Robert Lee coach said. ""We were getting in the habit of as soon as we get across half-court we would stop and hold the ball.

""We talked about trying to push the ball up a little bit and trying to see the whole floor. We put a girl in the middle and hopefully we might see that and be able to break. Those girls were just so aggressive sometimes that we just had a hard time seeing the whole floor.""

The Lady Steers shot 41.7% compared to 38.6% for the Lady Mustangs.

Robert Lee also out-rebounded Sands 34-18. Hood had a game-high 12 boards all on the defensive end to finish with a double-double.

The Lady Steers were almost perfect from the charity stripe as they connected on 12 of 15 foul shots (80%).

Sands went 9-of-15 (60%) from the line.

As tough as Saturday's loss was on the Lady Steers it won't tarnish the journey they enjoyed to get to the state tourney for the first time in nearly a half-century.

""I'm definitely going to remember all the girls on the team"" senior guard McKenzee Puentez said. ""Without them we wouldn't have made it this far. I've made a lot of good friendships and I'm going to miss them a lot.""

Freeman the Region 2-1A MVP who got hurt in Thursday's state semifinal win against Neches is optimistic about the future.

""I like how we have only four (seniors)"" Freeman said. ""We have more experience on the team like the five returning. We have more experience to help out the younger ones who are coming up and we can teach them all about leadership and teamwork and stuff that helps us win games.""

However for some celebrities mask mandates have actually come as a blessing as mask-wearing has served as a disguise from paparazzi. English actor Robert Pattinson is one celebrity who has enjoyed the freedom a mask has given him to stay anonymous out in public.

Read on to learn more about Pattinson’s views on mask-wearing what other celebrities have to say and how mask mandates have hurt the paparazzi business throughout the pandemic.

Robert Pattinson is pro-mask

Pattinson rose to prominence in the public eye after portraying Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. His fame quickly skyrocketed after landing the gig of Edward Cullen in the Twilight movie series. Pattinson 35 has been dealing with the paparazzi and mega fame since his early 20s. Having to find ways to hide from the paparazzi for the last decade and a half Pattinson actually found relief with the emergence of mask mandates that started during the pandemic.

During an interview with GQ Pattinson discussed how wearing a mask throughout the pandemic has given him a sense of anonymity that he quite enjoys when going out in public. Pattinson went on to say “It’s funny with all these anti-mask things because I’m like I will be wearing a mask for the rest of my life. I think I’ve gained a few years of life from lack of stress. It’s ideal when everyone else is wearing one as well so it’s not like I’m standing out. It’s incredible.” With all things considered it’s safe to say that Pattinson is definitely pro-mask.

Many celebrities have found masks to be comforting

Please wear Masks.

Pattinson isn’t the only celebrity that enjoys the anonymity that wearing a mask provides. Over the course of the pandemic many celebrities have been vocal about how masks allow them to do normal things without people recognizing them. Singer actor and television personality Cher is one celebrity that seems to love wearing a mask out in public.

According to Vanity Fair Cher told a fan via social media “OF COURSE I LOVE WEARING MASK. I CAN JUST RUN TO MARKET RUN AROUND SEPHORA& GO TO DRS. & NO ONE KNOWS WHO I AM. [Pray] 4 DAY WE DONT NEED TO WEAR THEM [sic].” From this message it’s clear that the 75-year-old is just as pro mask as many of her fellow celebrities.

Mask-wearing truly gives some celebrities privacy

Over the last two years it seems that many celebrities just like Pattinson and Cher have taken advantage of the fact that paparazzi can’t spot them as easily when sporting a mask. According to the Sunday Mail celebrity trainer Dion Jackson has said that since the pandemic began he has been able to train his superstar clients out on the hiking trails at the beaches and at public parks without anyone being the wiser when they are wearing their masks. The Sunday Mail reports that Jackson who has trained the likes of Jennifer Lopez Al Pacino Jim Carrey has said

“Nobody knows who they are! Probably the only upside of this awful thing is that celebs go anywhere they want with nobody hassling them.”

It seems that mask-wearing has been a blessing to celebrities while also being a hindrance to the entire paparazzi business. The Sunday Mail also reports that Randy Bauer the co-founder of the Bauer-Griffin photo agency has spoken out about how badly mask-wearing has hurt his paparazzi business. Bauer went on to say “We wrongly identified a lot of people. It was such a big hassle to figure out who anyone was. Now we have to identify celebrities more by their gait mannerisms voice.”

Only time will tell how long celebrities can hide behind their masks. Regardless of how things play out it seems like Pattinson is one celebrity that plans to have a lot more mask-wearing in his future both in his personal life and on the big screen in his next big role as Batman.",,,

In an interview with the Bleav in Pro Wrestling podcast former WWE wrestler and agent Jimmy Yang gave his version of events the night Seth Rollins was attacked by a fan on Monday Night RAW.

According to Jimmy Yang his wrestling instincts kicked in as soon as he heard fellow agent and former WCW Cruiserweight Champion Billy Kidman alert everyone that the fan had attacked.

""It was crazy and really like that's where my wrestling instincts (kicked in)"" Yang said. ""I was the next match I was the producer for the next match we were watching Seth's match and all that stuff. So I'm about to be up on the headset so I'm sitting there and Billy Kidman is in Briscoe's spot in the Gorilla Position.

""So basically he sees it all he sees everything. He has all the monitors sees everything and all I heard was 'Seth got attacked.' And I see Billy take off and just wrestler instinct is like 'okay let's go take zoom.' We got each other's back. I heard 'Seth got attacked.' Zoom Billy goes. Zoom I go. We just go in there too just make sure Seth's okay. So you know my mindset running out there. Luckily Billy and Adam Pearce got there before me because it would've been I would've spidermonkeyed that dude.""

Jimmy Yang admitted that the moment itself was scary due to no one knowing if the fan had any kind of weapon on him. He did also admit however that there was a moment of levity soon after the situation was calmed down.

""It's such a scary moment cause if he had a knife if he had some kind of weapon going that fast that's such a crazy situation and luckily nobody got seriously hurt"" Yang said. ""But the funny part was pulling this dude out. Like we all have him pulling him taking him out right? And all of a sudden we're dragging him across the floor and his like pants just go down to his ankle. Butt a– hanging out just everything. It got really intense and then it was like 'oh sh-t this dude's a– and balls are hanging out.'""

""I've been waiting for this since last year"" Roldan who lives close by in Agana Heights said after having her personal grand tour of Guam's latest retail outlet.

This is the third ROSS to open in Guam. The first one opened at Guam Premier Outlets in Tamuning and the other at the Micronesia Mall in Dededo.

Amid soaring prices of gas and other commodities residents came out in full force to check out the latest major store to open in Guam in two years since the COVID-19 pandemic reached the island.

Roldan said besides the excitement of being among the first to see the new store she was glad to find just the perfect wall clock that she wasn't able to locate at other stores.

""It's almost the same but it's just more spacious here and more organized"" Roldan said of the latest store compared to the first two ROSS stores she has been frequenting for years.

Dheor Aky 38 and his wife Ensa Aky drove all the way from Yigo to Hagåtña to find some good deals and they came out of the store happy.

""We wanted to check it out because it's a new store"" the husband said adding that he thinks this outlet has a greater selection of men's clothes so they bought some items.

Within minutes of the store's opening shoppers were able to fill their shopping carts with household items.

Adding to the festive opening day mood were the DJ music and the white and blue balloons to greet customers.

Anthony Damian Quenga 65 said he went to ROSS at Micronesia Mall Friday morning and was asked by a manager there whether he's already checked out the latest store.

That's when he remembered about the grand opening so he immediately put the items he had picked back on the shelves and drove to Agana Shopping Center.

He got there just in time for the 9 a.m. opening. Because he was pushed toward the front he ended up being the third person to go in he said.

""It’s wide open. You could actually see things from a distance. You could see everything. That's what I like about it"" he said.

Quenga shops at the first two ROSS stores ""practically every day"" he said. Now he and his wife Eva have another outlet to check out to buy gifts for their granddaughter Kyrah Veh age 3.

""She's my pride and joy"" Quenga told The Guam Daily Post proudly showing the Minnie Mouse toy he bought for his granddaughter.

While this is the closest ROSS to his home in Mangilao Quenga said he will still visit the other two outlets especially after he made friends with one of the managers there Peter Diaz.

""I just want to say to everybody come to ROSS. It’s the boss"" he said while giving the thumbs up.

Shopping was a family affair for Bree Artero 25 who came to the store with her daughter in a stroller along with her brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

Together they picked out some household items.

""It's bigger more spacious more organized"" Artero said as the group checked out of the store.

The Hagåtña ROSS takes up 22500 square feet of floor space at the former Pay-Less Supermarket location.

On a Thursday morning in early February roughly three dozen Russia-based managers for some of the West’s biggest blue chip multinationals gathered on the top floor of Moscow’s Baltschug Kempinski hotel for a multihour networking and briefing session on Russia’s business climate.

It’s a relatively informal event held every quarter with lots of back-and-forth between participants in a room that has a stunning view of the city’s Red Square and the Kremlin. Speaking in front of them to kick off the meeting with support slides beaming up from a nearby projector was a balding bearded and approachable-looking American named Mark McNamee director of Europe for market intelligence consultancy FrontierView.

A Russian scholar and expert in political economic and security risk analysis Mr. McNamee is only 40 but already boasts a cracking résumé: He’s instructed U.S. counterterrorism agents on the rise of jihad in Africa and lectured at the London Institute of Banking on investment decisions in emerging markets. For the past seven years he’s helped international companies understand the ins and outs of their external environment in Europe and especially Russia.

The party’s over for Russia’s oligarchs. The ones facing sanctions are losing billions – and their megayachts

As he outlined his assessment of the different elements affecting the region’s business prospects to executives from Domino’s Pizza Mondi Plc and others Mr. McNamee pegged the likelihood that the Ukrainian crisis would escalate to some kind of military conflict at 30 per cent. A full-scale Russian invasion with the aim of overthrowing the government in Kyiv? Five to 10 per cent.

Some of the executives in the audience laughed and smirked Mr. McNamee recalled in an interview. “Others said ‘That is impossible. It’s zero per cent.’”

If the executives on the ground didn’t take his warnings seriously their bosses in New York London and Berlin were desperate for advice. The analyst’s phone had been buzzing just days before with queries from panicked C-suite leaders who had heard the latest U.S. intelligence reports warning of an imminent attack. But in Moscow there was near-unanimity among the Russia country chiefs of these same corporations that Mr. McNamee’s worst-case scenario was drastically overblown. The general view among the businesspeople in front of him: “Putin is a rational actor. He would never do something like this.”

What’s happened since is the unthinkable. Ukraine a country of 44 million people is being shelled and bombed by the Russian military in a conflict the likes of which Europe hasn’t seen since the Second World War. As Russia tightens its grip on the country governments across the world are imposing sanctions against the Putin regime with new measures added almost every day. Among the most significant: Group of Seven countries have prohibited transactions with Russia’s central bank preventing Russia from deploying its international currency reserves to manage its economy and fund its war effort. Western allies are also targeting the Russian oligarchs.

But this isn’t simply a fight being waged by political leaders. A growing wave of international business has lashed out against Russia with previously unfathomable force halting operations there breaking off joint venture partnerships and unwinding investments – and not just to protect their own interests. The corporate pile-on is as unprecedented as it has been swift the likely consequence of an autocrat who has gone too far in the eyes of many if not most of the world’s business leaders at a time when corporations have never been more sensitive to being on the wrong side of history.

It’s been about 30 years since the Soviet Union’s collapse which global leaders hoped would usher in a new era of stability and an opportunity for Western corporations in the region they thought they’d never have. Many rushed into Russia like moths attracted to a flame reassured by governments that had opened the diplomatic path. The idea was that if Communist Russia had been brought into the light Western-style commerce and trade were going to brighten its prospects further.

Now however a darkness has returned and the West’s corporations are scrambling to find their way. This is a moment where the new imperatives of global capitalism – the responsibility to stakeholders and a newly adopted attention to environmental social and corporate governance – have shaped the collective consciousness of the Western business world and galvanized its response. A dwindling number of companies are choosing to maintain ties to Russia and those that do will likely face growing demands in the weeks to come to change their minds.

As it stands more than one-third of U.S. companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Index had taken some form of direct action to limit their business in Russia. More are likely to join the list as pressure builds. On Friday Andy Hunter president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine tweeted: “For God’s sake I call on US companies and multinationals to immediately shut down all operations in Russia. US companies must stop profiteering in a pariah state that murders innocent women & children and attacks a nuclear power plant in 21st century Europe.”

Russia has been trying to counter the exodus and has put in place new capital controls to prevent Western firms from selling Russian-based assets. Nor should it surprise anyone if the regime simply seizes their assets in the country a prospect some European banks are already warning might happen.

Regardless of how this shakes out for corporations and for the economies of Russia and the West as they grapple with the challenges of a possible new Cold War the clock has been reset. Trust built up over years and decades between Western companies and their Russian host has been shattered. For some it might never come back again.

In a video address on the day Russia’s attack began Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “What do we hear today? It’s not just rocket explosions fighting and the roar of aircraft. This is the sound of a new Iron Curtain lowering and closing Russia off from the civilized world.”

If the curtain has fallen fast it might be because Russia’s actions took some Western countries and many of their corporate champions by surprise. Companies that thought they were good corporate citizens in Russia trying their best to navigate the rules building wealth and helping make average Russians richer were suddenly confronted with a new reality imposed by a host government that they didn’t see coming and didn’t plan for. As Mr. McNamee puts it: While the top brass of well-known Western firms were wondering whether they should create crisis response units their Moscow-based subordinates were saying “Don’t waste your time.”

Those same companies are acting with urgency now. Automaker Ford Motor Co. suspended operations in Russia Disney stopped releasing films in the country and Apple Inc. halted sales of iPhones and other products as it condemned Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. International shippers such as Maersk and Hapag Lloyd have stopped taking bookings in and out of Russia as the country becomes increasingly shut out of world commerce.

Oil giant BP PLC set the tone early on. Russia’s biggest foreign investor led the Western-company exodus with its announcement that it would abandon its stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft a decision that could cost it as much as US$25-billion in writedowns. Rival Shell PLC followed cutting ties with state-controlled Gazprom.

It’s a far cry from how those same two energy companies responded to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. At the time BP’s then-chief executive Bob Dudley said the company operates in countries “that have ups and downs” while Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said at the time that “it’s the nature of our industry to live through periods of uncertainty.” Last week Mr. Dudley resigned his seat on Rosneft’s board as part of BP’s exodus while Mr. van Beurden said Shell “cannot – and we will not – stand by.” The abrupt shift highlights that when it comes to assessing geopolitical risk in boardrooms there were zones of Russian aggression companies were willing to tolerate but only up to a point.

Meanwhile Canadian companies have also begun dialling back their Russian presence. Toronto-based miner Kinross Gold Corp. which has operated in Russia for more than 25 years suspended operations at its Kupol mine as well as all activities at its Udinsk development project. The company said it is “deeply concerned about the tragic situation and the extent of casualties and destruction in Ukraine.”

Ski-Doo maker BRP Inc. which has been active in Russia for nearly three decades and has an office in St. Petersburg paused its exports to Russia citing “the instability of the current situation and the trade complexities.” Auto-parts manufacturer Magna International idled its Russian plants and luxury parka maker Canada Goose suspended all sales in Russia and donated $100000 for humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Bombardier Inc. said Friday it is breaking off all dealings with Russian customers including wealthy individuals who’ve already bought its jets and might want them serviced.

One hundred business leaders signed an open letter to the Canadian government urging Ottawa to step up sanctions on Russia. They also vowed to unwind commercial relationships with the country. The signatories included John Chen executive chairman of BlackBerry Ltd. and Walied Soliman chair of Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP.

“No one seriously expected such a quick pullback of leading Western businesses from Russia” said George Voloshin a corporate intelligence and geopolitical analyst with risk consultancy Aperio Intelligence in Paris. “Indian and Chinese firms will most likely stay put to the extent permitted by sanctions but access to Western technology and know-how has now been brutally severed.”

The exit by companies is largely due to “the enormous universal pressure which has built up across the Western world” against Russia making it difficult for brands most closely tied to the country such as BP to just sit and wait Mr. Voloshin said. They did not take the decision with a light heart because they remain profit-driven he said.

“No one rushed out of Saudi Arabia when it started bombing Yemen” in 2015 Mr. Voloshin said. “This time is different because of the tactic Mr. Putin chose. Had he limited his actions to the recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk [republics] in Eastern Ukraine no one would have budged an inch. It’s the fact that he launched all-out aggression against a sovereign state with the stated intention to topple its democratically elected government that led to the situation we are in.”

There have been other periods in history when corporations have voted with their feet in the face of bad actors on the global stage but it’s tended to unfold at a glacial pace said William Reinsch a former U.S. Commerce Department official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointing to the decades it took for disinvestment campaigns targeting apartheid South Africa to gain traction with corporations. “That took years this has taken days” he said.

While the sheer magnitude and blatancy of Russia’s attack no doubt shocked companies into acting more quickly Mr. Reinsch said CEOs today are also more aware than ever of the risks of alienating customers and employees over big moral issues. “Companies have learned that very quickly you can end up behind the curve on this sort of thing.”

And public opinion is decidedly in favour of companies cutting their ties with Russia to punish the country. Nearly three-quarters of Americans surveyed by polling firm Morning Consult on the weekend after the invasion said they want businesses to break with Russia.

Employees and alumni of big Western firms have also taken to social media in droves to shame those companies that were perceived to be dragging their feet. One former senior partner at McKinsey & Company blasted the consulting firm’s managing partner Bob Sternfels on LinkedIn on Tuesday for having “blood money on your hands” for failing to exit Russia. Dozens of similar messages from ex-McKinsey employees filled the site. By Thursday McKinsey said it has stopped accepting client work from Russia and will cease consulting for state-owned enterprises there.

Few Canadians have as much experience and knowledge about Russian business and culture as Lou Naumovski. He has spent the better part of his career building ties between the West and Russia first as Canada’s former deputy director for trade and investment development in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and later as a senior executive based in Moscow for Visa and Kinross. He now sits on the board of Russian miner GV Gold.

Mr. Naumovski 65 said he is shocked and emotionally crushed by Mr. Putin’s invasion order. And like many others he’s not optimistic about what it means for the future.

“A lot of us – meaning the wider Western community involved in businesses over decades in Russia – really felt up until recently that it was a normal place to do business” he said adding that he believes the Russian government did improve the investment conditions over the years.

Even after Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine Western businesses remained interested in Russia Mr. Naumovski said. And those that wouldn’t or couldn’t do business there because of subsequent government sanctions such as Canadian pork producers actually helped Russia to become more self-sufficient in sectors such as food and beverages. He said he believes that might have emboldened Mr. Putin to ask whether significant foreign investment in Russia was really needed and maybe even contributed to his war-order calculation.

And what about Russia’s future as host for foreign-based business? “It won’t come back unless Russia pays reparations unless The Hague gets involved and war crimes are adjudicated. I can’t imagine companies who have left what signals would they need to say ‘Oh well that was a mistake and we can come back now and we’re welcome.’ There would have to be a sea change in Russia’s political positioning before anybody with big money would bother.”

For the average Russian all of this could mean an unwelcome blast back to the past. Already there has been a run on banks as people try to withdraw savings before their purchasing power is destroyed by a plunging ruble. International travel has also been curtailed since Russian planes are banned from airspace in the United States and other countries.

“Eventually once the initial shock passes there’s going to be a black market for Apple phones and computers and other things” Mr. Naumovski said. “It’s a reconstitution of the shortages that made life in the Soviet Union so miserable.”

The job losses from the corporate exodus alone are already shaping up to be staggering with layoffs by Western companies numbering in the tens of thousands and likely to climb far higher. The 2300 Russian employees axed by professional-services giant Accenture when it discontinued operations there on Thursday will have a difficult time finding similar well-paying jobs since many of the consulting firm’s big rivals are also pulling out of the country.

Back in Canada David Ross had been nervously following the buildup of Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders for weeks. When the invasion finally began it hit him “like a sledgehammer” said the Ottawa-based entrepreneur who grew up on “stories of Ukraine pirogies and cabbage rolls” since his mother’s parents emigrated from that country in the early 1900s.

After posting about his anguish on social media the owner of Ross Video an Ottawa-based company that designs and manufactures equipment for live events and video production joined many other Canadians who were cutting cheques to the Red Cross’s Ukraine campaign. Ross Video’s donation was for $100000.

Still Mr. Ross felt compelled to do more. As one of the largest private companies in the sector with sales expected to reach $350-million this year Ross Video boasts customers in more than 100 countries. While Russia accounts for a modest 1 per cent of the company’s business among its customers there is a broadcast chain with dozens of television stations and it has been regularly spewing state-fed anti-Ukraine messages to its viewers.

“It was galling to see our equipment being used as part of a propaganda offensive against the people of Ukraine” he said. So on Feb. 28 he and the company’s senior management team decided to cease all shipments of new equipment to Russia and suspend all support for its existing equipment in the country.

Since then Mr. Ross has watched as scores of other global businesses have also amputated their exposure to Russia. He sees it as a natural extension of a growing awareness among businesses that they have responsibilities that go beyond the bottom line.

“‘Greed is good’ was a statement from the 1980s and I don’t believe that’s what business is about in the 2020s” he said. “Our employees don’t look to companies as a vehicle that is purely there to make money. They want to work for a company that is willing to do the right thing.”

As for when he thinks Ross Video will start doing business again with Russia he isn’t expecting Russia to suddenly see the error of its ways. “This could take a very long time” he said. “We are absolutely prepared to pretend that Russia no longer exists for as long as it takes.”

Over in Waterloo Ont. Kurtis McBride chief executive officer of Miovision Technologies Inc. said his company won’t do business with any Russian clients until the invasion of Ukraine is over. The tech company which has offices in Canada the U.S. Germany and Serbia has worked with 1500 customers in 63 countries to monitor and manage traffic through sensors and artificial intelligence.

Mr. McBride said he was inspired to make the move after reading a LinkedIn post from a former employee who grew up in Ukraine and was trying to stay in contact with his mother who is still in the country.

“He was a guy I worked closely with talking about someone that’s close to him his mother and being afraid that something terrible had happened” Mr. McBride said. “It just made me think it’s not an abstract newsreel for me any more.”

He said he hoped that more companies would cut ties with Russia to pressure the Putin regime to drop its attack on Ukraine. In particular he said tech companies like his could make their mark by banding together and disrupting the services that Russian citizens rely on.

Two provinces east in New Brunswick global French-fry giant McCain Foods halted construction of a new potato-processing facility in the Tula oblast region south of Moscow shortly after fighting began last week. The company also said it was re-evaluating the future of the project which if completed would be the company’s first in Russia at a cost of $210-million (at current exchange rates).

Meanwhile institutional money managers in Canada and around the world have found themselves holding a toxic stew of Russian equities in their portfolios they are having a difficult time unloading.

Among the Canadian asset managers caught in the downdraft is AIMCo the provincial pension and government fund manager in Alberta. On March 1 the Crown corporation said it had made a “values- and value-driven” decision to divest all of its Russian holdings which had been purchased by third-party managers and at $99-million (as of Feb. 28) accounted for 0.06 per cent of AIMCo’s $160-billion in total assets it manages for clients.

“AIMCo and our clients have standards and this violated our collective standards in addition to it being an investment decision” said Evan Siddall AIMCo’s CEO though the fund manager has only been able to unload part of its Russian holdings because of restrictions on share sales imposed by Russia to stop investors from fleeing.

In the wake of the crisis in Ukraine Mr. Siddall says the agency has launched a review of its whole portfolio “to make sure it’s consistent with values and value across the board.” That means looking at whether investments are in countries “where there’s concern about rule of law and the investibility of those jurisdictions” he said.

Mr. Siddall doesn’t easily foresee a time when the world’s attitudes toward Russia go back to the way they were. The scope of the “unprecedented” global response to Russia’s actions reflects “how repugnant the invasion of a sovereign nation is and has changed perspectives on Russia as a place to invest.”

When the shrapnel eventually stops flying European and North American companies are unlikely to rush back into Russia. “If peace were to miraculously break out it would have to be peace with complete withdrawal from Ukraine” said Gary Hufbauer a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

But even if Russia completely turned a corner – and by that Mr. Hufbauer means if Mr. Putin were deposed or assassinated and a new government came in promising openness and transparency – even then “companies are going to be extremely skeptical about going back for a very long time.”

The massive show of C-suite solidarity of the past week has raised awkward questions about how companies might respond to future geopolitical tensions with much of the focus on China’s aggressive stance toward Taiwan.

Russia’s economy is tiny compared to China’s making it relatively painless to do the right thing. “For a lot of North American companies pulling out of Russia the stakes aren’t that high” Mr. Reinsch said. “If the Chinese invaded Taiwan I believe you would see this scenario repeat itself but the decision would be a lot harder.”

Which companies have cut ties with Russia?

Energy and mining

British energy giant BP PLC was among the first big global companies to cut ties with Russia vowing to sell its 20-per-cent stake in Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. Other energy companies followed in announcing the end of joint ventures with Russian firms including Shell PLC Norway’s Equinor and ExxonMobil. Toronto-based miner Kinross Gold Corp. suspended operations at a mine and a development project in Russia.

Transportation

Most major automakers with operations in Russia have put production on hold including Mercedes-Benz AG Renault SA Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG while Ford Motor Co. suspended operations at its joint venture commercial van manufacturer. Canadian auto-parts manufacturer Magna International Inc. said it was halting production at its six plants in Russia which employ 2500 people. Many other automakers also vowed to cut off sales of their vehicles to Russia including Harley-Davidson Inc. General Motors Co. Porsche AG and Bentley Motors Ltd. Meanwhile in the skies aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE announced they’d halted support services for Russian airlines. Delta Air Lines Inc. suspended its code-sharing partnership with Aeroflot. As for Quebec’s Bombardier Inc. which does 6 per cent of its private-jet business in Russia the company cut all ties to its Russian clients including all forms of technical assistance.

Consumer goods and retail

Some of the most prominent global consumer giants – McDonald’s Corp. Starbucks Corp. The Coca-Cola Co. PepsiCo Inc. and packaged-goods giant Unilever PLC – are suspending operations in Russia. Canada’s McCain Foods Ltd. says it is ending construction of its first Russian manufacturing plant and halting sales to the country. Several international beer companies halted deliveries to Russia including Czech brewer Budejovicky Budvar np for which Russia is its largest market and Carlsberg A/S. Canadian Ski-Doo maker BRP Inc. hit pause on exports to Russia as did luxury parka maker Canada Goose Holdings Inc. Nike Inc. just isn’t doing it (all its stores in Russia have closed) while other retailers including Ikea Group Corp. and H&M Hennes & Mauritz AB also closed up shop. And Russians can forget about ordering goods from out of country to get around the bans. Both FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. have stopped delivering shipments there.

Technology

A number of major U.S. tech companies have taken steps to block Russian access to their services including Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. Twitter Inc. property rental company Airbnb Inc. and Alphabet Inc. which owns Google and YouTube. Apple Inc. put a stop to sales of its iPhone and other devices in Russia as did computer maker Dell Technologies Inc. On Friday Microsoft Corp. joined the action banning the sale of all new products and services in Russia.

Finance and investments

In Canada and around the world investment firms have rushed to unload their holdings of Russian securities though sales restrictions imposed by the government there are making that difficult. Canadian fund managers Mawer Investment Management Ltd. and Purpose Investments Inc. said they’re divesting all Russian stocks as are institutional money managers Alberta Investment Management Corp. and PSP Investments. Meanwhile both Visa and Mastercard have blocked some Russian financial institutions from their credit-card networks.

Entertainment

Finally an entertainment curtain has lowered around Russia blocking citizens from accessing international music movies and television shows. Streaming service Netflix Inc. is offline in Russia while Walt Disney Co. WarnerMedia Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Paramount Pictures Corp. have ceased distribution of their films.

It's easy and will only take a moment.

THE £5 million development of a new bargain basement retailer in Dingwall is set to create a boost for the local economy.

Highland Council planners have given the go-ahead for a Home Bargains store on land behind St Clement’s School and close to an existing Lidl.

The patch of land has the been subject of three separate planning applications for retail use the most recent being granted – but not acted upon – in 2014.

In its submission Dingwall Community Council considered the development “a welcome addition to the town” which would create jobs.

Applicant Forrest Development Limited and TJ Morris Ltd of Glasgow plans a class one retail unit of 1896sq m (20410sq ft) gross with associated car parking landscaping formation of access and other ancillary works.

The discount chain started in Liverpool now employs 22000 people and has over 500 discount stores stocking up to 4000 products ranging from health and beauty to clothing homeware and food.

Its statement to Highland Council said: “The proposed development is located on a site within Dingwall town centre encouraging shared trips to other services and businesses in the centre.

“It is easily accessed by pedestrian and cycle visitors and adjacent to a main public transport route corridor. The proposed development will contribute to the economic and social development of the area by providing complementary retail facilities and new employment opportunities for local residents.”

It says it will be development of a long-standing vacant and brownfield site within Dingwall town centre.

Planning permission includes a number of conditions including submission of a noise impact assessment and mitigation programme; a scheme to deal with any potential contamination and an archaeological interest survey.

Car parking and access arrangements must also be approved in advance.

A traffic management plan to encourage use of public transport and bicycle storage areas are further conditions.

The proposal first mooted in June last year was generally welcomed at that time with the prospect of the land being brought into productive use and adding to choice for shoppers.

Welcome to Royal Caribbean's newest dining venue The Mason Jar.

Found exclusively (for now) on Wonder of the Seas the latest holder of the ""world's biggest cruise ship"" title The Mason Jar will feed your soul (and dare I say pad your belly) with Royal Caribbean's take on Southern comfort food for brunch and dinner.

You will find lots of fried foods decadent baked goods and rich sauces. Vegetables are in short supply – I think there was some spinach hiding beneath mounds of gooey pimento cheese in my omelet but I hardly noticed it. When my daughter needed a snack before our 12:30 reservation I took her to the buffet and made her eat fruit because we were about to have a very unhealthy lunch.

It was worth every calorie.

The ambiance

The Mason Jar is located on Deck 15 right next to Wonder of the Seas' buffet restaurant the Windjammer Café. The far wall is floor-to-ceiling windows looking out to sea letting light flood the interior space. The homey bar area is enhanced by rocking chairs and a three-person porch-style swing by the windows so you can pretend you're drinking iced teas on mee-maw's front porch instead of hand-crafted cocktails in a floating resort.

A band plays country classics by the bar which sets the mood but as we were seated at the high tables by the bar (instead of the regular dining area in the back) it meant we had to lean in and yell to have a conversation over ""Wagon Wheel"" and ""All My Exes Live in Texas."" I love me some live music though so I'll take it.

A new restaurant with an inviting menu is bound to get attention and the line to get into The Mason Jar was more time-crunched New Yorker than slow Southern summer. My party of four arrived a few minutes shy of our reservation time and the line was out the door. As a couple of walk-ins in front of us were turned away I heard them grumble ""Why is it so hard to get a meal around here?""

Hey folks an enormous buffet's right next door and FYI on a ship carrying thousands of people you unfortunately need to trade spontaneity for advanced meal planning.

I had already learned my lesson in cruise ship dining best practices. My daughter was equipped with a coloring book and colored pencils for the inevitable wait between ordering and the food arriving.

The drinks

Drinks at The Mason Jar on Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas (Photo by Erica Silverstein/The Points Guy)

Cruise ships today are all about the mixologist-invented cocktails; leave your frozen daiquiris and Bahamas Mamas on the pool deck please.

The Mason Jar does have a bar you can patronize without reservations but only if you can find a seat. After navigating the hordes at the entrance the three adults in my party were definitely ready to wet our whistles.

I have no idea if I like whiskey but I'm a sucker for any drink that comes with a mini crustless PB&J as a garnish. The PB&J Old Fashioned is made with Skrewball peanut butter whiskey (who knew that was a thing?) Kentucky bourbon strawberry jelly and walnut bitters. It was smooth and delicious – and not at all like anything I'd pack in my kid's lunchbox.

My friends ordered the Southern Belle (Buffalo Trace bourbon fresh mint lemon juice blueberries and club soda) which was as sweet as your date at the cotillion and the No Joke Smoke & Coke (smoked Buffalo Trace Bourbon on the rocks topped at the table with a can of Coke) which my daughter said ""smelled like marshmallows"" and she wasn't wrong. Don't be caught unawares like we were; if you order a drink involving smoke be prepared for some tableside theatrics when it arrives.

You may like mimosas with your brunch but these drinks were more creative tasty and appropriately Southern than your usual spiked OJ. And mee-maw says it's ok to start drinking even if your reservation is before noon. You're on vacation.

The food

I planned my Mason Jar meal for brunch because let's be honest: As a person who does not eat meat or shellfish I could not find anything other than a couple of sides I could eat on the dinner menu. (As in even the fried green tomatoes come with bacon jam.)

Brunch is also hands down my favorite meal. Yet every time I struggle to make the critical decision: Sweet or savory?

At The Mason Jar you don't need to sweat the decisions. You just order your savory dishes for your main with the sweet stuff ""for the table."" Or if you're nearly 8 you order the Elvis-inspired French toast stuffed with bananas chocolate and peanut butter and refuse to share.

Every table gets ""Doohickeys for Y'all"" a plate of Saltines and jalapeno cornbread served with pimento cheese spread and Cajun and whipped honey butter. My friends skipped this course. Don't. Not only is pimento cheese spread possibly my new favorite food but that cornbread is moist in a way that mine never is. (Or maybe that's the honey butter talking.)

The waiter who kindly asked about food allergies convinced me to order the spinach and pimento cheese omelet and I loved it as much for the gooey cheese as for the perfectly spicy potatoes that came with it. I'd return for the potatoes alone.

My North Carolina friend ordered the shrimp po'boy and said his only complaint being a true Southerner is that the fries were cold. My Philly friend ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and practically needed a degree in advanced geometry to figure out how to fit said sandwich inside her mouth to eat it. (Consensus was to remove the top bun and eat the rest with a fork and knife.)

My daughter ordered the peanut buttery banana overnight oats when the waiter thought the peanut buttery banana French toast was unavailable. (Side note: If peanut buttery banana dishes are a Southern thing I may need to rethink my desire to live in the North.) Always the critic at the table she didn't understand why her oatmeal was cold. Consider that a warning to all y'all unaccustomed to refrigerated oatmeal.

The French toast had that ooey-gooey center that had me sneaking my fork over for ""just one more bite."" She nearly took my eye out. Grownups order your own damn French toast.

Instead we ""adults"" had ordered the giant plate-sized cinnamon roll and Dr. Seuss-worthy stack of red velvet pancakes layered with sweet cream cheese glaze for the table. I'd like to say that we took one bite and said ""It's not as good as I thought it would be"" and stopped right there. Nah I'm not ashamed – we had ourselves some brunch dessert and it was finger-lickin' good.

(I did I admit lick some of that chocolate-peanut butter French toast filling off my daughter's finger when she offered me some – since she wouldn't let me take another forkful. I carried her for 9 months and took her on the world's largest cruise ship and this is my repayment?)

Bottom line

Brunch is $24.99 per person at The Mason Jar; dinner which adds barbecue meats to the southern-friend sandwich options is $39.99. Kids ages 6 to 12 are charged $10.99 whether they let you share their French toast or not. Cocktails are $13. Reservations are a must; walk don't run to reserve a dining time as soon as you board. If you want to take a chance as a walk-in prepare yourself for likely disappointment.

Whether you like Southern cuisine a quality cocktail or a decadent brunch I definitely recommend The Mason Jar for a casual relaxed meal especially with friends who will swap bites with you or join you in ordering extra dishes for the group. I also recommend chasing that calorific repast with a good hour at the gym or an evening spent two-stepping the pounds away.

HMS Montrose's sailors and Royal Marines have seized 6.5 tonnes of hashish the heaviest haul of drugs seized by allied warships in the Middle East in 10 years. The hashish also known as cannabis resin is estimated to have a UK wholesale value of £6.5m. After five hours bagging up the drugs they were destroyed.

The dawn raid on a suspect ship is the third strike on drug traffickers by HMS Montrose in two months. The operation was carried out in the Gulf of Oman where the Bahrain-based vessel has prevented an estimated £95m worth of drugs from being successfully smuggled by traffickers since the beginning of her extended Middle East mission three years ago. The crew was working for the international Combined Task Force 150 which tackles terrorism and criminal activity in the region. Lieutenant Joe Martin the Royal Marines boarding officer said he was proud of the team: ""We conducted this boarding efficiently using the experience we've gained over the past three months. ""We learn each time we board a vessel never resting on our laurels and continually honing our edge.""

The frigate's Commanding Officer Commander Claire Thompson said the ship's company had ""proven their capability in the battle against illegal and illicit activity in the region"". ""These results only happen because of the collective effort and skill of the incredibly professional highly-trained and dedicated people that the Royal Navy employs and that I have the privilege to command"" she said. Commodore Adrian Fryer the senior Royal Navy officer in the Gulf region said the success underscored the importance of the frigate's long-term presence in the region. ""It is extremely rewarding to see the hard work of our sailors pay off with such a large-scale seizure and I know they will be as proud of their work as I am of them. ""Actions like this deprive criminal and terrorist organisations of the funds they need to function and has a positive impact both here in the Middle East region and in the parts of the world including the UK that these narcotics would have been eventually sold"" he added.

I am on this first sailing on Wonder of the Seas with a group of media so we can explore everything that the world’s biggest cruise ship offers. After 24 hours on board here are my first impressions of Wonder of the Seas.

Embarkation – Royal Caribbean really has mastered the embarkation process and checking in at the port was just as easy as ever. Since I showed up a bit early I did have to wait around 10 minutes after checking in before boarding the ship but that is basically nothing.

WOW – If one word could sum up this cruise ship it’s WOW. Wonder of the Seas is divided up in eight different neighborhoods including my favorites Boardwalk and Central Park.



Boardwalk has the feel of Coney Island and has a carousel Johnny Rockets Playmakers Sports Bar and the Aqua Theatre. Water and diving shows take place at the Aqua Theatre at night and it’s something you won’t find on any other class of cruise ships in the world.

Central Park located on deck 8 in the middle of the ship is lined with real trees and plants. There are several specialty restaurants in this area and many benches where you can just sit enjoy a drink and think you’re in the middle of park and not on a cruise ship.

There also an ice skating rink on board with nightly shows in addition to a traditional theatre. Did I mention a 10 story slide that will take you from the sports deck down to the Boardwalk? This cruise ship really does have it all.

Crew – The crew members have been nothing short of superb. Everywhere I go I am met with a friendly smile and hello. They really make you feel at home the moment you step on board the ship.

Enclosed Solarium – For the first time on an Oasis class ship Royal Caribbean has enclosed the Solarium and I just love it. The controlled climate allows you to enjoy this area no matter what the weather is. Is it raining? You can still enjoy the Solarium. Is it a chilly January day? Yes you can still enjoy this area.

The 10 foot windows on the side allow you to take in ocean views and doubles as an observation lounge. There are also a few large hot tubs a pool and a casual place to get something to eat. This really is the place to relax on a sea day.

I love this area so much I am actually sitting in a comfortable lounger in the Solarium writing this article. I have a feeling I will spend a lot of time here for the next week.

Cabin – I am staying in a deck 6 ocean view balcony. I love the convenient location by the the Boardwalk and Promenade.

The cabin is great and fairly roomy for a standard balcony cabin on a cruise ship. On each side of the bed is a 110 power outlet and a USB outlet. It has a great shower and there’s a 55″ TV in front of the bed. When you factor in the decent size balcony it’s a great cabin and there’s not one negative thing I can say about it. Well done Royal Caribbean.

You can watch a two minute tour of my cabin below:

Food – I haven’t yet counted how many restaurants and eateries there are but they are all over the ship. Everywhere you walk there is a spot you can grab something to eat.

There is such a great variety of food with a nice selection of complimentary and specialty restaurants. I will be trying out Royal Caribbean’s new Mason Jar Southern Restaurant later on in the cruise so stay tuned for that.

Doors on Casino – This is one trend on newer cruise ships that I just love. There are doors leading to the casino which helps keep the smell of smoke from traveling to other parts of the ship.

Playground for Families – Now that I have a toddler in my family I really appreciate this new area that Royal Caribbean added on Wonder of the Seas. Near the back of the ship where one of the Flowriders is on Oasis class there is a now playground for families instead. It is a non supervised area where moms and dads can play with their kids. It’s such a great idea.

I will have more on Wonder of the Seas as the sailing goes on as well as a full review after I get home. So far I’m pretty much blown away and this just might be the perfect cruise ship.

St Kitts and Nevis: The Minister of Foreign Affairs of St Kitts and Nevis and Premier of Nevis Island Administration Mark Brantley has expressed pleasure after the country has reported the return in the Crusie tourism. He stated that this is quite great that tye Nevis Island is coming back to its normal phase and tourism is coming to the normal phase.

While thanking God the Premier of Nevis asserted that the country is really grateful for God for the return of the very penny earned by the artisans taxi driers and other tourists who are once again heading towards Nevis.

The Premier of the Nevis Island Administration stated “Charlestown Harbour this morning. We are grateful to God for every penny being earned by our taxi drivers artisans restaurants and others as tourists have been coming back to our beloved Nevis.”

Tourism is something which is essential for any country as it provides a boost to the economy of any country. Cruise Tourism is one of the critical sectors which offers financial assistance to the twin-island Federation.

COVID-19 impacted this factor as well as to safeguard the nation from the deadly virus various restrictions were implemented by the administration.

A total of 1147 passengers have been loaded at the cruise ship and various passengers took part in the Federation’s bubble to us at the select tourist attractions across the island. The people who were inboard were fully vaccinated against the viral infection caused by the novel coronavirus and the children who were the age of 12 were not included in it.

At that time St Kitts and Nevis Tourism Minister – Lindsay FP Grant was quoted as “The day has been anxiously anticipated and a long time in coming as we continued our phased approach to rebuilding the cruise sector. The Royal Caribbean Group is a valued partner and with calls from their three main brands Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea were instrumental in the destination welcoming over 1 million passengers for two consecutive years cementing our position in the marketplace as a marquee port.”"

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so."

The last week has been nothing but turmoil for not only the stock market but the world. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shaken individuals and governments possibly reintroducing a return of a Cold-War era world order. Meanwhile markets have been highly volatile as energy prices surge due to sanctions on Russia and uncertainty around inflation lingers in the air. Trading in the near-term is not always a winning strategy especially in these times. This is why we've looked at what some of Wall Street's most accurate analysts have had to say on these five stocks. Let's take a closer look.

Petco

Ever since news of the omicron variant of Covid-19 swept across headlines in late November Petco's stock plummeted (WOOF). However this does not negate the growing numbers of new pet owners since the start of the pandemic. The pet retailer and services company is expected to report its quarterly earnings on March 8 and Zachary Fadem of Wells Fargo anticipates upside. The analyst believes WOOF will beat Wall Street consensus estimates and he argued there is no lack of opportunities for long-term monetization. He said that demand within the industry is strong and that Petco's stock is largely overlooked by investors. (See Petco News Sentiment on TipRanks) Fadem rated WOOF a Buy and he assigned a price target of $30. The firm has been executing well on its veterinary services segment and is generating strong business performance from its loyalty program and fresh food offerings. Moreover Fadem compared Petco to an online competitor Chewy (CHWY). He noted that over first four weeks of the first quarter ""WOOF web traffic has sequentially improved while CHWY web traffic has weakened."" Fadem admitted that supply chain challenges felt by much of the retail industry will continue affecting Petco. However many of the financial setbacks stemming from these obstacles may be mitigated by costs passed on to consumers and product premiumization. The analyst sees an ""attractive LT entry point considering stable category growth underlying share gains and estimates that likely move higher."" Out of more than 7000 analysts on TipRanks Fadem ranks as No. 77. He has been successful 62% of the time and has returned an average of 41.3%.

Apple

A firm that is repeatedly lauded for its growth and consumer penetration Apple (AAPL) may receive the same positive reception for pulling its products and services out of Russia. The West has levied sanctions onto Moscow since Russia has invaded Ukraine. It appears now that tech companies are following suit and Apple's possible losses from the move could be understood and quickly digested by investors. Dan Ives of Wedbush detailed the development which by his calculations may have impacts of 1% to 2% revenue losses at most for AAPL. The firm has no physical storefronts of its own in Russia and only sells its products through third-party retailers. (See Apple Stock Charts on TipRanks) Ives rated the stock a Buy and he declared a price target of $200. The analyst wouldn't be surprised if more large tech names were to make similar moves in the region. He added that Apple has also pulled Russian state-owned and propaganda-based apps from its mobile store and has halted services like traffic intelligence on its Maps platform. In addition to the historic decision Ives went on to detail how significant cybersecurity will become given the heightened threat level emanating from Russia. Indeed an increasing rate of attacks is expected as retaliation against the West. Ives is ranked as No. 222 out of over 7000 analysts on TipRanks. The analyst has been correct in his stock picks 60% of the time and he has returned 29% on average from his ratings.

Airbnb

Airbnb (ABNB) reported impressive quarterly results last month and cementing its position as an industry leader. The company went public in late 2020 and it has executed on its business model despite repeated controls on mobility and leisure travel. (See Airbnb Estimated Monthly Visits on TipRanks) Now with Covid-19 cases diminishing globally Airbnb stands to benefit as travel roars back to life. According to Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners the company can easily scale and add supply cheaply and it has been investing innovations to streamline onboarding for new hosts. Moreover the firm has shown its ability to adapt to abruptly changing consumer desires and trends be they long-term stays in rural environments or brief weekend urban vacations. Feinseth rated the stock a Buy and he raised his price target to $214 from $206. The analyst explained that Airbnb despite a year of mandated lockdowns and increased stay-at-home trends still managed to generate 78% in revenue year-over-year. While the pandemic may be waning the positive consumer trends it created for ABNB are some of the company's most popular. For instance Feinseth wrote that half of total bookings in the fourth quarter were for seven or more days. The analyst said that ""ABNB's ability to add incremental capacity through new Hosts ongoing investment initiatives in new technologies cobranded buildings branding opportunities expanding partnerships with travel service providers and increasing international expansion are all strong drivers of future growth."" Feinseth is rated as No. 78 out of more than 7000 professional analysts. His stock ratings have resulted in success 65% of the time and they have returned an average of 29.4% each.

Salesforce

Cloud software giant Salesforce.com (CRM) saw its valuation soar over the course of the pandemic. Shares have recently come down along with the rest of tech but that does not mean the fundamental business is any less sound. This is the hypothesis of Brian White of Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. who argued that ""Salesforce is uniquely positioned to capitalize on accelerated digital transformation with a platform that is stronger and more relevant than ever while benefitting from a new model the addition of Slack and an economic recovery."" White rated the stock a Buy and he maintained his price target of $328. The analyst said that CRM recently proved its reputation with its recent earnings report. The software firm issued upbeat guidance and reported revenues up 26% year over year. White said that he observed strength across industries localities and product lines. The company's various high-profile acquisitions like Tableau and MuleSoft generated a combined growth of 23.5% and Slack continues to impress investors with its performance. The latter is particularly important given the massive price tag spent on the company by Salesforce. Despite these tailwinds White admitted that the current tech sell-off may continue to persist for an unforeseeable amount of time. Near-term volatility is to be expected. Of more than 7000 analysts on TipRanks database White maintains position No. 190. He has been accurate when rating stocks 64% of the time and he has returned an average of 29.1% on each.

Splunk",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2VkNzViZDE5LTlmM2MtNDkzMC1hNTcwLWM0NDc2NDgzZTYwNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boomerang employees: returning with new skills and experience,"Print this page

In 2018 Lien Ceulemans left Salesforce for a new job at Google in London. She returned to the cloud software group becoming a “boomerang” employee last year. “The people I used to work with reached out when a role came up.”

Her return was in part personal. She wanted a job in Brussels to be close to her family. Professionally it was a step up becoming country leader at a time when the company is forging new working patterns as it emerges from the pandemic.

Returning to an old employer had advantages. Ceulemans was already familiar with the culture. “If you already know the organisation it’s easier to get on.” Over the past two years many new starters have had to grapple with remote interviews onboarding and homeworking making it particularly hard to get a handle on their new organisations.

Keen to fill labour shortages employers have tried recruitment parties hiring bonuses wage increases and perks. Now some are considering previous employees. According to LinkedIn the professional social network 4.5 per cent of new recruits on its platform were boomerangs last year compared with 3.9 per cent in 2019. EnterpriseAlumni which creates software for organisations says about 24 per cent of alumni on their platforms apply for a job at a former employer.

For the employer there can be a financial boon to hiring boomerangs reducing recruitment and training costs and increasing productivity. One study by Cornell University compared the work experiences of just over 2000 boomerangs and almost 11000 new hires in a large US-based healthcare organisation. It found that boomerangs outperformed new hires especially in roles that involved “relatively high levels of administrative co-ordination such as project manager and purchasing agent that encompass planning goal setting scheduling and the application of organisational routines and rules”. And also in jobs that focused co-operation with others within the company.

Caroline Gaffney vice-president of product and chief of staff to the chief executive at LinkedIn who returned to the company four years ago after a stint at Instagram would encourage people “in this period of the great reshuffle to think about companies you worked for in the past”.

Mike Ettling chief executive of Unit4 a cloud-based software company says: “You’ve always been able to talent arbitrage but now you have this phenomenon [the Great Resignation] happening everywhere the single biggest technique to find [recruits] in another pond has gone.” This means employers will need to experiment.

Alumni network

Alumni are increasingly important to recruiters Ettling says. This might mean changing the way an employer frames staff departures. Rather than saying goodbye he suggests welcoming departing staff to the alumni network a principle he practises himself. “Stop thinking of it as a negative - they potentially could come back to us. Let’s see it as a positive.” This mindset also changes the tone of exit interviews. “Too many people go into the conversation with a rescue approach. I’d rather [talk] about how we can help you in the next role.”

Maral Kazanjian chief people officer at Moody’s the rating agency and herself a recent boomerang says she has seen “organisations treating [departing employees] as disloyal”. Andrea Legnani global head of alumni relations at Citi detects a shift in corporate attitudes to recently departed staff. “Employers are thinking of alumni as an opportunity rather than a betrayal.” In the past he says alumni “were mostly retirees now companies are looking at alumni as employees of the future”. The company estimates about 10 per cent of its current global workforce are boomerangs.

An alumni network can help employers discover how to target boomerangs. Legnani says that he learnt that Citi employees in Africa were being lured by start-ups. “We were able to do a specific letter to [this population] saying there are jobs for tech workers.” He also adds that alumni networks can change the way staff who were made redundant through a merger for example or cost-cutting feel about their former employer. They might feel rejected he says and an alumni network can provide a “different voice”.

However employers must be conscious that if they are hiring from a historical talent pool it could counter efforts to diversify the workforce. Champions of alumni networks argue that formalising such structures would overcome informal networks of patronage.

Rejoining the company

Nisha Vasan left the Walt Disney Company to join WeWork in March 2020 and rejoined the film and entertainment group at the start of this year after a 12-month stint elsewhere. She says “it is a joy to onboard when you already know some of the people”. This was especially so after joining two organisations in the pandemic. “This is my third remote onboarding. The hardest part of being a new employee is building relationships. The familiarity is comforting [knowing] the organisational structure how teams work has made it seamless.” However the group she has returned to is not exactly the one she left. “There’s been a lot of change at the company. You’re not starting at ground zero. You’re not starting at 10 but somewhere [in between].”

Kazanjian at Moody’s says a boomerang must have “a curiosity about what [the organisation] is like today”.

Ettling says that in growing companies boomerangs might find the business is very different to the one they left. “The worst thing you can do is expect [a boomerang] to be fine. Often I get emails from [them] saying ‘Wow the company’s so different’.”

While the job Gaffney took at Instagram was in an area she had worked before — product — the one she returned to in LinkedIn entailed a steep learning curve. “I tried to come back with an open mind. I spent the first three to six months taking in information to understand how the organisation was running [rather than my] historical assumptions.”

Emma Sinclair chief executive of EnterpriseAlumni points out that “it’s not just people who evolve [but] organisations too — going back to something you know with new skills and experience is compelling”.

Returning employees are likely to have goodwill to their employer typically leaving due to personal reasons (location or caring responsibilities) or a compelling job offer.

Ettling whose Unit4 workforce numbers about 2800 says he values employees with a mixture of big corporate and start-up experience. “The smaller businesses give you [the ability to be] faster moving and more nimble. You have the underdog moves. I always say to people when thinking about their career to try to get both.”

While research indicates that boomerangs might outperform external hires Alison Dachner assistant professor of management at the Boler School of Business John Carroll University says that for long-term performance benefits internal hires might prove more effective than convincing ex-employees to return — boomerangs are likely to have negotiated higher pay and better job descriptions. Managers need to be conscious of the impact of well-paid returning employees on their teams’ morale. It may send out a signal that the only way to increase salaries is to leave the company.

Dachner does not recommend employers “talent hoard” but rather “improve ease of movement and role transitions”. So alumni should be considered a “part of overall talent management which includes supporting internal mobility”. Salesforce for example has a dedicated internal recruiting team to help employees find new opportunities at the company. Erin Makarius associate professor of management at Ohio’s University of Akron says companies should focus more on internal promotions having regular coaching or career conversations. “How often do employers say ‘where do you want to go next?’”

Gaffney says LinkedIn’s executive chair Jeff Weiner has a “next play” philosophy where employees are encouraged to plan their next steps including building careers that might include a move outside the company. When she originally thought about leaving the group managers and mentors were “very supportive. It’s part of our culture to have open conversations” including identifying their next opportunity and discussing how to reach it including externally.

New York-based Amer Jan a home lending officer is pleased to have returned to Citi after 18 years. One aspect he has noticed that is different from his previous stint is the confidence that comes with age. “If I have an idea I will call people I don’t care about their seniority.”

Since its founding by Ted D’Cruz-Young in 2012 Morsum has built a high-tech food operating system (fOS™) that improves profitability across a wide range of food service scenarios. With a suite of data-integrated products supporting CRM labor inventory and purchasing management Morsum improves day-to-day efficiency operational simplicity and cost control.

“We’re thrilled to welcome Morsum into the Dot Foods family” says Dot Foods CEO Joe Tracy. “Dot is committed to continuously building on our mission to significantly contribute to the success of our business partners. Morsum’s innovative products and extraordinary data capabilities will be key in helping us facilitate success for everyone in the food ecosystem using technology.”

Morsum has spent nearly ten years working to bridge data gaps that cause unnecessary food and labor costs for everyone involved in the food ecosystem. Morsum’s significant expertise in mapping food data helps automate key decisions enrich product data to aid customers in making more informed buying decisions and minimize non-core activity. This all facilitates a greater focus on customer-valued activity. Dot’s industry relationships will expand access to Morsum’s capabilities.

“Making life easier and more rewarding for food service establishments has always been our singular pursuit” says Ted D’Cruz-Young Morsum CEO. “Dot’s unique position in the market and evolved understanding on the role and value of data made the decision to join the Dot family of businesses easy. With Dot’s clear-eyed and disciplined approach I know that we will deliver tremendous value for distributor partners their food service customers and Dot’s suppliers. We’re really excited.”

When FE asked if Morsum will still work with its existing customers or will Morsum be exclusive to Dot D’Cruz-Young responded “Morsum will continue to seek opportunities to add value to its existing customers as well as future customers. We are also focused on finding opportunities to leverage their capabilities that will add significant value to our customers and business partners.

More about Morsum acquisition

FE had a few additional questions about the Morsum acquisition. It appears that Morsum is located in the UK. If that is correct how will Morsum work with Dot Foods?

“Morsum’s team is located in several countries” says Cullen Andrews Dot Foods VP of sales. “They have had remote teams for several years that effectively collaborate and build innovative products and services. They have an extremely talented core team. Like many other organizations Dot has had remote teams across our business for a number of years and that has certainly accelerated recently so we are confident in working with the Morsum team effectively. The Morsum team will continue to operate as its own entity which will allow us to move faster in creating new products and capabilities that ultimately will generate significant value to our customers. Dot will help with providing the resources to allow for that team to flourish.”

How does this new combination of expertise affect food and beverage processors whose products are distributed by Dot? “We believe this will align well with our continued pursuit to grow our supplier partners’ business” says Dot’s Andrews. “We will develop new digital products that will help our suppliers reach customers they wouldn’t have otherwise had access too. We have prioritized having best in class product data for years and have been involved in driving adoption of GS1 standards from the beginning. Being involved with GS1 and adopting their standards has been the key driver to allow us to have the product data we use today. Morsum’s AI/ML capabilities can enrich our existing product data that will lead to a better experience for customers. In addition we will be able to utilize data to generate more valuable insights through Morsum’s capabilities. We will focus on insights that will improve our partners’ business.”

FE asked if Morsum’s AI/ML experience in its varied applications help to solve supply chain problems—which seem to be many? “No one thing can solve today’s supply chain problems! With that said we are exploring ways to leverage Morsum’s AI/ML capabilities to turn data into actionable information that can improve the service disruption that is occurring today” says Andrews. “This can allow us to be more targeted in identifying opportunities to improve service.”

What are other benefits of this acquisition? “Part of Dot’s brand promise is creating innovative solutions for our business partners” says Andrews. “Having a team that is focused on driving innovation faster especially in the Ecommerce space will be a big benefit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2dhYnJpZWwtYWd0YXJhcC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzUzNTQzMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gabriel Agtarap Obituary - Healey Mortuary and Crematory - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/gabriel-agtarap-obituary?id=33535432 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2dhYnJpZWwtYWd0YXJhcC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzUzNTQzMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Another option: Tap + Create Sound in Featured Sounds to record your own sound.

This article explains how to add sounds to your Snapchat photo or video snaps using the built-in featured sounds or recording your own.

How to Add Featured Sounds to Your Snaps

Snapchat offers a selection of song clips you can automatically insert into your photo or video snaps. Unlike Tik Tok Snapchat's featured sound library is relatively small. There is a search function however so you can search for specific songs or sounds.

Launch Snapchat and tap the Camera icon. Tap Music (musical notes icon) from the menu on the top right. A Featured tab will open. You'll see a Playlists category with various genres as well as a Popular category with a list of tracks. Other tabs in the music section include My Favorites Recents and My Sounds. Explore the genres and featured music available or enter a keyword or song title into the Search field. Tap the Play icon next to any track to preview the music. When you decide on a track tap Next at the bottom of the screen. You'll see a slider above the Record icon allowing you to choose a snippet of the song to include in your Snap. Record your video for your Snap. You'll see a sticker displaying the song title and artist. (You can reposition this sticker if you like.) If you don't like how your Snap looks or sounds tap the X icon to select a different sound or abandon it to start over from scratch. Continue editing or adding features like stickers and filters as you usually would usually then send the Snap or post it to your Story. If you've already taken or recorded a Snap you can add the music afterward using these same steps.

How to Add Your Own Sounds to Your Snaps

Liberty ditched her blonde hair extensions and opted for a bouncy bob while wearing the hi-cut knickers and balconette bra.

She posted the seductive photo her Instagram declaring ""pretty in pink 🌸"" and her fans loved the look.

""Wow perfect 😍😍"" commented one person.

Another added: ""So beautiful 😍.""

And a third wrote: ""Wow Absolutely beautiful 🔥🔥🔥😍😍""

Rising to fame on Love Island Liberty immediately found a place in the nation's hearts thanks to her bubbly personality.

Before going on the show she admitted to adding extensions to her hair to make it look thick and luscious.

But denied having cosmetic procedures to enhance her appearance sharing: ""In regards to plastic surgery or anything I'm quite happy with the way I look so I wouldn't get anything done.

""Obviously if people do get plastic surgery to make them feel more confident then good for them - obviously everyone has their own choice.""

Since leaving the villa Liberty has continued to defend her appearance after a troll accused her of having lip fillers.

Responding to the follower Liberty wrote: ""I actually haven't had my lips done.

""I don't know where all these comments are coming from must be my lip liner. But thank you babe appreciate this.""

In January she showed off her major hair overhaul by chopping off her golden locks ahead of her stint on Dancing on Ice.

She crashed out of ITV’s Dancing On Ice in early February after taking a tumble during her performance to Flo Rida's Right Round with partner Joe Johnson.

According to the 46-year-old actor the hair transplant also helped him save his career.

This was only Thursday and already the convention center was bubbling with chatter and laughter as industry members gathered to celebrate after months apart. For me Southeast Produce Council’s Southern Exposure is always an amazing show and 2022 did not disappoint.

With over 530 buyers in attendance and 275 companies exhibiting the show was a whirlwind of produce companies getting back into the thick of show season—and the appreciation for this was tangible. The Marvel of Produce was certainly an appropriate theme!

Before I break down the high points of show for you guys David Sherrod President and Chief Executive Officer of Southeast Produce Council shared with me how he felt about the show’s success.

“We are truly a blessed organization. Our members came back in a monumental way this past weekend. We set new records for every single session we held beginning with the Tom Page Golf Classic with 280 golfers. The SEPC University Educational Sessions included over 700 in attendance and were highlighted with the 2022 Power of Produce debut anchored by a powerful panel of retailers. Our Opening Gala may possibly prove to be the biggest networking event in our industry for the entire year with over 1700 people in attendance for this high-energy experience and we marveled at the spectacular reunion of friends and family.

He continued adding his insights on the rest of the show's highlights.

""The momentum carried over to Saturday with Tim Tebow giving a riveting message of helping others who cannot help themselves to over 1200 in our sold-out Keynote Luncheon"" David noted. ""The expo opened to over 2800 eager members who were clamoring to see each other and get back to business. We closed out the day with a relaxing beachside evening that really capped off the event. We really cannot put into words how great it felt to be back together but it truly was more than an event it was a marvel-ous experience!”



Raina Nelson Southeast Produce Council Chairman of the Board and President and Chief Executive Officer of Westfalia Fruit USA also took the time to share with me her thoughts on the show.

“Every show has its own level of energy but this year’s Southern Exposure was electric. We had record numbers that brought connectivity to all that attended. The Next Generation of Superheroes was the platform of my chairmanship. There is no better time than the present to invest in the future. It is imperative we cultivate talent and ensure the future of our industry is bright. Tim Tebow delivered inspiration to a packed house. His heartfelt message about living a significant life was the perfect way to shape perspectives as the expo started. We are thankful to all our member attendees for helping us make this year beyond marvelous!”

The show kicked off with the Tom Page Gold Classic on Thursday March 3 as well as the STARS and STEP-UPP Dinner. Friday then began with the STARS breakfast followed by educational sessions. The first ""Prepare for the Future: Building the Next Generation of Leaders"" gave an insightful breakdown into how generational shifts affect how we work market and lead.

The next session ""Power of Produce 2022"" had a powerhouse cast of folks on the panel including Robby Cruz Vice President of Produce/Floral at Target; Jim Hancock Vice President of Produce and Floral/DMM at Sam’s Club; and Jerry Callahan Group Vice President of Produce and Floral for Albertsons.

Of the many topics covered in the Power of Produce 2022 report was the state of organics.

“The cost and the retail gap between conventional and organic continues to close. The quality is improving and the cost gap is getting really close” Jerry shared to a rapt audience. (When I tell you this room was packed it was packed.) “The approach that we take on organic is to stop treating it like it’s special. I think we have to do that. Promote organic when it’s right; don’t promote it when it isn’t right. Make sure that you duplicate things too like having both conventional and organic parsley.”

After that was the Southern Roots Women’s luncheon where the amazing women in produce gathered to hear from Heather Chauvin a leadership coach who helps women conquer their fears. This was followed by the STARS Cocktail and Careers and then the Healthy Family Project Reception.

Nicole Hulstein Fruit Category Manager at Food Lion attended the Southern Roots Women's Luncheon and took a moment to share with me her thoughts.

“It’s so great to be together in Orlando. Kim Lear coached us on leading a multi-generational workforce and the always informative Power of Produce session revealed shifts in buying habits of consumers in 2021. Heather Chauvin challenged female leaders to define success for ourselves and own our role in creating lives that serve us. Sharing time with suppliers and getting creative in strategy for achieving our mutual goals has been energizing” Nicole remarked.

Next on the docket was the Opening Gala where Marvel superheroes rubbed elbows with produce superheroes. Quite a few people showed off their marvel-ous industry pride too.

The atmosphere in the room can only be described as palpable excitement. Everyone was thrilled to have a chance to shake loose the stresses of the past two years all while making new connections and bolstering the old.

The day of the exposition began with the Keynote Luncheon where Tim Tebow of University of Florida and NFL fame gave the room a rousing speech on the power of belief and how being successful should not come at the cost of others. I don’t think anyone walked away from his address without striving for significance.

Then it was time to hit the exposition floor. I can only describe my experience as a whirlwind and I think we can all agree that it felt amazing to get back to doing what we do best.

One of the retailers walking the floor was none other than Mike Roberts Vice President of Operations for Harps Food Stores.

“The SEPC just showed again why it is the best show in the industry!” Mike shared with me. “Amazing educational sessions Tim Tebow speaking at the keynote luncheon Great Southern Roots attendance STEP UPP and Stars events! You cannot get more out of any other show! I think it will go down as one of the best produce shows ever. The excitement and engagement were at an all-time high!”

As we chatted with folks out on the floor they had nothing but praise for the event.

“SEPC is always a great show to attend. We were happy to share our new juice product Squeezed Juice. We received great feedback on both our Mandarin and Pomegranate flavors and look forward to continued success” Angela Hernandez Trinity Fruit’s Director of Marketing expressed.

Lisa McNeece Vice President of Foodservice and Industrial Sales for Grimmway Farms also took a moment to share her thoughts with me.

""This show was just what our industry needed! The excitement and energy were exhilarating"" she expressed. ""The SEPC pulled out all stops—kudos to them. I have been to this show over the years and had never seen so many people in attendance. Our industry is ready to get back to business as we know it. It was truly good to be back in mind body and spirit!""

Awarded during Southern Exposure 2022 with the Terry Vorhees Lifetime Achievement Award was none other than Bobby Creel the Director of L&M Companies. A well-deserved honor!

The energy on the show floor was contagious and you could see how excited everyone was to be back and doing business face to face. These past two years have been tough but as the theme showcased we're tough enough to fight back.

I know that I speak for many of us when I say that this show was one for the books. Cheers to a great event everyone!

Atlanta-based Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) suspended train traffic for 12 hours as its maintenance of way crew aided in the efforts to find Gabriel Vaughn 21 and Robby Dobos 23 who were found alive in a remote cave that was accessed through an active rail tunnel belonging to the company Connor Spielmaker media relations manager for NS told FreightWaves.

“Our crews ferried search and rescue teams back and forth to the area on their hi-rail trucks” Spielmaker said.

He added that the NS crew also brought in heavy machinery to “widen the entrance to the cave to allow easier access for first responders and their equipment.”

The conductor told passengers that a disabled Norfolk Southern freight train was blocking the station platform in Altoona.

By the time Norfolk Southern removed the train and the Pennsylvanian discharged its riders it was almost two hours late according to Metzler who lives in Altoona.

Delays are common on the Pennsylvanian and while that one was longer than normal it illustrates the kind of conflicts that frequently hold up passenger trains. It also illustrates the value of a proposed agreement between Norfolk Southern and PennDOT for right-of-way improvements to alleviate those conflicts and allow for a second daily round-trip Pennsylvanian.

Amtrak’s recent Host Railroad Reports and Host Railroad Report Cards show that delays caused by Norfolk Southern are typically worse than those of the five other major freight railroads.

Norfolk Southern is trying to do better according to a spokesman.

“At times as in the case of the disabled locomotive (that held up Metzler recently) there are impediments to both passenger and freight traffic that have to be worked through” wrote spokesman Connor Spielmaker in an email.

That is “especially true in areas of the network that are single track” Spielmaker wrote.

Amtrak’s Host Railroad Report for 2021 pegs Norfolk Southern as responsible for about 1500 minutes of passenger train delays per 10000 train miles.

The next most problematic Amtrak host was Union Pacific with less than 1200 minutes followed by CSX BNSF Canadian National and Canadian Pacific — which each caused less than 900 minutes of delays per 10000 train miles last year.

Causes of delays

Causes of host-related delays include temporary orders to reduce speed interference from passing trains orders to divert or re-route maintenance-of-way work and detours according to the report.

Norfolk Southern delayed Pennsylvanian in 2021 at the rate of 1396 minutes per 10000 miles above the “target” maximum of 900 minutes.

The Pennsylvanian was more than 15 minutes late 34% of the time station-to-station in 2021 the report said.

A listing of on-time percentages for the Pennsylvanian which runs on both Amtrak-owned and Norfolk Southern-owned tracks versus the Keystone trains which run only on lines owned by Amtrak shows that since 2017 the Pennsylvanian was late 28% of the time compared with 10% for the Keystone trains.

Interference problem

“Freight trains are still the No. 1 cause of delay to Amtrak passengers” states a note on the Amtrak 2020 Host Railroad Report Card. “While the law has required railroads to provide preference to passengers over freight for nearly 50 years freight trains caused 700000 minutes of delay in 2020 alone.”

The Pennsylvanian actually received a passing grade with 82% of riders boarding or arriving within 15 minutes of their scheduled times according to the report card.

Most of Amtrak’s network consists of host lines “owned maintained and dispatched” by freight railroads.

The biggest cause of delay freight train interference is typically the result of freight railroads requiring an Amtrak train to wait so its freight trains can proceed first the report card said.

Sometimes dispatchers force an Amtrak train to follow a much slower freight train for as much as 100 miles and sometimes dispatchers make an Amtrak train park in a siding while a freight train that is too long for the siding goes first according to the report card.

Amtrak was created in 1971 by Congress to relieve freight railroads of their obligation to provide passenger service on which they lost money.

Congress required that Amtrak retain access to the freight companies’ lines and that Amtrak trains would receive preference over freight trains.

Only the U.S. Department of Justice can enforce the preference law “and it has brought only one enforcement action against a freight company in Amtrak’s history — and that was over 40 years ago” according to the report card web page.

Norfolk Southern is working to improve in hopes of helping to make passenger rail on its line “a more reliable and sustainable transportation alternative according to Spielmaker.

The company is also “constantly monitoring where the system is seeing extra stress and moving or adjusting resources to match” he wrote. And The difficulties in single track areas make the proposed Norfok Southern-PennDOT agreement “a critical next step” Spielmaker wrote.

Norfolk Southern doesn’t acknowledge however that it is in violation of the passenger priority requirement.

“We follow the law and grant preference to passenger trains on our network” Spielmaker wrote.

The Western Pennsylvanians for Passenger Rail is an advocate for more reliable service.

“On-time performance is an important factor in maintaining and increasing passenger rail ridership” stated Mark Spada president of the WPPR of which Metzler is a member.

The organization is hopeful for improved performance both near- and long-term.

The right-of-way improvements that could result under the proposed Norfolk Southern-PennDOT agreement should help according to Spada.

Metzler an archivist and historian in private practice has traveled on the Pennsylvanian every month to work for a client in Philadelphia since 2014.

She also goes on the Pennsylvanian to watch Philadelphia Union soccer games.

She was “elated” recently to learn about the proposed agreement.

She likes traveling by rail because it’s more “environmentally friendly” and she can work or nap along the way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS90eC9zb3V0aC10ZXhhcy1lbC1wYXNvL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMy8wNS9hbWF6b24tcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC10ZXhhcy1jb2xsZWdlcy10by1vZmZlci1mdWxsLXR1aXRpb24tYWlkLWZvci1sb2NhbC1lbXBsb3llZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon employees in Texas to be afforded full tuition aid,"TEXAS — Education in the U.S. is quite expensive some having to set their academic aspirations on hold. Financial access to higher education is a luxury — a luxury that Amazon employees will be afforded given the company’s latest Career Choice partnerships with national and local universities.

Amazon employees in Texas will have free educational access to nine colleges and universities and national online education providers including Southern New Hampshire University Colorado State University–Global Western Governors University and National University.

The partner schools in Texas include:

Alamo College

Austin Community College

Dallas College

Houston Community College

Lonestar College

Tarrant County Community College

Texas State University

University of Texas at Dallas

University of North Texas

“We’re excited to have been selected as a partner university for the Amazon Career Choice program” said Adam Fein vice president for Digital Strategy and Innovation at UNT. “In our discussions together we knew immediately we would be a good match. They were looking for a highly ranked diverse mature university with a strong presence in the area and we were thrilled to offer our in-person and online undergraduate programs to tens of thousands of Amazon employees in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and all across Texas.”

Career Choice is an upskilling program dedicated to the career advancement of its employees. The program is forever working to expand upon its opportunities to assist workers with the resources needed for success.

“I’m so proud of Amazon’s commitment to invest in the future of our employees by providing easier access to higher education” said Evan Luscher director of operations at Amazon in Texas. “Amazon’s dedication to upskill our employees and empower their future regardless of whether or not it benefits the company is truly remarkable. Initiatives like Career Choice can be lifechanging for some people and I look forward to seeing how the program evolves.”

Amazon’s rule of thumb for full tuition aid now “allows employees to participate every year they work at Amazon and gives them eligibility after only 90 days of employment” according to its newswire.

Amazon made an upskilling pledge for 2025 with the expansion of Career Choice in mind. The free training and educational program is just one of nine others the company provides."
LUV,Southwest Airlines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1oYXMtZXhjZWxsZW50LW5ld3MtZm9yLWV2ZXJ5b25lLWV4Y2VwdC1iaWxsLWdhdGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines has excellent news for everyone (except Bill Gates),"Are they coming back? Screenshot by ZDNet

When a company wants to believe something it does everything in its power to make it happen.

One of those powers is of course hype.

You tell people something is coming it's close it's-so-right-there-you-can-smell-it.

Why many companies are using the onset of March to announce that yes this is the month when everyone will go back to the office.

And guess what airlines are saying? Yes that business travel is back well is kind of back well will be back well is showing concrete signs of backness.

I was moved to paroxysms of excitement therefore when Southwest Airlines offered a veritably bullish expression of business travel's imminence.

Speaking to Routes Americas Southwest's vice-president of business Dave Harvey teased ""sexy new cities."" Where are they? Well they're somewhere out there. Truly.

But here's the big one. He said: ""The business passengers are coming back."" Finally. At last. It took so long.

Oh I don't know why I still feel a touch skeptical. Perhaps it's because I've been getting a lot of emails from Southwest about astonishing $59 flights available to many cities sexy and non-sexy alike.

Does this mean that perhaps business passengers haven't quite come back all the way?

Might not Bill Gates have been unsexily correct when he predicted that after the pandemic business travel would sink to less than 50 percent of previous levels?

Harvey isn't having it.

Gates he said is ""dead wrong."" Many businesspeople will he insisted travel to restore company culture and specific operations.

He confessed that people have rather liked working remotely. He insisted though: ""The road warrior might not travel as much but there is this new swathe of business traveler who will more than make up for that.""

There's a new swathe? ""Is it a sexy new swathe?"" I hear you wonder.

Harvey explained: ""In operations such as recruitment and training businesses haven't found a good way to do that in the virtual space.""

This may be true -- or it may not -- but are there enough businesspeople who didn't travel so much before who'll now need to increase their frequent flyer status?

You can choose to side with Gates. Or you can be cheered by Zoom announcing disappointing financial results.

What's clear though is that the patterns of business have changed and airlines aren't entirely sure how to address them.

Why as the Points Guy reported United Airlines just removed 17 domestic routes from its offering.

The airline's statement offered a clue to a vital component of the Southwest vs Gates battle. It said: ""United makes regular adjustments to its schedule in response to market demand and staffing resources to ensure we can best serve our customers.""

During the pandemic airlines made large efforts to shed staff. Any sort of rapid return of business travel might be thoroughly thwarted by a lack of pilots and flight attendants.

But let's try and think positive. Let's cut to one of Harvey's sexy cities.

Speaking to the Las Vegas Review-Journal he foresaw enormous conference activity from well March onwards. Yes like a CES with more than seven people there.

So is Southwest right? Will businesspeople flock back to travel as they (may) flock back to their offices?

Or might Mystic Bill still have the last high-pitched chuckle?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL3RyYXZlbC10aXBzL3doYXQtdG8tZG8taWQtbG9zdC1zdG9sZW4tYmVmb3JlLWZsaWdodNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What to Do If You Lose Your ID Right Before a Flight,"There are few travel nightmares more terrifying than arriving at the airport without proper identification. If you're currently freaking out in the departures hall take a deep breath. Although it will likely be an inconvenient process you'll probably be able to fly even if your government-issued photo ID has been lost or stolen.

Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images

Arrive at the airport as early as possible. Passengers traveling without a form of identification will have to go through interviews with TSA officers to establish their identity and most airlines will not refund tickets for people who missed their flights due to a lost ID.

The first step is to explain your situation to an airline representative at the counter. Come prepared with additional forms of identification (credit card photo business card student ID even mail or prescription medication with your name and address). Once the airline representative is satisfied that you are who you say you are they will issue a boarding pass with a note that you don't have an ID.

Pass through to security and explain the situation to the TSA agents. An agent will likely take you to a second room for additional security screening. ""The TSA officer may ask you to complete an identity verification process which includes collecting information such as your name current address and other personal information to confirm your identity"" according to the TSA website.

If the agent is able to confirm your identity you will be allowed to pass through security after additional screening.

The process becomes more difficult when flying abroad as individual countries decide whether or not to allow travelers without identification. Travelers who lose their IDs abroad should immediately contact the closest U.S. embassy for assistance in replacing their passports.

Although it may be too late the best defense is preparation. If your ID was stolen obtain a police report. This will detail when and where your identification went missing (providing some proof to your story) and confirm your identity. Travelers should have a photocopy or digital scan of their identification easily accessible. (Consider storing this in a private Dropbox account.) Sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) before leaving for a trip. It will make it easier to get help from the embassy while abroad.

And most importantly: Remain calm and courteous. Airline security and immigrations employees are all more likely to help get you on your flight if you're being cooperative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL3NvdXRod2VzdC10by11cGdyYWRlLWV4cGFuZC10ZXJtaW5hbC1hdC1ob3VzdG9uLWhvYmJ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest to Upgrade Expand Terminal at Houston Hobby,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/news/airlines-airports/southwest-to-upgrade-expand-terminal-at-houston-hobby on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL3NvdXRod2VzdC10by11cGdyYWRlLWV4cGFuZC10ZXJtaW5hbC1hdC1ob3VzdG9uLWhvYmJ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dhdGNoLW1vdmllcy1pbmZsaWdodC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to watch this year's top Academy Award nominations on your next flight,"Somehow it is already March 2022 meaning Oscars season is officially upon us. Cue the last-minute scramble to Google this year's nominees binge a few of the buzzier films and wonder to yourself if Olivia Colman has been stranded inside AAA (Academy Award International Airport) for the last four years. (If so we have some airline miles you can borrow Ms. Colman!)

If you're like me this scramble usually involves watching a year's worth of trailers and reading a few self-important reviews so you can formulate approximately one minute of intelligent monologue for each potential winner. But thanks to a third year of being mostly at home due to the pandemic I've actually seen most of these distinguished films documentaries and shorts.

Should you find yourself needing to catch up on the Academy Award nominees you're in luck: You can watch most of the contenders on your next flight via inflight entertainment libraries and streaming services.

Here are my nine nominees for the best films to watch on your next flight — and which viewing platforms to use.

'Dune'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

At the risk of immediately diminishing all of my credibility I'll admit that this is the only film on the list I haven't actually seen. However as a vaguely conscious millennial I do know a few things about it.

The latest iteration which is nominated for best picture and best visual effects plus eight other awards is the first installment of a two-part adaptation from the prolific science fiction novel of the same name. It follows Timothée Chalamet (who plays protagonist Paul Atreides) as he fights an intergalactic system of feudalism tastefully small weapon and sharply chiseled jawline in tow. And if you are tuning in for Queen Z (aka Zendaya) you'll be sorely disappointed as she only appears on screen as character Chani Kynes for seven minutes.

Sound bites aside ""Dune"" the novel paved the way for iconic franchises like ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek."" Even though I haven't seen this most recent film adaptation its mere presence alone makes ""Dune"" well worth the high-altitude watch.

Where to watch: on American Airlines Delta Air Lines and United Airlines and via Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video.

'No Time to Die'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

Move over Daniel Craig. There's a new 007 on our screens.

Lashana Lynch stars as Nomi the lethally talented agent who took over the 007 alias following the conclusion of ""Spectre."" Lynch made history as the first black woman to hold this emblematic title. In classic fashion Craig's character doesn't stay retired for long as a new threat to the world with a mysterious connection to James Bond's past sends the 007's of yesterday and today on an epic mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist.

The Bond movies are famous for their ominous and artful title sequences and ""No Time to Die"" is no exception. This new version begins with a haunting original song from Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell earning the sibling duo their first nomination for best music (original song) from the Academy. The film is also nominated in the best sound and best visual effects categories.

Where to watch: on American Airlines and Southwest Airlines and via Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video.

'Spencer'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

""Spencer"" is not a biopic. I repeat: ""Spencer"" is not a biopic. Instead the film hones in on the royal family's 1991 Christmas celebration in Norfolk England when Princess Diana has reached her breaking point.

Alternating between dizzying vignettes of the princess of Wales' spiral out of Buckingham Palace's good graces and gut wrenchingly heartfelt scenes with Princes William and Harry ""Spencer"" emboldens its audience to take a fresh empathetic look at a beloved figure from history.

Anchored by a beautifully nuanced and career-making performance by Kristen Stewart who is nominated in the best actress in a leading role category ""Spencer"" leaves us with many things to love. Stewart haters do yourselves a favor and sit this one out.

Where to watch: on Delta Air Lines and United Airlines and via Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video.

'Luca'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

The most streamed movie of 2021 according to audience insights firm Nielsen best animated feature film-nominated ""Luca"" is a pure delight. The latest coming-of-age tale from Pixar Animation Studios follows a shy but curious sea monster Luca as he explores life above the water's surface.

I will be honest about my affinity for this animated gem — this is an LGBTQI+ movie no questions about it. For starters it was released in June 2021 (aka Pride Month) and chronicles the friendship between two boys (ahem sea monsters) who realize they share an alienating difference that both bonds the boys to one another and garners disapproval from their communities. They quite literally turn into rainbow creatures when they are presenting as their truest most authentic selves.

Metaphors aside Luca is a must-watch movie due to its nostalgic stop-motion style fantastic voice acting and important universal message.

Where to watch: on Southwest Airlines and via Disney+.

'Cruella'

Is Disney's focus on live-action movies getting a bit tired? Yes it sure is. Well at least that's what I thought until last summer when I saw ""Cruella"" which features Emma Stone as the young up-and-coming fashion talent Estella who evolves from orphan prodigy to diabolically iconic Disney villain Cruella.

Throughout the film you'll notice a few deviations from the animated classic. To start Disney finally reveals the story behind Cruella's deep-running hatred of Dalmatians. There are also the absence of the character's signature cigarette holder and the addition of a dress with a 40-foot train made entirely of garbage. In fact ""Cruella"" clinched a much-deserved Oscar nod for best costume design (in addition to a nomination for best makeup and hairstyling) thanks to the work of wildly talented Jenny Beavan.

Feeling territorial over Glenn Close's 1996 portrayal in ""101 Dalmatians""? Never fear — she served as an executive producer for this 2021 remake ensuring the villain remained ""perfectly wretched"" and just a bit more humanized.

'King Richard'

How could you possibly father raise and train not one but two of the most decorated athletes of a generation maybe even of all time? ""King Richard"" takes a peek at how Richard Williams a man from Compton California did just that while raising tennis phenoms Venus and Serena Williams.

Played by the ever-lovable Will Smith Richard Williams is just one of many incredible characters in this part-biopic part-sports movie flick but there's more to ""King Richard"" than its cast.

The film's flawless tennis sequences enhance the plot and heighten the emotional intensity felt throughout standing out in a genre that's often dominated by action scenes that seem stunted and ostentatious. At its core it shows the powerful desire by a father to provide a better life for his children — a classic American dream tale many viewers can relate to. It's no wonder then that it scored a slew of nominations for everything from best original screenplay to best picture.

'Don't Look Up'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

To put it bluntly: The critics got this one wrong. Prominent reviews have used all kinds of creative phrases to express dissatisfaction with ""Don't Look Up"" but that's not what you'll get from me an everyday viewer with no authority on the matter. Fortunately enough folks at the Academy share my sentiment to have nominated it for categories like best picture and best original screenplay.

""Don't Look Up"" is satire in its highest form and incredibly campy in its approach. It parodies the inevitable demise of our planet and our ""leaders"" selfish inaction through the story of two scientists who are propelled into mainstream politics when they realize a giant meteor is on a catastrophic collision course with Earth. If its thought-provoking complexities are not enough to persuade you to watch its amazingly talented cast — including Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Meryl Streep and Timothée Chalamet among others — will.

This film is a lightning rod and a skewer. It's the artistic adaptation of the real-world concern many of us have about the state of our planet and the lack of progress by our leaders to protect it. The less you know about it going in the more you will enjoy it. Trust me; you won't regret watching it.

'The Power of the Dog'

It's Kirsten Dunst's world and we are all simply living in it. That's the easy part. Describing ""The Power of the Dog"" (which has been nominated for a mind-boggling 12 awards including best picture and best directing) is a bit more difficult.

This film tests the confines of its genre depicting the psychologically complex dynamic of a family against the tried-and-true backdrop of the Wild West. Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays Phil Burbank) delivers a scathingly visceral performance that serves as a cautionary tale of the far-reaching impacts of toxic masculinity. Jesse Plemons and Dunst (a real-life married couple who portray newlyweds George Burbank and Rose Gordon) also deliver in a big way making a relationship in the era of straw mattresses somehow seem quite enviable.

""The Power of the Dog"" is the type of film that will have you initially thinking it's going in one direction before ultimately tossing aside any predictions for where the story will go as you'll be proven wrong 10 times over by the time the credits are rolling.

Where to watch: via Netflix.

'The French Dispatch'

(Photo courtesy of IMDB)

Although this most recent offering from director Wes Anderson didn't receive any nominations making it by far the biggest snub of the 94th Academy Awards it is a love letter to print journalism that you won't want to miss.

""The French Dispatch"" may well be the perfect movie choice for a flight as it is constructed episodically as three stories told in a fictional magazine's final issue. While it may lack some of the narrative earnestness and mass appeal of Anderson's early works it possesses everything else you could possibly want and expect from the acclaimed director. The set design and color palette are a five-course meal. The plots are both absurdly dramatic and hilariously quirky. And the cast boasts so many stars (think: Tilda Swinton Owen Wilson Frances McDormand and Benicio del Toro among others) that it could be an Academy nomination meeting in and of itself.

It is truly criminal that ""The French Dispatch"" was shut out of all Oscars categories especially best cinematography and best production design.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

Starbucks’ National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filings have now surpassed the hundred-store mark. Some cities are especially hot with workers in Eugene Oregon having organized eight out of eight stores in their city. Corporate is not coping well. As Starbucks’ recent retaliatory firings of union organizers in Memphis and Buffalo demonstrate the coffee giant is a lot less skilled at conflict de-escalation than many baristas.

In the last few months of Starbucks worker organizing one workplace issue gaining visibility is the expectation on baristas to manage in-store crises and altercations with little support from management. In the letter announcing their filing workers at the 7th and Washington location in Eugene cited “physical safety issues” at their “high-incident” store alleging that the company has failed to adequately support and compensate workers facing these challenges.

Organizing committee members Sadie Goetsch and Cassandra Hicks at 7th and Washington addressed this and other concerns in conversation with Jacobin. They and their coworkers began talking about a union after they heard about organizing in Buffalo last year. The conversations began as “almost-but-not jokes.”At first they would lightheartedly approach coworkers saying “Dang when are we going to do that? Wouldn’t that be awesome?” although at that time the Oregon baristas “didn’t really think it was possible.” Hicks added “Most of us didn’t really know what unions are and what they meant and what they can do.”

That changed after the first store in Eugene at 29th and Willamette announced an NLRB filing on January 8 of this year. The local campaign Hicks said made employees at 7th and Washington more confident that unionization was an option and prompted them to get in contact with Workers United. As with other locations across the country things moved quickly after that. The store at 7th and Washington announced their filing on January 31.

Oregon and especially Eugene has a high density of Starbucks stores with current filings. Workers at unionizing stores in Eugene Portland and Beaverton are in close and constant contact with one another. Organizing baristas in Eugene even have a dedicated group chat to talk about strengthening their efforts. “Every day it seems like there are new people in the Discord” said Hicks. “It’s pretty cool.”

At nineteen and twenty years old respectively Goetsch and Hicks are representative of the spirit of “Gen U” as Workers United organizer Richard Bensinger has referred to the Gen Z organizers who make up a large portion Starbucks Workers United. The chain attracts young workers like Goetsch who was sixteen when she first started working for the company.

Starbucks benefits from having a young workforce as many of its employees are able to rely on parental access to health care which makes them less likely to seek these provisions from Starbucks. Younger workers are also less likely to work full time and thus become eligible for other benefits. Workers allege that Starbucks often seems to prevent them from working full time when they try. Hicks and Goetsch said that the difficulty many workers face in securing more hours was a major impetus for unionization.

Another major issue for workers at 7th and Washington is employee safety which workers say is jeopardized by the company’s policy of lean staffing. The store features a drive-through and a particularly large indoor café area. Although about twenty-five people are generally employed at the store at any given time the location maxes out at six or seven people on shift at once and only schedules three partners for opens and closes. Baristas at 7th and Washington often need to step out from behind the bar to attend to a variety of crises involving community members at the busy location. In addition to confusion and sometimes physical endangerment dealing with these crises also means more difficulty keeping the store running efficiently making workers’ jobs even more difficult.

Located near a busy intersection and across from Jefferson Park a designated Safe Sleep Site 7th and Washington is considered a “high-incident store.” Hicks called it an “intense store to work at.” Goetsch added that the environment at the Eugene store is distinct from their experience working at another Starbucks location in a wealthy area of Portland where in-store conflict often revolved around customer “entitlement.” At 7th and Washington Goetsch said incidents are “more worrying and scary.” Hicks adds that incidents have included threats leveled against baristas sexual harassment and circumstances in which visitors to the store required emergency medical attention protection or mental health care.

Many community members rely on private businesses for resources like clean bathrooms and a warm place to sit. “We’re baristas” said Hicks “and at the same time we’re almost untrained social workers.”

Because they are located in Eugene 7th and Washington employees are able to call Cahoots a local alternative to the police that offers emergency mental health resources and transportation. Hicks and Goetsch are grateful for this service as well as a de-escalation training that the company offered to some staff — but they note that the latter was not provided to all employees. Hicks said that they would like to see these trainings offered to all Starbucks employees but that at the very least “it should be incorporated in the training of our store.”

Since the store’s lobby reopened taking precautions to prevent the spread of and exposure to COVID has become difficult both due to insufficient time for sanitizing surfaces during periods of heavy customer traffic and due to the way baristas are advised to handle unmasked visitors. Hicks told Jacobin that the store policy on masks is centered around customer experience. If a customer refuses to wear a mask after being asked once workers are told “to simply serve them and try and get them out the door as fast as possible because if we start a scene or we escalate a situation then we have created a bad customer experience for that person and we won’t get their business anymore.”

Following union certification Hicks and Goetsch would like to see more workplace protections centering the health and safety of baristas. They are currently gauging the primary concerns of other baristas in their store by way of a survey as they and Starbucks workers across the country await further updates from Buffalo where the Elmwood and Genesee Street locations are in the process of contract negotiations.

Goetsch and Hicks told Jacobin that they hope other baristas and workers in general will also consider unionization. Hicks expressed the wish that “everyone had the information that we do now” because changing the service industry “is a lot more possible than people realize.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcmd1c2xlYWRlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9jcmltZS8yMDIyLzAzLzA1L3Npb3V4LWZhbGxzLXBvbGljZS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW5nLWFmdGVyLXZlaGljbGUtY3Jhc2hlcy1pbnRvLXN0YXJidWNrcy85MzkzMDI1MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multiple people injured after vehicle crashes into Sioux Falls Starbucks police say,"Nine people were injured Saturday afternoon after an SUV driven by a man who had a medical incident slammed into the side of a Starbucks building in central Sioux Falls police said.

The crash happened at about 12:30 p.m. When emergency responders arrived they discovered a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee headed north at the time had left the roadway and collided with the southwest corner of the building according to a press release from the Sioux Falls Police Department.

""The vehicle was completely embedded in the business while several employees and patrons were also inside"" the release stated.

The driver a 65-year-old Sioux Falls man was treated at an area hospital along with his 71-year-old passenger a woman. Their injuries appear to be non-life-threatening at this time the release states.

Three other adults inside the building at the time were taken to area hospitals and their injuries were also not life-threatening the release read.

In addition four other people took themselves to the hospital for treatment. One was a Starbucks employee and three others were customers. None of the injuries are life-threatening police said.

Investigators determined it was likely a medical event likely contributed to the crash the release states. Drugs and alcohol do not appear to be factors and seatbelts were worn by those inside the vehicle.

No charges have been filed at this time and the investigation is ongoing.

Officers closed off the area between South Minnesota Avenue from West 11th Street to West 14th Street to conduct the crash investigation asking people to avoid the area. The streets opened again around 5 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbG9sYW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvZGV2ZWxvcGluZy1jcmFzaC1hdC1zaW91eC1mYWxscy1zdGFyYnVja3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nine people injured in Starbucks crash - Sioux Falls,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.keloland.com/news/local-news/developing-crash-at-sioux-falls-starbucks/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbG9sYW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvZGV2ZWxvcGluZy1jcmFzaC1hdC1zaW91eC1mYWxscy1zdGFyYnVja3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbGFib3Jub3Rlcy5vcmcvMjAyMi8wMy9ob3ctc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXdvcmtlcnMtd29uLW1lc2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Starbucks Workers Won in Mesa | Labor Notes,"Starbucks Workers United (SWU) won its third store election February 28 in Mesa Arizona. The vote was an overwhelming 25-3 with three additional contested ballots despite heavy anti-union pressure from the company and in a state with only 5.4 percent union density.

“We led with kindness and care and just did our jobs in the face of union-busting from upper management” said shift supervisor Liz Alanna who helped lead the effort. Shift supervisors coordinate the day-to-day running of a store but are eligible for union membership because they don’t have hiring and firing power.

The Mesa store at Powerline and Baseline Roads became the first U.S. company-run store outside Buffalo to be unionized in the recent organizing wave.

Starbucks Workers United is now three for four in the elections held so far—and workers at more than 110 more locations have filed or announced their intention to unionize. A Canadian Starbucks also filed to unionize separately with the Steelworkers (USW) in January.

In Mesa the company’s retaliation against a cancer-afflicted manager drove workers into the arms of SWU and Workers United the Service Employees (SEIU) affiliate that has been supporting these union drives nationwide.

COLLAPSED ON THE FLOOR

‘It was just a huge slap in the face that our manager has leukemia we never got support from another assistant store manager and it was holiday season and we were getting slammed” said Alanna.

The manager 29-year-old Brittany Harrison had been diagnosed with leukemia in October. Harrison requested paid leave which was denied and asked for an assistant manager to help at the store which was also denied. She wanted to be able to make medical appointments and take care of herself as she coped with both the diagnosis and the illness.

But in November when Harrison became aware of Starbucks’ planned union-busting strategy in Buffalo through a corporate meeting she blew the whistle on the company. Harrison spoke anonymously to the media about a plan to send hundreds of managers to Buffalo Starbucks. She also made contact with Starbucks Worker United members in Buffalo.

Higher-ups stopped communicating with her. “I was getting ghosted by my supervisor and that sucked” Harrison said. “My health was deteriorating.”

Starbucks company-owned stores are run by managers like Harrison who have hiring and firing power and are not eligible to join barista unions. Above them are district managers who are responsible for multiple stores in the same area. Below them are assistant store managers shift supervisors and baristas all of whom have been eligible to vote for the union. (NLRB regional directors so far have deferred the question of whether assistant store managers will ultimately be included in the bargaining unit to post-election proceedings.)

A bronchitis outbreak hit the store on November 10 and multiple workers called out. Harrison felt unwell November 11 and called out sick; the district manager told her that night she was not allowed to call out even though there were multiple shift supervisors present and questioned her leadership ability.

The district manager went so far as to order Harrison to work the next day even though she had not been scheduled.

That night at 3 a.m. Harrison called her again to tell her she was too sick to work but the district manager didn’t pick up her phone. Harrison even texted her photos of the temperature reader that showed she had a fever but got no response.

The store was already short-staffed and Harrison was forced to come in.

She ended up working until she collapsed to the floor after six hours. Unable to get up she defecated on herself. Even then she was forced to stay another hour because her district manager failed to send someone to cover for her in a timely way.

“This company will not be happy until I work myself to death” Harrison remembers thinking. She put in her two weeks’ notice that day at the corporation she had once expected to retire at.

Starbucks fired her three days later citing an “open investigation”; the charges were not disclosed to Harrison. Her Starbucks health benefits were cut off on November 16.

The coffee giant made $816 million in profits from roughly October through January and expanded by 484 stores in the quarter.

DON’T QUIT UNIONIZE

Starbucks eventually tried to walk back the firing claiming in a mass email to partners that it had never happened. By then though the cat was out of the bag.

When word spread through a group chat “we were all really upset” said Michelle Hejduk a shift supervisor and worker leader. “People were talking about quitting. Somebody said ‘unionizing’—and everybody knew I was the main one that would talk about it with everybody.”

Hejduk had previously been an IATSE member in custodial work at Universal Studios in California and an SEIU member doing costuming at Disneyland.

She called Alanna that night; the two had talked politics before. Alanna remains a member of the American Guild of Musical Artists from her past work as an opera singer.

“Both of us were scared at first that we would get fired or lose our jobs” Alanna said. She was pregnant and nearly due; she didn’t want to risk losing her family’s health insurance and owing thousands of dollars in hospital bills.

But after the pair talked with Workers United organizing adviser Richard Bensinger about legal protections for workers trying to unionize they felt reassured enough to move forward.

By November 16 just four days after Harrison had collapsed in the store the workers had enough cards to file for a union authorization election.

SWU raised $30000 through crowdfunding to support Harrison the uninsured and cancer-stricken whistleblower in a striking display of reciprocal solidarity.

The Mesa store is not the only one where workers allege a retaliatory firing. In February Starbucks fired seven unionizing workers in a Memphis store. Cassie Fleischer a bargaining committee member was also terminated from the Buffalo Elmwood location that was the first to win a union.

UNDERSTAFFING AND DISCRIMINATION

SUPPORT LABOR NOTES BECOME A MONTHLY DONOR Give $10 a month or more and get our ""Fight the Boss Build the Union"" T-shirt.

Like other Starbucks workers organizing around the country Mesa baristas were motivated by understaffing pressure to come to work sick the company’s reluctance to stop accepting mobile orders when a store is overwhelmed and a lack of worker voice.

“People who sit behind a computer do not know how to make a latte do not know how to clean a toilet—we need to have a say” said Alanna.

Many Starbucks workers around the country said that people tend to underestimate the amount of physical labor they’re required to do in an environment where there’s pressure to be efficient and customer-pleasing at all times. This includes everything from heavy lifting to being on your feet all day—in some shifts for almost six hours with only a ten-minute break.

Another concern at the Mesa store was religious discrimination. Harrison who is Jewish filed a complaint against the district manager for anti-Semitism.

For example when Harrison had a swastika painted on her house and the mezuzah torn off the district manager suggested she should try to understand where the person who did it was coming from.

Harrison and workers in the store say that the district manager whom Alanna described as “very Christian” regularly prayed in meetings at which they were present.

“I’m Christian and even I find it very off-putting to have her reading a Christian story at the holiday meeting—I just think it’s weird” Alanna said.

STALLING AND INTIMIDATION

There were 25 workers for the Mesa store the day they filed for election. But in a union-busting move Starbucks started hiring. The number of eligible voters ended up at 43.

“They hired half the store just to say ‘no’” Alanna said.

The company also flooded the store with management—another tactic it has repeated around the country.

Whereas when Harrison was diagnosed with cancer Starbucks wouldn’t add a single assistant manager to help the workers in Mesa now it added three plus two managers.

“We called them the babysitters” Hejduk said. “We were not allowed to be there without them.” One day she was scheduled for the morning but because a new manager couldn’t come in the store did not open until 1 p.m.

The managers held captive group meetings (“listening sessions”) and one-on-ones to pressure workers over the union. One manager cried as she told a worker “I want you to vote 'no'.”

Hejduk found the episode “totally bizarre.”

“They’ve done so much wild stuff” she said. “We’ve been desensitized to everything that’s happened.”

As it has done around the country Starbucks argued to the NLRB that the appropriate bargaining unit would be the whole district not just one store.

The company lost on this issue in a regional director’s ruling but then filed an appeal with the NLRB’s head office. A ruling on the appeal was not made by February 16 the day the Mesa votes were to be counted even though Starbucks had already lost on this issue at the NLRB in Buffalo.

As a result the final vote count for the Mesa store was postponed pending a decision by the Board's head office. It was eventually held on February 28.

The NLRB’s decision against Starbucks set the size of the bargaining unit at the store level rather than the district. This is expected to allow the Board to more quickly stop the company’s procedural delays on this issue moving forward.

NEW CAMARADERIE

As the organizing drive continues to build SWU is building worker-to-worker contacts nationwide.

The day the Mesa workers filed their cards with the NLRB they met over Zoom with Colin Cochran a Buffalo-based SWU member who told them what union-busting tactics to expect.

“Starbucks uses the same playbook everywhere and we know the ins and outs of it” Cochran said over email. “It’s really fulfilling to be able to help other stores.”

And among the Mesa workers themselves Alanna said the process of organizing has forged a new sense of community.

“Previous to this night workers might never talk to day workers” she said. Now they’re all on the same group chat and are going out for food and attending parties together.

“I’ve worked in four different stores and I’ve never felt this kind of camaraderie before” Alanna said.

Within weeks SWU will know if it has managed to replicate the successes in Mesa and Buffalo through election wins in more stores and in other parts of the country. Next up: Seattle and Boston.

Since her store filed to hold a union vote in September she said Starbucks management has told her to take them off or be fired. She also said she hasn’t been allowed to supervise a shift in nearly two months.

“It really hurts because I got this job and I earned my job and I earned everything that I have and I worked very hard” she said. “And they're pulling that all away all because I want to do is speak for accountability within the company.”

Tom Dinki / WBFO News Angel Krempa (second from left) a shift supervisor at the Transit Road Starbucks in Depew speaks with the media at the Buffalo office of Starbucks Workers United March 1 2022.

Krempa and other workers’ allegations against Starbucks are detailed in 21 Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges filed over the last week. The allegations currently being reviewed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) include surveillance and intimidation closing stores hiring new workers to dilute union elections and even firing union leaders.

Starbucks Workers United the Buffalo-area workers leading the unionization effort that has now spread across the country is seeking a special remedy under the National Labor Relations Act in which a U.S. District Court judge would block Starbucks from any more alleged anti-union behavior.

The remedy is not used all that often but has recently been given special priority by the Biden administration’s NLRB.

“We're asking the NLRB to put a stop to the entire anti-union campaign” said an attorney with Starbucks Workers United Ian Hayes. “It's been that destructive and it's that egregious of a violation of the law.”

What workers are alleging

In September Starbucks Workers United tweeted out a photo of Starbucks President for North America Rossann Williams sweeping the floor at an Orchard Park store.

Workers say Williams who reports directly to Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson  has been a constant presence in Buffalo-area stores.

“Why on earth would you ask one of the top executives to clean a bathroom? I think they have other things that they should be focusing on” said James Skretta a barista at the Sheridan Drive and Bailey Avenue store in Amherst. “So it's clear what Rossann was in our store trying to do.”

Altogether workers say more than 100 out-of-state company officials have visited Buffalo since the unionization campaign began last summer including former CEO Howard Schultz who spoke to workers at a company event in November.

In the ULP charges filed with the NLRB workers alleged that high-ranking Starbucks officials making such “unprecedented and repeated” visits to Buffalo-area stores was an act of “surveillance” and meant to intimidate workers.

“Between August and today there was not a conversation that I had with a coworker in my store where I was more than 10 feet away from a manager” said William Westlake a barista at the Camp Road store in Hamburg which voted against unionizing in December.

Other ULP charges deal with the temporary closing of some Buffalo-area stores. Starbucks Workers United alleges Starbucks temporarily closed at least 11 stores in the Buffalo-area since the unionization effort.

Tom Dinki / WBFO News Colin Cochran a barista at the Walden Avenue and Anderson Road in Cheektowaga speaks with the media at the Buffalo office of Starbucks Workers United March 1 2022.

That includes the Walden Avenue and Anderson Anderson store in Cheektowaga whose workers were transferred to other stores while it became a training-only facility for several months last fall.

“They specifically sent a lot of folks from my store to the Genesee Street and the Camp Road stores to basically send the message of ‘We were trying to unionize and look what they did to our store’” said Colin Cochran a barista at the Walden-Anderson store.

And for new employees trained at the Walden-Anderson store the training had less to do with making drinks and more to do with why unions aren’t necessary said one of the employees trained there RJ Rebmann.

They said it was almost two months between the time they were hired and when they poured their first cup of coffee.

“I was just attending these anti-union listening sessions” Rebmann said “and it seemed very much to me that they were trying to indoctrinate me and other new hires into this kind of climate of distrust toward the partners that wanted to unionize and spread this kind of scary narrative.”

This alleged hiring of new employees to dilute the pro-union vote has disrupted scheduling and given Starbucks an excuse to terminate pro-union employees workers alleged.

A reduction in workers’ hours in recent months forced some of them to get second jobs. Recently Starbucks has begun telling workers they have to increase their hours or be fired.

That’s what happened to Elmwood Avenue store barista Cassie Fleischer a member of the bargaining committee whose firing last month has been widely publicized .

“We're filing these charges to get justice for Cassie and all of our co-workers who've been put in this untenable position of having their hours reduced” said one of Leischer’s coworkers Jaz Brisack “and then not being able to live on them so they have to get another job and then suddenly they're told that they don't meet the needs of the business.”

A Starbucks spokesperson Reggie Borges called any allegations of Unfair Labor Practices at the company “categorically false.”

How the NLRB might handle it

The NLRB received over 15000 Unfair Labor Practice charges last year . More than half were withdrawn or dismissed while about a third resulted in settlements in which the employer or union agreed to stop the unfair practice.

“As you can tell that's a pretty ineffective remedy” said Cathy Creighton director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations School ’s Buffalo Co-Lab and a former NLRB attorney.

What’s different about the Starbucks workers’ case Creighton said is that they’re seeking a 10(j) injunction named after the same section in the National Labor Relations Act. It entails the NLRB asking a U.S. District Court judge to issue an injunction against an employer or union to stop the alleged unfair labor practices while the NLRB investigates.

“The workers are saying that the actions of Starbucks are so egregious that this should not go through the normal processes of the National Labor Relations Board but should go directly to federal court to have a federal district court judge decide in a very quick manner whether Starbucks violated the law or not” Creighton said.

Tom Dinki / WBFO News Starbucks Workers United pins sit in the Buffalo office of Starbucks Workers United Feb. 23 2022.

The NLRB general counsel must get authorization from the NLRB itself before seeking an injunction in court and doesn’t seek these injunctions very often. It did so just fewer than 60 times during the first three years of the Trump administration .

But there may be some good news for Starbucks workers. The Biden administration’s NLRB general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo just last month launched an initiative to more quickly seek injunctions on behalf of workers facing threats over their unionization efforts. Abruzzo’s memo instructs regional NLRB offices to quickly investigate allegations and promptly submit those cases for consideration of injunctive relief.

“Her attitude is much more worker-friendly and she is looking for ways to help workers who are organizing” Creighton said “because the law statute says that it's federal policy that workers should be able to form a union if they want.”

Hayes the attorney for Starbucks Workers United said they hope the NLRB will act on the 21 ULP charges “soon” adding there’s only so much Starbucks can “say to try to excuse itself.”

“This has been an extraordinarily vicious anti-union campaign and it calls for extraordinary remedies in order to make up for that or try to make up for that” he said. “We can't get into a time machine and go back six months and get the company to not do everything it just did. However there are some measures under the law that we're going to ask the NLRB to take to try to make up for it.”

Sports writer

NAMPA — The St. Maries Lumberjacks came up short in their bid to repeat as state 2A champions but it wasn’t for lack of effort.

Despite a poor shooting night the Lumberjacks scrapped and clawed and dived on the floor contesting everything the Melba Mustangs tried to do before finally waving the white flag with 19.8 seconds left.

“We never give up” St. Maries senior forward Colby Renner said after the Lumberjacks fell to Melba 59-50 in the state title game Saturday afternoon at the Ford Idaho Center. “Down 15 we’re still pushing to come back … maybe hit a couple of 3s … we truly thought we were coming back.”

But shooting 36.2% (21 of 58) from the field stalled any attempts at a comeback for St. Maries (20-4) and Melba (24-2) went on to win its first state title since 2011.

“They have such a will to win and never-give-up attitude” said St. Maries coach Bryan Chase whose team was in the state title game for the third time in four years. “That’s what I’m most proud of … down 15 got within striking distance … and we were a couple of possessions away from … who knows what happens? That just says a lot about those kids and how hard they play.”

Senior Tristan Gentry-Nelson had 11 points and 10 rebounds for St. Maries and guard Greyson Sands added 12 points. Senior Coleman Ross had eight points and seven boards.

Gentry-Nelson and Ross started on last year’s title team.

“A sense of unfulfillment” said Gentry-Nelson who has been talking to area colleges about possibly continuing his basketball career. “We felt like we should have been here all year and we got here and it just seems like we dropped the ball. It was winnable but not enough stuff went our way tonight.”

Joe Reiber a 6-foot-2 senior swingman scored 16 of his game-high 20 points in the second half for Melba. Junior guard Braden Volkers added 14 points and Cache Beus a 6-4 sophomore post had 11 points and 10 rebounds.

Senior Dillon Stosich scored all six of his points — and Melba’s first six points — in the first three minutes and the Mustangs jumped out to a 9-3 lead.

St. Maries took a 12-11 lead early in the second quarter on a 3 by Sands but Melba answered with an 11-0 run and never trailed again. With the clock winding down Volkers tossed in a 3 just before the buzzer for a 25-16 halftime lead.

“In the first half we forced it a little and took some tough shots” Chase said. “They trapped us quite a bit and we didn’t handle that pressure very well. They’ve got a great group of athletes and they just forced our hand a little bit in that first half.”

Melba increased its lead to 15 points on several occasions in the second half but St. Maries wouldn’t go away running off eight straight points including 3s by Connor Wolfe (which nearly turned into a four-point play) and Ross to cut it to 57-50 with some 40 seconds left before time eventually ran out on the Lumberjacks.

“It just felt like we were spinning our wheels all night long trying to get some traction” Chase said. “If we could have made one of those runs a little earlier … “

“They’re a great team” fourth-year Melba coach Spencer Trappett said of St. Maries. “I thought they were tired and I thought we could use that to our ability and get the ball up and down the floor. Great coach great program. They could have won it anyway and once we got ahead I thought that kinda took it out of them took the fight out of them but they stuck with it the whole game. They play hard and they get after it and they do it year after year after year.”

Gentry-Nelson played quite a bit as a freshman on the state runner-up team of 2019. Renner Ross and Sean Elliott were brought up from the junior varsity late in that season and Wolfe joined the mix last year.

The last four years at state St. Maries finished second third first and second.

“Those seniors I know they’re upset but they’ve got so much to be proud of with four state trophies in four years and to make three trips to play on this (Idaho Center) floor” Chase said. “I told them ‘Hold your heads high because you have so much to be proud of.’”

Cobra Gold 2022 is the 41st iteration of the international training exercise that supports readiness and emphasizes coordination on civic action humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. From Feb. 22 through March 4 2022 this annual event taking place at various locations throughout the Kingdom of Thailand increases the capability capacity and interoperability of partnered nations while simultaneously reinforcing our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.

LOPBURI PROVINCE Kingdom of Thailand – The M1129 Stryker mortar system is an infantry carrier vehicle descendant of the Swiss Mowag Piranha III accommodating a 120mm mortar system that fires a suite of mortar ammunition and first employed in 2005. After 17 years the U.S. Army is sharing this technology and weaponry with a close ally of the Indo-Pacific: The Kingdom of Thailand.



Here at Cobra Gold 2022 the annual international training exercise now in its 41st year the 4th Battalion 23rd Infantry Regiment 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team 7th Infantry Division shares the Stryker system with their partners from the 112th Infantry Regiment Royal Thai Army at the Fort Bhumibol Lopburi Artillery Centre Feb. 28 2022.



“The Royal Thai Army chose to invest in the proven capability of the Stryker family of vehicles based on their proven combat effectiveness” said Maj. Curt Belohlavek the battalion executive officer for 4th Battalion 23rd Infantry Regiment. “The Stryker family of vehicles simultaneously provides a new capability within the RTA and improves its interoperability with the U.S. Army.”



The Kingdom of Thailand which has enjoyed nearly two centuries of friendly and formalized diplomatic relations with the U.S. is the first foreign nation to ever receive these Stryker systems.



“It’s a great opportunity for us to partner with the Thailand forces” said Army Lt. Col. Duke Reim the 4/23rd Infantry Regiment battalion commander. “But most importantly we get to create those relationships those lasting relationships.”



This year’s Cobra Gold starts the process of introducing the Strykers to the Royal Thai Army with a series of training exercises and field missions at Fort Bhumibol preparing them to officially receive the vehicles at a future date.



“The RTA has not currently fielded the M1129 Stryker Mortar Carrying Vehicle yet” said Belohlavek “but it is scheduled to start receiving them in the near future. Fielding the 112th Stryker Regiment is spearheading the ongoing development and modernization of the RTA by introducing new armored vehicles that significantly upgrade its combat capability and operational reach.”



The event additionally provided an opportunity for the newest members of the 112th Infantry Regiment to demonstrate their fresh skills and take the lead in moving the Royal Thai Army into a new era of regional defense.



“The 112 Stryker Regiment Team is a new unit that is still receiving new equipment and personnel” said Belohlavek. “Given its importance as one of the model regiments to modernize the RTA the 112th is one of the premier organizations within the RTA. The Soldiers and leaders from the 112 Stryker Regiment Team were handpicked to participate in the Cobra Gold and Hanuman Guardian exercises so that they could bring their new knowledge and experiences back to teach the rest of the regiment.”



The 4/23rd and the 112th practiced maintenance procedures elevation preparation on the mortar systems dismount maneuvers and live fire exercises on the Strykers to hone their skills in a field environment.



“They're ready to do anything it doesn’t matter if it’s maintenance or dismounting from the Stryker to pull security” said Pfc. Charles Fairbairn a Stryker leader with the 4/23rd. “You know really moving to it and getting stuff done.”



Designed to demonstrate the United States’ commitment to Thailand the field training portion of CG 22 encourages the U.S. and Thai Soldiers to learn from one another build confidence and strengthen their bond been developing over the years.



“They’ve been really receptive to everything we’ve been teaching them” said Fairbairn. “Really engaged and I feel like it’s been working really well.”



“The fielding of this vehicle is strategically important because it further enhances the military alliance between the United States and Thailand” said Belohlavek “and signals to neighboring countries that Thailand is committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXkubWlsL2FydGljbGUvMjU0NjUxL3NvbGRpZXJfc3BvdGxpZ2h0X3NndF8xc3RfY2xhc3Nfd2VzdGxledIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXkubWlsL2FydGljbGUtYW1wLzI1NDY1MS9zb2xkaWVyX3Nwb3RsaWdodF9zZ3RfMXN0X2NsYXNzX3dlc3RsZXk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Soldier Spotlight: Sgt. 1st Class Westley,"U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Cedrick Westley a Cleveland Mississippi native and electronic warfare senior noncommissioned officer with 1-2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord Wash. takes a quick break for a photo while aiding his Soldiers' transition back into garrison life after returning from the National Training Center Feb. 15 2022.

U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Cedrick Westley a Cleveland Mississippi native and electronic warfare senior noncommissioned officer with 1-2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord Wash. takes a quick break for a photo while aiding his Soldiers' transition back into garrison life after returning from the National Training Center Feb. 15 2022. Along with his Soldiers Westley recently returned from NTC as well – his eighteenth NTC rotation in his eighteen-year Army career.

“What NTC does is help focus Soldiers for their upcoming mission” Westley said. “When something goes wrong at NTC it allows you to home in on deficiencies so you are prepared for anything in the future.”

Westley started out his career as a tanker and transitioned to electronic warfare around 2010. He uses his combat experience as a tanker to support his current profession something that sets him apart from his peers. However sometimes Westley does miss being in the action.

“An HHC [Headquarters and Headquarters Company] brigade NTC experience is different from my previous NTC experiences” Westley said. “Sometimes I’d rather be on the ground and in the fight along with my Soldiers. However with a brigade TOC [Tactical Operations Center] you are able to see the overall fight and get the bigger picture of the causes and effects of movement on the battlefield. I am also able to help more subordinate units with our EW assets.”

Westley’s responsibilities as an electronic warfare senior NCO include deconflicting jamming and scheduling EW assets. However Westley’s primary responsibility and one he takes to heart is taking care of his Soldiers. As recovery tasks begin after NTC Westley leads the way for his team and his Soldiers.

So I got a few photos with a note “can you write something about these?” In those photos we have two new Xeon D-1700 codenamed “Ice Lake D” platforms and another Elkhart Lake platform with two of the three being fanless designs.

Supermicro Fanless Intel Xeon D-1700 at MWC 2022 and a 1U

First we have the fanless Supermicro SYS-E302-12D. This features at least two different Intel Ice Lake-D SKUs. One is a Xeon D-1718T quad core CPU. The other is an Intel Xeon D-1736NT 8-core part with 2nd generation QAT onboard. There are also dual 25GbE ports and quad 1GbE ports.

The rear I/O is similar to a E300 system we saw with fans the SYS-E300-12D-4CN6P previously.

The new Ice Lake-D platform brings some compute upgrades but more by way of networking PCIe Gen5 QAT and other acceleration versus the previous generations. If you missed it here is the launch piece: Welcome to the Intel Ice Lake D Era with the Xeon D-2700 and D-1700 series.

There was also a short-depth 1U system the SYS-510D-10C-FN6P at the show that seems to be based on the same motherboard but with active cooling.

This looks like a future firewall platform for many of our readers. We did not get to feature this platform in our Ice Lake-D launch article.

Aside from Xeon D there was also Intel Elkhart Lake in a fanless embedded platform.

This has the Atom-based Elkhart Lake processors. You will see it is a 4-core 12W model called the “x642SE” here but that is not a public SKU. We think the “S” should be a “5” and is the x6425E. Here we get quad 1GbE ports we also get video since the Atom CPU has an onboard GPU and we also get 10Gbps USB ports.

On the back we can see USB 2.0 and serial ports like we saw in our recent Supermicro X12STN-E Review. These are for industrial embedded applications.

Final Words

Since the main thrust of the Intel Ice Lake D series is really network and embedded applications these seem like cool platforms. I can see why I was sent a task about writing something about these photos. These are new platforms so it is always good to get to see them out in physical form instead of just on web pages.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That is why Dish has been in the words of one of our loyal readers a ""spectrum squatter"" (love that term!). In fact in that famous 2017 FCC auction of low-band spectrum which resulted in T-Mobile spending nearly $8 billion to win 31Mhz of 600Mhz spectrum  Dish also shelled out $6.2 billion for 486 licenses.





Dish hopes to have its own stand-alone 5G network running in over 100 cities by June and the FCC might have given away the names of the first two phones that will support Dish's 5G signals over Band 70 and 26 (more on that below). As described by PhoneScoop  Band 70 is unusual in that the bandwidth for downlink is larger than for uplink. The former runs 1995 – 2020 MHz and consists of H block and AWS-4 while the uplink spans 1695 – 1710 MHz which includes AWS-3.

Dish faces a deadline to cover 70% of the country with its 5G by June 2023





As we mentioned late last month Dish does have a deadline imposed by the FCC and must cover 20% of the country with its 5G signals by the middle of June 2022. By the middle of June 2023 70% of the U.S. must be able to connect to Dish's 5G airwaves. This will be confirmed by drive tests. Dish is on the hook for potentially billions of dollars in ""voluntary contributions"" to the U.S. Treasury if it fails to meet the 2023 deadline.





Now back to the FCC where the U.S. regulatory agency signed off on two new phones with the model numbers XT2213 and XT2215 . Those model numbers certainly have a Motorola-ish sound to them and PCMag reports that the XT2215-1 has been mentioned on a Chinese forum as a model heading to AT&T MVNO Cricket Wireless. An MVNO or Mobile Virtual Network Operator is a firm that doesn't have its own network but uses one owned by another firm (in this case AT&T) to do business.





Dish Wireless currently uses bands 26 29 48 66 70 71 and 77. Amid this locker combination of numbers bands 26 and 70 will be exclusive to Dish Wireless' mobile traffic. Band 29 belongs to AT&T 71 is used by T-Mobile (which makes sense in light of Dish's MVNO agreements with both carriers) and the remaining bands are employed by other multiple carriers.







Band 70 was designed specifically for Dish but band 26 was once used by Nextel and Dish agreed to buy the spectrum as part of the $26 billion T-Mobile acquisition of Sprint. Dish has yet to close on the purchase of those airwaves. Neither band has been spotted yet on any phone outside of the upcoming Motorola models. The pair will make calls on 5G only since Dish is not going to use any 4G networking gear once its 5G network is finished.

Band 70 will be exclusive to Dish for its 5G wireless traffic









Currently the only phone made for Dish is the Celero 5G  but it does not work with bands 26 or 70. The phone features a 6.5-inch display four cameras 36 hours of battery life 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage. It is available from Boost Mobile which happens to be owned by Dish Network and at $13999 it is half-off the retail price.





Dish Wireless is being counted on to keep the competitive balance the same in the U.S. with four major wireless providers now that Sprint has been swallowed up by T-Mobile. Still you can see from the Celero 5G and the two aforementioned Motorola phones (that are supposedly headed to Cricket) that Dish will be offering low-priced handsets instead of flagships. That's because the bulk of its customers come from Boost Mobile which is a pre-paid wireless provider.

Pre-paid customers are more apt to save money by purchasing low-priced handsets rather than spend a ransom on high-priced flagship models.

Nevertheless it also has a huge problem: the limited radio frequency spectrum to accommodate it. For that reason cellular carriers and the FCC agreed to shut down older 3G networks to make room for 5G.

What are the models affected by the 3G network shutdown in the U.S?

To see obsolete technologies replaced with new ones is something mundane these days and most people saw the demise of the 3G networks years ago. This poses no problems for almost all communication devices that have a short life cycle like mobile phones modems laptops and others. But some devices that rely on Internet communication remain in service for many more years or so they should.Vehicles are one good example with a service life that can span decades. Many are now stuck with a communication technology that no longer exists some of them without any hope to be brought back to life. And we’re not talking about old models but newer ones too with what should’ve been state-of-the-art telematics and assistance systems on board. They will all soon be bricked across the U.S. cut off from the Internet or other services in some cases even safety-related.According to the FCC website  AT&T shut down its 3G network on February 22 with T Mobile next on March 31. Verizon will keep its 3G networks live until December 31 2022. Smaller networks that rely on the bigger ones will see similar timelines for phasing out their 3G communications. Starting 2023 no mobile network in the U.S. would be offering 3G coverage. This affects remote services internet connection and even emergency services alerts in case of accidents for millions of vehicles in the U.S. Acura announced that 3G disappearance means no more AcuraLink Premium (concierge services) AcuraLink Connect (emergency services and remote access to vehicles) or AcuraLink Standard (real-time traffic alerts and maintenance reminders). The models affected are MDX (2014-2017) TLX (2015-2017) ILX RDX (2016-2017) RLX (2014-2016) and NSX (2017). Acura dealers can install a new device for AcuraLink services. Alternatively the owners can opt for a $1500 discount on a new vehicle. Audi vehicles lost all connect services including SOS emergency call features following AT&T's 3G network shutdown. The models affected are 2012–2015 A6 A7 2012–2018 Q7 2012–2018 Q3 A5 A8 2013–2016 Allroad A4 2013–2018 Q5 2014–2016 A3 2016–2018 A3 e-tron 2018 Q5 A8 and 2019 RS5. Audi is offering a 4G modem and a telematics unit installed in the OBD-II port.BMW doesn’t offer a list of affected models but confirms that vehicles equipped with 3G telematics devices will no longer be able to access any ConnectedDrive/BMW Assist services. Even some 4G-enabled vehicles will lose services that require a voice connection such as BMW Assist eCall and Concierge Services. According to BMW certain models will be upgraded for free at the dealers but others will be ineligible. Ford vehicles equipped with a 3G telematics control unit (TCU) will lose MyFord Mobile and MyLincoln Mobile app functionality. These include 2012–2015 Focus 2012–2013 Fusion 2012 Mercury Milan 2012 Lincoln MKZ and 2013 C-Max.General Motors does not offer a list of vehicles but owners can verify their VIN on the dedicated webpage . The 3G network shutdown impacts services in which you need to speak to an OnStar Advisor through the vehicle or the Advisor needs to speak to you in the vehicle. Automatic Crash Response alerts are still operational. GM started pushing over-the-air updates to affected models so that they can work on LTE networks. No hardware installation is required.Hyundai models with BlueLink manufactured between 2012 and 2015 (except Sonata with navigation and Genesis) as well as 2016 Elantra Elantra GT Veloster (without navigation) Sonata Hybrid Santa Fe Equus will see deactivated services including safety and security features. There is no remedy offered. Honda models lost the same services as the Acura models except Honda calls them HondaLink. The affected models are 2018–2020 Accord Touring Odyssey Touring/Elite 2019–2020 Insight Touring 2019–2022 Pilot Touring/Elite/Black Edition and 2019–2021 Passport Touring/Elite. Unlucky owners will have to pay for a new modem or lose all connected services.Every 2016 and 2017 Jaguar Land Rover model is also affected meaning they lose InControl Touch Pro Connected navigation features. All these services will stop working except telematics (InControl Remote and Protect) that will be made to run on T-Mobile’s 2G network. It’s safe to assume that the 2G network will also phase out rather sooner than later. Nissan and Infinity vehicles equipped with 3G modems will lose access to NissanConnect Services NissanConnectfeatures Infiniti InTouch Services and Infiniti Connection features. The affected models are 2016–2017 Altima Maxima Rogue Titan 2016–2018 Sentra 2017–2018 GT-R Rogue Sport 2017 Murano Pathfinder Titan XD 2017–2018 Rogue Sport 2011–2015 Leaf 2014–2018 Infiniti Q50 2017–2018 Infiniti Q60 2013–2018 Infiniti Q70 2017–2019 Infiniti QX30 and 2013–2017 Infiniti JX QX60 QX56 QX80. There is no remedy. Porsche cars like 2014–2018 Panamera 2014 918 Spyder 2015–2019 Cayenne 2017–2018 Macan and 2017–2019 911 will lose all Porsche Car Connect services including Remote Safety and Security services. Some models are eligible for an upgrade so please contact your dealer to see if you’re in luck.Stellantis did not offer a list of affected models but they’re mostly vehicles built before the 2017 model year. Remote services including automatic crash notifications will be permanently disabled even though certain models will be upgraded to 4G. Subaru vehicles will lose Automatic Collision Notification SOS Emergency Assistance Stolen Vehicle Recovery and Remote Features such as locking and unlocking. The models affected are 2016–2018 Forester Legacy Outback Impreza Crosstrek and 2017–2018 WRX WRX STI. There is no remedy unless users installed Subaru’s over-the-air update before February 22. Tesla Model S vehicles built before June 2015 will lose remote services as well as connected services. Tesla offers a modem upgrade but this will cost owners $200. The upgrade can be ordered via the in-vehicle infotainment system.Many Toyota and Lexus vehicles will lose Safety Connect/Enform Safety Connect services starting November 1 2022. Among them are most Lexus cars built between 2012 and 2018 as well as 2011–2017 Sienna 2012–2016 Prius V 2013–2018 Avalon/HV 2012–2014 RAV4 EV 2012–2015 Prius Plug-in 2013–2017 Camry/HV 2016–2017 Mirai 2010–2016 Prius 2014–2018 Highlander/HV 2011–2017 Land Cruiser and 2010–2019 4Runner. There is no remedy. Volkswagen vehicles with a 3G modem will lose all Car-Net telematics services as well as Safe and Secure services and Car-Net Mobile App. The models that will remain without connectivity are 2014–2019 Passat Jetta Eos Tiguan Beetle Golf e-Golf GTI Golf R 2014–2018 CC and 2018–2019 Atlas Arteon. If you have a 2017-2019 Volkswagen vehicle you will have the chance to buy an upgrade starting this fall. All other models (including all e-Golf models) will be permanently disabled.It's sad to see even newer models including some two to three-year-old vehicles that will be left without the smart and safety features . This is even more outrageous when you consider many people bought them because of their connectivity options. And is also plain dumb that automakers built 21st-century cars with 20th-century technology. Everybody should've learned their lesson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbW1hanVua2llLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5L2phbGluLXR1cm5lci12cy1qYW1pZS1tdWxsYXJrZXktdWZjLTI3Mi1waG90by1nYWxsZXJ5LW1tYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jalin Turner def.

A two-time Sambo world champion Nurmagomedov made his pro debut in 2008 and joined the UFC in 2012. The fighter from Dagestan retired 13-0 with the promotion. He beat Al Iaquinta for the UFC lightweight title in 2018 and defended the belt three times. His last fight was a submission win in October 2020 over Justin Gaethje. After the fight he put his gloves in the center of the Octagon cementing his retirement.

One of his memorable rivalries was with Conor McGregor. Nurmagomedov submitted McGregor in 2018 at UFC 229 after months of tension. Before and after the fight there were brawls involving the fighters' teams.

Nurmagomedov holds the UFC record for most takedowns in a single bout with 21 and he landed 59 takedowns second-most in UFC lightweight history. He retired at 29-0 following the death of his father and mentor Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov.

Since retiring Nurmagomedov has been a coach to young fighters including Islam Makhachev and Umar Nurmagomedov. He also is the owner of Eagle Fighting Championship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbW1hanVua2llLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5L2JyeWNlLW1pdGNoZWxsLXZzLWVkc29uLWJhcmJvemEtdWZjLTI3Mi1waG90by1nYWxsZXJ5LW1tYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bryce Mitchell def.

With so much nostalgia suddenly available right on your phone it's no wonder that Delta has become one of the most downloaded apps on the store. And while the emulator itself is fantastic none of these games were intended to be played on your iPhone -- and more specifically with the touchpad. Even the old Game Boy games can feel cramped and cluttered when you are blocking parts of the screen with your thumbs but there are plenty of handy accessories to make your iPhone the perfect platform for Delta games.

The Backbone controller has been around for a few years and is the perfect combination of convenience and quality. It easily slides onto your iPhone and adds two thumbsticks a D-pad four face buttons and two pairs of triggers. It's more than enough for any game you could emulate with Delta. The best part is that it allows you to view your screen with no obstructions so you can fully enjoy your gaming experience.

Having taken down the Leaplasher it's time to focus on the Grimhorn which is weak to Acid and Purgewater so using a combination of these elements will destroy it in no time.

In addition to destroying key parts another great tactic to deploy is tripwire traps as the Grimhorn's charge attack is a prime target for being tripped up.

“The decision to withhold tenure from Hannah-Jones was a warning shot to other journalists and scholars — not just Black women but especially Black women. The power structures of many states will not tolerate freedom of thought or too much success from some kinds of people.” — Siva Vaidhyanathan writing in The Guardian

The term “cancel culture” has been used more and more in our political and social discourse but much like Critical Race Theory (CRT) there is no commonly accepted definition. Was UNC-Chapel Hill withholding tenure from Nikole Hannah-Jones an example? Her 1619 Project a reexamination of America's slave-holding past earned her a Pulitzer Prize but has became a target of conservatives.

Pew Research did a poll asking Americans about cancel culture and its findings were interesting. Nearly half of Americans had heard of the phrase with 64% of those under 30 familiar with it. Liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans were the most familiar with the term. But they defined it differently.

More:Jack Bernard: In NC and the U.S. thoughts and prayers not enough to stop gun violence

The majority of Democrats tended to see it as meaning “actions taken to hold others accountable” whereas only 36% of Republican conservatives believed that was accurate. And more than a quarter of GOP respondents saw it negatively as “censorship of speech or history.” Relatively large percentages of Republicans also believed that it meant “canceling anyone they disagreed with” “mean-spirited actions meant to cause others harm” and “an attack on traditional American society.”

Conservatives have tried to say that only progressives employ cancel culture. However specific examples of “cancel culture” abound in both the liberal and conservative spheres. A good example is the major GOP effort to stop Critical Race Theory a college-level theory that examines racism's systemic impacts.

Unfortunately many school districts are defining CRT as any mention of slavery and the harm that it has brought to our nation and its minority citizens. Harm that continues to this day in the form of poor educational status health and economic well-being for African Americans. Ironically these school districts in primarily red states want our teachers to ignore historical facts i.e. engage in “censorship of speech or history.”

But the best example on the right is the censoring of history regarding the 1-6-21 insurrection that took place at the Capitol and was meant to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump. Trump and his followers have successfully convinced the majority of Republicans that the riot which injured 140 law enforcement officers was simply a peaceful protest.

On the left there have also been cancel culture initiatives. Comedian Dave Chappelle was heavily criticized when he made some intemperate remarks about transsexuals in a 2021 Netflix special. A few years ago comedian Kevin Hart homophobic tweets got him into trouble.

Whoopi Goldberg was suspended for two weeks from The View after making ignorant remarks about Jews and the Holocaust. Spotify talk show star Joe Rogan was caught repeatedly using the “n-word” on past shows. Many liberals called for his removal.

More:Jack Bernard: Yes Sen. Burr voluntary vaccinations are better than masks ... but

And then there was the tempest in a teapot about Senator Al Franken’s sophomoric photo ogling a woman. Although he did nothing illegal he was driven out of office by feminists in the Senate and elsewhere.

Each “cancel culture” instance is different and unique. Sometimes “cancel culture” actions are warranted. Other times they are not.

We must remember that we are all people. And people are fallible. Some transgressions are minor and forgivable. Others like the assaults on teaching race relations and democracy not so much. The key is distinguishing one from the other.

In 2021 the pharmaceuticals sector reported the third highest average cost of a data breach among all industries behind healthcare and financial services.

Over the past 12 months the digital threat landscape has evolved significantly with COVID-19 being used as common bait to deposit ransomware in networks.

The pharmaceutical industry possesses sensitive information such as R&D data patents and patient information making them a prime target for hackers. Unauthorised access to sensitive information has threatful implications including loss of public trust stolen intellectual property and significant revenue losses.

The Cost of Pharma Data Breaches

Cybersecurity breaches inflict huge costs on pharmaceutical companies. Estimates from 2020 place the average cost of an attack at US $5.06 million which is 1.3 times the global average.

Apart from the monetary aspect cybersecurity breaches can disrupt clinical trials which can prove even more expensive. To avoid this companies need to map out what data is held how it is processed and what regulations if any should be met when handling clinical data. Any digital platform implemented by pharmaceutical companies to improve the patient experience or the efficiency of business operations must be integrated with stringent data protection measures to ensure the security of personal health information.

Protecting Patient Data is Imperative

With accelerated digitalisation brought on by the pandemic there is heightened risk of cyber-attacks particularly in the pharmaceutical sector. Pharmaceutical companies are looking for ways to safeguard patient data as well as commercially valuable information such as patents and intellectual property. Leveraging new technologies can help pharmaceutical companies protect patient data and minimise their vulnerability to cyber-attacks. This coupled with solutions that encrypt sensitive data and enable early threat detection can build confidence within the public around the use processing and storage of their personal health information.

What Makes Pharma a Prime Target?

There are a couple of reasons why cyber-criminals find the pharmaceutical industry a tempting target.

1. Patient data can be sold online

Pharmaceutical companies handle personal health information from clinical trial participants including medical histories laboratory results biometric information and more. All of this is valuable to hackers. Medical identity theft can lead to spurious medical claims or cyber-criminals opening new lines of credit and accessing insurance details.

2. There is more medical data available digitally today than ever before

In the digital era there are many sources through which personal health information is being collected. This includes electronic medical records clinical trials fitness apps and wearable devices. Despite concerns regarding data confidentiality the popularity of smart devices and wearables continues to grow.

How the Pharma Industry is Protecting Patient Data

With the amount of data generated globally expected to reach a trillion gigabytes by 2025 governments are recognising the need to protect patient data which includes the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Several emerging technologies can help pharmaceutical companies safeguard data. Blockchain for example can better manage data collected from clinical trials encrypt patient data and prevent unauthorised access to identifiable information.

Pharmaceutical giants and academic institutions are already testing blockchain to manage supply chain challenges and clinical trials. Blockchain offers transparency and traceability of information. Several industry-led initiatives are already underway to convince regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the viability of implementing blockchain for clinical trial management.

The digitalisation of life sciences has led to the industry becoming increasingly more data-rich. While digitalisation has the potential to drive sustained growth and create new value streams loopholes in cybersecurity protocols can result in unauthorised access to research corporate and patient data of commercial value. Additionally a lack of compliance with security standards and regulations can lead to substantial fines amounting to millions of dollars. To this end progress is already underway with organisations investing in encryption and intrusion prevention systems. Ultimately digital solutions must leverage cutting-edge technologies along with total cybersecurity compliance to drive sustained growth without compromising the security of patient data.

Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

For the last six weeks I’ve been using Full Self-Driving (Beta) both for local and long-distance driving — virtually all the time. I will often repeatedly push the software to the limit when I know it would be too slow for a regular driver or where it has failed previously. As time goes on I continually observe new behavior.

In Part 1 I summarized all of the fabulous things that FSD (Beta) does for the driver as well as what it takes to get it and keep it. Here in Part 2 I relate the shortcomings and failures of the software.

When is FSD (Beta) Too Slow/Timid?

At one-way or two-way stop signs FSD (Beta) creeps forward so slowly that it’s not useful for normal driving. However if you signal it to proceed with the accelerator it will proceed straight ahead or steer the turn correctly depending on your route. FSD (Beta) stops at the entry to a rotary even when no cars are present. Again a little pressure on the accelerator solves the problem. Ironically the behavior at a 4-way stop is generally better and it proceeds more quickly. I think this is because it doesn’t have to look out for cross traffic.

Phantom Braking

You can be driving on perfectly clear roadway and FSD (Beta) will occasionally do regenerative (mild) braking for no apparent reason. Sometimes on the Interstate you will get this mild braking for a large vehicle approaching or a large vehicle or trailer parked near your lane.

I’ve never had hard braking and I keep my foot lightly on the accelerator so that I can compensate for unwanted braking. [Editor’s note: I’ve gotten very hard phantom braking on residential roads.]

Phantom braking is worse with FSD (Beta) than it is with standard smart cruise control. I assume this is because the software is now looking for more things in your lane and it misidentifies some objects. [Editor’s note: My thought was that it was because the Autopilot suite changed from using the car’s radar as well as cameras to only using cameras but perhaps Fritz is right or partially right.]

When Do I Turn Off FSD?

Notice I said FSD not FSD (Beta). On limited access roads FSD will pass slower moving vehicles and make automatic lane changes. FSD will almost always change lanes promptly for a slow-moving vehicle. However it does not reliably exit the passing lane even when specified in the settings. FSD will also make frequent lane changes on multilane freeways for no scrutable reason. For this reason I usually turn off Auto Navigation on multilane freeways and make the turns semi-manually. I use the turn signal to initiate the turn because I know that with multiple cameras it knows better than I do when it is safe to change lanes.

When Do I Turn Off FSD (Beta)?

I turn off FSD (Beta) when making a turn or crossing a road with high traffic where there is no traffic light. Afterwards I immediately turn FSD (Beta) back on again.

Where Does FSD (Beta) Fail Completely?

Note: These failures are consistent so I know when to disable the software and drive manually. Some may be caused by errors in the database. However in item #1 it can see the stop signs — which I know because they are visualized for me — but it apparently doesn’t use the visual distance information to calculate position accurately.

At some stop signs it will stop 10 or 15 feet too early. (This may have improved slightly since V10.5.)

it will stop 10 or 15 feet too early. (This may have improved slightly since V10.5.) There is one stop sign turning from 1650 W onto Snow Canyon Parkway in Saint George Utah where FSD (Beta) will always run the stop sign. Oh my! Note: this is the only stop sign where I have seen this behavior.

Right Lane Bias: Exiting from I-15 at 1600 N in Orem Utah 1600 N street narrows from two lanes to one lane at a stoplight. FSD (Beta) will consistently not just fail to make the merge but will actively put the car in wrong (righthand) lane. Recently I saw the same behavior in another location.

FSD (Beta) will consistently not just fail to make the merge but will actively put the car in wrong (righthand) lane. Recently I saw the same behavior in another location. Right Lane Bias: When making a turn or going across an intersection your car will sometimes turn into a bike lane or other wide lane on the right. It will find the correct land after ~50 ft.

When making a turn or going across an intersection your car will sometimes turn into a bike lane or other wide lane on the right. It will find the correct land after ~50 ft. Right Side Bias: Particularly on a freeway merge when the lane is still double width your car will cling to the white line on the right. This is unnerving because a normal driver will tend toward the left hand dotted white line where you need to be when the merge is complete. Note: This also occurs with regular Tesla Autosteer.

This is unnerving because a normal driver will tend toward the left hand dotted white line where you need to be when the merge is complete. Note: This also occurs with regular Tesla Autosteer. Parking Lot Behavior: You can engage FSD (Beta) in the Walmart or UPS parking lot but good luck having it actually find its way out. In tight quarters the steering wheel will jiggle and jerk like a Nervous Nellie and it’s as likely to find its way into a blind corner as it is find its way out. [Editor’s note: I have never played with FSD in such circumstances so this is especially interesting to read.]

Improvements Going from V10.5 to V10.8 to V10.10

One of the great things about Tesla is that you get over-the-air software updates as frequently as once every two weeks. I have seen several significant improvements in the 2 years and 4 months (and over 60000 miles) that I have owned and driven my Model 3. With FSD (Beta) one hopes that regular updates will fix problems and we can dream that Elon Musk is correct and that we are on a path sooner rather than later to full Level 5 autonomy that is safer than human drivers and doesn’t need to be monitored.

Reading the release notes for V10.10 it lists 8 areas that have been improved and gives the percentage of improvement to be expected. I must say that I have seen little improvement from V10.5 to V10.10 in the things that I feel are most important. The one significant improvement area is that it no longer brakes for cross traffic that will be gone before you reach the spot.

Can You Report Bad Behavior to Tesla?

There is a small camera ikon at the top of the screen. If you have a situation where the software fails consistently you can push the ikon and send a short video clip from the cameras to Tesla. I have done this a few times but have seen no change in behavior. In other cases with traffic you are so busy intervening you don’t have time to push on the camera ikon.

Comments/Your Experiences

I have listed the things I have observed in the 6 weeks I have been rigorously testing FSD (Beta). Please get back to me in the comments section if your experience has been different and also if you have seen any behavior that I haven’t observed myself.

Tesla electric vehicles including the Model 3 Model X and the Model Y all have a current 5 Star Euro NCAP safety rating the highest score.

“At Tesla we’re deeply committed to safety which is why we engineered Model 3 to be the safest car ever built. In the U.S. Model 3 has already earned an overall 5-star rating from NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) including earning 5-stars in every category and sub-category and scoring the lowest probability of injury of any car ever evaluated by the U.S. New Car Assessment Program.” — Tesla stated in 2019.

Tesla Model S

Tesla Model S was introduced on June 2012 and its efficiency has been improved since then. The first version needed 38 kWh of energy to travel 100 miles and now it can do it with only 28 kWh with 405 miles of range.

During 2021 Tesla sold in U.S. around 150k units of Model 3 186k Model Y and 23.7k Model S/X  totalling 360916 units.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdWJzY3JpYmVyL3Rlc2xhLWlzLW9wZW5pbmctaXRzLWZpcnN0LXR1Y3Nvbi1kZWFsZXJzaGlwLWFuZC1zZXJ2aWNlLWNlbnRlci9hcnRpY2xlXzk4ZmY0MTk0LTk4YzQtMTFlYy05Y2VhLWZiM2EyYTk2ZGViZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla is opening its first Tucson dealership and service center,"Tesla Motors will open its first electric vehicle dealership and service center in Tucson this summer as supply-chain and production issues have slowed deliveries of EVs to a trickle nationwide.

The site at 5001 N. Oracle Road near River Road is about 30000 square feet of showroom and service center with a price tag of about $5 million city of Tucson building records show.

A sign hanging on the chain link fence around the construction site announced Tesla’s pending arrival.

In 2020 Tesla dissolved its public relations department and there is no mechanism for communication with the media. Getting the company’s comment on why it chose to open a Tucson dealership was not possible.

Stephen Grimm owner of the shopping center Keystone Fiesta Plaza and general contractor Blue Lion Construction said completion is expected this summer.

The architect is G Squared Architecture.

The showroom will have Tesla Models S 3 X and Y and the Cybertruck.

Teslas are sold mainly by pre-order with delivery waits now ranging from six to nine months depending on the model.

EV shortage

The opening of the dealership comes as most shoppers now will have trouble finding any new EVs to buy and drive off Tucson dealer lots.

Popular lower-priced EVs like the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Bolt were out of stock last week and at most dealers nationwide with delivery delays stretching into months for the Leaf and later this year for the Bolt due to a safety recall.

Automakers blame supply-chain issues related to the pandemic and a shortage of semiconductor computer chips which has also delayed production and deliveries of some gas-powered cars and trucks.

David Gebert president of the Tucson Electric Vehicle Association said EVs have been in short supply at local dealerships for the past year.

“It’s all (because of) supply-chain stuff” said Gebert whose group offers tips to EV newbies. “There’s really nothing for them to sell.”

Volkswagen acknowledged struggling to meet demand for the ID.4 all-electric SUV and it didn’t help that a U.S.-bound cargo ship carrying more than 1500 Volkswagen Group vehicles including ID.4s Audis and Porsches caught fire and sunk off last week off the coast of Portugal.

Larry H. Miller Volkswagen in Tucson does not currently have any ID.4’s on the lot and the dealership is taking orders for the vehicle with a delivery wait of about nine to 11 months company spokeswoman Sara Waldman said.

Meanwhile sports-car enthusiasts looking to buy a Ford Mustang Mach-E the all-electric version of the iconic muscle car are facing a delivery delay of 20 to 28 weeks Ford says.

Demand high

Hot demand for EVs also is a factor driven nationally by mandates to move to “zero emission vehicles” adopted by a dozen states including California.

Sales of new light-duty plug-in electric vehicles including all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electrics nearly doubled to 608000 in 2021 according to the U.S. Energy Department and some analysts predict EV sales could nearly double again in 2022.

After getting nearly 200000 purchase reservations for its new F-150 Lightning electric truck Ford began taking orders for the Lightning in January.

The automaker says it plans to begin deliveries this spring though it may not be able to fill all pre-orders this year. The Lightning starts at about $40000 and can top $90000 with all the options.

The Leaf is the lowest-priced production EV in the U.S. starting at $27500 for a shorter-range model.

But last summer Nissan halted production of the 2022 Leaf at its Tennessee manufacturing plant for at least six weeks due to chip shortages and it has also delayed the rollout of its new EV the Ariya.

And special circumstances have prompted shortages of two other popular EVs.

General Motors halted production of its Chevy Bolt EV and EUV — a sport-utility version — last fall to devote production to replacing battery packs on about 140000 2019-2021 Bolts involved in a safety recall after a series of battery fires.

GM recently said it would restart 2022 Bolt EV and EUV production in April when sales of new Bolts also are expected to resume.

Looking ahead GM plans to launch several new EVs by the end of 2023 including the Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV a Chevrolet Silverado EV pickup and a Chevrolet Equinox compact SUV.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZWxvbi1tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItdXNlcnMtcmVxdWVzdC1kZWFjdGl2YXRlLXRlc2xhLXJ1c3NpYS0yMDIyLTPSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2Vsb24tbXVzay10d2l0dGVyLXVzZXJzLXJlcXVlc3QtZGVhY3RpdmF0ZS10ZXNsYS1ydXNzaWEtMjAyMi0zP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk asked by Twitter users to deactivate all Teslas in Russia,"Elon Musk has not responded to any of the requests. Jae C. Hong/AP

Elon Musk has received several requests to turn off all Teslas in Russia amid the Ukraine invasion.

Twitter users called for the move saying it could act as a ""tech embargo"" for Russia's actions.

""It's absolutely disgusting what Russia is doing and Putin has to be stopped"" one user wrote.

A small but impassioned group of Twitter users are urging Elon Musk to deactivate all Teslas in Russia.

The calls come in the wake of the country's continuing attack on Ukraine which began on February 24.

In a series of tweets to the tech mogul several users asked Musk to ""turn off every single Tesla in Russia.""

One said: ""Please turn off and deactivate all Tesla's in Russia. It's absolutely disgusting what Russia is doing and Putin has to be stopped.""

Another requested the deactivation as a sort of ""tech embargo"" on Russia.

Musk however is yet to respond to the requests. Tesla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

Since Russia conducted a ""special military operation"" on Ukraine Musk has been helping Ukrainians by providing them with internet access. Refugees can also access free charging for both Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles in neighboring countries.

Last week the SpaceX founder said he was providing Ukraine with the Starlink satellite service after the military action disrupted internet service across the country.

Musk responded to a request from a Ukrainian government official for Starlink saying it ""is now active in Ukraine"" with ""more terminals en route.""

""We hope that this helps give you the peace of mind to get to a safe location"" Tesla wrote in the email Electrek reported.

Seasoned Tesla Owners Compare EVs,"Ben Sullins and his wife Jennie spend some time with the all-new Kia EV6. They compare it to the Tesla Model Y which is obviously its most important rival. After spending a week with the EV6 the Sullins also let us know if they'd consider owning one.

Before we go on we think it's important to talk just a bit about our friend Ben. Sullins has been covering Tesla for years. In fact he was arguably one of the first movers when it came to Tesla YouTube influencers. He's owned several Teslas he supports the company as a whole and he's objective and insightful.

Not too long ago Sullins decided to revamp his channel focus less on Tesla and shed light on other EVs as well as products and topics related to green energy. During this sort of ""departure"" from being a ""hardcore Tesla fanboy"" in the eyes of many in the community it seems Ben has grown a bit frustrated with Tesla.

Some would say Sullins has opened his eyes to some of the obvious issues surrounding the company and he's just being honest. However sadly others have instead chosen to harass him on social media call him out and suggest he's now a sellout a Tesla hater a short seller etc.

Despite any of the above we appreciate Ben's coverage today AND we appreciated his coverage years ago. Regardless of whether it's pro-Tesla or it points out Tesla's flaws or whether it focuses on Tesla or its rivals or really whatever the topic Ben is certainly striving to provide compelling content. He has a lot of solid insight he's entitled to his opinions and his list of Tesla's pros and cons are arguably valid in many cases.

At any rate the reason we decided to feature the Sullins' comparison of the Tesla Model Y and Kia EV6 really boils down to all of the above. Ben has a storied perspective here. While an ""early"" Ben Sullins may have praised the Model Y up and down and not even considered a Kia EV for a single second today's Ben Sullins may actually give the EV6 credit where credit is due.

We all grow and mature from our life experiences hopefully in a positive rather than a negative way. We are allowed to develop new opinions change our minds and denounce things we once believed or claimed were true. If we have evidence – especially from personal experiences – to support our change of opinion and/or why we transitioned or matured in the way that we did it can arguably work as validation.

With all of that said we could now proceed to write paragraph after paragraph about how the Kia EV6 stacks up to the Tesla Model Y but we aren't Ben or Jennie Sullins and we don't have the life experiences they have. If our little soapbox talk about Ben Sullins made you want to watch the video to see exactly what he thinks – so you can either argue with his opinions or agree with him – then fantastic.

If you don't want to watch because Ben might say something negative about the Model Y (and in your personal opinion it may or may not be true) then don't watch. It really is entirely up to you just like it's entirely up to Ben how he feels about the Kia EV6 and the Tesla Model Y. And Sullins' perspective is just one of many we chose to share on InsideEVs.

We will tell you that both Ben and Jennie have different opinions about various aspects of the EV6 and Model Y. They also both praise the EV6 in some areas and the Model Y in others.

This is not a comparison in which one car simply dominates and makes the other car look bad but rather if you could combine the Kia's strengths with the Tesla's strengths you would arguably have the perfect electric crossover. There's a whole lot to like about the EV6 and Model Y and both could certainly stand to improve in a few ways.

If you did decide to watch we'd love to read your takeaways in the comment section below. We'd love to know what you think of the EV6 and why? We'd also appreciate your opinions about the Model Y. Or you can just fill up the comment section arguing about ""What's up with Ben?"" As we said it's up to you."

We Asked the Experts in CRE and Economic Development,"Expert Views: How Dallas-Fort Worth Punches Above Its Weight in Commercial Real Estate Dallas-Fort Worth is a contender—not only nationally but on the global stage. Here's what real estate and economic development leaders have to say about the region's 'X factors.'

Whether you’re putting the past two years under a microscope or using a telescope to envision what’s ahead the Dallas-Fort Worth region has shown a tough resilience during the pandemic. We’ve also been presented with the kinds of opportunities that can mark an inflection point for North Texas. Through it all companies continue to seek out Dallas-Fort Worth to relocate or expand their businesses. Investors are choosing to back projects here because they know an investment in DFW is a good one.

In other words we’re a contender—not only nationally but on the global stage.

In fact the region has joined Los Angeles Chicago and New York in the upper echelon of the nation’s commercial real estate markets. That didn’t happen overnight. It’s been a determined steady rise for Dallas-Fort Worth as economic development experts CRE leaders and others have worked for decades to raise the region’s profile attract investment and create the kinds of environments that will attract corporate headquarters and an ever-growing workforce.

To use a boxing analogy Bill Sproull says “There’s no doubt that we’re punching above our class.”

It ‘staggers the mind’

The number of people and companies moving to North Texas “staggers the mind” says Sproull an innovation-led economic development expert in DFW.

He believes that Dallas-Fort Worth leads the nation in terms of all the regions that have emerged from the pandemic the quickest and regained the jobs that were lost.

We also lead the nation in the percentage of office workers who have gone back to the office says Sproull who most recently served as the leader of Tech Titans and helmed the Richardson Economic Development Partnership for more than 17 years.

The Kastle Back to Work Barometer which measures 10 U.S. metros by building occupancy using access data from Kastle-secured properties shows Dallas and other Texas cities continue to lead the nation as of February 28.

“That doesn’t mean they’re in the office 24/7 365” Sproull says. “But think about that in terms of the commercial real estate industry: It’s an in-person industry.”

The combination of the momentum we have in Dallas-Fort Worth—the companies and people moving here—added to the fact that we lead the nation in the percentage of office workers back to the office “really does allow us to punch above our weight class” he says.

It’s part of our culture of success: “People believe in the value of work here” Sproull says. “To me that’s always spoken volumes about the way that CEOs regard the productivity of people in this market. They’re just hard workers.”

He says CEOs consistently rank Texas high in surveys saying “I’m choosing North Texas in this market for what they do.”

Sproull who moved back to DFW some 25 years ago remembers one of the Dallas Observer’s “Best of Dallas” stories: “The lead was really funny and it struck me just having come back to Texas but the writer said ‘Dallas is a business town with no natural beauty and a lot of attitude.’”

Yes says Sproull “There is an attitude here. We find a way to succeed.”

What makes DFW great

Robert Sturns who leads economic development efforts for the city of Fort Worth is also impressed by the energy in Dallas-Fort Worth as a whole.

“Whether we’re punching above our weight or we’re just hitting our aspirational goal” he says “there’s a lot of excitement.”

“We’ve done a really good job across Dallas-Fort Worth of diversifying industries looking at life sciences and biotech and expanding technology efforts.”

ROBERT STURNS

Everyone thought COVID-19 would slow things to a crawl he says. But “it’s probably busier now than we were before the pandemic.”

Sturns thinks our “historical base has been growing and we’ve done a really good job across Dallas-Fort Worth of diversifying industries looking at life sciences and biotech and expanding technology efforts.”

Sturns and Sproull are among a group of economic development and commercial real estate experts that we invited to share their thoughts about what factors into our success what’s trending and where we’re headed in our recent DALLAS® Commerical Real Estate magazine.

These experts examine the positives and the negatives: What makes DFW great? What challenges must the region overcome as it continues its ascent to greater prosperity and a more prominent place in the nation’s commercial real estate establishment?

Alan Shor co-founder and president of The Retail Connection sums it up: “DFW can take advantage of the current CRE trends and influence them. There’s no stronger market in the industrial multifamily retail or office categories.”

How DFW Punches Above Its Weight in Commercial Real Estate

Read on for what leaders in the region had to say about our Dallas-Fort Worth ‘X factors’ as a whole and across sectors:

Bill Burton

Hillwood

People underestimate the size and diversity of the North Texas economy. The GDP for North Texas is approximately $615 billion and the GDP for the State of Texas is around $1.7 trillion. If we treated North Texas as a state it would be the ninth-largest economy in the United States. As a country North Texas would be the 24th largest economy in the world.

Finance insurance healthcare technology manufacturing and energy are all major industries in the region. Combine the strength and diversity of North Texas with a favorable tax policy affordable housing significant investment in infrastructure a highly skilled workforce and a government that helps business grow and you begin to understand why DFW is a popular place for people to move and companies to flourish.

Brad Gibson

HALL Group

Here are three top factors:

Geographical location. The Dallas region is centrally located and has an ease of accessibility for domestic and international travel. Talent. The talent pool in the Dallas region is among the best in the country with multiple universities locally and a draw for graduates who return to the area after attending other prestigious universities. Taxes. The environment is friendly to corporations resulting in savings specifically around taxes and ease of doing business.

Jason Ford

Frisco EDC

DFW’s central location and lower costs (lower than coastal cities) makes it very attractive as companies realign their footprints. Mobile talent is also flocking to North Texas because lifestyles improve as money goes further here.

From a local perspective Frisco is a city that takes a common-sense approach to public planning business continuity public health and safety. We have long advocated for heavy green space in mixed-use developments. Today that’s a very-high demand amenity for residents companies and employees seeking healthy workspaces and engaging outdoor environments.





Kim Buttram

Mesquite EDC

Here are five top factors:

Location. We’re lucky to be in the center of the continental U.S. Accessible. Land availability and competitive cost of doing business; access to workforce talent on all sides and of all skill levels. Workforce. Companies go where the people are. Our population explosion naturally attracts the need for additional products and services plus companies want to be where the talent is. Supply chain. Close proximity to suppliers services and related industry. Business-friendly environment. Freedom to do business without over-regulating policies.

Keri Samford

The Colony EDC

When it comes to the factors companies evaluate for expansion or relocation the Dallas region continues to rank high in all areas including having a central location in the U.S. for

distribution and market access a diverse and well-educated workforce a pro-business environment with low taxes and a high quality of life with excellent communities.

Steve Williamson



Land parcels in DFW are now commanding the highest sale prices on record.

New development for all product types but especially for industrial and residential projects literally exploded in the last half of 2021. The unprecedented levels of new development throughout the region will continue to drive increases in land prices in 2022. All product types for land are in great demand but particularly land that’s already zoned for industrial multifamily and townhomes.

Beth Bowman

Irving EDC

Our region is rich in offering a variety of communities that can serve the many needs of companies looking to expand or find a new place to call home. We can serve a multitude of needs—from industrial to e-commerce—and we also offer an attractive location for employees searching for affordability and job opportunities which are abundant because of our continued growth.

Alan Shor

DFW has been—and will continue to be—one of the fastest-growing MSAs in the country with announcements almost monthly about businesses relocating or opening major regional offices here. The region is predicted to add more than 1.7 million residents in the next seven to eight years making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. A great example of DFW’s population growth is the 380 corridor—literally thousands of homes are planned north of 380. Coupled with the explosive growth in the communities of North McKinney Prosper Celina and Little Elm—and the transformative PGA HQ Development—the 380 corridor is one of the hottest submarkets in the country.

Nationally there’s a “buy America” resurgence particularly in the semiconductor industry. In North Texas you can look at Texas Instruments’ plans for its new fab plants in Sherman and its continued expansion in Richardson. They can’t wait to get the equipment in there and start producing. Next door to them is Qorvo which is expanding. That kind of advanced manufacturing plays very well here in the Dallas area.

Watch the “buy America” trend: I think a lot of that will be tied into the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA). It opens a door to more opportunity.

North Texas especially the DFW MSA is a highly sought-after market for hospitality investors. I’ve seen a huge influx of out-of-state investors moving into North Texas and a growing number of first-time buyers getting into the hotel industry. Low corporate travel is going to continue to be a challenge for certain corporate-driven markets. On the contrary non-urban core hotels especially interstate and some secondary-tertiary markets here actually performed better in 2021 than pre-pandemic comparisons and are expected to continue the same trend in 2022 thus presenting some opportunities for investors.

Dallas-Fort Worth has become the epicenter of growth in North America. We’re in the middle of a population boom that has led to the region outperforming other markets in terms of job creation and growth as well as the demand for all types of CRE.

In terms of the multifamily boom we’re seeing now: population growth and migration trends business-friendly environment relative affordability compared to coastal markets and sustained levels of rent growth are forecasted.

So many factors contribute to making DFW the greatest economic region on the globe. Let’s start with net migration. Almost 400 per day are moving to DFW. More people equates to the need for more housing warehousing retail and office space. Secondly the ease and cost of doing business. We are the catcher’s mitt for the vast majority of corporate relocations due to being a less regulated and taxed state coupled with a low cost of living for their employees. Almost daily you read of a new company leaving California or New York to move their HQ to DFW. Factor in we are the epicenter for the Central part of the United States from a logistics standpoint. There is a reason we have over 1 billion square feet of industrial inventory in DFW. Interstates world-class airports and railroads all lead to DFW.

It’s almost corporate malfeasance for a C-level executive at a Fortune 500 publicly traded company in San Francisco or New York not to be considering or studying a potential move. Dallas-Fort Worth is usually at the top of that list because:

Businesses can generally save 20% on overall costs by making the move from California to DFW

Combined federal and state corporate taxes total 28% in California and 21% in Texas

On average an employer in the Bay Area can save about 15% to 20% in annual payroll costs by moving to DFW

The San Francisco typical home value is $1.38M and the average apartment rent is more than $3000 per month

In DFW the average cost of purchasing a home is about $350000 and apartment rent is $1200 mo

Sprague Dawley rats (4 weeks old) were obtained from the Animal Center of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine and were housed in standard laboratory rooms under controlled conditions. All animal experiments were performed according to international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the Experimental Animal Committee of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. BMSCs were extracted and cultured according to our previously described protocol24. Briefly bone marrow plugs were extracted from the bones of the hind legs of the rats and the cells were centrifuged and resuspended twice in complete medium (Cyagen Biosciences Santa Clara CA USA). Subsequently 5 × l08 cells in 9 mL of complete medium were transferred to 100-mm culture dishes. Three days later the medium was refreshed and only adherent cells were maintained in complete medium supplemented with glucose and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA) until treatment with erastin (MedChemExpress Monmouth Junction NJ USA).

Lentivirus overexpression and knockdown experiments

A lentiviral vector (lenti dCAS-VP64) harboring the green fluorescence protein (GFP) coding sequence was used to stably express NSUN5 in BMSCs. We obtained Nsun5 from a different vector and then inserted the sequence into the lenti dCAS-VP64 vector along with the GFP from pLVX-AcGFP along with one containing a scrambled sequence as a negative control for the overexpression experiments (lenti-dCas9-Vp64-AcGFP). A total of 5 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated for 12 h. At 50% confluence the cells were infected with either lenti-dCas9-Vp64-NSUN5-AcGFP (NSUN5 overexpression group) or lenti-dCas9-Vp64-AcGFP (negative control group) or not infected. The cells were incubated for 24 h before the medium was replaced with virus-free medium. Three days later the infection efficiency was evaluated based on GFP signal intensity and the cells were harvested for western blot and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses. For the knockdown experiments BMSCs were transfected with siRNAs targeting NSUN5 and TRAP1. The siRNAs were designed and synthesized by RiboBio (Guangzhou China).

C11-BODIPY 581/591 assay

The C11-BODIPY assay was used to characterize the degree of lipid peroxidation as previously described [38 39]. BMSCs were first incubated in basal medium without (control) or with erastin (20 μM) for 12 h and then with C11-BODIPY (2.5 μM Molecular Probes Carlsbad CA USA) for 30 min. The cells were observed and imaged under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) or analyzed using flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter CA USA).

Measurement of intracellular iron concentrations

To measure intracellular iron concentrations BMSCs were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. After allowing them to adhere for 24 h the cells were divided into groups as in the C11-BODIPY assay. The iron concentration was quantified using the QuantiChrom Iron Assay Kit (Bioassay Systems Hayward CA USA) and the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in the presence of the chromogen was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 590 nm using a spectrophotometer (BioTek VT USA).

Measurement of ROS levels

To measure ROS production BMSCs were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 12-well plates. After allowing them to adhere for 24 h the cells were divided into groups as in the C11-BODIPY assay. The cells were incubated with 10 μM DCF-DA (Molecular Probes) and ROS levels were determined using flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter).

RT-qPCR

NSUN5 transcript levels were evaluated using RT-qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from BMSCs using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA purity and concentration were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 and 260 nm using a NanoDrop-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA). The RNA was converted into cDNA using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers for amplifying NSUN5 Trap1 Fth1 Ftl and beta-actin were obtained from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai China). The sequences of the primers used are shown in Supplementary Table 1. qPCR was performed in a LightCycler 480 II instrument (Roche Applied Science Basel Switzerland) using a SYBR Green Master Mix.

Western blot

Proteins were extracted from BMSCs using RIPA lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma MO USA). Proteins (30 µg) were separated on precast 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad USA) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Sigma USA) by semi-dry blotting. After blocking with 5% skim milk the cells were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies targeting NSUN5 (Proteintech IL USA) FTH1 FTL β-actin 5mC (Abcam Cambridge MA USA) or DDX25 (Santa Cruz CA USA). The next day the membranes were incubated with an horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore MA USA).

Fluorescence immunocytochemistry

BMSCs were fixed in 4% formalin washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding was blocked using serum-supplemented antibody dilution buffer for 30 min. Immunofluorescence labeling was performed using monoclonal antibodies against NSUN5 TRAP1 FTH1 and FTL diluted 1:100 in 5% goat serum. After incubation for 12 h the cells were rinsed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 Alexa Fluor 555 Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor 647; Abcam). After counterstaining with DAPI and washing the cells were imaged using a confocal microscope.

RNA immunoprecipitation assay

RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) was performed using the Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Merck Millipore Billerica MA USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly cultured BMSCs were collected and lysed in RIP lysis buffer. Thewhole-cell extracts were incubated with RIP buffer containing magnetic beads cross-linked with antibodies targeting NSUN5 5mC or control IgG at 4 °C for 8 h. The beads were washed and the complexes were incubated with proteinase K and SDS at 55 °C for 30 min to remove proteins. Co-precipitated RNAs were amplified using RT-qPCR.

Dot blot assay

RNA was diluted to 200 100 50 and 4 ng/µL. Nitrocellulose membranes were predipped in methyl alcohol and a dot blot apparatus was used to spot the RNA onto the membranes. Approximately 200 100 50 and 4 ng of RNA was probed to measure 5mC modification levels. The RNA was cross-linked to the membranes using ultraviolet irradiation and the membranes were incubated with blocking solution followed by an anti-5mC antibody diluted in blocking buffer and then an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence.

Methylation analysis by bisulfite sequencing

Total RNA was extracted from BMSCs and purified using an RNA extraction kit (Zymo Research Irvine CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was treated with bisulfite and PCR was performed under the following conditions: predenaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s 60 °C for 40 s and 72 °C for 40 s with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The methylation status of the Fth1 and Ftl genes was qualitatively analyzed using gel electrophoresis (1× TAE) and methylation-specific PCR gene sequencing and direct bisulfite sequencing. The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Co-immunoprecipitation assay

Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was performed using the Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly BMSCs were collected from culture plates and lysed in co-IP lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 13000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The extracted proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 12 h with magnetic beads cross-linked with nonspecific mouse IgG (5 mg) or anti-NSUN5/Trap1 antibodies and treated with coupling buffer. After magnetic separation the precipitates were washed the proteins were eluted and neutralized and western blotting and silver staining were performed according to standard protocols.

Silver staining assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometric analysis

Co-IP products were analyzed using vertical gel electrophoresis on 12.5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gels at 300 V for 45 min. The gels were subjected to silver staining and sent to BGI Technology Co. Ltd for analysis by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS).

Statistical analysis

Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Data were expressed as means ± standard deviation and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v7.0 (GraphPad Software La Jolla CA USA) or SPSS v19.0 (SPSS Inc Chicago IL USA). The Student’s t test was used to compare means between two groups and a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcGFyYXNpdGVzYW5kdmVjdG9ycy5iaW9tZWRjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4xMTg2L3MxMzA3MS0wMjItMDUyMDMtetIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phylogenetic relationship between the endosymbiont “Candidatus Riesia pediculicola” and its human louse host ...,"Lice selection and DNA extraction

From among the human lice collection of the IHU Mediterannée Infection laboratory we selected 126 head and body lice that had been collected from around the world to perform the molecular study (Additional file 1: Table S1). These specimens had been collected in dry tubes transported to our laboratory and frozen at − 20 °C for subsequent analysis. Prior to DNA extraction each louse was externally decontaminated as previously reported [20]. Each specimen was cut longitudinally and one half was frozen for subsequent analysis. DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit (QIAamp Tissue Kit; Qiagen Hilden Germany) using the EZ1 instrument in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.

Lice genotypic status

Haplogroup identification using qPCR assays

To identify the lice mt clades DNA samples were subjected to clade-specific quantitative duplex real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting a portion of the cytb gene [21]. Each duplex is specific to clades A–D and B–C noting that the B–C duplex also amplifies clade E lice classified as a sub-sister clade within clade C lice. DNA amplification was performed as described previously [22]. Lice with a known clade were used as a positive control while the master mixtures served as negative controls.

Haplotype identification using standard PCR and sequencing

Based on the qPCR results we randomly selected 46 lice specimens encompassing the full range of clade diversity for phylogenetic analysis. DNA samples were subjected to standard PCR targeting a 347-bp fragment of the cytb gene [23]. The final reaction volume (25 μl) consisted of 12.5 μl Amplitaq gold master mixes 0.5 μM of each primer 5 μl DNA template and water. cytb amplification was performed in the Applied Biosystems 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) with the following thermal cycling profile: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 15 min; then 40 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C 30 s at 56 °C and 1 min at 72 °C; followed by a final extension step for 5 min at 72 °C. Successful amplification was validated by electrophoresis in an 1.5% agarose gel. Amplicons were then purified on NucleoFast 96 PCR plates (Macherey–Nagel EURL Hoerdt France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer.

Candidatus Riesia pediculicola housekeeping gene analysis

Primer design

In order to investigate the genotypic profile of the endosymbiotic bacteria four standard PCR systems were designed targeting three Candidatus Riesia pediculicola housekeeping genes: ftsZ groEL and two regions of rpoB. Four genomes of Candidatus Riesia pediculicola belonging to clade A and B lice deposited in the GenBank database (accession numbers CP012841 CP012843 CP012845 CP001085) [17 18] were aligned using Muscle in MEGA7 software [24] and screened for conserved and discriminative genes.

Based on the variability in the available Riesia genomes three housekeeping genes were selected as candidates for primer design. In order to find a suitable and conserved region for primers two sequence fragments (approx. 100 bp) separated by a minimum of 500 bp for each gene were submitted to Primer3 software v. 0.4.0 (http://primer3.ut.ee/). The melting temperature of each primer was tested using the free online software programme Oligo Analyser 3.1 (https://eu.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer) [25]. Designed primers (Table 1) were then tested in silico using the NCBI BLAST nucleotide sequence similarity tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

Table 1 Details of designed primers for Candidatus Riesia pediculicola gene amplification Full size table

Housekeeping gene amplification

Prior to endosymbiotic DNA amplification the designed primers were tested against a panel of negative controls consisting of the DNA of various bacterial species and arthropods (Additional file 2: Table S2). Once validated 73 samples were randomly selected from the 126 lice to amplify ftsZ groEL and the two rpoB regions of the endosymbiont (Table 1). Standard PCRs were performed as described for cytb and amplicons were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel.

Data analysis

Phylogenetic analysis

In total 28 lice specimens harbored common sequences for the cytb and the endosymbionte genes but only 21 specimens had good quality sequences and were chosen for the phylogenetic analysis. The obtained cytb sequences were combined and compared with the worldwide cytb data previously reported and deposited in the GenBank database [8 26]. Alignments were performed using MEGA7.0.26 software and a maximum-likelihood (ML) tree was constructed using the Kimura2-parameter model under 1000 bootstrap replicates [27]. Candidatus Riesia pediculicola sequences were combined with data reported previously by Boyd et al. [16 17] and were analysed as described for the cytb gene. Specifically we used an Orthologous Average Nucleotide Identity Tool (OAT) [28] to define the overall similarities between the published Candidatus Riesia pediculicola genomes reported previously by Boyd et al. [17]. We also performed a Procrustes Approach to Cophylogenetic (PACo) analysis [29] using R [30] with 10000 permutations to test the dependence of the endosymbionte phylogeny on that of the louse clades by superimposing principal coordinates generated from the phylogenetic distance matrixes of Candidatus Riesia pediculicola and P. humanus.",,,,,,,,,

After 14 years in the show ring junior animal science major John Boyes radiates these qualities inside and out of the ring.

Boyes moved around the West Coast growing up and he graduated from Durham High School. His first taste of agriculture came about through his father. A Chico State alumnus Stephen Boyes taught high school agriculture and managed beef herds for several universities providing the initial spark to his son’s passion for the industry. From the moment the younger Boyes picked up a show stick he was hooked. Boyes found a home in agriculture from which he has not strayed.

Upon graduation from Durham High School Boyes’ quest for an agricultural education led him to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Shasta College and Butte College before he found the perfect program to fit his educational needs at Chico State. It was not until his last local fair when he met Chico State animal science professor Celina Phillips that he discovered an agriculture program that encompassed what he was looking for.

Phillips played a vital role in helping Boyes’ make the decision to transfer to Chico but she has since become a mentor advising Boyes both academically and at the Chico State Sheep Unit.

“I first met John as an FFA member at the Silver Dollar Fair [in Chico] and saw his dedication to the care and well-being of livestock. He has a passion for learning which will serve him well in his future endeavors” Phillips said.

Throughout his experience in 4-H and FFA Boyes served in a number of leadership positions and competed in public speaking events. At Chico State Boyes’ has been active in the Young Cattlemen’s Association and the Rangeland Management Club. Serving as vice president for the Rangeland Management Club and attending annual conferences on its behalf Boyes’ enthusiasm for the livestock industry has flourished. Although it seemed an obscure topic at first Boyes has found enthusiasm for rangeland management through close work with mentor and faculty member Kasey DeAtley. One of his proudest accomplishments was at the Annual Society of Rangeland Management Conference in February Boyes said where he competed in the extemporaneous speaking contest and Rangeland Cup placing second for their presentation on wildfire prevention and suppression.

Boyes’ involvement does not cease at the local level as he has been concurrently involved with the National Charlois Breed Association Red Angus Breed Association California Wool Growers and California Farm Bureau.

In recognition of his dedication to the industry and his academics Boyes was awarded scholarships from the National FFA Association as the recipient of the Tractor Supply Growing Scholars Award as well as the Chico State Agriculture Alumni Recruitment Scholarship.

A resident and student employee of the University Farm Boyes said that his favorite thing about the College of Agriculture is the hands-on experience the farm has to offer.

“Having the farm as a constant resource for learning and getting our hands dirty as students is highly valuable” Boyes said. “It’s a way we can find our niche in the agriculture community.”

Upon graduation from Chico State John will looks toward a career in rangeland management and ecology. He plans to continue his studies in graduate school with an emphasis on invasive species and their impact on the local ecosystem. A field with various facets and a world of opportunities a career in rangeland management for Boyes’ will likely encompass employment with the Bureau of Land Management University of California Cooperative Extension or in a research and teaching position pertinent to rangeland ecology and grazing systems.

For incoming freshmen in the College of Agriculture Boyes says the most important advice he could give is to diversify themselves and find new experiences.

“Get involved and network like crazy especially with professors” he said. “Without Dr. DeAtley I wouldn’t have found my passion and understanding for what rangeland is and how it is a good fit for me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW5jb25uZWN0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9saWZlc3R5bGUvY2x1YnMvMjAyMi8wMy8wNi9naXJsLXNjb3V0LWNvb2tpZS1zZWFzb24tbGVhcm5pbmctbGlmZS1za2lsbHMtYW5kLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LzkzNzM0NTQwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Girl Scout Cookie season about learning life skills and development,"Not only are they a delicious indulgence each year but Girl Scout Cookies make a difference as troop members learn people and business skills.

Girl Scout Cookie sales are in full swing. Cookie stands have been popping up all over Lenawee County. There are opportunities at businesses such as Walmart Lowe’s and Tractor Supply Co. to name a few where local Girl Scout troops have been selling the boxed sweet treats and will continue those sales over the next handful of weeks.

And while Girl Scout Cookies are enjoyed by many they are one of the driving forces behind the yearly success and activities of the organization which is celebrating its 110th anniversary this week beginning today.

Girl Scouts of the USA was founded in March 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low in Savannah Georgia. Today Girl Scouts are the largest girl-serving organization in the United States and are a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts comprising a sisterhood of nearly 10 million girls and adults in 145 countries.

The first known cookie sale by Girl Scouts was in 1917. In 1922 cookie recipes and the business plan were shared. The recipe for the s’mores cookie was first published in 1925. By 1937 cookie sales spanned coast to coast. Today there are smartphone apps that show where to find cookie sale stands.

The week of March 6-12 is known as Girl Scout Week and members past and present are encouraged to show off their Girl Scout pride daily either by wearing something green or by doing something positive for their community. Today specifically is referred to as Girl Scout Sunday.

“You can’t slow down Girl Scouts. We are just getting started” Brenna Smith the communications manager for Girl Scouts Heart of Michigan said.

Smith like many adults grew up as a Girl Scout troop member and has remained loyal to the organization and its mission: “Girl Scouting builds girls of courage confidence and character who make the world a better place.”

When she was a child Smith said her mother was her troop leader.

“Every adult that is involved in Girl Scouts we are here because girls deserve these opportunities to build these life skills and try new things without fear of failure” she said. “Girl Scouts is a safe place to try something fail miserably pick yourself up with your Girl Scouts sisters by your side and try again until you get it right. You get to learn alongside your best friends in the world.”

One of the major learning experiences associated with Girl Scouts is the season of cookie sales. There are only a handful of weeks remaining in the sale season so if you haven’t yet grabbed a box — or multiple — of Thin Mints Samoas Tagalongs Do-si-dos or this year’s new flavor Adventurefuls which are brownie-inspired cookies topped with caramel-flavored creme with a hint of sea salt head to www.gshom.org and click on the “cookies” tab at the top of the page. A dropdown menu should appear and users should then click on the “find cookies” option to find a sale near them.

Sales are expected to wrap up in early to mid-April Smith said.

Maddalynn Zellen is a high school senior and has been involved with Girl Scouts since she was in kindergarten. She is a member of Troop No. 60026 in Onsted. On Friday she and her father Matthew were selling cookies in front of the Walmart store in Adrian. Matthew said the sales had been “gangbusters.”

Maddalynn however managed to find some time to relax when sales were a little slow.

“After you’re at a stand long enough you understand the selling patterns of the day” she said. “Sometimes you’ll be really busy with customers and other times there aren’t a lot of sales.”

Some Walmart customers Friday purchased more than $50 worth of cookies. The traditional flavors such as Thin Mints Samoas Tagalongs Do-si-dos and Trefoils are $5 per box. Speciality cookies which are gluten free or organically made are $6.

Manning a cookie stand is one of Maddalynn’s favorite things about Girl Scouts she said. The fruits of her labor benefit such Scouts activities as field trips and troop bonding events.

Cookie sales provide the Scouts with multiple learning and character-building experiences. Grace Moreno a troop leader for Troop No. 60143 in Blissfield said Girl Scouts learn five business skills when engaged in the cookie selling season: goal setting making decisions based on goals they want to achieve business ethics learning how to talk to people and improving their people skills and how to manage money.

Moreno has 25 years invested in Girl Scouts joining the organization when she was 5. Today she is passing on her appreciation for its mission to her own children and others.

“I truly believe in the power of a G.I.R.L. (Goal Getter Innovator Risk-Taker and Leader)” she said in an email. “Cookie season encourages our Girl Scouts to step out of their comfort zones set goals make connections take ownership and work hard to create positive and impactful opportunities for themselves and others. So when you see a Girl Scout out selling cookies take interest in her business. Our world will be a better place for it.”

Funds from the cookie sales help support efforts such as service project opportunities activities troop members are interested in avenues to move along in their Scouts journey and the Scouts’ HomeTown Heroes Program which sends several boxes of cookies to local servicemen and women oversees firefighters police and others.

Beyond selling cookies Girl Scouts also take part in archery kayaking canoeing learning how to build a campfire and then learning how to make their dinner on that campfire encampment trips and informational facility and business tours. Badges are earned by Scouts throughout their educational journey in the program.

“Being able to see through cookie sales those achievable goals happen it kind of makes all of the money math click for the girls.

Ian and Rebecca Chick established the Lincolnshire Pig Company shortly after buying their farm at Scredington between Grantham and Sleaford and are proud of their quality animal welfare standards.

Their livestock includes over 2000 pigs and 340 sheep keeping the couple busy round the clock.

Ian a former Parachute Regiment Warrant Officer retired from active service in 2009 while Rebecca hails from an agricultural background.

Ian said: “Rebecca and I make a great team. While her focus and expertise is in animal welfare my military background has given me a real appreciation of efficiency.”

The couple say they have been helped in their busy lives with the acquisition of their Unimog – a 12.7-tonne implement carrier – helped by specialists South Cave Tractors. Its arrival has already cut time and stress for the couple day-to-day.

Ian said: “The Unimog fits the bill perfectly for our needs. There are so many jobs around the farm for which it can be used from cutting raking and carting hay to hedge trimming fencing… I even use it to run a hydraulic pressure washer. What’s more our six-year-old daughter Trinity absolutely loves it!”

He added: “Rebecca has relatives in the area with their own farming ventures. Using a 16-tonne Larrington Harvester trailer we supply them with farmyard manure from the pigs and bring back straw for bedding.

“One regular run involves a 14-mile round trip which was taking me over an hour with the tractor. The Unimog is so much quicker on the road so I’m now able to complete the task in little more than half the time.

“There are safety benefits too. I no longer get cars coming up close behind then cutting in front of me after they’ve overtaken!”

South Cave Tractors celebrated its 50th anniversary last year and has been supporting the unique Unimog brand since it opened for business. Ian said“The service I’ve received from sales executive Ben Middleton and his colleagues has been first class from start to finish while the Unimog is exceeding all my expectations.”",,,
TT,Trane Technologies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5dGltZXMuY29tL2VkdWNhdGlvbi10cmFuc2l0aW9uLzIwMjIvMDMvMDUvbWFraW5nLXRoZS1qdW1wLXRvLXRoZS1za2lsbGVkLXRyYWRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Making the jump to the skilled trades,"For veterans who only know the military and its structure transitioning into the civilian workforce is a daunting task.

It can be especially challenging for veterans who have the skillsets needed to be a skilled tradesperson in the civilian world but may not have obtained the accreditation or certification that employers look for when vetting job candidates.

“A lot of times it’s almost like two ships passing in the night” said Eric Eversole President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Hiring Our Heroes program an organization with a goal of helping veterans transitioning service members and military spouses find employment opportunities. “In the military you have this talented committed hard-working force that quite candidly often looks quite different than what the civilian workforce is used to recruiting. That can be challenging.”

Eversole himself a veteran of the Indiana Air National Guard and United States Navy JAG Corps and a current member of the U.S. Navy Reserve said he tells transitioning service members to plan for their future civilian employment as they would a military mission.

In his eyes that means having a clear objective and getting a head start well ahead of being discharged.

“First and foremost you want to define your operation” he said. “Second do your intelligence work. What skills do you have? How do those skills translate into the civilian world? What do you want to do? Where do you want to live? Then you have to look around and see what services are available to you. If you want to obtain certification as a skilled tradesperson before you leave the military you need to do your pre-work. You should start a year before you plan on leaving the military meeting with a transition team and taking advantage of the services offered by the military to help you transition.”

Trane Technologies is one of the Top 100 “Best For Vets” employers in the nation. Eric Weiss technical trainer for Trane Technologies residential HVAC and supply said there are several options for military members and veterans looking to obtain certification when entering the civilian workforce.

“Some HVAC dealers will hire an untrained tech into an entry position where they will teach them the needed skills and help them acquire the proper certification while on the job” Weiss said. “A more formal path would be to enroll in a school program—from associates degrees to HVAC-only specialty schools—to learn the skills either before or while working for a company.”

For example Trane Technologies offers several different education and training programs for employees of its equipment dealers and installers. They include online training for entry-level advanced and systems installations technicians as well as a program that blends online education and virtual training for installation technicians.

“Our company is also developing another option through another pilot program—Trade Warriors—that brings HVAC certification opportunities to military personnel before they leave the service” said Weiss. “That program is in its infancy and we hope to soon share more about it in the near future.”

Eversole said that in the ever-changing economy military members looking to enter a skilled trades profession should be able to do so fairly seamlessly especially if they are willing to plan ahead.

“We are at one of those junctures from a workforce standpoint where the opportunities for skilled laborers are abundant. We encourage our military members to start planning for that life while they are still in the military.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

On Saturday (March 5) Mastercard and Visa — the two largest credit card and digital payment processors — both suspended operations in Russia forcing Russian banks to consider alternate systems. Tinkoff Alfa Bank and Sberbank the biggest lender in Russia are all looking to switch to the UnionPay system.

PYMNTS wrote recently about Mastercard and Visa’s decisions to get out of Russia with both of the processors releasing statements Saturday that they would suspend operations within Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

The statements were issued very close to one another and both companies announced their plans to amp up their original plans to stop operating in Russia.

“With this action cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by the Mastercard network. And any Mastercard issued outside of the country will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs” the Mastercard statement said.

Visa said it had been “compelled to act” and was working with clients and partners in Russia to cease all transactions there.

Visa CEO Al Kelly said that while the company doesn’t like that it has to impact employees clients partners merchants and cardholders in the country there was no other choice — because of the country’s threats to “peace and stability” the company had to “respond in line with our values.”

Visa’s statement said “all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country and any Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia will no longer work within the Russian Federation.”

Both companies’ actions follow a growing wave of global outrage and financial sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden in his State of the Union address announced plans to “cripple the Russian economy” after the central banks moved to freeze hundreds of billions in foreign reserves globally.

Russia has also largely been blocked from moving money internationally through SWIFT.

In 2016 Charleston was ranked one of the top ten most friendly cities for tourists by Conde Nast Traveler.

Safety Tips for Traveling to South Carolina

Call your bank and credit card companies. Call your financial institutions to let them know you’re traveling. If this information is available it will help prevent theft as your accounts can be flagged for suspicious charges within a specific timeframe. Use ATMs at banks. ATMs located at banks are less likely to be tampered with because they require bank personnel intervention to access the machine and alter its settings (e.g. PIN). Choose ATMs that appear well-maintained and always opt for those located in secure locations such as lobbies or hallways leading toward the interior of the building. Keep your purse/bag handy. Whether you’re walking around town or taking a city bus always have your purse/bag nearby. If you are seated on a bus or train place your bag in your lap to prevent it from being snatched by thieves. Keep your car doors locked and windows up. When you arrive at your destination make sure all car doors are locked before getting out of the vehicle. Don’t leave anything of value in plain sight in the passenger compartment even in a locked car. This includes purses or wallets left in an unlocked glove box or center console as well as loose change left beneath the seat cushions. A thief could easily access this information using an unlocked door window when they break into your locked car. Lock Your Hotel Room Door. Make it a habit to secure your hotel room door behind you when entering the room. Never leave your room unlocked during your stay as anyone could easily access personal information such as credit card numbers PINs and other valuables kept under your pillow or mattress. Ignore (or limit yourself) to “good samaritan” encounters. During your trip always be aware of people who appear suspicious hold out their hand for money or beg for food/water. Most scams are committed by groups of individuals working together with one usually distracting the victim while another picks his/her pockets or steals his/her belongings. Avoid hurricane season. From June 1 to November 30 the state of South Carolina is under a hurricane watch/warning period. During this time it’s best to avoid traveling to the coast. If you do plan on visiting during this season have an emergency plan in place. You’ll also want to steer clear of areas that are prone to flooding or landslides. Be aware of scams involving vacation rentals. If you’re looking for safe alternatives to hotels consider vacation rentals instead. Before booking with an unknown traveler via sites like Craigslist or Airbnb always request photo identification and confirm their phone number in case there are any issues during your stay. Once everything checks over the phone/email meet in person and pay with a credit card or gift card (that hasn’t been loaded with funds) if possible. Watch your drinks at clubs/bars. Be aware of your surroundings when you’re out having fun. Don’t leave drinks unattended and only accept open containers from bar staff or friends you trust. You can also make yourself less vulnerable by sticking to bottled beers instead of pints/glasses that need to be poured. Lastly never accept drinks from strangers; this is how people get drugged before being mugged or sexually assaulted (i.e. roofies). Be careful online & on social media. If you’re engaging with friends on social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter avoid posting personal information about your plans while traveling such as flight numbers/times/addresses.

So... How Safe Is South Carolina Really?

If you remain vigilant and plan you can enjoy a beautiful trip to South Carolina.

Be aware of the coastline during hurricane season stay safe by locking your hotel room door and using valet service and only accept drinks from people you trust.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson

McDonald's and PepsiCo along with many others are being urged to end their business in Russia.

New York state's comptroller wrote to several companies calling for action per Reuters.

British politician John Mann has made similar requests.

McDonald's and PepsiCo are among the food and drink companies facing calls from political figures to cut business ties with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

In a letter Friday Thomas DiNapoli New York state comptroller urged companies to rethink their Russian business operations because they face ""significant and growing legal compliance operational human rights and personnel and reputational risks"" Reuters reported.

He added that suspending or ending business in Russia ""would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market"" and play a key role in ""condemning Russia's role in fundamentally undermining the international order.""

McDonald's and PepsiCo did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

Other companies including Estee Lauder Kimberly-Clark Corp Coty Inc Mondelez International Inc Fortinet Inc Bunge Ltd Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and Trimble Inc were also asked in the letter to boycott business in Russia per Reuters.

Since Russian President Vladamir Putin invaded Ukraine in an unprovoked attack scores of companies have taken action by ending or limiting their commercial dealings with Russia.

Ikea Spotify and Nike were among the major companies that recently severed business ties with Russia. Some retail brands including Publix and Kroger also showed their solidarity with Ukraine by removing Russian vodka from store shelves.

British politician John Mann called for similar action to DiNapoli. In a tweet he said: ""If Mcdonalds and Starbucks continue to sell in Russia then an international boycott of their products should be instigated.""

Social media users have also called for company boycotts with McDonald's facing particular scrutiny.

One user who posted a photo of open McDonald's stores in Russia said: ""Guess who is doing business as normal in #Russia no surprise #BoycottMcDonalds.""

Another said: ""@McDonalds Leave #Russia or lose loyal customers the choice is yours. #BoycottMcDonalds.""

The company Feb. 18 closed a former BB&T branch on Clark Street on the Covington Square and a former SunTrust branch in the Kroger supermarket on U.S. Hwy. 278. There were “no job losses associated with these consolidations” said Shelley Miller spokesperson for Truist Bank. “All teammates are being offered other roles in nearby branches” Miller said. “Our client relationships have been automatically transferred to a nearby branch where they’ll receive the same attention and client service they’re accustomed to.”

The closures will leave the bank with one branch — a former BB&T location — at 3110 Hwy. 278 in Covington and an ATM next to the Oxford Post Office on Ga. Hwy. 81.

Miller said many former BB&T and SunTrust branches in close proximity to one another presented “natural opportunities to reduce redundant branches with very little impact to our clients. We’re being thoughtful in our approach and are keeping the needs of our clients at the forefront of our decisions” Miller said.

The bank recently closed numerous former BB&T and SunTrust throughout Metro Atlanta as part of the new operation.

Branches that closed Feb. 18 were the main Covington BB&T branch at 1134 Clark St SW; and Covington Kroger Branch of SunTrust at 3139 Hwy. 278 NE Miller said.

“Like many industries we’re seeing our client preferences and behaviors change as more and more clients choose to bank with us digitally” Miller said.

“This trend has accelerated even more due to COVID-19. This has caused a gradual effect on client traffic patterns and branch usage. Over time we’ve also closely tracked past branch closings to see how this might affect our clients. To date we’ve seen virtually no client attrition through this process.”

BB&T and SunTrust announced a merger to become Truist in 2019. “It’s also important to note that clients have access to their accounts through one of the strongest branch and ATM networks in our markets telephone banking and 24-hour delivery channels such as online and mobile banking which allow them to bank anytime anywhere” Miller said.

The Charlotte North Carolina-based company plans to close some 800 branches by the end of the first quarter of this year — part of its post-merger initiative to cut expenses and address overlaps in its branch network which spreads throughout the Southeast the Charlotte Observer newspaper reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDYvYnVzaW5lc3MvcGF5bWVudHMtZnJhdWQtemVsbGUtYmFua3MuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fraud Is Flourishing on Zelle. The Banks Say It's Not Their Problem. (Published 2022),"Justin Faunce lost $500 to a scammer impersonating a Wells Fargo official in January and hoped that the bank would reimburse him. Mr. Faunce was a longtime Wells Fargo customer and had immediately reported the scam — involving Zelle the popular money transfer app.

But Wells Fargo said the transaction wasn’t fraudulent because Mr. Faunce had authorized it — even though he had been tricked into transferring the money.

Mr. Faunce was shocked. “It was clearly fraud” he said. “This wasn’t my fault so why isn’t the bank doing the right thing here?”

I’ll be publishing this every Sunday so in between posts be sure to listen to the Equity podcast and hear Alex Wilhelm Natasha Mascarenhas and me riff on all things startups! And if you want to have this hit your inbox directly once it officially turns into a newsletter on March 27 (woo hoo!) sign up here.

It was a busy week for fintech news but then again what week isn’t?

Since fintech became a thing there has been inherent friction between incumbents and startups. But something I’ve noticed over the years is that while in some cases there will always be competition (especially between digital banks and traditional ones) there is also some cooperation generally between the two because — let’s face it — banks realize they need fintechs to stay competitive. And fintechs too can glean knowledge from banks that have operated for decades.

And so you can imagine how interesting it was for me on Friday to have a conversation with Scott Case Truist’s chief information officer and Dontá L. Wilson the bank’s chief digital and client experience officer. For the unacquainted Charlotte N.C.-based Truist is one of the nation’s largest financial institutions – as of June 2021 it was the 10th largest bank with $509 billion in assets. It was formed in 2019 as a merger between BB&T and SunTrust banks. Not long after that merger the COVID-19 pandemic hit leading to a “digital acceleration” in many industries but especially finance.

“We had a beautiful plan for all these new solutions with an extended road map of a couple of years to bring them forward” Wilson told me. “So the shift wasn’t something we hadn’t thought about but the pandemic brought all these things forward much more quickly.”

As part of its efforts to stay on top of all things digital Truist opened a 100000-square-foot innovation and tech center. Some of the things the bank is getting serious about according to Case are cloud architecture data and analytics. It’s even built an “API toolkit and playbook” that he describes as “very important” to the institution.

“We want to position ourselves to respond like a fintech responds” Wilson said. “We don’t see them as competitors. We may compete with them for some clients but we also partner with them to bring solutions to our clients.”

Truist invests in them too. Similar to how Citi and American Express formed their own venture arms the institution backs companies such as Veem – a startup that has developed a global payments network for businesses – through Truist Ventures.

All smart incumbents recognize that sometimes it just makes more sense to work with a startup than build out their own technology. And according to Truist fintechs also at times need bank partnerships at times to scale up.

“The world we live in is an interconnected set of ecosystems” Case said. “Fintechs have taken a market share in some of them and there are others that own a space. There are still others who need to partner. Clients want to travel through the journey seamlessly. So we’re behind the scenes engineering those partnerships and iterations to make that happen.”

And while banks that have operated for decades like those that combined to form what is today Truist “have a 100-year start on fintechs” Wilson noted he also acknowledges that fintechs “have brought a healthy competition to make sure everyone is elevating their games.”

On to infrastructure

A couple of weeks back we touched on an investor survey that we published on TC+. An area of interest that came up among multiple investors was infrastructure. Well this past week only provided further evidence that infrastructure is hot and continues to rake in the dollars.

I wrote about Tenderly a startup that aims to make it easier for web3 developers “of all skill sets” to build blockchain products. The company raised $40 million in a Series B round of funding just months after closing on its Series A and after seeing a 500% increase in year-over-year revenue.

As I reported the financing is yet another example of the rapid succession of funding rounds in the blockchain infrastructure space — and fintech space in general. Earlier this month TechCrunch also reported on Alchemy raising a $200 million extension to its Series C at a valuation of $10.2 billion. That company aims to be the starting place for developers considering building a product on top of a blockchain or mainstream blockchain applications.

I also reported on another infrastructure company that raised just months (five in this case) after its previous round. Coincidentally — and I just realized as I am writing this -– both companies raised $40 million. Atomic is a provider of payroll APIs that powers 70 banks credit unions and fintech companies such as Coinbase Dave and Propel. This also ties into the above discussion as Atomic is an example of a startup that is working with both incumbents and fintechs to help connect consumers to their financial data for things like verification of income and employment automating setup and updating of direct deposits repaying financial obligations from their paycheck optimizing tax withholdings and accessing earned but unpaid wages.

Not much else to say here beyond what we already know — infrastructure is hot.

Finding your calling

Another story I reported this week involved the departure of Instacart’s head of payments Ofek Lavian and his move to become COO of a startup called Forage.

In summary Lavian had helped make it possible for Instacart to accept EBTs more commonly known as food stamps online. But during that process he was introduced to Forage whose mission is to make it easier for merchants everywhere to do the same.

Lavian’s passion came across during our conversation which took place on his first day on the job.

“When I looked at all the places on the internet that people couldn’t use these funds I realized that this was going to be my calling” he told me.

I loved this story honestly because it’s about boosting inclusion which means a lot to me personally and it’s always awesome to see someone find their calling and be willing to leave a big company that’s been around for years to take a chance on a fledgling company like Forage.

I wish both him and the company the greatest success.

Fundings

Of course there were plenty of other funding deals announced this week – way more than I could even think about covering. But here’s just a few:

Romain wrote about how European spend management startup Payhawk added $100 million to its Series B round that he had already covered back in November. The startup confirmed that it has reached a post-money valuation of $1 billion proving that spend management is heating up worldwide.

He also covered the fact that Shares closed a $40 million Series A funding round led by Valar Ventures. That company has been working on a mobile app that lets you easily buy and sell shares but with a social twist. You can follow your friends’ moves and talk with other users directly from the app.

TabaPay an instant money movement platform also this week revealed an undisclosed investment by the SoftBank Vision Fund 2. The startup says it is currently processing over 1 million transactions a day with a 2018-2021 CAGR of 111% and 153% in dollar volume.

Los Angeles-based Counterpart a management liability insurtech brought in $30 million in Series B growth financing. The company said it is growing amid an “increasingly challenging operating environment for small businesses where one in four has faced a management liability lawsuit in the last three years at an average cost of more than $100000” according to Chubb. Its offerings include crime insurance among other things.

Speaking of insurance Christine Hall wrote about how Kin Insurance raised $82 million of a Series D round that execs expects will officially close at $100 million. QED Investors led the round. Notably the Chicago-based direct-to-consumer home insurance company had in January had shelved plans to go public via a SPAC. Kin Insurance is among its insurtech peers experiencing rapid growth and in its case closed 2021 with $105 million in premiums up from $25 million in 2020.

And last but not least Kaleidoscope a fintech driving “education-based philanthropy” raised a $10 million Series A round to connect sponsoring organizations donors and applicants. The startup says it has facilitated over $370 million in scholarships and grants over the last two years.

In other news

Melio a B2B payments platform for small businesses announced it had named former Meta and PayPal senior executive Tomer Barel as its new chief operating officer. The fintech’s last raise – a $250 million round – valued the company at $4 billion in September. Melio had in January 2021 closed $110 million in funding at a $1.3 billion valuation.

In M&A news DoorDash said it is acquiring Bbot a hospitality technology startup that simplifies digital orders and payments processes for an undisclosed amount. According to Restaurant Dive the acquisition will strengthen DoorDash’s on-premise technology offerings and could grow its partner footprint since Bbot services restaurants hotels bars breweries food halls ghost kitchens and bowling alleys.

Meanwhile in scratching-our-heads news Mercury which describes itself as a bank for startups restricted several accounts linked to African tech startups our man on the ground there Tage reported.

The number of companies involved with this restriction is unknown. But several sources told TechCrunch that they ranged from a dozen to 30 — including well-established YC-backed startups and newer upstarts.

Tying back to our original topic of fintechs partnering with incumbents Mesh Payments announced it is teaming up with Visa to launch a numberless business card called Plug & Pay that it says lets Mesh users link that physical card to any of their virtual cards “and swap them out on the fly as many times as they want or need.”

In December Ingrid reported on how Mesh Payments — which provides a platform for companies to oversee and manage employees’ expenses and for employees to better track and manage how and where they spend money — raised $50 million in a Series B led by Tiger Global.

In case you’re wondering how this differs from say Curve’s or Apple’s offerings Mesh said that while their physical card doesn’t have a number printed on it there is still a number associated with the account/card. Plug & Pay on the other hand the company maintains allows users to link the physical card to any of their virtual cards. It told me: “So it’s almost as if the physical is empty and you ‘plug in’ the virtual card from the platform. If you want your physical card to have let’s say new limits or other features you can ‘plug-in’ a new card from the platform and swap as many times as you want — instantly.”

Mesh touts that this is a big deal when it comes to security in that if the card is compromised in any way a finance manager can just link a new virtual card to the physical one. Also finance managers have full control over the physical card allowing them to disable the card change its PIN or swap the virtual card remotely and instantly from the Mesh platform. The company is calling this “a spend management platform in your pocket.”

And in another example of fintechs partnering with banks Plaid announced an “open finance relationship” with Frost Bank that will bring data connectivity to the institution’s nearly 400000 customers located throughout Texas. Or in other words Plaid wants to help Frost customers “securely and easily” integrate their accounts and finances online. This is a prime example of a bank recognizing that technology can make the lives of their customers easier — and doing something about it.

That’s it for this week! I hope you have an awesome rest of your weekend.

Tonight’s NCIS: Los Angeles recap begins now – Refresh Page often to get the most current updates

Tonight’s episode begins with Deeks who was selling his bar. It was a decision he made with his wife. It had been a cash drain. It went under the pandemic and the only reason it didn’t wipe out their savings is the fact they both have second jobs. The couple also needed the resources if they were going to become parents. They couldn’t keep wasting it on a cash drain and so Deeks has to tell Callen about the sale. Callen lives in the apartment above the bar. Once Deeks sold the place Callen will have to move. Callen should start looking for new places now rather than later and that meant Deeks has to tell him his news. He couldn’t leave it to the last minute. He also couldn’t let someone buy a bar when there’s already a tenant.

It’s not like Callen is paying a lot of rent. The new owner could raise the rent on him for the fair value of the property and anyways Callen will still have to look for a new place if he doesn’t like the rent hike or if he doesn’t even like the new buyer. Either way Deeks needed to man up to tell Callen about the sale. His wife was putting pressure on him to do it and he was grateful when they caught a case because it helped put off the inevitable. The case they were working on was a murder investigation. The murder of Dr. Laura Nash was considered high security because she was leading a team of engineers to develop short-range radar for the Navy.

Nash was murdered at the warehouse where she worked. The technology which she was working on was also missing and it could lead to something quite dangerous in the wrong hands. Nash technically could have handed it over to the proper authorities weeks ago but she was so focused on working out all the bugs that she held onto it a little too long and someone capitalized on it by stealing it from her. Nash was a perfectionist. The group of Marines she worked with had all respected her. They just didn’t like her. The more liked her right-hand man Petty Officer Kevin Tyler.

Tyler went missing a day after the murder. He even missed work and that was the first time he missed it in five years. His behavior was highly suspicious. The team went to his home to find out what happened and they found it ransacked. There was no sign of Tyler. It was believed at first that maybe he was kidnapped. Only kidnappers don’t usually allow people to pack up their clothes. Tyler had packed before he left and he had a gang-affiliated tattoo in a picture frame at his home. The tattoo could be traced back to White Knights. They were the gang in Tyler’s hometown in Venice.

The team thought at first maybe Tyler killed his mentor to steal the tech to get it back to the White Knights but then they questioned why any low-level gang would risk so much. The tech that was stolen was one of one. It was going to be flagged for potential terrorism if it went missing and so the team came up with a different theory. They came to suspect that a foreign spy could have stolen the tech. Either Russia or China could have stolen it or paid Tyler to get it for them. Fatima was asked to track the spies with flights out of town. She found one woman who’s been to several cities in a matter of months and so the suspected spy was brought to the boat shed.

She was questioned. She gave them a false story about being a supposed librarian at first. She also refuses to turn her back on China but she was willing to admit that she bought the radar tech from Tyler and another man. She gave them two million dollars for the tech. She also had to give them some Devil’s wraith. Which is an untraceable explosive that China developed. It turns out Tyler really was working with the White Knights and they planned on committing terrorism. The team later learned they planned on bombing a scholarship ceremony at the local community center. The scholarships were going to smart kids from immigrant families and it was happening in the White Knights’ backyard in Venice.

The whole team drove out there. Sam and Callen were looking for their terrorists in the nearby area. Someplace that was close enough to detonate the stuff and far away enough to be safe. Sam and Callen found their culprits. It led to a shootout. They were forced to kill members of the White Knights. Not that it was much hardship and so they stopped the bombing from ever happening. Deeks and Kensi had evacuated everyone from the community center while the shootout happened and they met some good people while doing their jobs.

And after surviving another day on the job Deeks came clean to Callen and Callen wasn’t upset. Callen was actually glad that Deeks and Kensi weren’t wasting money on that drain.

But Callen’s voice and face have been stolen by someone operating a computer program that allows them to impersonate him to the point they met with his doctor on a video call.

White supremacy ended up being at the heart of NCIS: Los Angeles Season 13 Episode 10.

What started out seeming like the standard military technology stolen by a bad-actor country ended up getting a twist.

As the Jan. 6 insurrection proved white supremacists are embedded in government law enforcement and the military which was the point being made here.

It took a while to get there in a roundabout way but the OSP made it ... eventually.

A murdered civilian scientist developed a radar system that essentially let Marines see through walls to increase their combat efficiency.

What wasn't addressed was that the radar didn't have all the bugs worked out yet.

But the buyer didn't seem too concerned about that. When you're buying stolen tech from two skinheads in a pickup you don't ask too many questions.

Where's the logic in selling to a race you consider inferior to pay for attacks on other races you consider inferior?

The team took some entertaining directions to unravel this mystery.

When the scientist's lieutenant went MIA just before the killing and theft that's one actual red flag.

Once Sam determined that Tyler was a member of a racist gang and Fatima discovered that merchandise goes missing around him it was pretty simple to figure out who was behind the radar theft.

A bigger puzzle was why no one had asked any questions about Tyler's previous activities. That's likely because the military regularly loses inventory and there had been no bodies attached to his early thefts.

Having found the seller Fatima then uncovered the buyer simply by checking for those soon departing for hostile nations.

Like Tyler no one had previously noticed the pattern of Jun Chen gaining jobs at universities near military locations being just in the right spot to accept handoffs of stolen technologies.

Most unlikely was how Kensi's jeans obsession came into play.

After finding threads near where she postulated that the killer had hidden Kensi learned that those came from new high-end jeans.

This allowed for disgusted looks from Kilbride and shocked faces from Deeks as she explained the value of these special jeans.

It also meant she could drag Deeks on a field trip to the one local store which sold such jeans for $425 a pair (not a three-pack as Deeks guessed).

Kensi quickly determined that those able to afford such jeans had little cause to traffic in stolen military technology.

That led to further questioning of store owner Ruby who admitted that she donated her seconds to a community center that had tried to help his late addict sister.

The community center initially appeared to be a dead-end but would be important later on.

Jun proved to be a sympathetic villain. She smuggled back weapons to her Communist government in exchange for it taking care of victims from a toxic agricultural area including her parents.

While she was willing to go to prison rather than give up the location of the radar prototype June was OK with fingering the white supremacist sellers ultimately stopping a near-disaster.

The sellers wanted money and an unstable explosive the Chinese had been developing.

Fatima was able to identify the second seller older racist Seth Wilcox who Kensi and Deeks recognized as a workman coming out of the center earlier.

Callen and Sam took down the two white supremacists while Kensi and Deeks evacuated the special scholarship event just in case.

Now onto the weird ongoing storylines. First up would be the sale of the Squid and Dagger.

Since the bar was seemingly another victim of the pandemic Deeks was smart to unload it. The two of them had been carrying it for too long and that beats just going under.

Now why Deeks kept babbling on about converting his garage into a man cave was a whole other matter. They live in L.A. they need cars and they need a place to park them. Maybe he could convert the nursery since that doesn't seem to be working out for them.

No bar meant Deeks had to inform his tenant Callen that he needed to move out. Being Deeks he hemmed and hawed then hemmed some more especially after Sam refused to bail him out. Because you know Callen is headed for Sam's houseboat.

And when Deeks finally told Callen Callen was relieved. He'd just been helping out those crazy kids because he thought they could use the rent.

Callen's got his problem forming although what exactly that is wasn't clear.

People connected to Callen are getting calls from him that he knows nothing about.

All that's evident is that these calls originate in Russia. Is it time for the Katya storyline to raise its ugly head again?

Kilbride seemed incredibly cranky and was dispersing most of his ire at Fatima who had been his special project. What's up with that?

Fatima was rightfully overwhelmed by the lack of help in Ops. I wonder when Roundtree will resurface?

To revisit the Katya storyline watch NCIS: Los Angeles online.

What did you think of the white supremacists as villains?

Why was the radar technology left unrecovered?

Who's after Callen this time?

(Courtesy Queen’s University Belfast)

Cameras and microphones in the house could be the next big thing in poultry welfare.

Later in 2022 the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research’s (FFAR) SMART project will help new solutions utilizing vision and audio-based technology make their commercial debut in the U.S. and Europe.

SMART

In March 2020 FFAR selected six research programs for use in the broiler industry focused on automated sensor monitoring analysis and reporting technologies (SMART) to receive a total of $2 million in research grants.

In June 2022 it is expected to pick two or three finalists from its initial group to receive an additional $1 million each to accelerate the development and potential commercialization of their technology. The SMART projects aim to objectively and comprehensively assess broiler welfare while improving efficiency for producers.

The six initial selections were efforts led by:

Marian Dawkins a professor of animal behavior at the University of Oxford to test the ability of a novel camera and computer system called OpticFlock to monitor broiler welfare.

Niamh O’Connell a professor with Queen’s University Belfast to develop a vision-based system leveraging existing human crowd surveillance algorithms and apply them to the tracking and behavior analysis of broiler chickens.

Dr. Ingrid de Jong a senior scientific researcher at Wageningen University & Research to use an affordable camera-based system and artificial intelligence to automatically record broiler chicken behavior on the farm.

Scio+ to use camera technology and advanced image analysis to continuously monitor commercial broiler flocks map welfare assessments and estimate walking ability.

Dr. Hao Gan an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) to use multi-angle and multi-range cameras to monitor broilers at an individual and flock level and measure their walking ability and level of activity.

Tom Darbonne and Dr. Brandon Carroll with AudioT to develop audio-based monitoring tools created on bird vocalizations alerting farmers to broiler welfare and behavior.

Funding assistance came from McDonalds Corp. which helped develop the program and the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association (USPOULTRY). Dr. Denise Heard vice president in charge of USPOULTRY’s research program said her organization contributed $100000 to the SMART project.

FFAR is a non-profit organization dedicated to funding research in agriculture founded by Congress in 2014. FFAR’s mission is to build public-private partnerships supporting agriculture research. The organization is funded through the federal budget and seeks funding support for researching programs from companies and organizations such as USPOULTRY.





Dr. Tim Kurt scientific program director for FFAR said research it supports has already led to notable improvements currently saving the dairy cattle breeding industry more than $8 million a year in feed costs. It is also working with USPOULTRY on chick sexing technologies.

The second phase

The second phase of the program will commercially validate the projects chosen from the first round for their technological progress and potential promise. Data collection in a commercial setting is essential for success.

Heard said a formal review of the research and its progress during the first two years of the program was held in January 2022. Heard and Kurt said a formal announcement of the winning teams will come in the summer of 2022.

Commercial trials could begin as early as June 2022. McDonalds Corp. will try the technologies in its U.S. and European supply chains Kurt said.

Tyson Foods Inc. will continue its work with the emerging technologies at its research farm in Arkansas. The animal welfare research farm is led by Dr. Karen Christensen senior director of animal wellbeing for Tyson Foods Inc.

Kurt hopes that by the end of phase two the finalists will refine their technology enough to enter the demanding commercial broiler production environment or be close to ready for commercialization.

Previewing the finalists

Kurt said the finalists are projects focused on computer vision technology specifically approaches for monitoring bird health and performance. The main outputs of those technologies are observations of the bird’s health. This is primarily observed through their walking abilities which can display disorders like hock burn and footpad dermatitis.

Those technologies show potential to automatically identify natural bird activities and associate those behaviors with animal welfare. This is a step toward quantifying the number and duration of events.

Heard said one system can monitor individual birds and based on readings give a clear indicator of a bird’s welfare status as good neutral or bad. Vision-based systems she said can leverage existing human surveillance techniques and potentially notify farmers of abnormal conditions.

“Amongst the small group that we've selected we have some very promising data that suggests they can collect that information and provide essentially a user interface or a dashboard … to the grower and potentially to others” Kurt said.

Commercialization

After the second round of funding FFAR hopes the technologies will enter the next stage of development as a component of a modern integrated poultry operation. This could happen through expansion of their own company or acquisition by an existing equipment manufacturer.

Ideally the mature technologies will easily integrate into other data collection and processing systems already employed by integrators and major food companies Kurt said.

One consistent issue described by the SMART project leaders is the struggle of placing camera systems in working broiler houses.





“It has been a challenge implementing camera systems due to the high computing power needed to run the cameras and associated algorithms as well as low accuracy in prediction/assessment due to the challenging farm environment” Gan said.

Queen’s University Belfast

O’Connell’s team applied existing human crowd surveillance technology to track and analyze the behavior of broilers. This enables the monitoring of a large number of birds the tracking of individual activity patterns and welfare indicators.

She said the system in the first phase called FlockFocus was focused on monitoring the behavioral and physical characteristics of individual broilers. Once each bird can be identified they can be counted. This allows for different density evaluations around the house and allows farmers to track bird movement patterns.

The team is also working on automating detection of positive emotions and activities in birds as well as key welfare indicators like leg health behavioral indicators like non-avoidance of the farmer and automatic collection of bird weight information.

O’Connell an established animal welfare researcher said the technology will grant a new level of depth to the information currently available to farmers and integrators. Estimating bird density knowing exact usage of feeders and drinkers and other factors will only enable farmers to make smarter and more informed decisions about the health of their animals.

Wageningen

A team led by de Jong used affordable 2D and 3D camera-based systems and artificial intelligence to automatically record broiler chicken behavior on the farm. The cameras continuously monitor the birds’ ability to walk interact with others and their surroundings and tracks the bird’s other behaviors like running playing foraging and dustbathing.





Dr. Ingrid de Jong Wageningen University & Research (Courtesy Queen’s University Belfast)

Focusing on the birds’ walking ability and other natural behaviors is crucial she said because it creates insights into a whole flock’s collective welfare. It can also warn farmers when the bird’s walking ability is declining or suffering so they can make the necessary interventions.





Moreover automatically collecting this data removes the need for time consuming and inaccurate human welfare measurements and makes it easier for farmers and integrators to track measurable progress in meeting welfare goals. Eventually she said gait scores and walking ability assessments could be measured and tracked like any other variable on the farm such as water and feed consumption.

De Jong said the system is now able to automatically detect different bird behaviors with good accuracy sensitivity and specificity for most bird actions. This is a good first step she said but the concept must be expanded and tested in a commercial setting to continue to advance.

Scio+

René Thomsen a director at Danish information technology and services company Scio+ said his project is using cameras and advanced image analysis to continuously monitor flocks make welfare assessments and gauge walking ability.

The project began with the objectives of using the technology to estimate and assess walking ability and leg health; create an early warning system for the farmer for abnormal conditions in the broiler house and potentially identify natural bird behaviors like dustbathing.

The 3D cameras used in the Scio+ project can see the environment in visible light infrared light and use thermal imaging to detect additional information. Additionally the system can monitor the flock density in certain areas of the house and report abnormal behaviors to staff.

UTIA

Gan said his team is developing an integrated sensing system using top-view and side-view cameras to continuously monitor broiler birds analyze their walking ability and assign gait scores. It randomly samples broilers from various locations in the house to predict their gate score and analyzes the entire flock to create an average gait score for the entire flock.

He said the UTIA project’s technology can greatly reduce the labor needs and improve the throughput and accuracy of gait assessments. Faster more efficient detection allows farmers to act sooner and take actions to reduce potential mortalities.

AudioT

WATT PoultryUSA could not reach representatives of AudioT to speak about its SMART research. However Darbonne presented on the status of his research as part of the 2020 Virtual Poultry Tech Summit in October 2020.





Tom Darbonne AudioT (Courtesy AudioT)

AudioT is a project using audio sensors software and machine learning techniques to detect illnesses in birds – like laryngotracheitis and infectious bronchitis – before the farmer would otherwise notice symptoms.

Darbonne said the technology was originally built to detect and sort out avian coughs but it could be used for a variety of other applications using the same principle of learning a sound and what it means recognizing it and automatically notifying the end user. Audio he said could be more advantageous than video because of its durability affordability and high compatibility with existing broiler house technology.

Oxford

WATT PoultryUSA could not reach representatives of Oxford University to speak about Dawkins’ SMART research. However according to FFAR her team was assigned to test an Oxford-designed camera and computer system called OpticFlock. The system uses cameras to monitor bird behavior and assess the presence of welfare issues.

In February 2022 Dawkins along with others published a research report on the significance of the so-called optical flow patterns of broiler chicken flocks in the journal Animals. That report concluded there are correlations between the level of flock activity and the welfare of those birds. Broilers that move less than their peers are more likely to display welfare problems.

It's been revealed that Everton's shirt sponsorship with Cazoo will come to an end following the culmination of the current season which will leave the Blues looking for a ninth company's logo to be emblazoned on their shirts.

We'll find out who that ends up being in the months ahead but for now here’s a potted history of Everton’s shirt sponsors over the years.

The Blues went over a century without a sponsors logo on their shirt between 1878-1979 and for long periods they didn’t even have a club crest on their shirts but 100 years after they first adopted the name Everton after previously being St Domingo’s they took the plunge into football’s new commercial world.

Danish meat manufacturers Hafnia had the honour of becoming Everton’s first sponsor and their logo was on their shirts for both the 1984 FA Cup final win – the club’s first trophy for 14 years – and during the 1984/85 League Championship season.

Curiously though despite this association with one of Goodison’s golden ages Hafnia’s products including corned beef; pork roll; jellied veal and ox tongue were never even available for UK customers and dissolving soon after their deal with Everton ended their name was passed on to Tyson Foods – but again no link to ‘Iron Mike.’

With Everton back in the spotlight in 1985 having secured the title and the Cup-Winners’ Cup – what would prove to be their only European trophy so far – they managed to land a major global brand in the shape of their decade-long association with NEC (Nippon Electric Company) headquartered in the Minato ward in the Japanese capital of Tokyo.

An IT and network solutions firm they were the world’s largest semiconductor company at the time as well as being one of the biggest manufacturers of PCs.

Everton’s last League Championship was won on their watch and their final game as shirt sponsors was the 1-0 success over Manchester United in the 1995 FA Cup final – the Blues last major trophy to date.

In 1995 Everton struck a £4million deal with Danka whose logo had already been seen by Merseyside sporting crowds earlier that year when it had been emblazoned on the silks of jockey Jason Titley as he rode 40/1 shot Royal Athlete to victory in the Grand National at Aintree.

A provider of office equipment such as photocopiers printers and fax machines based out of St Petersburg Florida they cut their ties with the Blues two years later switching to Formula One racing team Arrows who had just moved to Oxfordshire and acquired reigning F1 champion driver Damon Hill.

Mobile phone operator One2One became Everton’s new sponsors in 1997 and launched their initial three-year deal with summer recruits Slaven Bilic and Gareth Farrelly showcasing their products on the Goodison turf.

Their first season with the Blues featured the embarrassment of an ‘upside down’ design on the players’ shirts after an eagle-eyed fan spotted that the design worn by the first team was different than the jerseys being sold to supporters.

Umbro who manufactured the kit were forced to act quickly and declared that it was the players’ kit that was wrong and the thousands of replica shirts that were right.

Everton only survived relegation on the final day of the 1997/98 season with Kopites having previously mocked them with ‘Gone2one’ taunts (English football’s second tier was called Division One at this time) but the company stayed with the Blues for an additional two years until 2002 when they rebranded themselves as T-Mobile.

Everton’s £2.5million deal with Chinese electronics firm Kejian not only resulted in Mandarin writing on the Blues shirts but the acquisition of 2002 World Cup China international pair Li Weifeng and Li Tie for David Moyes’ squad.

The former a centre-back turned out just twice before returning home but the latter proved to be a competent midfielder before a broken leg hampered his progress.

Everton stayed in the Far East for their next sponsors Chang Thailand’s largest beverage company whose main product is lager.

The 13-year-association would prove to be the longest shirt sponsorship in the club’s history with new deals struck in 2005 2008 2010 and 2014.

Everton and Chang also worked in close partnership to help victims of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami which affected Thailand and many parts of the Pacific region.

In 2017 SportsPesa who billed themselves as “Africa’s leading Gaming Platform” became Everton’s shirt sponsors.

Moving their European headquarters to the Royal Liver Building on the city’s waterfront which had recently been purchased by Everton’s majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri their association also saw the Blues face East African club opposition three times for the SportPesa Trophy.

The first addition featuring Prodigal Son Wayne Rooney’s return to his boyhood club after 13 years at Manchester United saw Everton defeat Kenyan side Gor Mahia 2-1 in Tanzania’s National Stadium in Dar es Salaam.

The following season Gor Mahia came to Goodison Park and were thrashed 4-0 by a Blues shadow squad in November before Marco Silva’s side suffered the ignominy of a 2019 penalty shoot-out defeat to minnows Kariobangi Sharks after a 1-1 draw at the Moi International Sports Centre in Kasarani Nairobi.

However in September 2019 SportPesa halted operations in Kenya after a rise in tax on betting stakes with Everton confirming their early parting of the ways in February the following year stating: “This has been a difficult decision but one that allows us to best deliver on our commercial plan and to grasp the new opportunities now open to us.”

Since September 2017 in line with a relaxing of Premier League regulations between September 2017 and the end of the 2019/20 season Everton also carried Angry Birds as a secondary shirt sponsor on the left sleeve of shirts but this has been blank again since the deal expired.

Everton confirmed Cazoo as their shirt sponsor in June 2020 signing a three-year deal with the online car retailer believed to be worth £9.6million per annum.

Cazoo also sponsor Aston Villa and are set to continue with them next season but on Friday it was confirmed that the Blues had chosen to activate a break clause in their deal a year early.",,,,,,

Empires often follow the course of a Greek tragedy bringing about precisely the fate that they sought to avoid. That certainly is the case with the American Empire as it dismantles itself in not-so-slow motion.

The basic assumption of economic and diplomatic forecasting is that every country will act in its own self-interest. Such reasoning is of no help in today’s world. Observers across the political spectrum are using phrases like “shooting themselves in their own foot” to describe U.S. diplomatic confrontation with Russia and allies alike.

For more than a generation the most prominent U.S. diplomats have warned about what they thought would represent the ultimate external threat: an alliance of Russia and China dominating Eurasia. America’s economic sanctions and military confrontation has driven them together and is driving other countries into their emerging Eurasian orbit.

American economic and financial power was expected to avert this fate. During the half-century since the United States went off gold in 1971 the world’s central banks have operated on the Dollar Standard holding their international monetary reserves in the form of U.S. Treasury securities U.S. bank deposits and U.S. stocks and bonds. The resulting Treasury-bill Standard has enabled America to finance its foreign military spending and investment takeover of other countries simply by creating dollar IOUs. U.S. balance-of-payments deficits end up in the central banks of payments-surplus countries as their reserves while Global South debtors need dollars to pay their bondholders and conduct their foreign trade.

This monetary privilege – dollar seignorage – has enabled U.S. diplomacy to impose neoliberal policies on the rest of the world without having to use much military force of its own except to grab Near Eastern oil.

The recent escalation U.S. sanctions blocking Europe Asia and other countries from trade and investment with Russia Iran and China has imposed enormous opportunity costs – the cost of lost opportunities – on U.S. allies. And the recent confiscation of the gold and foreign reserves of Venezuela Afghanistan and now Russia along the targeted grabbing of bank accounts of wealthy foreigners (hoping to win their hearts and minds along with recovery of their sequestered accounts) has ended the idea that dollar holdings or those in its sterling and euro NATO satellites are a safe investment haven when world economic conditions become shaky.

So I am somewhat chagrined as I watch the speed at which this U.S.-centered financialized system has de-dollarized over the span of just a year or two. The basic theme of my Super Imperialism has been how for the past fifty years the U.S. Treasury-bill standard has channeled foreign savings to U.S. financial markets and banks giving Dollar Diplomacy a free ride. I thought that de-dollarization would be led by China and Russia moving to take control of their economies to avoid the kind of financial polarization that is imposing austerity on the United States. But U.S. officials are forcing them to overcome whatever hesitancy they had to de-dollarize.

I had expected that the end of the dollarized imperial economy would come about by other countries breaking away. But that is not what has happened. U.S. diplomats have chosen to end international dollarization themselves while helping Russia build up its own means of self-reliant agricultural and industrial production. This global fracture process actually has been going on for some years now starting with the sanctions blocking America’s NATO allies and other economic satellites from trading with Russia.For Russia these sanctions had the same effect that protective tariffs would have had.

Russia had remained too enthralled by free-market ideology to take steps to protect its own agriculture or industry. The United States provided the help that was needed by imposing domestic self-reliance on Russia (via sanctions). When the Baltic states lost the Russian market for cheese and other farm products Russia quickly created its own cheese and dairy sector – while becoming the world’s leading grain exporter.

Russia is discovering (or is on the verge of discovering) that it does not need U.S. dollars as backing for the ruble’s exchange rate. Its central bank can create the rubles needed to pay domestic wages and finance capital formation. The U.S. confiscations thus may finally lead Russia to end neoliberal monetary philosophy as Sergei Glaziev has long been advocating in favor of MMT.

The same dynamic undercutting ostensible U.S aims has occurred with U.S. sanctions against the leading Russian billionaires. The neoliberal shock therapy and privatizations of the 1990s left Russian kleptocrats with only one way to cash out on the assets they had grabbed from the public domain. That was to incorporate their takings and sell their shares in London and New York. Domestic savings had been wiped out and U.S. advisors persuaded Russia’s central bank not to create its own ruble money.

The result was that Russia’s national oil gas and mineral patrimony was not used to finance a rationalization of Russian industry and housing. Instead of the revenue from privatization being invested to create new Russian means of protection it was burned up on nouveau-riche acquisitions of luxury British real estate yachts and other global flight-capital assets. But the effect of making the Russian dollar sterling and euro holdings hostage has been to make the City of London too risky a venue in which to hold their assets. By imposing sanctions on the richest Russians closest to Putin U.S. officials hoped to induce them to oppose his breakaway from the West and thus to serve effectively as NATO agents-of-influence. But for Russian billionaires their own country is starting to look safest.

For many decades now the Federal Reserve and Treasury have fought against gold recovering its role in international reserves. But how will India and Saudi Arabia view their dollar holdings as Biden and Blinken try to strong-arm them into following the U.S. “rules-based order” instead of their own national self-interest? The recent U.S. dictates have left little alternative but to start protecting their own political autonomy by converting dollar and euro holdings into gold as an asset free of political liability of being held hostage to the increasingly costly and disruptive U.S. demands.

U.S. diplomacy has rubbed Europe’s nose in its abject subservience by telling its governments to have their companies dump the Russian assets for pennies on the dollar after Russia’s foreign reserves were blocked and the ruble’s exchange rate plunged. Blackstone Goldman Sachs and other U.S. investors moved quickly to buy up what Shell Oil and other foreign companies were unloading.

Nobody thought that the postwar 1945-2020 world order would give way this fast. A truly new international economic order is emerging although it is not yet clear just what form it will take. But “prodding the Bear” with the U.S./NATO confrontation with Russia has passed critical-mass level. It no longer is just about Ukraine. That is merely the trigger a catalyst for driving much of the world away from the US/NATO orbit.

The next showdown may come within Europe itself. Nationalist politicians could seek to lead a break-away from the over-reaching U.S. power-grab over its European and other Allies trying in vain to keep them dependent on U.S.-based trade and investment. The price of their continuing obedience is to impose cost-inflation on their industry while relinquishing their democratic electoral politics in subordination to America’s NATO proconsuls.

These consequences cannot really be deemed “unintended.” Too many observers have pointed out exactly what would happen – headed by President Putin and Foreign Secretary Lavrov explaining just what their response would be if NATO insisted in backing them into a corner while attacking Eastern Ukrainian Russian-speakers and moving heavy weaponry to Russia’s Western border. The consequences were anticipated. The neocons in control of U.S. foreign policy simply didn’t care. Recognizing its concerns was deemed to make one a Putinversteher.

European officials did not feel uncomfortable in telling the world about their worries that Donald Trump was crazy and upsetting the apple cart of international diplomacy. But they seem to have been blindsided at the Biden Administration’s resurgence of visceral Russia-hatred by Secretary of State Blinken and Victoria Nuland-Kagan. Trump’s mode of expression and mannerisms may have been uncouth but America’s neocon gang has much more globally threatening confrontation obsessions. For them it was a question of whose reality would emerge victorious: the “reality” that they believed they could make or economic reality outside of U.S. control.

What foreign countries have not done for themselves – replacing the IMF World Bank and other arms of U.S. diplomacy – American politicians are forcing them to do. Instead of European Near Eastern and Global South countries breaking away out of their own calculation of their long-term economic interests America is driving them away as it has done with Russia and China. More politicians are seeking voter support by asking whether they would be better served by new monetary arrangements to replace dollarized trade investment and even foreign debt service.

The energy and food price squeeze is hitting Global South countries especially hard coinciding with their own Covid-19 problems and the looming dollarized debt service coming due. Something must give. How long will these countries impose austerity to pay foreign bondholders?

How will the U.S. and European economies cope in the face of their sanctions against imports of Russian gas and oil cobalt aluminum palladium and other basic materials? American diplomats have made a list of raw materials that their economy desperately needs and which therefore are exempt from the trade sanctions being imposed. This provides Mr. Putin a handy list of pressure points to use in reshaping world diplomacy in the process helping European and other countries break away from the Iron Curtain that America has imposed to lock its satellites into dependence on high-priced U.S. supplies.

But the final breakaway from NATO’s adventurism must come from within the United States itself. As this year’s midterm elections approach politicians will find a fertile ground in showing U.S. voters that the price inflation led by gasoline and energy is a policy byproduct of the Biden administration blocking Russian oil and gas exports. Gas is needed not only for heating and energy production but to make fertilizer of which there already is a world shortage. This is exacerbated by blocking Russian and Ukrainian grain exports sending U.S. and European food prices soaring.

Trying to force Russia to respond militarily and thereby looking bad to the rest of the world is turning out to be a stunt aimed simply at demonstrating Europe’s need to contribute more to NATO buy more U.S. military hardware and lock itself deeper into trade and monetary dependence on the United States. The instability that this has caused is turning out to have the effect of making the United States look as threatening as Russia.

Showtime

The new series ""Super Pumped"" tells the story of Travis Kalanick and Uber's early days.

The show is based on a book by a New York Times reporter but it can be hard to tell what's real.

The show embellishes but most of episode 1 includes things that actually happened in real life.

At the Uber depicted in the new Showtime series ""Super Pumped"" brashness is celebrated rules are flouted and winning is the only priority.

""Super Pumped"" is based on New York Times' reporter Mike Isaac's book of the same name. The show follows the early days of Uber and the antics of Kalanick ending in his ouster at the hands of Gurley and Uber's board.

But this is the Hollywood version of what was once Silicon Valley's most celebrated and successful startup. After all hard-charging CEO Travis Kalanick is portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt perhaps best-known for playing a sensitive ex-boyfriend in ""500 Days of Summer."" The legendary venture capitalist Billy Gurley a former college basketball player who's 6'9"" is played by the more average-sized Kyle Chandler (sorry Coach Taylor).

Uber's rise and subsequent meltdown shocked Silicon Valley and after watching the first episode of the show it can be hard to know what's real and what's embellished — or flat-out made up. Here are the six wildest details from the first episode and whether they happened in real life.

Garrett Camp came up with the idea for Uber but Kalanick pretended it was his

In the show's portrayal of the first meeting between Kalanick and Gurley Kalanick appears to take credit for the idea for Uber. He tells Gurley that he had the idea while standing at the top of the Eiffel Tower but that ""Garrett contributed a lot too.""

The show pivots to reveal that the idea for Uber actually came from Camp the founder of internet discovery platform StumbleUpon who presented his idea to a skeptical Kalanick.

According to Isaac's book Uber was Camp's idea and it did take some convincing for Kalanick to come onboard — Kalanick initially didn't want to run it. However there's no evidence that Kalanick ever misrepresented Uber's founding story to Gurley.

Kalanick paid cabs to steer clear of his first meeting with Gurley in order to show off Uber's technology

Following Kalanick and Gurley's first meeting a slightly inebriated Gurley announces he's going to take a cab home. But there are none to be found so a helpful Kalanick calls Gurley an Uber a black car that seems to arrive in seconds.

As they come close to closing the deal Kalanick admits he paid off all the cab drivers in advance so they'd stay away from the bar where he and Gurley met — Gurley admits he wasn't too drunk to drive after all that it was all a test.

While it's a fun anecdote of a CEO and a VC trying to outfox each other there's no evidence that it ever happened in real life.

Kalanick would ask potential employees if they were assholes during job interviews

""Super Pumped"" opens with Kalanick looking straight at the camera. ""So you want to work for Uber"" he says. ""I have one question for you: Are you an asshole?""

When a prospective hire later answers yes Kalanick assures him it's the right answer. ""Because if you're not you'll never make it at Uber"" he says.







While it's fun to consider whether being a jerk was a prerequisite for landing a job at the ride-sharing startup there's no evidence that Kalanick ever actually asked this in job interviews.

Instead the show seems to be basing the question on Uber's company culture in the early years which included such values as ""always be hustlin'"" and encouraged ""toe-stepping."" This culture resulted in a ""Hobbesian jungle"" where ""you can never get ahead unless someone else dies"" one employee told The Guardian in 2017. When board member Arianna Huffington stepped in to help Uber through its 2017 crisis she described Uber's staff as being full of ""brilliant jerks.""

UberCab dropped ""cab"" from its name to avoid heavy fines from the San Francisco taxi authority

Back in 2010 Uber was still known as UberCab and had been served with a cease-and-desist from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. If UberCab didn't stop operating in the city immediately it said the company could be fined $5000 per trip and company executives could face jail time.

In the show Emil Michael an incoming exec points out that the MTA regulates cabs — if Uber simply changed its name it could skirt the fines.

This portrayal is mostly true according to Isaac's book although Michael wasn't involved in the conversation — it was Kalanick who realized the company could easily give the middle finger to the city.

""We'll ignore it"" he said of the fines. ""We'll drop 'Cab' from our name.""

Kalanick filled a file box with trash to make it look like they had more pro-Uber petitions from riders

In ""Super Pumped"" Kalanick has an idea for forcing San Francisco's hand: get riders to sign petitions saying how much they loved and relied on Uber. Uber collected hundreds of petitions stashing them in file boxes to bring to city hall. In the show Kalanick fills a file box with trash to make it look like Uber had more signed petitions than it did.

""What if they check 'em?"" someone asks. ""Then we become baristas"" Kalanick responds.

This story is based on something that did happen in real life: When Uber attempted to expand in St. Louis the city blocked it from operating. In response Uber employees hand-delivered nine file boxes labeled ""1000 PETITIONS."" A reporter later discovered that none of the boxes contained petitions — they were filled with six-packs of water bottles according to Isaac's book.

Uber's ""safe rides fee"" was a scam to help its public perception and make more money

Early in ""Super Pumped"" Kalanick has a problem: the company has passenger safety issues and it's creating a public relations nightmare.

Uber's onetime CEO Ryan Graves and another employee present a solution: a ""safe rides fee.""

Uber will add a dollar to every ride in the name of creating a safer experience for passengers — Uber will make a driver training video and pocket the rest. Passengers won't mind Kalanick surmises because ""once we get them in our car we can charge whatever we want to the next time.""

According to Isaac's reporting this happened in real life adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for Uber over several years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90di1hbmQtcmFkaW8vMjAyMi9tYXIvMDUvdWJlci1qb3NlcGgtZ29yZG9uLWxldml0dC10cmF2aXMta2FsYW5pY2stc3VwZXItcHVtcGVk0gFraHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3R2LWFuZC1yYWRpby8yMDIyL21hci8wNS91YmVyLWpvc2VwaC1nb3Jkb24tbGV2aXR0LXRyYXZpcy1rYWxhbmljay1zdXBlci1wdW1wZWQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘It’s kind of a tragedy’: behind the battle for power at Uber,"In dark jacket grey sweater and white undershirt Travis Kalanick was relaxed in comfy chair coffee mug before him shooting the breeze with late-night TV host Stephen Colbert. Then came a cry from the studio audience.

“Shame! Respect drivers’ labour! Respect professional full-time work!” The camera picked out a T-shirt-wearing protester who standing and cupping his hands to his mouth yelled: “Uber exploits taxi drivers for profit and kills professional full-time work in the taxi industry!”

Colbert asked the man to sit down and joked to Uber co-founder Kalanick: “That’s my cousin. I apologise.”

This September 2015 incident – a rare moment when a king of the gig economy was confronted by one his powerless subjects – was not broadcast at the time but finally aired on CBS last month when Colbert interviewed actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt about playing Kalanick on the small screen.

Super Pumped: the Battle for Uber is the story of how Kalanick led the fastest-growing startup in history taking on incumbent taxi industries in San Francisco America and the world. It is a compelling portrayal of a man who is in turns charming and obnoxious genius and crazy superhero and supervillain and who gives new meaning to the word “disrupter”.

It is also a glimpse of a tech industry where there is a thin line between creation and destruction and bad boys such as Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg Tesla’s Elon Musk and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey are criticised for moving fast and breaking things with little regard for who gets hurt.

Beth Schacter an executive producer of Super Pumped told a recent Washington Post Live event: “They’re kind of modern kings and in that Shakespearean way of wanting to examine what makes a king and what brings a king down it’s kind of where many of the kings are either in the high finance area or in Silicon Valley.”

Kalanick’s rise and fall was certainly Shakespearean. Born in Los Angeles in 1976 he learned to computer code at school and dropped out of university to start his first tech company when he was 22.

He co-founded Uber in 2009 launching its first smartphone app UberCab the following year – a revolutionary idea for passengers to hail and pay for taxis on their phones and for drivers to work when they wanted. The first episode of Super Pumped finds Kalanick acknowledging that the original concept came from friend Garrett Camp making his pitch to venture capitalist Bill Gurley (Kyle Chandler) and defying San Francisco city bureaucrats who want to crush him.

With Gurley’s financial backing and mentorship. Kalanick embarked on a rule-breaking self-mythologising global conquest that saw bitter battles with entrenched interests that helped drag transport into the 21st century (“We are in the world changing business” says the screen version of Kalanick. “At least I am.”)

By 2017 the company had grown to an international operation with a market value of nearly $70bn. But in February that year a blogpost by former employee Susan Fowler blew the whistle on sexism and “bro culture” at the company and in May Kalanick was devastated by the death of his mother Bonnie 71 in a boating accident.

By June Kalanick’s wild ride at Uber came to an end when he was forced to resign over a series of lawsuits against the company over workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. It was at last a reckoning over years of poor treatment of workers and the dangerous conceit that high performers went unpunished.

In short Super Pumped has a lot of material to work with. It does so with slickly produced tightly scripted crisply acted relish (Uma Thurman plays Arianna Huffington the co-founder of the Huffington Post who was an Uber board member).

The series is made for Showtime by the team behind Billions. Its primary source material is a bestselling non-fiction book of the same name by Mike Isaac a New York Times technology correspondent who served a consultant factchecker and co-executive producer. He has met Kalanick on numerous occasions though the entrepreneur did not want to participate in the book.

Isaac says by phone from Oakland California: “He’s a very charismatic person. You might not immediately vibe with the guy because he’s a little more masculine than let’s say other folks that you want to hang out with but he’s very sharp very intense very driven willing to argue his points but he can also charm you.

“The last time I talked to him was right before he went to testify in court in the Google/Waymo trial and he was still very magnetic. People flock to him in a certain way and he has the charisma which is an important quality to have if you’re going to be leading the company.”

Asked if he likes Kalanick personally Isaac admits to having mixed feelings. “On the one hand I try to see the whole person and there’s more depth to him than you would have carried away if you were just reading the headlines a few years ago.

“That said you can’t divorce the person from the sort of things they cause in their life. Under him Uber became a really dysfunctional place for a lot of people to work. Some people might say he created this new labour model that I know a lot of folks are upset exists.

“So I don’t think he’s a cartoonish villain; I don’t think he’s a complete angel. He like all of us exists somewhere in the middle. He has redeeming qualities as well as things that he probably has to answer for at some point.”

Gordon-Levitt widely seen as a Hollywood nice guy is cast against type to great effect. At some moments the viewer sees his vulnerability and complex family relationships and roots for him to succeed; at others we wince at his gigantic ego and callous treatment of drivers and passengers as commodities.

After the first episode was broadcast Isaac received text messages from sources saying the actor nailed Kalanick perfectly. “Travis is a ruthless person very driven; megalomaniac is probably a good way to describe him.

“But I also think that you wouldn’t understand that he has nuance to him if you were just reading the headlines from 2017. So I saw them bringing in Joe as someone who could bring depth to the character and round him out in a way that’s not one-dimensional was really important.”

Gordon-Levitt’s performance renders Kalanick as a swashbuckling visionary businessman facing down opponents through sheer force of will; but also as the boss from hell willing to belittle and insult his employees without pity.

Isaac adds: “He was very good at explaining the math and theory behind why it all worked out but lacked a kind of empathy for the people directly involved a lot of the time.

“It’s one of these things where he’s a brilliant guy and lives in a sort of fantastical world of how things should be but isn’t able to connect on an emotional level to someone who’s struggling or be able to empathise in the moment with someone who’s going through a hard time.”

At one point in the series Gurley observes: “The best thing about Travis is he’ll run through walls to win. The worst thing about him is he thinks everything’s a wall.” Like a politician who is great at campaigning but terrible at governing the qualities in Kalanick that helped Uber rise proved useless once it reached the top. In fact they planted seeds of self-destruction.

Isaac says: “The problem with Travis is that he always felt like he was an underdog and fighting and in one mode and that’s good while you’re coming up. But Uber eventually won it became ubiquitous and it destroyed the taxi industry and he wasn’t able to change out of that fighting mode into a normal ‘OK we can be peaceful and operate in cities without having to fight everyone.’

“Maybe there’s a different version of history if he would have been able to grasp that it’s kind of a tragedy because he wasn’t able to see it until it was too late.”

A similar ambivalence hovers over the legacy of Uber Lyft and other apps that some regard as avatars of progress much as the motor car rendered the horse and carriage obsolete and others say are new weapons of capitalist exploitation. The gig economy is worth more than $5tn a year worldwide and was accelerated further by the pandemic but offers little by way of trade unions or safety net.

Isaac reflects: “A lot of folks ask would Uber be Uber if it weren’t for Travis? Can you will a sector like this into being when the folks who are entrenched in the first place aren’t going to let you play ball? Is there a nicer version of Uber that could have come into being?

“There are a lot of amazing things that the company has done just in providing transport for folks who maybe were too scared to get home when they get off work at two in the morning and don’t want to wait for the bus. I know a lot of folks who have to do that sort of terrible commute and feel safer doing an Uber.

“But then there are also the folks who feel that they’re exploiting workers and [that] this model might not be good for workers in the long run. Like many different kinds of new innovations in the world it brings with it a host of issues. Like anything with Uber it’s never easy or straightforward.”

Today Uber has around 118 million monthly active users around the world while Kalanick is still a billionaire and running a property development company. Super Pumped is a new take on an old question: can you be a nice guy chief executive and still make world changing things happen?

Isaac comments: “For really big swings and big moonshot ideas you kind of have to be a little … if not crazy then at least an eternal optimist. It takes a lot to believe in this mission.

“That’s why you get these larger-than-life personalities. I don’t think it’s an accident that they tend to go hand-in-hand.”

Another perspective is offered by journalist Brad Stone author of The Upstarts: How Uber Airbnb and the Killer Companies of the New Silicon Valley Are Changing the World who has interviewed and dined with Kalanick.

He says by phone: “He was confident to the point of maybe arrogance but a lot of entrepreneurs are. There was a lot of swagger and there had to be because they were trying to change a pretty big industry.

“The whole thing was put on steroids. Suddenly the speed at which they went from a small startup in San Francisco and Washington trying to fight regulators to being valued at $50bn and having thousands of employees the wheels came off.”

Stone adds: “At a certain point they just got besieged by not only their success but the culmination of all the mistakes and the problems with growing that fast – and the fact that his confidence did turn into hubris.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3VwZXItcHVtcGVkLXRoZS1iYXR0bGUtZm9yLXViZXItc2Vhc29uLTEtZXBpc29kZS0yLXJlY2FwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Super Pumped: The Battle For Uber Season 1 Episode 2 Recap,"Speaking to Travis Kalanick on an airport tarmac with fine views of the private jets owned by Silicon Valley success stories Bill Gurley likens himself to Phil Jackson the Chicago Bulls coach who led the team to six NBA championships around his temperamental star Michael Jordan. Bill tells Travis that Jackson built a system around Jordan and as the guard became a superstar “he needed Phil’s voice less.” The analogy is a great one only not the way Bill frames it. The title of Sam Smith’s The Jordan Rules an extraordinary chronicle of the team’s first title season refers to Jordan playing by his own rules not the system Jackson was trying to build around him. Jordan was already the biggest star in basketball and in Smith’s telling the Bulls were a miserable and dysfunctional unit right up until the moment they won it all. Jackson was a master at managing big egos but they could not be corralled.

Bill would like to think that he’s the Phil Jackson type who’s guiding his temperamental star to glory but he’ll be lucky if he’s the actual Phil Jackson who spent that season working on a complicated “triangle offense” in the vain hope that Jordan might want to take part in it. His bit of staging does little to convince Travis to lean on him for advice. Travis is fully in “You know what’s cool? A billion dollars” mode dismissing the private jets as if they were cheap balsa-wood airplane models. He’s after Larry Ellison money. Jeff Bezos money. Elon Musk money. It’s as if Bill wasn’t listening when he told the story about LeBron James turning down Reebok’s check because he knows what he’s worth. To him Bill writes the checks. Any other input smacks of helicopter parenting if not outright treachery.

One gentle piece of advice he’d like to give Travis: Don’t blow tens of millions of dollars on an employee party in Las Vegas. The “X to the X” party which Uber had officially referred to as a “private tech conference” takes up the bulk of this episode and for a good reason. In last week’s episode I talked about how Super Pumped is less The Social Network than The Wolf of Wall Street even though Travis aspires more to the casual sociopathy of Mark Zuckerberg than the bridge-and-tunnel populism of Jordan Belfort. This week has two moments that echo The Wolf of Wall Street: The first is the out-of-control nature of the party itself which reflects the work-hard-play-hard philosophy of a boss who doesn’t like to set limits for his people (or himself). They’re all pulling off a swindle together and they should be rewarded for it whether that involves marching bands and prostitutes parading through the office or tossing a keg into a crowded pool from a hotel window. The second is Travis’ “core values” speech in Vegas which may look like a Ted Talk or an Apple conference presentation but is more like Belfort grabbing the mic at Stratton Oakmont and firing his people up.

Bill isn’t an idiot. He sees it coming because he’s seen it before. In the sharpest exchange in the episode he shares what he’s learned about founders with his junior partners:

“When I was younger and new I used to think they were all Jesus Christ because their followers never questioned them. They did actual provable miracles. Then I began to see that half of them were indeed on the side of the angels and half of them were some version of David Koresh.”

“How do you see the split now?”

“Oh they’re all Koresh. The trick is to flee the cult and get out of the compound the second before they burn it to the ground.”

Bill hints at an essential point about Silicon Valley “disruptors” like Travis: They’re eager to upend entire sectors of the economy like the taxi and livery business but they’re not necessarily replacing them with a sustainable business model. And they’re definitely not replacing them with a model that’s beneficial long term to employees and customers who Travis and his brain trust are finding new ways to fleece. As Uber prepares to take on New York City — which promises to be both its biggest challenge and the gateway to its success in America and around the globe — there are dreams of “surge” pricing during those peak hours when the demand for rides outstrips availability. The taxi system lacks the flexibility to set its own price on demand.

It also lacks the moral flexibility (and technical sophistication) to eliminate threats through extralegal means. “X to the X” introduces Fred Armisen as Erich England a code-enforcement inspector in Portland Oregon who gets creative in trying to slow Uber’s growth in the city by issuing citations to drivers and impounding their cars. In San Francisco the combination of Bill’s money Austin’s on-the-ground aggression and a little corporate creativity were enough to secure drivers and conquer the city but unique situations call for unique solutions. And for Travis and his team the solution to combating Erich’s system of ticketing and towing Uber drivers is to fight fire with fire and simply not give him a ride. This involves using a digital tool called Greyball to identify individual riders like Erich and deny them service.

The Greyball deployment and the party in Vegas may be two separate narrative strands but the show holds them in sharp juxtaposition as signs of a startlingly reckless corporate culture. The show fudges a bit on the timing of the infamous “URGENT URGENT” company-wide email which was actually written in advance of the Miami party rather than the Vegas party and the scene where Travis and Emil dictate the email to Angie while drinking seems fanciful too. But it certainly doesn’t read like a sober document and the idea of sending it out to all employees without it immediately leaking to the press is both naïve and suggestive of Travis’s cult of personality. He treats employees as disciples turning his Sermon on the Mount into a raging kegger. The hangover that follows will throb forever.

Off The Meter

• While Super Pumped certainly doesn’t count itself among Travis’ disciples it does share his contempt for the sniveling government officials propping up the taxi and livery industry. As depicted England’s scheme to crush Uber in Portland is not only grossly unfair to drivers but smug in its execution too.

• Quentin Tarantino’s narration is a seemingly fun touch but it’s deployed so sporadically as a device that it feels out of rhythm with the rest of the show. An omniscient storyteller has a “Voice of God” quality that can be effective but the first response to it shouldn’t be “Wait who’s talking now?”

• As with Billions Super Pumped is loaded with pungent references to pop culture. Here Travis calls transportation agencies “more incestuous than the clans in Deliverance and twice as likely to fuck you over.” And in predicting that his minions will not leak to the press he says “They’re going to make Silent Bob look chatty as Tracy Flick.”

• Angie’s line after Travis brusquely leaves her for another woman hits the center of the target: “I guess I was just your seed round.”

• When Travis includes Beyoncé and Jay-Z in the background of a video call with Gabi my mind immediately drifted to the scene in Dazed and Confused where a kid who just graduated eighth grade casually mentions to his buddies that he bought “a sixer” at the liquor store.

• If you want to read the complete URGENT email — and you should because it’s deranged — it’s still up on Vox along with some good context for it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL3ViZXItbHlmdC1kcml2ZXItY2hpY2Fnby1jYXJqYWNraW5nLWNyaW1lLzExNjI0Mjg4L9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2FtcC91YmVyLWx5ZnQtZHJpdmVyLWNoaWNhZ28tY2FyamFja2luZy1jcmltZS8xMTYyNDI4OC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New ride share driver office opens in Park Ridge IL as Lyft Uber drivers face crime carjacking in Chicago area,"New Chicago area rideshare driver safety office opens amid carjackings crime

PARK RIDGE Ill. (WLS) -- The Illinois Independent Drivers Guild opened a new Chicago area office for rideshare drivers across the state.

Organizers said it's a place where they can receive in-person support as drivers continue to fear for their lives on the road.

""We are seeing carjackings and assaults of gig workers at an alarming rate. It is absolutely at a crisis"" said Lenny Sanchez director of the Independent Drivers Guild Illinois chapter.

The increased violence toward rideshare drivers and the dangers of the job advocates said are being felt among Illinois drivers.

""That became real clear when I got car jacked back in January"" said John Baker who is a rideshare driver.

Baker said he was carjacked two months ago while picking up a rider in Chicago's Auburn Gresham neighborhood.

""The woman sprayed me with pepper spray and told me to get out of the car"" Baker said. ""I'm standing on the side walk and the pepper spray hurting like hell. Oh my gosh they got my car. But I'm alive.""

Sanchez said he also knows the fear well.

""It drives me crazy because I also had someone pull out a firearm on me and everything. I'm one of the lucky ones"" Sanchez said.

That's why Sanchez said opening a hub for drivers with safety resources and legal support is necessary.

""There's a ton of vulnerability there there is an anonymity that exists with the users and the carjackers know that. That if they can open an account and be completely anonymous on the other end and for us to get justice is I hate to say this but it's almost impossible"" Sanchez said.

To improve safety Sanchez said he wants riders to have to submit a selfie. The photo would not be shared with the driver but with the app in case of a crime so they can later be used as evidence.

Sanchez said he also wants riders to upload an ID that matches their form of payment to verify it's them requesting the ride.

""We believe that these steps are some things the applications can easily take to deter the criminals"" Sanchez said.

As gas prices rise across the county she's feeling the impact.

“So typically my car it would be about $30 to fill it up it cost me $80 dollars and I had to fill it up twice on Friday and Saturday"" says Wozniak.

While customers may be paying more for rides Wozniak says Uber is still paying drivers the same amount per mile and minute.

“You may be paying $20 more for a ride that would typically be $10 but I am not seeing that difference I am still getting paid 63 cents a mile and ten cents a minute so our side of it doesn't change"" says Wozniak



Wozniak is now driving 12 hours at a time just to make sure she makes up the difference.

“The more gas prices go up the more I am going to have to work the more days I am going to have to throw in there"" says Wozniak.

As rideshare costs rise Wozniak says people are not tipping like they used to.

“Some people see that they are paying $80 for a ride and because they are paying $80 they think we are getting that whole fee and we are not so they will say 'oh I am paying this much for this drive I am not tipping you' ... We hear that a lot and it sucks"" says Wozniak.

We reached out to Uber for a statement on the matter. Their statement read:

Fenty Beauty is a cosmetics line owned by Rihanna and known for its inclusive range of shades and colors true to its mission “Beauty For All.” On Feb. 17 Rihanna announced that the line previously only available online or at Sephora would be sold in Ulta Beauty stores starting March 6.

But getting the line set up in Ulta stores appeared to be an unwelcome chore according to the TikToker known as Alexis (@alexismacieglam).

In her TikTok video which has received over 70000 views Alexis said she worked an hour more than her scheduled shift after being tasked with setting up the new beauty display.

“We could not leave until everything was up every tester was made and everything was done” Alexis said. “I’m tired frustrated and I want to cry a little bit. But I’ll be fine.”

The TikToker explained that beauty drops “bother” her as an Ulta employee because she’s not paid more to set up the planograms or merchandise displays which she described as strenuous work. She said she gets paid the same amount as she would working as a cashier for the day.

She said setting up the display involved plugging and unplugging wires “that haven’t been touched since the store opened” lifting “extremely heavy” things figuring out how to assemble confusing and complex pieces and reading diagrams that “don’t always make sense.” Alexis said she didn’t sign up for this work when she took the job.

“I genuinely believe Ulta needs to bring in outside vendors to do these types of things” Alexis said in the video.

TikTok viewers who claimed to also be current or former Ulta workers empathized with Alexis saying they experienced similar working conditions at their Ulta locations.

“Former ulta ops manager here—i do not miss this at all. one of the reasons i left. they’ll work you you the ground and make you feel replaceable” one viewer commented on the video.

“Bro I just got off my shift [crying emoji] midnight shifts take a toll on you I’m exhausted. They really should pay us more when doing this” another viewer commented.

One TikToker wrote “God i will not miss this at ULTA it was so much work for such little pay unfortunately.”

Another said “This is how you know your ulta is on top of it when they start the night before not at 6am with 4 people [crying emojis].”

Others tried to comfort Alexis offering apologies and telling her at least the display looked good.

“Well I’m sorry it sucked but it does look dope!!!” one user said.

“i’m so sorry:( y’all work so hard i don’t think many people realize y’all do all of this too! def need a raise” another user wrote.

The Daily Dot reached out to the creator via TikTok comment and Ulta Beauty via email.

Her 101M followers were thrilled with the announcement with one person cheekily asking 'Does it come with the model too?!'

In the promotional video for the new perfume launch the singer - born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell - spoke about her inspiration for the fragrance.

'It was like a dream. I've done a lot of amazing things and gotten to experience so many incredible things and this journey was like honestly like probably my favorite of everything.'

'Fragrance has been very very involved in my life since I can remember. I can't even stress enough how important fragrance is to me. Pretty much all based around synesthesia - it's an association of one thing with another thing.'

The Grammy Award winner also spoke about the inspiration behind the photos for the campaign.

'The inspiration for this campaign? Appreciation for the human body and I guess body positivity within yourself. Not like a statement about it it's really about embracing yourself and how you feel and how you feel like you look.'

Warm: 'Creating this fragrance I really wanted it to feel warm' she explained adding that the scent is her 'favorite smell in the world'

The exceptionally chic perfume bottle - gilded in amber-bronze - is body-shaped and features a woman's bust and face as well as an engraving.

Eilish explained that she chose the design because she is 'in love with the human body' and thinks it's 'one of the most beautiful things in the world.'

'I especially think that collarbones and necks and jaws and just like shoulders are the most beautiful thing' she said.

'I wanted to make a body that could be anybody and isn't me. And it's really not based off of anybody. It's really appreciating the human body.'

Confident: The Grammy Award winner spoke about the promotional photos for the campaign saying they were meant to exude 'body positivity within yourself'

She also specified that the fragrance is unisex and meant to be worn by 'whoever loves it.'

The fragrance starts off at $48.00 for 1.0 oz size and goes up to $68 for a full size bottle.

Kerry Washington shared all of the essentials she carried in her bag to the SAG Awards.

In her tiny clutch she fit a chocolate bar an energy drink packet and most importantly a multi-purpose makeup stick for touch-ups.

The actress says she is “obsessed” with . “It saves so much space in my purse and I love it” she said.

Kerry Washington was one of many celebrities who took on the SAG Awards with glamour beauty and grace (we’re still not over Helen Mirren’s beauty look). Washington’s all-yellow ensemble—featuring a strapless mermaid gown and matching velvet clutch—was so luxurious in fact that you’d never know a $13 multi-purpose makeup stick completed the look. Thankfully the actress was kind enough to share her little beauty secret.

While in the car on her way to the red carpet Washington a Neutrogena ambassador shared the contents of her purse on her Instagram Story per People. The handbag had only enough room for the essentials: a to keep hunger pangs at bay an to keep her stamina up and of course her go-to Neutrogena products including a  a  and the pièce de résistance: .

“This is incredible because it does so many things. It’s a touch-up color pigment for my lips my eyes and my cheeks” Washington told the camera. “It saves so much space in my purse and I love it.”

Her praise continued in her caption. “The BEST for touch-ups on eyes lips and cheeks throughout the night” she wrote. “Obsessed.”

Like the rest of the Hydro Boost line the versatile balm contains ultra-hydrating hyaluronic acid to keep makeup from looking cakey and dry. It comes in one universally flattering tint that according to the brand gives every skin tone a “healthy-looking” glow. And just in case you were concerned about using it around the eyes: It’s ophthalmologist-tested and approved for use by contact lens wearers and those with sensitive eyes.

Because it’s still a relatively new product customer reviews of the balm are slim but the few that exist are positive. “This stick made my face look great. It blended well and look so natural like I had a beautiful suntan” one Amazon reviewer writes. “This glides on smooth and has a nongreasy feeling yet feels hydrating with a little pop of color. This will be my easy go-to lip balm for my very dry lips [on] over 50 skin” another adds.

The stick was clearly a no-brainer choice for Washington and quickly earned itself a spot on the list of her favorite products right next to her holy grail item from the Hydro Boost line: the moisturizer. She uses it so often her entire family now can’t get enough.

“I’m addicted to hyaluronic acid” she told Vogue in 2020. “Moisture for me is the key to it all.”

And clearly it’s working—Washington is glowing as always. You can shop the rest of her top moisturizing picks below.

“You know he was a friend of mine” the former president told the athlete on speaker phone as recorded in a viral video. “I got along great with him.”

Mr Daly is a Republican and staunch supporter of Mr Trump. As the ex-president spoke to the golfer Mr Trump repeated a claim that he’s made frequently in recent weeks: that if he were still president Russia’s leader wouldn’t dare invade Ukraine.

“I’d say ‘Vladimir if you do it we’re hitting Moscow’” the one-term president bragged to Mr Daly. “I said ‘We’re gonna hit Moscow.’ And he sort of believed me like five per cent 10 per cent. That’s all you need. He never did it during my time John.”

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now in its third week. The United Nations has estimated that at least 227 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million have fled the country. On Sunday reports emerged that Russian soldiers were either intentionally or accidentally firing on evacuees.

As the invasion has progressed Mr Trump’s comments on Russia have swung wildly from glowing admiration to harsh condemnation and sometimes back again. In late February he called the war “genius” and Mr Putin as “smart” “savvy” and “brilliant”.

“I mean he’s taking over a country for two dollars’ worth of sanctions” he said on 23 February. “I’d say that’s pretty smart.”

But in a speech to Republican donors on Saturday in New Orleans Mr Trump struck a different tone.

Trump discussing Russia with John Daly on speaker phone is something else

“Are all of these nations going to stand by and watch perhaps millions of people be slaughtered as the onslaught continues?” he demanded according to CBS News. “At what point do countries say ‘No we can’t take this massive crime against humanity?’ We can’t let it happen. We can’t let it continue to happen.”

During his presidency Mr Trump repeatedly praised Mr Putin sided with him against his own intelligence agencies at a public press conference and held up a military aid package to Ukraine while demanding a public investigation of Joe Biden’s son Hunter.

“Nobody has ever been tougher on Russia than me” Mr Trump said on Saturday.

In the same speech the former president said the US should put Chinese flags on its fighter jets and “bomb the s*** out of Russia”.

“And then we say China did it we didn’t do it China did it and then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch” Mr Trump told the crowd according to a transcript from The Washington Post.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL2Jlcm5hcmQtdGFsbGV5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNTM2MTc30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bernard Talley Obituary (1939 - 2022) - Frisco TX - Dallas Morning News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/bernard-talley-obituary?id=33536177 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL2Jlcm5hcmQtdGFsbGV5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNTM2MTc30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The Las Vegas native’s day started off well enough with a third-place qualifying run but he couldn’t hold that track position once the race started as a tight condition sent him backwards. That plagued him throughout the day as he hovered just outside the top 10 but attrition in the latter stages opened the door for a third straight top-10 finish.

Running seventh shortly after a restart with 12 laps to go Herbst’s frustration returned as he got collected in a multi-car accident. Herbst was forced to pit road for repairs but still ended up being the top Ford in 14th.

Kyle Sieg finished 16th while brother Ryan ended up 36th after getting involved in an on-track altercation with eventual winner Ty Gibbs. The incident occurred on lap four when Gibbs tapped Sieg’s bumper sending the No. 39 Mustang into the wall. Sieg hit the wall again after a red flag delayed the race for 42 minutes and went to the garage.

Joe Graf Jr. finished 29th but was disqualified after the race for a lugnut violation.

The NASCAR Xfinity Series’ next stop is Phoenix Raceway for the United Rentals 200 on Saturday March 12 (4:30 p.m. ET on FS1 MRN SiriusXM NASCAR Radio).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcmFjZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDUvdHktZ2liYnMtbWFrZXMtaGlzLW93bi1sdWNrLWluLXhmaW5pdHktd2luLWF0LWxhcy12ZWdhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ty Gibbs makes his own luck in Xfinity win at Las Vegas,"Ty Gibbs pulled away from the field on a restart with six laps remaining and held off the hometown favorite Noah Gragson to claim his first NASCAR Xfinity Series win of the season in Saturday’s Alsco Uniforms 300 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

It was the first win of the year for Gibbs 19 the grandson of NASCAR Hall of Fame team owner and three-time Super Bowl champion head coach Joe Gibbs. He had an eventful day from the drop of the green flag. His No. 54 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota got just the nudge he needed from JR Motorsports’ Justin Allgaier on that final restart then pulled away from Allgaier’s teammate Gragson to take the lead for the first time on the day and ultimately score his fifth career series victory.

This race had a little bit of everything – from snowflakes in the air to dust-ups on the track. There were 17 lead changes 11 caution flags and a 42-minute red flag for light snow and rain.

For the first half of the race there was never more than a 15-lap period of green flag laps run between caution flags. There were seven yellow flags by Stage 2 (lap 90).

Gibbs’ day started with a run-in with veteran Ryan Sieg on lap 4 of the 200-lap race. The two made enough contact while racing hard to send Sieg’s No. 39 RSS Racing Ford hard into the outside wall. The team was still making repairs when the red flag came out for rain and reports of light snow.

With drivers standing outside their cars Sieg made his way down pit road to have what appeared to be an animated discussion with Gibbs about the incident. And Sieg was visibly still frustrated after the talk.

“It’s tough but it is what it is’’ Sieg told reporters while still waiting by his car. “He’s definitely going to have to learn his lesson you know what I mean.’’

Gibbs remained adamant that he didn’t do anything on purpose.

“I told him if my goal was to wreck you and end your day you wouldn’t have made it around another lap’’ a defiant Gibbs said.

A few minutes later he softened his tone and apologized for ruining Sieg’s day and the impact it had on the Sieg’s small family-owned team. The race re-started and only a handful of laps later Sieg pulled alongside Gibbs and looked as if he was trying to wreck Gibbs but he missed and spun out himself.

Again after the race Gibbs apologized to Sieg on live television for starting the whole episode.

“I want to apologize to the 39 (Sieg) for the contact I made it wasn’t my best decision and I’m sorry to the whole group Ryan’s family they work so hard.

“I want to say thank you to Justin Allgaier for my push too’’ Gibbs added. “I had a fun time racing with the Junior cars (JR Motorsports) too so hopefully we can keep it going and win some more races.

“Let’s go’’ he added with a scream.

Certainly it was a bitter pill for Gragson to swallow. He won both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the race and was leading when the final caution came out for a multi-car wreck in Turn 4. He lined up with Kaulig Racing’s Daniel Hemric behind him. His teammate Allgaier was behind Gibbs and Gibbs was able to pull away just enough to pull away to a nearly half-second lead before a wreck – after the white flag – froze the field.

Gragson finished runner-up followed by Hemric and JR Motorsports drivers Josh Berry and Allgaier. Landon Cassill rookie Sheldon Creed Brett Moffitt polesitter A.J. Allmendinger and Brandon Jones completed the top 10.

“I just kind of got beat at our own game there. Restarts just came up short’’ Gragson said adding “Just needed to be better. Congrats to them and we’ll keep working hard. Thankful to this team led by Luke Lambert and we’ll come back stronger next week.”

“Obviously I wanted to be in victory lane but it could be a hell of a lot worse ‘’ he said.

Though Gragson was immensely disappointed to miss out on the win this marks his consecutive second runner-up finish in 2022. He has a third place and two second-place showings and holds the Xfinity Series championship lead by 17 points over Gibbs.

The next NASCAR Xfinity Series race is scheduled for Saturday at Phoenix Raceway the United Rentals 200 (4:30 p.m. ET FS1 MRN SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). Austin Cindric is the defending winner taking the trophy over runner-up Gibbs.

Between its historic district and nearby recreation you’ll find some fantastic things to do around town.

With all the benefits of being just minutes from all of Vail Valley’s wonders Minturn makes an excellent base for exploring central Colorado. It lies in-between Avon and Vail and you can drive to either in under ten minutes. Minturn makes a perfect day trip off-the-beaten path exploring Colorado’s mountain sides.

Year-round

Sightseeing is the main draw to Minturn and it’s exceptional no matter what time of year. The town sits by the start of the Top of the Rockies Byway which heads over some dramatic scenery to Leadville. The wooded mountainsides are part of the White River National Forest which manages a myriad of multi-use trails and recreational spots.

Top of the Rockies Scenic Byway

Traversing a total of 115 miles between Minturn Frisco and Aspen the Top of the Rockies Scenic Byway is a picturesque high-altitude route that passes by some of the state’s best sites. The entire route takes 3-4 hours to complete but visitors could easily spend an entire day or more exploring this section of Colorado. Most of the route is open year-round but Independence Pass is closed during the winter.

Highlights of the byway include the scenic Tennessee Pass near Leadville Independence Pass views of Colorado’s highest 14ers and a number of small towns and beautiful lakes. The route rarely drops below 9000 feet and at the high point it reaches 12095 feet on top of Independence Pass. Be sure to stop at Leadville the highest incorporated town in the United States at over 1000 feet and also consider taking a break at Twin Lakes a small town nestled into the San Isabel National Forest.

Shopping and Dining in Downtown

Local shops and restaurants abound down Minturn’s Main Street. A tasty place for dinner is Thai Kitchen a small but well-received restaurant serving popular items like pad thai hot pot and even a variety of curries. For shopping walk one block down Main Street to Holy Toledo a fashionable consignment shop or peek in Eagle Valley Music & Comics an eclectic store selling both rare and recent comics and records.

All visitors to downtown should be sure to stop at the Minturn Saloon an iconic restaurant with memorabilia-covered walls and a great menu including tacos burgers locally sourced ribs and more. For drinks the saloon offers a number of draft beers Colorado made spirits and margaritas. The Minturn Saloon is a popular weekend destination so be sure to call for reservations before arriving.

Summer

With the weather just right it’s hard to beat anywhere in the Rockies during summertime. And Minturn is as charming and beautiful as they come. There’s just enough things to do to keep you coming back season and season. There’s plenty of camping near Minturn and Vail for both tents and RVs.

Hiking

Like many of the surrounding towns Minturn is situated in close proximity to top-tier hiking. Adventurous visitors should consider attempting a summit of Mount of the Holy Cross a beautiful mountain southwest of town that tops out at 14009 feet. The most popular route to the top is known as the North Ridge and it involves 12 miles of hiking and 5600 feet of elevation gain.

For an easier hike consider walking a portion of the Everkrisp Trail a scenic trail connecting Minturn to Eagle-Vail. The entire route clocks in at just over four miles one-way.

Finally another option is to hike Minturn Mile a famous “out-of-bounds” ski run that can be fun to walk when the snow melts. The route ends at the front door of the Minturn Saloon so plan to stop for a well-deserved bite to eat after conquering the hike.

Biking

Mountain bikers looking for a place to ride should be sure to stop at the Minturn Bike Park a free public bike park with jumps bridges and exciting technical trails. Otherwise for an intermediate route starting right outside of town look no further than the Meadow Mountain Loop. Clocking in at ten miles with 2000 feet of elevation gain this is a scenic route that winds through open meadows and majestic aspen forests.

Daring road cyclists should attempt to conquer the ride to Tennessee Pass and beyond. At approximately 21 miles from downtown to the top of the pass this is a spectacular ride featuring some of Colorado’s best views including open canyons forests and the jaw-dropping Red Cliff Bridge. If that’s not enough extend the ride approximately ten miles further to Leadville or turn around and enjoy a much easier ride down the pass back to Minturn.

Explore the Eagle River

The Eagle River flows parallel to Main Street through town so opportunities for fishing kayaking and rafting are never far away. For guided fishing consider booking a trip with Minturn Anglers a local company offering overnight floats wading trips and even guided horseback fly fishing.

For whitewater rafting Minturn is home to the Dowd Chutes an intense section of the Eagle River that contains whitewater up to Class IV. Beginners should consider consulting a nearby rafting outfitter like Arkansas Valley Adventures. If that’s too intense the nearby Lower Eagle River features gentler water that is more appropriate for kayaking and floating

Little Beach Park

The perfect place for an afternoon walk or lunchtime picnic Little Beach Park is a picturesque public space nestled directly beside the Eagle River near downtown. Visitors traveling with children will enjoy the impressive playground climbing wall and basketball court and everyone can take advantage of the picnic tables and grills scattered across the park. At the river visitors can feel free to cast a line or put in a kayak.

Blue Starlite Mini Urban Drive-In

Showing a variety of indie films and classic movies filmed sometime between the 1940s and 1980s the Blue Starlite is a small drive-in theater located right downtown. Showings generally begin at dusk and parking spots are filled on a first-come first-served basis. Gates open one hour prior to showtime so arrive early for the best spot.

Visitors can purchase admission with concessions included or without. Concessions include classic drive-in fare like popcorn hot dogs nachos candy and more. Showings occur most weekends throughout the summer with the occasional night during the week and most nights include a double feature. Dogs are welcome but they must remain leashed at all times.

Winter

Situated between two world class ski resorts Minturn is close to all the action. Thanks to its convenient access to highway I-70 you can be at a number of other winter attractions such as those in Summit County. Or take US-24 to a backcountry wonderland.

Basecamp for Skiing at Vail and Beaver Creek

Situated almost perfectly in the middle Minturn provides the perfect basecamp for exploring Beaver Creek and Vail two of Colorado’s most famous ski resorts. Vail Ski Resort features over 5000 skiable acres and nearly 200 trails but Beaver Creek’s 2000 skiable acres is nothing to scoff at. Both resorts have equipment rentals and lessons for beginners as well as a significant number of advanced runs for more experienced skiers.

Before heading back to town after a day of skiing be sure to check out Beaver Creek Village a fun area at the base of the mountain offering shopping dining and galleries. At Vail stop by Lionshead Village a pedestrian-only section of the resort with shopping dining and a scenic ice-skating rink.

Backcountry Skiing and Snowboarding

Besides the large and ever-popular ski resorts located just minutes from town Minturn is also within close proximity to great backcountry skiing. Meadow Mountain which towers above town to the west is one such option. Featuring mostly open meadows with the occasional patch of trees this is a fun intermediate mountain to ski. Visitors should keep in mind that this is a popular spot and snowmobiles are permitted.

For a much more legendary backcountry ski run consider attempting the Minturn Mile. Accessible from the top of chair 3 or 7 at Vail this famous run requires a short hike to access. Despite the name the route is around three miles in length and it loses almost 3000 feet of elevation before ending right outside of downtown. Though it’s close to Vail this is a remote and un-patrolled run so attempt with caution.

Cross-country Skiing

Minturn is the proud site of Maloit Park a cross-country skiing area with 10 kilometers of trails maintained by the Ski & Snowboard Club of Vail. Home to a number of high-level events including competitions and training for Olympic hopefuls a visit to Maloit Park offers visitors the possibility to see and practice with incredible athletes. The park also features a few ungroomed trails perfect for snowshoeing.

Another popular destination for nordic skiing is the Vail Nordic Center. With 17 kilometers of ski trails as well as 10 kilometers of snowshoe trails this is a great option for athletes of all levels. Lessons and rentals are available for beginners.

Snowmobiling

Colorado’s long cold winters provide the perfect opportunity for snowmobiling. For those looking to try out this fun activity consider renting equipment from Rocky Mountain Adventure Rentals. Located downtown this local business offers daily and half-daily snowmobile and Timbersled rentals. Rentals include helmets trailers gas and GPS tracking so visitors only need to bring a vehicle that can tow and good winter clothing.

There are a number of popular snowmobiling areas nearby among which is a large swath of land south of town near Red Cliff. The trailhead is positioned directly off of US Highway 24 and the trails wind through the Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area.

That’s a look at a slice of the fun activities to do in Minturn throughout the seasons. Add on some things to do in Vail and fun in Beaver Creek you’ll keep the thrills high all year long.",,,,,,

Disparities were observed across all WHO Regions and all income groups although the largest inequalities in the distribution of nursing personnel were found in the African region. Countries with lowest densities of nursing personnel tend to have largest Gini coefficient. On average an 11-fold difference was observed between the regions with highest nurse densities as compared to the region with lowest densities. Therefore a similar magnitude of distributional inequality exists at subnational level as compared to the global and regional differences identified in the SoWN 2020. The largest inequalities found in the present analysis were in countries in the African Region which simultaneously have the lowest overall densities of nursing. These countries face both a scarcity of nursing personnel at national level and a severe maldistribution of the few nursing resources within country. While the size of the global nursing workforce is projected to grow by approximately 8 million by 2030 approximately 70% of the growth is expected in upper middle- and high-income countries [31]. The SoWN 2020 estimated that low- and lower-middle income countries would need to increase their domestic production of nurses by about 8% per annum alongside sustained investments in the recruitment and retention of the graduates at a cost of approximately USD $10 per capita per year through 2030 [31].

Effectively and sustainably increasing investments in health worker education and employment requires multisectoral policy action. The GSHRH [7] uses a health labour market framework [41] to describe policy options that can improve the recruitment development training and retention of the health workforce with specific considerations for least developed countries and small island developing states. The retention of health workers in rural or remote area is a pervasive challenge but several acceptable and feasible policy inventions have been identified [42 43]. Policy measures tailored to the local context that simultaneously address education and training regulation incentives and support in an integrated and bundled way are proven to help reduce the geographic maldistribution of health workers [44]. Investments and policies must include safeguarding and protection of health workforce [45 46].

The Global Strategic directions for nursing and midwifery 2021–2025 [47] provides policy priorities aligned with the guidance above to ensure that nurses maximally contribute to national health goals and UHC. Policy-relevant evidence on what specifically contributes to nurses’ retention in health and care settings [48495051] including for advanced practice nurses in rural and remote settings is increasingly available [525354]. Institutionalizing these aspects requires a context-specific aligning of the education training and lifelong learning of nurses with optimized roles of nurse in the health system updating and strengthening professional regulations providing leadership and career advancement opportunities ensuring safe and supportive service delivery environments and competent management planning and forecasting of the nursing workforce to ensure nurses are where they are most needed [31 47].

The multivariate analysis identified a variety of factors potentially associated with this inequitable distribution of nursing personnel with inequity more important in countries with lower human development index with high maternal mortality and high inequity of life expectancy. It should be noted that this comparison is based on data aggregated at national level and further investigation should require all these factors being available at subnational level. There was clear opposition between higher income countries (Western Europe Japan Korea) with high development index and higher expenditure in education and the grouping of countries comprising lower income countries of Asia Central and South America. This could suggest that weaker investment in the human capital both for the active workers and for the education and that existing inequities in these areas results in inequitable distribution of nurses.

This observation is in line with the 2021 UHC Monitoring Report which found that the within-country relationship between inequalities in accessing essential health services and both the education and urbanization levels was particularly pronounced in low-income countries [55]. It also supports studies which using subnational data identified inequalities in the distribution of health workers correlation with health spending and impacts on PHC service delivery and health outcomes [565758]. Related frameworks have also suggested that inequities in various domain are intrinsically correlated and that inequities tend to cluster in particular in the poorest countries as having similar root causes [42].

Identifying root causes of inequities correlated factors and impacts upon health and well-being on the route towards UHC requires investment and political commitment to enhance country health information systems for timely accurate and disaggregated data [55]. For essential health services to be equitably available health workforce data must be available at the subnational level. This analysis demonstrated the feasibility to monitor and report the distribution of nursing personnel at the first administrative level for 58 countries. Through the progressive implementation of the National Health Workforce Accounts [35] countries can be better equipped to conduct such evaluations to inform health policy [31 59 60]. Senior government nursing leaders should be enabled to and accountable for driving the national agenda to improve and utilize nursing workforce data for health policy decision-making [31 47].

The present study has a series of limitations but nevertheless presents an important step in harmonizing approaches to understanding geographical mal distribution among nurses. While data for countries on all continents could be identified with only 58 countries included not enough data on nursing personnel distribution at subnational level exist to provide a comprehensive global description of nursing personnel inequity. These data were also from different points in time some being rather old relying on census statistics. In addition they cover different geographies and sizes therefore spatial heterogeneity is an issue. The progress on NHWA implementation would likely result in improved assessment in the coming years but countries should improve their monitoring and reporting systems to enable such critical assessment. The definition of subnational level varies between countries with sometimes states department of region being used as first-level subnational unit. In some countries these will be administrative units aligned with health planning/services in other they will be less aligned to policy intervention. These variations in definition of subnational level will remain in coming years as the United Nation Statistics Division only recently supported the use of the DegUrba methodology to classify the degree of urbanization enabling better comparison of subnational data [61].",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vbGFzdC15ZWFyLWhhbGYtYS1taWxsaW9uLWF1c3RyYWxpYW5zLWNvdWxkbnQtYWZmb3JkLXRvLWZpbGwtYS1zY3JpcHQtaGVyZXMtaG93LXRvLXJlaW4taW4tcmlzaW5nLWhlYWx0aC1jb3N0cy0xNzgzMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Last year half a million Australians couldn't afford to fill a script. Here's how to rein in rising health costs,"Nearly every Australian uses some part of the health system every year whether it be going to the GP getting a prescription filled or seeing a specialist.

Despite having a universal health-care system we often still pay for these services out of our own pockets.

Sadly these out-of-pocket payments are unaffordable for many Australians – so they skip the trip to the doctor or defer going to the chemist.

This is bad for those individuals but also bad for taxpayers and the economy. It makes people sicker widens inequities and puts further strain on the health system down the track.

In the Grattan Institute’s latest report we identify what governments should do to make health care more affordable for more Australians.

Who is missing health care because of cost?

In 2020-21 more than half a million people deferred or did not fill a prescription because of cost. Nearly half a million decided not to see a specialist because of cost.

Read more: We need more than a website to stop Australians paying exorbitant out-of-pocket health costs

People with chronic conditions have much higher health-care costs particularly if they have multiple chronic conditions; they spend between A$200-600 on average on health care each year.

But they are also less likely to be able to afford their ongoing care because their chronic condition can make it more difficult to keep or get a job.

Many of these people who are forgoing health care due to cost are younger particularly younger women:

Younger people tend to have fewer savings and can therefore find it harder to afford care. And women are more likely to have chronic health conditions. About 55% of people with two chronic conditions are women and 60% of people with three or more chronic conditions are women.

Chronic conditions are becoming more common so more and more Australians will be facing higher health-care costs and are at risk of missing needed care.

Over the past ten years average out-of-pocket payments rose by 50% and they will continue to rise unless governments act now.

What can be done?

The federal government can do much more to reduce out-of-pocket payments and avoid unnecessary costs down the line.

Cost of medicines

While Australia has a world-renowned Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) that helps keep many medications affordable Australians are still spending nearly A$3 billion on PBS-listed prescriptions each year including A$1.5 billion on mandatory co-payments and A$1.4 billion on PBS-listed prescriptions which cost less than the co-payment.

The federal government should lower the cost of prescriptions for people taking five or more medications for chronic conditions after their GP conducts a medication review triggered by a computer-generated alert.

We estimate this could reduce inappropriate medication use for about 300000 patients.

Read more: Poor and elderly Australians let down by ailing primary health system

The government should also extend the duration of prescriptions for some medications to reduce the number of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payments people have to make to pharmacies.

Tests and scans

The government should abolish the out-of-pocket burden from diagnostic services such as blood tests and scans.

Australians spend about A$400 million on these services each year – even though patients aren’t the real users of these tests doctors are.

With these services now frequently provided by large corporations the federal government should fund them directly through a commercial tender instead.

Patient enrolment

The government should expand the voluntary patient enrolment scheme to people with two or more chronic conditions.

Patient enrolment is where a patient can enrol in a GP practice and nominate a GP to be their “usual doctor”. It can help make care more affordable for people with chronic conditions by reducing their exposure to out-of-pocket payments.

Greater GP stewardship over a person’s care could reduce inefficiencies in areas such as routine repeat prescriptions and routine renewal of specialist referrals.

The government has already committed to this reform for people older than 70. If it was expanded to younger people we estimate an additional 1.7 million people would be eligible for the program.

Bulk billing

The vast majority of health services people receive outside hospital are “bulk-billed” – meaning the patient pays nothing out of pocket. But bulk-billing rates for specialists and allied health are still far too low – at about 46% for specialists and 56% for allied health.

The federal and state governments should expand the number of health-care services provided free of charge particularly in lower-income areas and areas where bulk-billing rates are especially low.

Our analysis shows that if state and federal governments invest an additional A$710 million a year on these reforms they could save Australians about A$1 billion in out-of-pockets a year and enable more people to get the care they need when they need it. That’s a healthy return on investment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDYvaXMtc2NvdHQtd2llbmVyLWtpbmRhLWdyZWF0LXllcy_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5vY3JlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzA2L2lzLXNjb3R0LXdpZW5lci1raW5kYS1ncmVhdC15ZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Scott Wiener kinda great? Yes.,"I know I know.

Sen. Scott Wiener D-San Francisco wants to tax everything. He proposed a soda tax as a county supervisor and as state senator he has proposed estate taxes and signed onto the absurdity that is ACA 11 to fund a universal health care system in California.

Scott Wiener is also a nanny-stater. He’s voted to ban plastic straws (AB 1884) and flavored tobacco products (SB 793).

But yes I will still after all of this say: He’s kinda great.

Here’s my starting point for making this admittedly peculiar line of argument — as someone who values both social and economic freedom I have no one to be enthusiastic about in the California Legislature.

Republican politicians are functionally irrelevant in the superminority so there’s really no use paying attention to them. All they can do is issue strongly worded press releases and pray that police unions continue to endorse them.

There’s independent Chad Mayes but Chad Mayes is let’s face it more compelling as a Twitter critic of the GOP than he is as a lawmaker (he couldn’t even vote against Assembly Bill 5).

Wiener’s horrible in all the ways basically all Democratic politicians are horrible to someone like me in that he advocates for a much for much more government intervention than I prefer. However unlike Republicans Wiener actually has influence and has used that influence to meaningfully advance freedom in California.

Wiener’s highest-profile efforts have been on housing. The high cost of housing in California is the primary driver of poverty in the state; it’s an impediment to economic mobility and a driver of wealth inequality. In practical terms housing production in California has not kept up with demand and the biggest reasons for that come down to government-imposed hurdles and restrictions on housing development from zoning and broader land-use restrictions to duplicative and onerous regulatory processes.

Lifting those restrictions is not only key to solving the problem of the housing shortage but it’s a free market-initiative.

Wiener recognizes that restrictions on what types of housing can be built and where are a major problem and that California can’t resolve its housing crisis and be a more affordable place to live so long as those restrictions are in place. And that’s why he’s forced needed conversations about zoning and has been scoring victories on this front.

Now here’s where some homeowners in suburbs object and say zoning restrictions as imposed by their local governments are good because they limit how property owners around them use their properties which is good because don’t you dare threaten my property values or marginally increase traffic within 10 miles of me. (I’m paraphrasing.)

But to that I say: “Nah.”

And you know who also says “Nah”? Scott Wiener.

This is usually where critics of his ideas start deflecting by invoking the need for CEQA reform but the truth is that both CEQA reform and lifting of zoning restrictions are needed.

And to that latter point Wiener has recently introduced legislation to exempt on-campus student and faculty housing developments on state university and community college campuses from CEQA. This was in response to a recent development in which a NIMBY lawsuit has resulted in UC Berkeley being forced to reconsider the admissions of thousands of students.

Comprehensive reform of CEQA is better than carve-outs but hey Wiener’s proposal will tangibly help students across the state.

What else? Prohibition has been a failure for half a century. It’s only been lucrative for cartels street gangs and the prison industrial complex while failing to help addicts making drugs deadlier fostering violence and criminalizing countless millions of people.

In an op-ed last year for NBC News Wiener presented the following insights on the drug war: “One is that criminalizing drug use does not make anyone safer. Two is that this country’s failed war on drugs is a primary reason that people from our communities of color are disproportionately incarcerated. And three is that psychedelics are a promising tool in our fight to improve treatment for mental health and addiction.”

California legislators misunderstand basic economics. Taxpayers will pay the price. Opinion | White House title insurance waiver program would hurt California residents He’s right about all of that. And he’s followed that up with proposals to decriminalize possession of psychedelics and allow for overdose prevention programs to operate. Those are meaningful contributions to individual liberty and reducing the harms of drug prohibition.

Why else is Scott Wiener kinda great? He recently voted against last year’s shady contract that gave away hundreds of millions of dollars to the prison guards union. And he’s vowed never to take police union money again. That’s better than almost anyone but former Sen. John Moorlach (who never took such money) could say.

Scott Wiener isn’t perfect. But he’s pushed the state in the right direction on housing (no small task) he’s leading on dismantling the racist drug war he’s angered the prison guards union and he’s willing to push the limits of discussion. For all of that he’s kinda great all else considered.

COVID-19 has been a watershed moment in the healthcare system. Over the last two years the pandemic exposed the healthcare eco-systems of even the most advanced economies costed millions of lives globally and – shifted norms of the ‘normal’ itself. In parallel it has engendered the need for a multi-stakeholder focus on healthcare and triggered a step jump in self-awareness levels amongst people. Overall COVID-19 has pushed the envelope of rethinking the entire healthcare system.

As India also plans to revamp the healthcare system in the wake of COVID-19 it is important to set a clear and bold vision – the one which places the patient at the center of the care. We envision a futuristic journey where the patient gets democratized access to quality healthcare across the care continuum irrespective of his location income age or gender. We need to make this journey a universal reality – where we can provide ‘quality health care’ to ‘all’ individuals which is ‘accessible anytime anywhere’ at an ‘affordable cost’. Comprehensive insurance coverage throughout the care experience is key to this ideal patient journey.

The economic impact of better health globally could add USD 12 trillion to the global GDP by 2040. These gains that could be potentially garnered steers the global economic recovery through the pandemic but more importantly can also aid in our demographic fight with an ageing population.

Our renewed understanding on the effect that health carries on society and the larger macroeconomy requires us to pivot in the way we have delivered health to our nation. Building an ecosystem that is not fragmented and can help deliver effective health outcomes throughout any season is what India should strive towards creating.

CII Health Insurance group has worked closely with various members and actively engaged with the Government towards achieving framework modules to strengthen healthcare delivery in India. CII has intensified its engagement with Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) NITI Aayog and the State Governments.

CII has also initiated series of enabling payer provider discussions where the main focus is on common pain point other than pricing. This has 2 working groups one from insurance and other from hospitals who are working on topics like customer experience discharge policy etc. This will also lead to a common platform with one voice involving all healthcare stakeholders.

Globally countries are progressing towards Universal health coverage as laid down under UN Sustainable Development Goals. However health insurance in India is highly underpenetrated at just 35% of the population of which majority is covered under Government-sponsored health insurance schemes.

The high out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure is taking a heavy toll and pushing 4% of the population below poverty line every year. Further the havoc created by COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront the need for universal health insurance coverage. As a nation today we have the opportunity to build on and scale our efforts to transform health insurance in India.

The Vision to Insure health of billion Indians by 2025 is a bold one and the imperatives include awareness through large-scale campaigns and creating pull for health insurance curating comprehensive product portfolio catering to different segments improving value proposition by driving better outcomes and lower costs building distribution muscle for last mile access and leveraging technology and data to improve efficiency in underlying healthcare and insurance infrastructure. Additionally this journey will be accelerated by designing favorable policy and guidelines to spur efforts by multiple stakeholders in the ecosystem.

(WMC) - Could the Byhalia Connection Pipeline project be revived?

Tennessee lawmakers are considering a bill that environmental activists say would make it easier to build the pipeline and others despite local opposition.

The Byhalia pipeline was one of Memphis’s most controversial environmental issues.

The pipeline would have connected the Valero oil refinery in south Memphis to Byhalia Mississippi.

Part of the pipeline would have passed through low-income Black neighborhoods in south Memphis and there were fears the pipeline would contaminate the Memphis sand aquifer where the city gets its drinking water if it leaked.

The company that wanted to build the pipeline Plains All American insisted it was safe.

But after months of fierce opposition including from former Vice President Al Gore the company canceled the project last July.

It marked a victory for environmental activists like Justin Pearson the president of Memphis Community Against Pollution.

But now he worries the victory may be short-lived.

“The reality is we knew billion-dollar corporations don’t go down quietly or easily and anticipated that they would do something else” said Pearson.

He’s concerned about House Bill 2246 by State Representative Kevin Vaughan of Collierville.

The bill was introduced in January calling for “a study of the current infrastructure of utilities operating in this state including pipelines or transmission lines used to produce or distribute a source of energy such as gas or oil to determine what improvements to the infrastructure are needed to attract development and investment to this state.”

However an amendment was introduced last week that changes the bill dramatically.

Vaughan says his bill as amended would preempt localities from creating zoning laws that prohibit the creation of critical infrastructure such as pipelines through their communities.

“We’re seeing now how we have issues with our supply chain particularly due to international events” Vaughan told his colleagues in a subcommittee hearing last week. “This is a situation where it’s bigger than just a community. This is vital to our nation’s infrastructure.”

Pearson says the bill could undo the victory he and others fought so hard for last year.

“We are all deeply concerned that this legislation is going to allow for the creation of the Byhalia pipeline but also other pipelines without zero local control over zoning that would protect communities and protect drinking water sources” said Pearson.

Sarah Houston the executive director of Protect Our Aquifer said she’s also concerned.

“This bill would take away local power from all 95 counties in the state and give that power to oil and gas companies. Local governing bodies wouldn’t even be able to pass resolutions making a public statement like what Memphis City Council did to formally voice their opposition to the Byhalia Pipeline” said Houston. “There are also questions about its legality - first amendment rights public and private property rights conflicts with the Tennessee State Constitution and even federal laws that enforce the Safe Drinking Water Act.”

The bill is set to go before the Tennessee House and Senate commerce committees on Tuesday.

Pearson says he and others are hoping to speak to lawmakers when the bill is brought up.

Action News 5 reached out to Plains All American to see if they support the legislation and to ask whether they had plans to revisit the Byhalia pipeline project. A company spokesman has not yet responded.

Con ello hilaron seis meses consecutivos de reducciones y se alcanzó el nivel más bajo desde el 2014.

Para el primer bimestre del año la venta de automóviles nuevos acumuló 158 mil 185 unidades 3.9% menos que en el mismo bimestre de 2021 y también el volumen más bajo desde 2012 de acuerdo con cifras del Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Inegi).

La venta de vehículos nuevos es un indicador relevante y de los más oportunos por su publicación sobre las condiciones económicas del mercado interno por lo que el menor volumen de ventas acusa una sostenida debilidad en la situación económica de los consumidores y también la perspectiva que tienen sobre su futuro a mediano plazo.

El indicador de ventas de autos también es relevante por ser una de las industrias más globalizadas del país lo que hace que refleje también la dificultad de las condiciones en las cadenas de suministro de dicha industria a nivel internacional generadas por la situación de desabasto detonada por la crisis sanitaria.

En el reporte más reciente del Inegi sobre el empleo en la industria manufacturera en México al cierre del 2021 se destaca la sostenida reducción en el personal ocupado por tres años consecutivos lapso en el que se cancelaron 59 mil 554 plazas correspondiendo al 2021 el mayor número con 23 mil 20 puestos de trabajo.

En las empresas dedicadas a la fabricación de autos y camionetas la baja fue de cuatro mil 176 trabajadores mientras que en las otras ramas de la industria del transporte como la dedicada a la fabricación de tractocamiones y la de remolques se registraron incrementos en su plantilla de personal.

Pero el coleccionismo de carros de carreras históricos es un gusto que está a otro nivel y que muy pocas personas pueden darse como lo prueban los $4.9 millones de dólares que un vendedor anónimo está pidiendo por este Ferrari 300 1998 de Fórmula 1 a través del duPont Registry.

Esta unidad en particular cumple con muchos requisitos para colocarse entre los bólidos de colección más codiciados de la historia; se trata de un Ferrari compitió entre la gloriosa época de los V10 en la Fórmula 1 y su piloto fue nada menos que el heptacampeón alemán Michael Schumacher uno de los mejores pilotos en la historia de la máxima categoría del automovilismo mundial. Lo único que tiene en su contra este F300 en particular es que según el aviso de venta nunca ganó una carrera.

El aviso indica que se trata del mismo auto conducido por Schumacher en el Gran Premio de Luxemburgo de 1998 que a pesar de su nombre tuvo lugar en el célebre circuito alemán del Nürburgring. Aún cuando había obtenido la pole position en la ronda clasificatoria Schumacher quien ya se había coronado campeón en 1994 y 1995 llegó en el segundo lugar detrás de Mika Hakkinen en una carrera sin contratiempos.

Schumacher compitió en el Gran Premio de Japón en Suzuka a bordo de este mismo ejemplar el cual fue equipado de una versión mejorada del V10 a fin de potenciar la probabilidad del alemán de coronarse campeón mundial pero el destino tenía otros planes. Hakkinen fue coronado campeón del mundo en 1998 en una carrera que inició con dos partidas abortadas que hicieron que Schumacher perdiera la pole position. A pesar de haber corrido ejemplarmente Schumacher tuvo que abandonar la carrera al perder uno de sus neumáticos después de pasar sobre los escombros que un accidente previo.

El F300 está equipado con el motor V10 de 3.0 litros 047 de Ferrari que desarrollaba de 805 caballos a 17300 rpm para una proporción de 269 caballos de fuerza por litro de desplazamiento. El aviso no da detalles sobre el estado actual del vehículo porque a ese nivel de coleccionismo se trata de un detalle sin importancia y el vendedor probablemente no estará dispuesto a rebajar un centavo del precio de venta por un rayón de más. Después de todo lo que está vendiendo no es un simple carro usado es un pedazo de la historia de la Fórmula 1.

En un recorrido por farmacias en distintos puntos los dependientes coincidieron en que aun cuando en los locales se ofrece tanto la medicina de patente como el genérico los capitalinos optan por el de menor precio.

Los medicamentos genéricos más vendidos son el paracetamol de 500 miligramos utilizado para dolor y fiebre cuyo costo genérico es de 20 pesos con 20 tabletas la caja mientras que el de patente cuesta 75 pesos.

Otro de los medicamentos más vendidos es el Ibuprofeno de 600 miligramos que se usa como desinflamante y mientras que el costo genérico es de 30 pesos el de patente llega a costar hasta 120 pesos.

Otros medicamentos que suelen comprar los capitalinos en farmacias genéricas son los antihistamínicos para tratar alergias o resfriados ya que se pueden conseguir a un precio de 28 pesos contra 90 en farmacia de patente.

Se informó además que conforme han pasado los años la gente acepta más el medicamento genérico pues anteriormente se creía que tenía menos efectividad pero hoy en día es bien aceptado debido a que incluso en los servicios médicos lo recetan.

El personal de farmacias indicó que además muchos medicamentos pueden adquirirse sin receta médica y eso hace que las personas acudan sin antes ir al médico ni ser prescritos.

That’s because Verizon announced Plus Play (styled by the Verizon marketing department as “+play”) a packaging service that will feature a single sign-on and billing for not just multiple streaming video services but also several other kinds of direct-to-consumer offerings. PlusPlay also could be a mortal blow for the battered cable TV business while fixing some of DTC’s most intractable and annoying customer headaches.

The initial Plus Play testing will include Netflix Disney’s three streaming services Discovery Plus three A+E Networks niche networks three more from AMC Plus and TelevisaUnivision’s Spanish-language Vix Plus. The video networks will sit next to some decidedly different subscription options including sports-news site The Athletic Peloton’s exercise programming Live Nation’s Veeps live-music online platform weight-management service WW International meditation service Calm and language-learning app Duolingo.

“I think the most succinct way to describe it is that it's a digital store for your subscriptions” Verizon Chief Revenue Officer Frank Boulben told me. “What we are observing in the marketplace is that consumers are having more and more digital subscriptions whether it's for video audio music gaming lifestyle wellness etc. And it's becoming a real pain point for those customers to keep track of which services they are subscribed to on which platform with which payment mean which login and password.”

The service is still in alpha mode Boulben said launching by the end of March for testing with a small pool of customers. The plan is to continue curating a list of “dozens and dozens of services” ahead of a full Plus Play launch by year’s end.

“We have a lot of service providers starting with the (video) programmers that are reaching out to us as they are looking for an efficient direct-to-consumer distribution platform because most digital service providers haven't got the marketing or distribution clout to reach a large customer base” Boulben said. “And that's really the gist of the Plus Play strategy. It's to be that neutral market place that provides convenience and choice for consumers on one side and on the other side provides unparalleled reach and marketing ability for the service provider.”

Marketing hype aside Boulben can point to previous successes pushing Apple Music then Disney Plus Discovery Plus and the Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass video game services as add-ons or premiums for wireless service.

“Those partners have realized that we are very good at acquiring active subscribers” Boulben said. “In particular we have a very high conversion rate from promotion to paid subscribers which is a business challenge for them. And obviously we are very good at managing the lifecycle of customers. It allows our partners to focus really on the product experience or the content experience.”

Startups such as Paket have created go-to apps that bring together in one place all the sign-ons billing and other customer minutia that streaming video customers need for all their video services. Amazon has its Channels program as well but unlike Paket isn’t exactly Switzerland given its own streaming services and tight control over customer data.

Because of that HBO Max last summer walked away from 5 million subscribers on Amazon a gutsy call that paid off in Q4 with strong subscriber growth that suggests most of those customers followed it to a more direct relationship.

But owning all the data and relationship can be hard for many companies especially as customers add more and more subscriptions in the direct-to-consumer era.

Boulben argues that Verizon’s Plus Play partners are willing to trade some of the customer relationship in exchange for Verizon’s huge reach existing sales/upsell teams and lower acquisition and retention costs. Verizon has the biggest customer base of the Big Three wireless carriers some 50 million households with 150 million individual customers an enticing target for any DTC company in video or elsewhere.

Asked how Verizon can avoid a replay of HBO Max’s Amazon walk away Boulben said “we have the commercial relationship” but the streaming service has “100-percent ownership of the usage data.’ The streaming service is “the only party knowing whether you are using the service on the daily basis how much you are using it and what you are watching. Verizon doesn’t know any of that.”

The subscription service also gets its customer’s log-in and email address so it can do direct marketing to its customers.

Boulben declined to specify Verizon’s revenue share (estimates of Amazon’s Channels suggest it brings in a whopping $4 billion a year). For Verizon the revenue share will vary from deal to deal category to category.

“What I can tell you on the basis of our existing relationships it is perceived as fair by the providers” Boulben said. “Because what we bring in exchange it's an acquisition machine and also a marketing machine for the lifecycle management of customers.”

As Boulben rather slyly mentioned having a sense of getting value for money “is not the case as you know with all marketplaces currently in the market.”

The real potential here could be longer term though. Can Verizon become a substantive competitor for the most lucrative piece of business remaining for the cable industry: providing high-speed broadband connectivity to the home?

Plus Play could become an adoption driver for what’s oxymoronically called fixed wireless where a 5G-enabled base station provides bandwidth and Internet connectivity to all kinds of devices in a home including smart TVs other smart devices phones tablets and computers.

Verizon said Thursday that it already can provide fixed-wireless access to 30 million households which combined with Verizon’s 16 million FiOS customers makes it one of the three largest U.S. “broadband” providers.

The Verizon approach contrasts sharply with traditional cable however with “no contract no bundle taxes and fees are included” Boulben said.

“It's self setup no need for an appointment” Boulben continued. “The equipment is included. And if you happen to be a mobile subscriber on Verizon it's only $25 per month. So that's a very attractive proposition. That's going to be the next generation of home broadband and home entertainment. So long live the traditional cable bundle.”

Boulben quickly clarified that Verizon’s approach is actually not the traditional cable bundle because it doesn’t lump connectivity and content together. The future will bifurcate the two he predicted with connectivity on one side and the customer choosing exactly the content they want.

For now choosing those services is a teeth-gritting a la carte process but Boulben said that probably won’t be the case forever.

“Maybe in the future it will make sense to group (services) in packages” Boulben said. “I'm not using the word ‘bundle’ but in packages of services. If we do that that will be a very different type of bundle because it will not bundle content and connectivity.”

Disney of course already has its bundle of Disney Plus ESPN Plus and Hulu and once Discovery and WarnerMedia merge they plan to offer a bundle of HBO Max Discovery Plus and the soon-to-launch CNN Plus.

“What we haven’t seen yet is the bundle across companies right” Boulben said. “Maybe that will go.”

The PlusPlay initiative marks a dramatic shift for Verizon which half a decade ago spent billions buying aging Internet properties such as Yahoo Huffington Post and Tumblr and launching its own mobile-video service Go90. None of those initiatives went well.

It’s also probably still too early to expect fixed wireless to be a big thing given the grinding process of rolling out 5G nationally. One recent article called the mobile technology “a $100 billion whiff so far” thanks to conspiracy crackpots airline opposition branding missteps and slow customer adoption.

But Verizon and its competitors are rapidly adding more mid-band spectrum which provides good speed and carrying capacity for high-quality video and dozens of devices without the interference issues 5G’s fastest flavors face in trying to penetrate buildings and other obstacles.

As that Goldilocks spectrum becomes more widely deployed new business models will shoulder forward to take advantage. PlusPlay could be one and almost certainly will soon spawn copycat offerings from AT&T and T-Mobile.

That may be inevitable if PlusPlay can find its footing in the market but Boulben said “certainly we have a head start.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdXJnZW50Y29tbS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8wNi9hdWRpLXZlcml6b24tcGFydG5lci10by1icmluZy01Zy10by12ZWhpY2xlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Audi Verizon partner to bring 5G to vehicles - Urgent Comms,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://urgentcomm.com/2022/03/06/audi-verizon-partner-to-bring-5g-to-vehicles/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdXJnZW50Y29tbS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8wNi9hdWRpLXZlcml6b24tcGFydG5lci10by1icmluZy01Zy10by12ZWhpY2xlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZW5zYm9yby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hcnRpY2xlXzQ5MTM2ZjkyLTlhNmUtMTFlYy1hMjQ2LWJiOGY5M2NlNGNlZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ask a Reporter: What is the purpose of the new black painted metal poles going up curbside around town?,"Question: Who is responsible for and what is the purpose of the new black-painted metal poles going up curbside around town? I haven’t had an opportunity to examine one close up but observing as I drive by they appear to be about the same height as normal utility poles but have no wires etc. attached. The top section of the poles are a little larger diameter and look like burners I have seen out west that are used to burn off methane gas from oil wells.

K.S.

Answer: We wondered if the new poles had anything to do with the new 5G system and asked Verizon.

“These are indeed part of our 5G Ultra Wideband antenna. This will provide millimeter wave coverage in the area” Andy Choi a communications manager for Verizon said in an email. “In addition 5G Home has been available in Greensboro since last June.”

So what exactly is 5G? It is the fifth-generation broadband cellular network. Most phones are now on 4G and phone companies have been phasing out the old 3G network with the shutdown expected to be completed this year. Every time the network is upgraded speeds generally improve. In the case of 5G more data can be sent “due to more available bandwidth and advanced antenna technology” according to techtarget.com.

The 5G system is different from 4G in a couple of ways. It uses a higher radio wave spectrum which means the data travels a shorter distance than in 4G which uses a lower wave that travels longer distances. The 4G system needs high-power cell towers to send signals over longer distances. But 5G because the radio waves don’t travel as far needs a large number of small cell stations which can be in places like light poles or building roofs according to techtarget.com.

Q: What’s up with the flashing stop signs at Friendly Center?

D.P.

A: “The flashing stop signs were added in late summer 2021 as part of the Northline Ave section of an ongoing parking and sidewalk improvement project throughout Friendly Center” Sarah Kotelnicki marketing director for Friendly Center said in an email.

“Speed bumps were removed and 4-way stops were added to improve traffic flow in all directions along Northline Ave while maintaining crosswalks for pedestrians. Utilizing the flashing stop signs provides better visibility and brings attention to these new stop locations.”

But Wells Fargo said the transaction wasn’t fraudulent because Mr. Faunce had authorized it — even though he had been tricked into transferring the money.

Mr. Faunce was shocked. “It was clearly fraud” he said. “This wasn’t my fault so why isn’t the bank doing the right thing here?”

The app industry continues to grow with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021 according to the latest year-end reports. App Annie says global spending across iOS Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5% reaching 230 billion in 2021 and mobile ad spend grew 23% year over year to reach $295 billion.

Today’s consumers now spend more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day for example but in 2021 they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil Indonesia and South Korea users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.

Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue App Annie noted. This was up 20% from 2020 when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend and just eight apps topped $1 billion.

This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps including news updates startup fundings mergers and acquisitions and suggestions about new apps and games to try too.

Top Story

The Russia-Ukraine war continued to have a wide-reaching impact on the world of apps as major tech companies took action to block Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik and to further isolate Russia from participating in the broader tech economy. The EU specifically banned the Kremlin-based media outlets in the region to prevent the further spread of disinformation and propaganda across EU broadcast channels online platforms and apps.

The app stores pulled the Russian state-owned media outlets’ apps RT News and Sputnik News from their global marketplaces outside Russia. This includes the ban of RT from the Windows app store plus Google and Apple’s ban of RT and Sputnik’s apps.

Sensor Tower said that RT News had 5.7 million installs worldwide since its launch in May 2013 across the App Store and Google Play while Sputnik had 2 million installs worldwide since its release in March 2015. Another firm reported different data. Apptopia estimated RT News had 10 million global installs and Sputnik had 3.85 million.

Among other key changes this week:

Facebook and Instagram said they would suppress the spread of Russian state media via algorithms and will begin attaching labels to their content to provide more context. It also restricted access to their content in the EU and more recently the U.K. per a government request.

MyHeritage (update with LiveStory)

Last year genealogy service MyHeritage went viral after introducing a new “deepfake” feature that allowed users to animate the faces of loved ones in still photos. TikTok users posted videos reacting to the technology called “Deep Nostalgia” as they brought back relatives they never got to meet or those whose loss they still grieved. To date more than 100 million photos have been animated with the feature. Now comes the next iteration. This week MyHeritage along with technology partner D-ID is expanding upon “Deep Nostalgia” with the launch of “LiveStory” a feature that doesn’t just bring the people in photos to life with movement but actually has them speak.

The company licensed the new technology from D-ID a Tel Aviv-based startup that works to create patented video reenactment technology powered by AI and deep learning techniques.

To make the lips match the words D-ID trained a neural network on a database of videos of people speaking. Its technology is able to work with any language the company says. The MyHeritage implementation however supports 31 languages including dozens of dialects with both male and female voice options. After the LiveStory is created users can watch it share it with friends or post it to social media. They also can customize the story further by editing the text choosing a different voice or even uploading their own audio recording.

The feature is available in the MyHeritage mobile app and is free to use a few times before a subscription is required."

She’s even scarier while prosecuting her fellow cops and some nasty do-badders even when they’re innocent (this time). Suffice to say she’s not exactly anyone’s favorite player but we think she should be.

Days of our Lives: Give This Woman Credit

Is Melinda (Tina Huang) rough around those rigid edges? Of course. But she has plenty of reasons to be. She’s working in a town where everyone (and we mean EVERYONE) has broken a law or two…or fifty. She goes up against the rich and powerful who never seem to pay all while still suffering the loss of her murdered daughter. That’s an ache that will never go away.

DAYS: She’s A Tough One

Is she hard on everyone? Yes. Is she sometimes wrong? Also yes. Does she get justice when it’s needed? You bet your bottom dollar she tries to. This woman has thrown herself into her work and doesn’t seem to give herself the luxury of a personal life. Who has time to lean when you have to clean…up the mean streets of Salem?

It can’t be easy being the bad guy when there are so many bad people to take down. Someone has to do it though and at least she’s stepped up to the plate. Just look at the trash she’s taken out. Clyde Weston (James Read) and Orpheus (George DelHoyo) are both where they belong because of her. She does good work. We can’t deny that. We’d even go so far as to say she’s a hero in her own right.

Sure right now she has Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering) all wrong and EJ DiMera (Dan Feuerriegel) too but alas you can’t win them all. We’re sure once the truth comes out she’ll get those men out of lock up and back to their lives. She may not apologize but hey at least she’ll do the right thing and get back to chasing real (current) criminals.

Days of our Lives: Give Melinda More

What we’d like to see is Melinda’s life outside of the station. Give her a partner let her have a love story maybe even get married. She’s a hard-working lady who deserves some good old fashion romance. Maybe she’d even lighten up a little. Do you agree us or do you have your own thoughts on this storyline? Let us know in the comments section below.

American credit card providers Mastercard and Visa announced late Saturday they will suspend their services in Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine.

Mastercard's cards issued by Russian banks will stop operating and Mastercard cards issued elsewhere won't work at ATMs located in Russia. Visa is halting all transactions made with Visa cards issued in Russia outside of Russia and any Visa cards issued by banks outside of Russia will no longer work within the country.

""We don’t take this decision lightly"" said Mastercard in a statement adding it has operated in Russia for 25 years and employs over 200 people in the country. ""When it is appropriate and if it is permissible under the law we will use their passion and creativity to work to restore operations"" it said.

In an announcement on Visa’s website the company says it’s working with partners in Russia to “cease all transactions over the coming days.” A separate press release from Mastercard contains a similar message noting that it’s suspending services in Russia and that its decision wasn’t taken “lightly.” Both companies explain that any transactions made with Mastercard or Visa cards issued by banks in Russia won’t work outside of Russia while any cards issued by banks outside of the country won’t work at Russian merchants or ATMs.

“We regret the impact this will have”

“We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues and on the clients partners merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia” Visa CEO Al Kelly states. “This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values.”

As noted by Bloomberg anyone with a card issued in Russia will still be able to pay for products and services with Mastercard and Visa cards however neither financial company will process the transactions — Russia’s National Payment Card System (NSPK) will have to handle them instead.

Visa and Mastercard’s announcement comes shortly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with US lawmakers and asked that they halt both companies’ operations in Russia. “Pleased to hear that Mastercard and Visa will be suspending all their operations in Russia effective immediately” Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) said on Twitter following the meeting with Zelensky.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3Zpc2EtYW5ub3VuY2VzLXN1c3BlbnNpb24tb2YtYWxsLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtaW4tcnVzc2lh0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvdmlzYS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtc3VzcGVuc2lvbi1vZi1hbGwtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy1pbi1ydXNzaWEuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visa Mastercard suspend all operations in Russia 'effective immediately',"Financial services companies Visa and Mastercard announced Saturday they are suspending business in Russia in response to the country’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

There are hundreds of thousands of unexploded land mines grenades and cluster bombs buried in Vietnamese soil that continue to injure or kill people decades after the conflict ended. In 1982 seven years after the end of the war Dung Trinh was a 12-year-old boy living in Hanoi when a retired soldier gave him what he thought was an inert grenade as a memento. As a kid Trinh was intrigued by the small old handheld explosive. One day driven by his burning curiosity Trinh pulled its safety pin. Seconds later the grenade exploded. Trinh lost his left arm.

Two years after the accident Trinh got his first prosthetic arm. But he periodically needed replacements to fit his growing body. His family couldn’t afford them.

“After ten years without wearing an artificial arm I found an orthopedic hospital that offered an affordable one. But the technology wasn’t advanced at the time. The arm was heavy and it was very uncomfortable” Trinh told KrASIA.

In the 2000s it still wasn’t easy to gain access to wearable medical devices in Vietnam. There was no information online so Trinh and his family had to go from one hospital to another often in different provinces to seek assistance. The trips drained a lot of time and money and the hospitals that had prosthetics only offered limited options.

“Over the past 40 years I have used several prosthetic arms. Most of them didn’t have fingers some had a hook attached to the arm to carry light bags. My last artificial arm had fingers but they weren’t functional” he said.

Trinh is a member of the Hanoi association of persons with physical disabilities. In late 2018 the association introduced him to Vulcan Augmetics a startup based in Ho Chi Minh City that makes modular robotic prosthetics. The startup had just expanded to Hanoi at that time and Trinh had the opportunity to meet the team and learn about its products.

“Vulcan’s arm is light and the fingers have many functionalities. I can do many things that I couldn’t do before like opening a bottle with my prosthetic fingers and riding a bike” Trinh said. Now he helps his family run a small store that sells construction materials and the arm from Vulcan makes it possible for him to perform daily tasks without hassle. Trinh also loves the way his arm looks. “It’s really nice but I hope Vulcan will have skin color options in the future so it would look more like a normal arm.”

Trinh was one of the 30 beneficiaries of Vulcan’s nonprofit project Uplift through which the company gives away prosthetics to people who can’t afford them. The objective is to help them gain confidence and a sense of independence.

Vulcan Augmetics was founded in 2018 by two expatriates living in Vietnam—Rafael Masters who hails from the United Kingdom and is now CEO and Akshay Sharma who is originally from India and serves as CTO.

Masters drew from personal experience when he established Vulcan with Sharma. “I grew up about 200 meters away from one of the biggest disabled colleges in the UK. Many of my teenage friends were in wheelchairs but they led amazing lives. They had support and access to technology that would give them full lives” Masters told KrASIA.

After graduating from university Masters relocated to Vietnam. While there he realized that people with physical disabilities living in a developing country had to navigate different circumstances than those in the UK. “In the developed world people have financial support insurance and healthcare that give patients access to prosthetics after they undergo amputation. This is not the case in developing countries. You get amputated and that’s it. There is very little support for the amputees and their families” said Masters.

Vulcan Augmetics combines traditional manufacturing processes with 3D printing and injection molding to create customizable and upgradable prosthetics. Their prices start at USD 1100 making them more affordable than most prosthetic arms which on average cost USD 2600 according to Masters. “The frame is made of metal where we use traditional mass manufacturing methods. All plastic parts are currently made through 3D printing but we’ll be using injection molding more to make the peripheral or accessory parts in the future” said Masters.

Vulcan’s prosthetics are modular and the components plug and click together like Lego pieces. If one part breaks the startup will ship a replacement component within five business days to users.

“The starting model is cheap and efficient. Users can upgrade to our more advanced models over time” Masters added. “For the base model we use off-the-shelf components. We put an adjustable mechanical device inside the hand so it has multiple functions.”

Vulcan’s arms provide the ability to grip a range of daily household objects. The fingers are strong and dexterous enough to perform tasks such as opening jars cutting food driving a motorbike and taking photos. “One of our users is even able to drive up to eight hours a day with the arm” Masters said.

Vulcan partners with 17 major hospitals and clinics with orthotic and prosthetics services in Vietnam. This gives amputees an easy way to connect with Vulcan’s team. Most Vulcan Augmetics users are young people aged 18 to 40. Therefore the arm is designed to look sophisticated as the team wants users to feel proud while wearing them.

“If you’re wearing a piece of thousand-dollar technology you should be showing it off loud and proud. However we’re looking at offering skin-colored gloves for older users as they usually want to blend in more” said Masters.

Moving forward the startup plans to expand its product offerings. This is possible because the technology for the prosthetics including machine learning to read biosignals can be leveraged across all wearable robotics including mobility devices and stroke rehabilitation devices.

Vulcan Augmetics is also eyeing regional expansions to Thailand Malaysia and Indonesia in the near future although Masters didn’t share the exact timeline. The company’s vision is to serve 38 million disabled people globally. “We’re a Vietnamese company and we’re proud of that. We want to showcase that countries in Southeast Asia can be tech leaders and innovators not only in software but also in the hardware and robotics industries” Masters said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

By a very close margin the multi-community referendum vote proposing a brand new $305 million dollar facility passed.

Determined through an aggregated vote a total of 6400 people from seven communities came out to vote on Saturday. There were 3353 ""yes"" votes in favor of a new building for B-P while 3047 voted ""no."" The total ""yes"" votes amounted to 52.4% of the vote.

""As a District we are grateful to our sending communities for their support of a new

school building and ensuring a 21st century career technical education for future

generations at Bristol-Plymouth"" said B-P Superintendent Alexandre Magalhaes in a statement thanking the voters.

Originally built in 1972 and located in Taunton B-P serves Taunton Raynham Middleboro Berkeley Bridgewater Dighton and Rehoboth.

Of the estimated $305 million dollars taxpayers will pay for 60% of that price tag or $180 million with the rest paid for by the state’s Massachusetts School Building Authority.

Had the referendum not passed the school would have still been required to undergo extensive repairs and upgrades to the old facility estimated to cost $137 million none of which was eligible for reimbursement by the state.

“It’s a great opportunity to build a new school. We would have been still on the hook for the repairs so it makes complete sense” said Estele Borges a Taunton representative on the B-P school committee and a Taunton City Council member.

Borges has been a strong advocate for this proposal doing as much outreach as she can through official public presentations on the project.

“I understand its difficult for the taxpayers. It’s a huge price tag I’m not going to deny it. Education and public safety will never be things I will cut back on” said Borges who is also a graduate of the B-P class of 1986.

“If you just do it in pieces then eventually you’d have to upgrade everything. In the long run will you really be saving?” said Timothy J. Holick Raynham representative on the B-P school board before the Saturday vote.

Holick emphasized how much the school has saved over the years by delaying repairs and even having students do some of the low-risk maintenance work as assignments. Said Holick “We do a lot of things ourselves. The kids have done a lot but they can’t do these kinds of projects. We’ve stretched this school to the limit.”

Love from the city

Through future votes it will be up to each community to determine how they will pay for their portion such as through a multi-year debt exclusion cash reserves or taking it out of general funding annually.

Under the approved proposal Taunton will be responsible for 41% of the total cost to the communities.

Within the city limits of Taunton sentiment was more in favor of the new B-P building than against. In Taunton 67.1% of the total 2092 voters who came out voted yes.

""We’re definitely for the students. It’s a good training ground. Not all kids want to go to college but they still have the option. It’s important to invest in our children’s future"" said Andrew Larrimore who along with his wife Joanne voted in favor the referendum at the East Taunton Elementary School poll site.

Over at Joseph H. Martin School Mary McCaffrey voted in favor of the new building because she doesn't see much of its technology and infrastructure as up-to-date as it should be for today's students.

""I feel the technological resources have to be there for the kids. What's been used since the 80's isn't viable"" she said.

Her husband William McCaffrey agreed but had another reason for voting yes. He sees B-P as a good outlet for special needs kids who tend to thrive at vocational skills.

""We need to train them educate them take care of them. Otherwise they will fall by the wayside. I don't want higher taxes but its needed"" he said.

Elsewhere at James L. Mulcahey Elementary School Shane O'Brien with wife Tinique were thinking about the choices their kids will have in the future which is why they voted in favor of the project.

""This gives the children better options. We own a house here. We're invested in the city"" Shane said.

Shifting sentiment the further out you venture

Several of the smaller communities didn't share this sentiment. Opposition to the project was vocal especially in Dighton Berkley and Rehoboth where financial worries were a primary factor and far fewer students make up the total student body at Bristol-Plymouth.

Over in Dighton only 35% of the voter turnout voted yes to the referendum. Similarly percentages of yes votes in Berkley and Rehoboth were 34.3% and 29.5% respectively.

A group of 20 or so protesters calling themselves #NotoBP picketed the entrance to Dighton Elementary School.

""Simply put we can't afford it. There is an innumerable amount of things this town has to deal with"" said Tom Gallucci Dighton resident who referenced the need for the town to build a new fire station and two new bridges first as well as overcrowding and maintenance issues Dighton Elementary School is facing.

Gallucci emphasizes he's not against Bristol-Plymouth or greater educational opportunities for its students.

""B-P is a great school. My son graduated from there. I'm raising a family of four. We're stretched to the limit"" Gallucci said.

Bill Moore one of the founders of #NotoBP stated at the picket line he was ""greatly opposed to the cost for the new building.""

Dighton resident Robert Woods said that worsening economic factors like other costs in town and increased taxes and fuel prices were enough reason to delay this project.

“I’m voting no at this time. I’m all for the children and their education but this is really poor timing” Woods.

The district's project consultants estimated in a recent presentation that the annualy property tax impact on the average single-family home in each community would be: Berkley $285; Bridgewater $131; Dighton $241; Middleboro $178; Raynham $217; Rehoboth $110; and Taunton $194.

Prior to the vote Dighton rep for the B-P School Committee Edward F. Dutra Jr. explained that he understood adding to the financial burden families in his town are already concerned about pointing to an expensive water main project planned for Dighton.

Said Dutra: “The school has outgrown the building itself. I know it’s a tough time but it’s something that needs to be done to support the students and the trades that come back and affect our communities.”

The Love Hypothesis By Ali Hazelwood

Berkley

$16.00

Sept. 14 2021 >> Purchase

From the publisher: When a fake relationship between scientists meets the irresistible force of attraction it throws one woman’s carefully calculated theories on love into chaos. As a third-year Ph.D. candidate Olive Smith doesn’t believe in lasting romantic relationships—but her best friend does and that’s what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So like any self-respecting biologist Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.

From Andrea bookseller: Fake dating is my favorite! The pining between the two was so frustrating but of course fantastic at the same time. There was demisexual rep so if you’re looking for a romance book with ace characters I cannot recommend this enough. I also appreciated that the story was set in academia and addressed important issues that women deal with in STEM. Read it in essentially a day because I just needed to know what happened.

A shocking and immersive read perfect for fans of ”Gone Girl” and ”The Haunting of Hill House.” In a boarded-up house on a dead-end street at the edge of the wild Washington woods lives a family of three: a teenage girl who isn’t allowed outside; a man who drinks alone in front of his TV trying to ignore the gaps in his memory; and a house cat who loves napping and reading the Bible. An unspeakable secret binds them together but when a new neighbor moves in next door what is buried out among the birch trees may come back to haunt them all.

From Andrea bookseller: Genuinely one of my favorite manga. The story follows a high schooler that wants to get into art school breaking away from all previous expectations for him. The considerations of developing your own artistic style and becoming your own person are so heartfelt and beautiful as the anxieties of life are expressed through artistic pieces. The cast of characters are each so unique as both artists and people. Highly recommend.

From the publisher: In this heart-pounding and sharply written thriller from J.A. Jance Ali Reynolds’s personal life is thrown into turmoil just as two men show up on the scene—a former employee of her husband’s who has just been released from prison and a serial killer who sets his sights a little too close to home.

From Susie owner: This is the most recent book in the author’s long running Ali Reynolds series which started as a blog when Jance was fired for being “too old” to host the news. Many successful books and new characters later Jance’s heroes are trying to help a former employee who was just released from prison but may be innocent. This doesn’t mean the headaches of running their business got any easier since they have to deal with a tenant who stopped paying rent and all that entails. J.A. Jance tells great stories with well-written plots but it’s her characters that keep me reading.

Barbosa posted a video on Wednesday on his Facebook page of himself walking around Walmart.

""So guess where I'm at?"" Barbosa asked. ""Anybody take a guess? Like I said misunderstanding. Everybody wants to jump on the news talk all this crap about me. Where am I at? Misunderstanding. This is exactly why I resigned because people are (expletive). So take a picture news guys. Why don't you show a picture of this. Yeah you won't see this news. Sad man. Sad what the news and media do.""

Barbosa did not respond to a text from The News-Journal seeking comment.

Trespassed:Palm Coast Councilman Victor Barbosa resigns following scanning incident at Walmart

Wanted in Costa Rica? Palm Coast City Councilman Victor Barbosa believed to be a fugitive sheriff's office says

Barbosa’s resignation came after he was trespassed from Walmart on Sunday when a store security officer said Barbosa twice failed to scan an item at two different self-scanning registers according to a report from the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office.

On Wednesday a deputy responded to the Walmart where an asset protection employee completed and signed a statement voiding the trespass warning according to the sheriff's office.

The sheriff's office provided a document on Tuesday which read ""On 03/02/2022 Walmart Market team has approved the request to void the TPW for Victor Barbosa at Walmart store 1182 at 174 Cypress Point Parkway Palm Coast … "" It was signed by the asset protection operations coach who also signed the statement.

Had the trespass warning not been voided Barbosa would have faced arrest and a misdemeanor charge had he returned to the store.

In a resignation letter dated Tuesday Barbosa wrote:

“I Victor Barbosa fear for my life. I repeat I fear for my life. All I wanted to do was help small businesses fight corruption and be the voice of the people of this community. I now understand why Council Member Howell resigned.

“Effective immediately I resign from City Council and withdraw my candidacy from the 2022 election.

“Thank you to all that voted for me. All I want is my peace back” Barbosa wrote.

Barbosa said in a phone interview Monday that he believed the item was not scanned because of a problem with the scanner. He said the $18 item was just one among a $300 purchase. Walmart opted not to press a petit theft charge against him because the item was less than $25 according to the report.

Barbosa has also been shadowed by questions about whether he is wanted in Costa Rica in a criminal case. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement stated Tuesday it was still awaiting documents on that case.

The City Council scheduled a special meeting on March 22 to appoint someone to finish Barbosa's term.

Applications for the District 2 seat are available on the city's website. Applications are due by noon March 16.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGFsa2J1c2luZXNzLm5ldC8yMDIyLzAzL3RoZS1zdXBwbHktc2lkZS13YWxtYXJ0LWxvb2tzLXRvLWZpbnRlY2gtYXMtbmV3LXByb2ZpdC1jZW50ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Supply Side: Walmart looks to fintech as new profit center,"Walmart has made no secret of expanding financial services products to its shopper base. The retail giant has joined forces with several financial technology (fintech) startups with plans to create a “neobank” that will enable customers to manage money with lower fees.

Walmart announced in January 2020 a strategic partnership with fintech investment firm Ribbit Capital to develop and offer affordable financial solutions. Ribbit’s investment portfolio includes Credit Karma Affirm and Robinhood. Walmart hired two Goldman Sachs execs to head up the new fintech venture named Hazel.

Last month Walmart acquired the financial startup Even Responsible and One a digital banking alternative founded in 2019 by Brian Hamilton.

Pending regulatory approval all the startups will operate under the name ONE with Omer Ismail as CEO. The combined entity will have a workforce exceeding 200 people and have more than $250 million in cash on the balance sheet to advance growth according to the Walmart release on Jan. 26.

“Consumers everywhere are being left behind by the world of financial services” Ismail said. “Our vision is clear: build on Even and One’s success to offer a product that offers consumers the best way to spend the best way to access their wages and helps millions save and grow their money.”

Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner told analysts during the Feb. 18 earnings call that the fintech moves help consumers get paid early spend save borrow and grow their money as ONE seeks to develop a super app once the deals close in the first half of this year. The retailer said that the ONE app would be integrated inside Walmart’s physical and digital channels offering options to its 1.6 million U.S. employees and 100 million-plus weekly shoppers. As a standalone company and app Walmart said that one would be available directly to U.S. consumers and through partnerships with other leading employers and merchants.

ONE will partner with Coastal Community Bank to offer saving spending and borrowing services in one digital account.

Walmart’s investments in fintech also stem from knowing millions of Americans can’t access credit. Almost 25% of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

“Walmart is constantly looking for new ways to deliver on our core mission of helping our customers save money and live better” Furner said. “Customers have made it clear that they want more from us in the financial services arena. Creating a simple personalized app that allows users to manage their money in one place is the natural next step toward fulfilling that. We couldn’t be more excited about what this will mean for Walmart customers associates and consumers everywhere as we try to help empower millions to improve their financial lives.”

Ben Jackson chief operating officer at Innovative Payment Solutions said retailers have long understood the need to provide financial services to their customer base.

“What retailer wouldn’t want to help consumers with access to money and it’s never been easier as consumers have a bank in their pocket with their smartphone” Jackson said.

Jackson said it’s an opportunity for Walmart to become top of mind with their customers regarding financial services and it’s another way to draw them into the retail giant’s ecosystem. He said the model Walmart is using with partnerships is strategic. It makes it possible to outsource the compliance to bank partners to understand that the retailer will do certain due diligence.

Jackson said it would be interesting to see how the new financial service rolls out suggesting it may take time for consumers to jump in with both feet.

“It is very hard to get people to change banks. But if Walmart can appeal to customers to try one service or tiptoe into the larger ecosystem and if they have a good experience it will be easier to have them sign on for services” Jackson said.

He said community banks already have a plethora of competition from fintechs such as Chime which allows consumers to get paid earlier or Affirm which allows customers to pay on time with instant gratification. These are also planned features of the new venture ONE.

Jackson said many banks have decided to work with fintechs on the service side acting as the clearinghouse and taking care of the regulatory compliance for fees.

“Every bank needs to be looking at the future with developing technology and be creative and more aggressive than ever before. They must pay attention to what consumers are saying they want because retailers are making inroads” Jackson said.

He said Starbucks has been successful with its mobile app that allows consumers to load money and gift cards onto the app and easily order and pay for their purchases from their car while in the drive-thru. He said Nike has combined shopping with exercise workouts on its mobile app and Sephora was one of the first retailers to use an experiential app to help customers shop for cosmetics and apply them all from their living room couch.

Jackson said Walmart has an opportunity to weave financial service into its mobile app that already allows consumers to order a prescription refill schedule a vaccination return merchandise order a custom cake or shop for a new or used car. He said the 4300 store locations are also a significant advantage because of the proximity to 90% of the U.S. population.

“Kapi‘olani relies on donations for the lifesaving care of local children and Hawai‘i’s generous spirit always amazes and inspires us” said Gidget Ruscetta chief operating officer of Kapi‘olani Medical Center for Women & Children in the press release. “We are proud to be the state’s only full-service children’s hospital and are honored by the trust and support of our communities to help our keiki live happy and healthy lives.”

In 2021 money raised through the Walmart and Sam’s Club campaigns helped Kapi‘olani purchase a portable ultrasound machine for its neonatal intensive care unit. The machine will allow the medical team to perform several procedures for newborns without moving them from their beds including checking heart strength performing brain scans providing guidance for nurses doing blood draws and more.

Fulah Wade 34 of the 800 block of McDowell Avenue is facing 39 counts in two cases that include charges of organized retail theft receiving stolen property corruption of a minor criminal trespass and conspiracy.

The two cases comprise an arrest made Feb. 22 at the Wal-Mart as well as prior thefts allegedly carried out through a scheme detailed in an affidavit of probable cause written by Eddystone Police Lt. Joseph Pretti.

Pretti was contacted by Wal-Mart Asset Protection Officer Ray Trent Feb. 22 about several thefts that had occurred in the prior month according to the affidavit. Trent indicated one of the store’s employees a 17-year-old male identified as “D.M.” was involved in the thefts.

Trent reported that Wade met D.M. in the store Jan. 27 and D.M. handed her several game controllers valued at $694. D.M. then allegedly let Wade out of the store without charging her by buzzing her out of a tire and lube center entrance so that no alarms would activate.

Wade allegedly came into the store again Feb. 14 with three other people including her juvenile daughter. The affidavit says Wade grabbed a couple of totes then met D.M. in the electronics department where he unlocked a cabinet and loaded the totes with more than $5400 worth of computers.

D.M. appeared to ring Wade up for the items but voided the sale according to the affidavit. Wade left the store after again being buzzed out of the tire and lube center by D.M. and had her children help her wheel the totes out the affidavit says.

Wade returned the following day with two other people including her daughter and D.M. again gave her two more computers according to the affidavit. D.M. allegedly pretended to ring her out for those items and again assisted Wade in exiting via the tire and lube center. Those items were valued at $1553 according to the affidavit.

On Feb. 17 D.M. provided Wade with another five computers and two car radios valued at $2114 according to the affidavit. He again rang her up voided the transaction and buzzed her out through the tire and lube center the affidavit says.

Trent provided Pretti with this information along with pictures and receipts after conducting an internal investigation and found $9843 in total merchandise had been stolen according to the information.

In reviewing video surveillance from the store Pretti found Wade and D.M. were clearly working together and always seemed coordinated and organized. He noted that D.M. could be seen laughing at times during their encounters and that Wade always parked her car in front of the store well away from the tire and lube center entrance.

Pretti discovered Wade had pawned five computers and one of the game controllers at the Aston Pawn Shop in exchange for $1170 according to the affidavit. Pretti met Trent and another APO at the store where Trent confirmed the merchandise was the same in the alleged thefts and was able to retrieve it. Some other pawned items had already been sold according to the affidavit. The actual value of the pawned items was $1624 the affidavit says.

Wade and D.M. were caught in the act of attempting to carry out the same scheme Feb. 22 according to the affidavit. They were arrested on site and charged by Eddystone Officer Michael Golden. The juvenile has been released to his mother according to Pretti.

Wade has numerous prior retail theft arrests according to the affidavit and had already been banned from that Wal-Mart location for shoplifting years ago.

Court documents indicate she is awaiting a pretrial conference next week on one set of retail theft charges in Upper Darby from August 2021 as well as preliminary hearings on two separate cases out of Chester for burglary and terroristic threats.

Wade is awaiting a preliminary hearing April 11 for the alleged Feb. 22 theft and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing March 7 on the overall organized retail theft scheme according to online court documents. She is currently being held at the county prison on 10% of $75000 bail.

Wal-Mart is seeking restitution of $8219 and the Aston Pawn Shop is seeking restitution of $1170 according to the affidavit."
DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhleWFsbWEuY29tL3doeS1kby1zby1tYW55LWRpc25leS12aWxsYWlucy1sb29rLWxpa2UtbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Do So Many Disney Villains Look Like Me?,"Oh Disney. As if the waifish empty-headed princesses and irredeemably racist portrayals of non-white characters were not enough. Just why does my fine Jewish ass resemble the full cadre of Disney villains?

“Tangled” got me first.

Mother Gothel is the cinematic foil for the predictably wide-eyed button-nosed Rapunzel. Gothel that magnificent mercurial manipulator. So miserly with her food and money. So separate from the other golden-haired kingdom. So distinctly othered.

She so happens to be animated with the curly black hair and hooked nose stereotypical to Jews.

But beyond Gothel’s suspicious phenotype “Tangled” follows an eerily familiar story. Blood libel an antisemitic canard that reverberates through history accuses Jews of stealing Christian children to bake their blood into matzah. It was particularly prevalent in the Middle Ages when it was not uncommon for European Jews to be hunted down and murdered whenever a child went missing. Jews stealing pretty Aryan children to sustain their dark magic. Sound familiar?

Angst led me further. One rabbit hole excellent Twitter thread and confusingly upbeat Hava-Nagila-themed rap history of Jewish stereotypes in media later my suspicions were confirmed: Disney villains are almost ubiquitously Jew-coded.

Cinderella’s evil stepmother slays the high-brow high-nose sneer. Maleficent from “Sleeping Beauty” rocks demon horns like those twitchy demon Jews of yore. Hades from “Hercules” is a snide familiar outsider with thick New York diction who spits Yiddish phrases with endearing punctuation. In “The Little Mermaid” Ursula has got the sweetest little purple hooked nose you’ve ever seen.

I’m tempted to dismiss all of this as incidental. The cartoon villain is always ugly. But the lengthening list begs the question: why are the phenotypic features common to Jews and other minorities the “ugly” ones?

The historical grounding of Disney’s antisemitic tropes is neither hidden nor surprising. Since the invention of the printing press caricatures of Jews have been broadly distributed.

Early media depicted Jews as wrinkly and fat with flabby lips wheeling eyes hooked noses and their signature unruly black hair.

These depictions made up the basis of Grimm’s Fairy Tales which are rife with antisemitism. The original Grimm includes a slew of fabulous little finds such as “The Jew in the Brambles” where the sweet-faced protagonist tortures a Jew by forcing him to dance in thorns and “The Good Bargain” which involves a Jewish ne’er-do-well who (surprise!) hoards money. The Nazi party capitalized on the distinctly Jewish villains in Grimm’s fairy tales distributing the stories as propaganda.

Disney continued this illustrious history of Jew-coding villains. But unlike Grimm which enjoyed a steamy release in 1812 “Tangled” came out in 2010. What is the excuse for employing the same tired trope nearly 200 years later?

Disney produces media for young minds. There are real consequences to marinating youth in antisemitic imagery that trains us to unthinkingly identify any hint of darkness or Semitic origin with ugliness and evil. I for one grew up with a virulent burning hatred of my untamable curls and by 6th grade I was secretly saving money for a nose job to address my barely perceptible bump.

Today my feelings are more complex. I understand mass media’s impact on culture and with rising antisemitism it is no joke. But Disney villains aren’t only Jew-coded. They are queer-coded too. As a queer Jew and — God forbid — a woman looking for substantive representation pickings are slim. Don’t blame me for finding kinship where I can.

Greedy! Tricky! Sexually deviant! Fat! Snide! I will love these freaky sneaky slimy little villains. I will revel in their counter-cultural sedition. Disney Jew-code your villains so be it! But watch out for your shiny golden locks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvZGlzbmV5LW9mZmVycy1zdGFyLXdhcnMtZmFucy1uZXctZXhwZXJpZW5jZS82NDY4ODk3Lmh0bWzSAWBodHRwczovL2xlYXJuaW5nZW5nbGlzaC52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvZGlzbmV5LW9mZmVycy1zdGFyLXdhcnMtZmFucy1uZXctZXhwZXJpZW5jZS82NDY4ODk3Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney Offers ‘Star Wars’ Fans New Experience,"Walt Disney World in Florida is probably the most famous amusement park in the world. Visitors to the park buy an entry ticket visit exhibits go on rides and eat in restaurants inspired by the entertainment company’s characters and movies. At the end of the day people can go home or if they live far away spend the night in one of the many hotels inside or close to the amusement park.

But starting this week visitors who enjoy the Star Wars movies can do something a little bit more “immersive” as the park officials say.

The park now offers a two-day imaginary trip on a Star Wars spaceship called The Halcyon.

The new attraction “Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser” opened on March 1. It costs about $2500 per person to experience the imaginary world created by filmmaker George Lucas. Guests can talk to robots and meet famous characters like the large hairy Wookiee Chewbacca.

The ”trip” begins with captain and crew welcoming the guests onto The Halcyon. They tell the visitors that the characters Han Solo and Princess Leia vacationed on the ship right after they were married.

Crew members will teach visitors how to use the weapons of the Star Wars story: lightsabers. They can work to fight attacks from the ship’s control center.

Visitors are permitted to come onto the ship wearing clothing from the movies.

Scott Trowbridge leads the creative team at Walt Disney Imagineering. He said: “We are trying to make it safe and fun to play Star Wars.”

The Starcruiser experience lasts two days and two nights. It includes food and drink based on the movies. Visitors who look out the ship’s windows see what looks likes outer space stars and all. The “ship” has 100 living spaces.

Matt Martin who leads part of the Lucasfilm Creative Group compared the experience to a theatrical performance that involves the audience directly.

The experience begins with the crew and captain welcoming guests onto the Starcruiser. Then evil characters known as stormtroopers appear. Actors ask the visitors for help in the fight. The visitors get to choose if they will join the Resistance or the First Order.

Ann Morrow Johnson from Walt Disney Imagineering said visitors can also choose to tell the truth or lie to the actors in the show. They can “really continue that relationship with them” and influence the way the story is told she said.

Trowbridge said visitors can enjoy as much or as little of the experience as they want. They can get involved or they can “sit back.”

The Starcruiser experience took six years to build. Disney would not say its cost. However it is next to two other Star Wars places at Disney World that cost a total of $1 billion to build.

Disney said people are coming back to their parks in recent months as COVID-19 restrictions are reduced. Trowbridge said the company is excited to show off the new show and “about expanding the ways in which we can engage with our guests.”

A full review video is also at the bottom of this article.

I want to warn you — it’s mostly positive. (Editor’s note: I also want to warn you — there are mild spoilers for the experience in this review.)

But before we get to that I think it’s important that we acknowledge that yes these were things we were promised for Galaxy’s Edge. The droids the aliens the reputation system. And I mean promised they were announced to the public on several occasions. But I’m going to focus not on the executives whose bean-counting decisions hurt the experience of the guests but on the Cast Members the entertainers and the creative team.

Walt Disney Imagineering got a chance to do what they do and almost unencumbered create something completely new that changes the business. This industry is different now than it was a few days ago. I’ll explore that more a little later.

The Arrival

The arrival is a weak point. You drive down this weird side road that is shared by Cast Members at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. They have literal shipping containers with the Starcruiser logo painted on the side telling you where to go. It’s not great. I’d even say it’s thoughtless.

Think about arriving at the Magic Kingdom. You get to the TTC you travel across a beautiful lake and see the castle welcoming you on the horizon. You don’t see show buildings or backstage elements (like the spires of Batuu on sticks).

When you arrive at the Starcruiser you see backstage. You can see the actual hotel building too. And sure you can say it’s the terminal but it looks like a hotel. It doesn’t set the stage well.

I hope they give this some thought plant some trees and add something to improve the arrival experience.

Generally for this experience you’ve paid around $6000 and with that price comes expectations. Here at the terminal for arrival and departure is where the white glove service can be found. This isn’t to say that the crew members onboard aren’t fantastic because they are. But when you arrive the crew opens your doors takes care of your luggage and assures its safe delivery to your room and gets you checked in.

If you arrive very early they may try to convince you to take a bus to Disney Springs. We arrived around 12:15 p.m. and were behind 40-50 people. They don’t let you in until closer to 1:00 p.m. but the atmosphere is fun. People are excited and there’s iconic Star Wars music playing. It builds the anticipation.

The music is something they’ve done right where they’ve course-corrected from Batuu. The Star Wars music on Batuu is used sparingly albeit at very good moments. Here the Star Wars music serves to set you up to “live your adventure.” At the end it plays as you depart on your launch pod and arrive back at the terminal and it feels like you’ve reached the ending of your own movie.

The Rooms

On our cruise we stayed in a Galaxy Class Suite (one bedroom) while friends of ours had a Standard Cabin so we were able to get a good look at both room styles. I won’t spend too much time on these since we do have full room tours up where I talk through the details but I do want to say the rooms are not as small as they appear in photos.

The Standard Cabin has a good amount of floor space. And to answer a question many of you have asked the bunk beds are a sort of optical illusion. They look small in photos and they look small in real life but they fit adults over 6′ tall. I don’t know if it’s the curved trim or the way they are built-in but they are regular-sized beds.

They don’t give you regular bedding. The mattress has a sheet on it and you are given a weird sleeping bag. It has the Chandrila Star Line logo on it which is great. And it’s comfortable.

The viewport is the downside of the rooms. It’s not great. It has a weird glare and sometimes gets blurred especially around the sides. It’s difficult to capture photos and video of the screen. However watching it is neat. It was thoughtfully done and is in sync with events happening around the ship. For example when a hyperspace jump is performed during a Bridge Training session you can see the jump in your room’s viewport. It all ties into the story and you can see nearby planets as the ship travels the galaxy.

As a concept and story point it’s very cool. As a practical display piece it leaves some things to be desired.

Overall the rooms have a lot of charm. There are small details that are fun to find and they feel very “Star Wars-y.” And so do the hallways which reinforces that Disney did such a disservice to themselves with the early promotional material. The whole ship feels very authentically Star Wars.

Ultimately you won’t likely spend a lot of time in your room unless you have small children who need a break.

The Experience

After we checked in and got settled we went to the Sublight Lounge to have cocktails. There was a lot of mingling happening and the story started to gradually begin. Some of the characters were in the lounge and introducing themselves to guests. Raithe Kole Gaya’s manager stopped to chat with us but the most important interaction was when First Order Lieutenant Croy came by. He hit it off with some of our group and it stuck.

The Cast overall are a huge highlight of the experience. Regular readers will know we always say live entertainment is the magic and it’s so apparent here. But even the crew members who weren’t actors were incredible. Everyone onboard has a story. They’ll tell you their homeworld information about their character and we even learned some Star Wars facts along the way. We didn’t have a single bad experience with the cast; they were truly exceptional.

I know many of you are concerned about the level of roleplaying involved. This adventure is up to you. Even as a bystander it’s so much fun to watch and you’ll still feel involved. Because this first cruise was mainly for this review and to learn all about the experience I didn’t participate much. I sat back to watch and see what people were doing and how everything worked.

I wished I had put myself out there more. On the next cruise I’m going to go full out and really dive into it. It really is what you make of it. You’ll still have a ton of fun if you don’t get involved with the roleplay aspect but if you put yourself in the story and actively participate it’s a whole other level.

We saw people who put themselves out there and really connected with the characters and really became memorable characters themselves. The more you show your face and talk with the main characters the more they remember you. They’ll address you by name remember information you told them and trust you with harder tasks (which you can fail!).

It was also a great part of the experience to be part of the group you end up aligned with. The missions and meetings become enthralling experiences because the other guests are the people you wished showed up every day in the parks. These are the fans who truly love live theater theme parks or Star Wars and want to be a part of it.

The cast are fantastic at improv and quick to respond to anything you say to them. It’s fun and funny to see what unfolds.

The bad part of the experience is the Play Disney Parks app which is unfortunately a necessary part of the stay. My advice is to use the device Disney provides because guests are having problems with personal phones. I tested it out to see what the issues were and didn’t receive certain mission prompts on my personal phone. Cast Members said it was just a weird issue with the app. Plus it was kind of nice to have my own phone for taking photos and videos.

Another issue with the app is the excursion to Batuu whereas on the ship the app sends you to do things and meet face to face with characters and physically interact with elements of the ship. The missions on Batuu are the same as they ever were; solving puzzles turning off a ship etc. It doesn’t feel like Star Wars and it doesn’t feel like you’re actually doing anything.

I didn’t love the excursion to Batuu but it’s instrumental for your reputation and achieving what you need to do for your chosen alliance. The box truck ride is the weakest point of the whole experience. You take this cool transport up to the ship and then you ride in a truck to Batuu. It’s dark crowded and clearly the victim of budget cuts.

The original concept had video screens to see your journey and a physical droid pilot. Now you have a few minutes of voiceover from an unseen droid and no screens. Even if I hadn’t known what could have been this still would have been a lackluster experience.

On Batuu it really does take away from your immersion. It’s hard to ignore that you’re suddenly in a theme park. However like I said the tasks you are assigned are important to the story and you technically paid for the Lightning Lane passes and meal voucher. Also the food on Batuu is better than what’s served at the lunch buffet that day and the voucher can be used for the only free alcoholic beverage of the trip.

Rise of the Resistance is the same experience though while wearing your Halcyon Passenger button you may get some unique interactions with the cast. However on Millennium Falcon: Smuggler’s Run Hondo has two added lines about the Halcyon at the beginning of the preshow and when you exit.

The line at the exit is important because it alludes to the coaxium that plays a big role in the Starcruiser plot. It’s really neat because you’ve been to Batuu before and ridden Smugglers Run and now on the Starcruiser you get the payoff. The Starcruiser story creates a compelling ending to the narrative of Galaxy’s Edge. The show writing is great and they did an excellent job putting the story together.

Having nearly 48 hours for the story to marinate and unfold for little moments to come together piece by piece really pays off. It’s wonderful.

Back on the ship on the second day activities start to pick up around noon. Most of them are the little generic “cruise” activities. Sector Set is Space Bingo Know Your Co-Pilot is a watered-down Newlywed Game kids can race droids and more.

We didn’t find those to be worth our time but we did attend Cantina Chronicles at the Sublight Lounge. It features three non-alcoholic specialty drinks that are normally an extra charge but this experience is complimentary. The bartenders give you an in-universe backstory for each drink. It was fun and relaxing.

Honestly you’re not going to be able to do everything. There are so many things happening and you only have so much time. I recommend that you sit down and look over the schedule and really think about what’s important to you and plan on missing out on some things. The schedule doesn’t account for the missions that pop up and you don’t want to miss those.

Keep in mind that you will also miss out on missions for the other paths. We followed the First Order path but could tell we were missing out on adventures with the Resistance and helping Gaya. We’ll have more in-depth articles detailing each track soon if you want to know more.

I don’t want to spoil the adventure so I’m not going to go into too much detail here but the story plays out as a real living scenario. It moves across the decks and around the ship. You can’t see everything simply because it’s too organic; it’s playing out in real-time. And that’s a good thing. It feels authentic.

If you do the basic stuff in the Datapad at the beginning you’ll get invited to the key events on the final night which should not be missed. It’s very important and very cool. The events build up to the finale and escalate the tension. Big story events start happening across the ship not small five-minute things but scenarios that put you in an important role in the finale.

These moments really encapsulate how great the entertainers are and how thought-out the story was. Minor spoilers ahead; but for me the highlight was this one moment that I happened upon by chance.

I was on the landing of a staircase leading to guest cabins when the elevator doors opened to reveal Resistance operatives (pretending to be First Order sympathizers) attempting to distract Lt. Croy. It was a real Abbott & Costello moment as the guests were hitting all the buttons and standing in the way of the door. Just then the other elevator opened to reveal some of the Saja who peeked around the corner to see if Croy was around. They kind of looked at me like “Is he there?” and when I confirmed they just slunk back into the elevator and closed the doors so they wouldn’t be seen.

It was a really fun moment and there’s a lot of magic here. If you love theme park entertainment improv or live theater this is top-notch. And the guests who are getting into the roles and becoming characters who are part of the story get to interact with these tremendous actors. It’s a well-constructed system that’s fun to watch and fun to be a part of. It really works.

Food and Beverage

It’s not great.

The Sublight Lounge is the best dining experience and not just because of the alcohol. The cocktails (which cost extra) are solid and have cool souvenir cups. The snacks there are great especially the smoked cheese en cloche and chips. There’s a lot of really good food up there and it’s included in your stay.

The buffets in the Crown of Corellia dining room were lackluster. One or two things at each buffet were good but the rest ranged from underseasoned to flavorless to outright gross. The few good things are good not great and the rest ranges from mediocre to bad. At one point during the lunch buffet on day two we were laughing because there were chocolate chip cookies. They ended up being the best thing during that meal.

For dinner on the first night which is the performance with Gaya we had upgraded to the Captain’s Table. It’s in the middle of the room and it’s not really dining with the Captain. She visited the table for about ten minutes and it was the only awkward interaction we had on our trip. I don’t know if it’s the setting or because everyone but the Captain is eating but it was a little weird.

Story moments play out near the Captain’s Table like interactions between Lt. Croy and Gaya. There are tiny supplemental extras on the menu but nothing significant. Overall we don’t think the upgrade is worth it.

Gaya’s performance at dinner was awesome which is another reason we don’t recommend the Captain’s Table. Half of the table faces away from the stage and while Gaya moves around the room during the show you still miss out on things like Ouannii playing the keyboard.

For dinner on the second night each dish is themed to a different planet for a “Taste Around the Galaxy.” It’s cool. The presentation is fun. The chefs come out and introduce each dish and give a little history about it the lighting and music change and the servers all come out in a line and present the dishes to each table.

Both dinners have their moments. The food was a mixture of good and forgettable. Nothing was outright bad but again a lot was underseasoned. The dinners are solid and definitely better than the buffets.

There’s a grab-and-go breakfast in the Sublight Lounge with pre-boxed selections of a few items from the buffet.

There’s also a snack area in the Atrium that is stocked with some good stuff like spicy popcorn cookies with the Chandrila Star Line logo fresh fruit and more. It’s available most of the day.

The drinks are only available when the dining room is open but offer unlimited blue and green milk soft drinks coffee and more. There is a water fountain for refilling your bottles in the Atrium that is available 24/7 and you can ask for soft drinks and such in the Sublight Lounge.

We’ll be posting reviews of every item available so stay tuned.

Is It Worth It?

I know this is the question everyone has.

The answer is no.

I’ve seen others try to sound objective like “Can you really tell someone if something is worth it to them?” But when it comes down to it there is a trade-off of goods and services for money and the price of something delivers an expectation. That’s life.

So is it worth it at the price they are charging for it? No. It can’t be. It’s an insane amount of money.

You can have a luxury cruise vacation for less money. Even the shortest Disney cruise is longer than this. It’s true that those are two very different types of trips. And maybe it feels so rushed because it’s great and you don’t want to leave the story; I don’t know.

But whenever you spend money on an experience even if you’re very wealthy it comes down to wanting to get the value of what you’ve paid and do everything you want to do.

For the Galactic Starcruiser there’s no way it’s worth this amount of money. As a Star Wars or theater fan you will have a tremendous unbelievable unforgettable time. But it’s just an absurd amount of money.

In good faith I have to say this: please do not put yourself in debt to go to the Star Wars hotel. I know I’m sitting here telling you that it’s great but it’s not worth putting yourself in a hole financially. And I assure you this isn’t going away. At some point bookings will go lower; it’s inevitable. Disney will burn through the number of people willing to pay that much and everyone who wants to do it will have done it.

Eventually they’ll need to update or change the experience so people want to come back. But in between those two moments there will be lower rates. Groups like Annual Passholders and Disney Vacation Club members will get discounts. And it will be more affordable. If you feel you need to do this but it’s a big financial burden wait Disney out. The chips will eventually be down and when they are they’ll always come back for the rest of us.

That being said if you can afford to do this do it. It’s really cool. To see unencumbered creativity at work is amazing. I love this artistry and nothing has ever brought me greater joy than to see what it can be at its full potential.

The live entertainment is so powerful so much more magical than any attraction could be. It’s the forefront and star here. When the whole experience comes to an end and the whole ship is packed into the Atrium and screaming and cheering and the Star Wars music swells over the noise it’s a powerful moment you will never forget. It really made me emotional.

What the Starcruiser Means for the Future of Themed Entertainment

It means we can’t go back. We can’t accept less than this ever again. This is the level that everything has to be after. It has changed the industry for the better and set a new bar for immersion storytelling and the future of themed entertainment.

The pressure is on Disney. You’ve shown what can be done and done it well.

So rarely do we get new things from a company that has become so budget-conscious. This is the shiniest moment in an era of darkness for Walt Disney World.

It’s important that we remember they’ve put this behind a huge paywall. It’s a hard pill to swallow and this positive review does not absolve anyone of that. Disney should believe in giving that experience to every guest. The Starcruiser stay can be a step up but the other elements should be in Batuu. Bring the droids and aliens. Make the Datapad more interactive and interesting.

Is it worth $6000 or more? No but it is really fun. It’s truly fantastic. If you’re a Star Wars fan or a theme park fan you’ll love this. If you’re both you’ll be blown away.

Thrill-seekers of all ages are excited to return to theme parks but gravity-defying rides and immersive attractions aren't the only things they have an appetite for. In the last two decades food and beverage offerings have become an increasingly important part of the amusements business. And the Walt Disney Co. is the one that's led the charge in delivering innovative and delicious meals snacks and drinks to parkgoers. For decades Disney has pushed the boundaries of food and beverage innovation developing unique park favorites like Mickey Mouse-shaped ice cream bars and pretzels as well as Dole Whips and themed candied apples and cookies.

""Rides and attractions are the number one then food and beverage are really neck and neck with why people go to the parks"" Dennis Speigel president of International Theme Parks Services said. ""It's just a fact. And what parks have seized on in the last 20 years is building their new attractions around areas that offer food and beverage."" Disney has taken this a step further with its new Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser experience. Unlike its themed lands like Pandora Galaxy's Edge and Avenger's Campus the Halcyon is a two-day immersive experience. Guests aren't strolling in for a bite or a drink they are living a Star Wars story for 48 hours. That means chef Brian Piasecki and his team had to create an all-inclusive program of food that would be delivered to guests over the course of two days. Onboard the Halcyon Disney is showcasing some of its more ambitious and delectable food and beverage creations. Piasecki worked to create dishes for breakfast lunch and dinner that were accessible to guests but also upscale. The lunch buffets for example feature familiar dishes such as grilled cheese and tomato soup peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and salads but with a distinctly Star Wars spin.

The food trays which are used for the breakfast and lunch buffets are uniquely shaped with three rectangular depressions so that dishes can slide into place snugly and not move when being carried into the Crown of Corellia Dining Room the main eating hall onboard the Halcyon. They have a distinct sci-fi aesthetic but are also incredibly functional especially for those who want to try a little bit of everything. ""It's so important to the experience and it's something that is really under the microscope now in our industry"" Speigel said. ""Everybody is looking at ways to improve and that's quality service style plating everything. I think that's going to be with us forever now.""

A history of innovation

While Disney has long used food design as a way of elevating its traditional fare it entered a new phase of innovation in 2017 when it launched its theme park land based on the planet Pandora from James Cameron's film ""Avatar."" With this new land Disney had the opportunity to create its own cuisine. It wasn't translating foreign dishes and recreating them at Epcot it was taking inspiration from a film about an alien planet. Chefs used spices found in Argentinian Brazilian and Chinese cooking to bring a distinct flavor profile to its food. ""It expands the experience"" said Bill Coan president and CEO of iTEC Entertainment. ""Disney is playing this out and playing it up to advance the visitor experience and at the same time generate incremental revenue."" Guests tend to be less stringent about their diets while on vacation and will opt to try out menu items that they cannot get anywhere else Coan said. At Satu'li Canteen guests make their own grain bowls choosing between a base of quinoa and vegetable salad red and sweet potato hash mixed whole grain and rice or romaine and kale salad. Then they add either grilled chicken roasted beef shrimp or chili-spiced tofu on top as well as a variety of dressing options.

The menu also features ""pods"" better known as bao buns. Inside these steamed buns is either a cheeseburger or vegetable curry. The culinary team also designed unique desserts for the themed land. There is a blueberry cream cheese mouse with passion fruit curd and a chocolate cake with crunchy cookie crumbs and banana cream topping.

Each has been designed to have an out-of-this-world look that is both appetizing and photographable. Instagram has become a place for parkgoers to share their food experience at the parks with others and to get ideas of what they should try in the future. Pandora also has an array of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks available from Pongu Pongu a themed Tiki bar located near the canteen.

Taste a galaxy far far away

Disney continued this innovation when it opened its two Galaxy's Edge locations one in Florida and one in California in 2019. The main dining location is Docking Bay 7. Here guests can sample the Braised Shaak Roast (beef with pasta) or the Felucian Garden Spread (vegan meatballs with hummus) among other items. There's also Ronto Roasters which is home to the famed Ronto Wrap. It's a grilled sausage and roasted pork wrap with a spicy slaw. Make sure you have a drink if you decide to bite into this one it's got a kick.

If you are in the California park you can wash it down with a glass of Phattro from the Docking Bay. It's a play on a half lemonade half iced tea drink and features a dash of pear juice. Oga's Cantina is a place for Star Wars fans to embrace their inner scoundrel. Here guests can order alcoholic drinks that are both familiar and foreign with names like Fuzzy Tauntaun Jedi Mind Trick and Bloody Rancor. Those looking to skip the booze can try out mixed drinks like the Carbon Freeze and the Hyperdrive which feature fruit juices popping pearls and dry ice. Reservations for Oga's fill up quickly and often purchasable specialty drink mugs are out of stock. ""[Disney] understands that if you do it and you do it right the theming and the quality of what you are serving the guests will buy it"" Speigel said.

Additionally throughout the themed land parkgoers can purchase special bottles of Coca-Cola products. The beverage company worked with Disney to create stylized Coke Sprite and Dasani bottles that fit into the world of Batuu. The sodas are reminiscent of thermal detonators from the Star Wars films and feature the name of each brand in Aurebesh the fictional language of Star Wars.

Down to Earth food

For Disneyland's Avengers Campus which opened in 2021 the theme park was faced with a new challenge — innovating traditional American food. Disney's culinary team decided to lean into its superhero theme and rely on Ant-Man and the Wasp to create unique menu items. The main dining area within Avengers Campus is called Pym Test Kitchen. Here scientists use growing and shrinking technology to make monstrously large and surprisingly small creations. Guests can enjoy chicken sandwiches with massive chicken patties spaghetti and meatballs with one large meatball and soft pretzels that are the size of a head among other items.

Next door is Pym Tasting Lab a place for adults to enjoy craft beers and signature cocktails. The mixologists play with flavor offering a variety of ingredients that range from habanero and mango to lemon and vanilla.

There are two food carts. The first is Shawarma Palace a nod to the iconic mid-credits scene from ""The Avengers."" The other is called Terran Treats. This booth is located near the Guardians of the Galaxy ride and features items that play on traditional human foods. Circular rainbow churros and bright purple cream puffs are just a few of the delicacies available.

Venturing back to space

In creating the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser experience Disney took everything it had learned from Pandora Galaxy's Edge and Avengers Campus and set the bar higher. As part of the total cost of the two-day experience all meals are included. So for breakfast and lunch guests are treated to buffet-style meals. They can pick and choose from a dozen or so options and eat as much or as little as they want. ""It fills you up and you have fun eating it"" Speigel said.

The dining room is equipped with a traditional soda fountain as well as free Blue Milk and Green Milk which is featured in the Galaxy's Edge park land. Special alcoholic beverages are the only menu items that need to be purchased separately.

For dinner there is a set menu. And on the first night on board the Halcyon dinner comes with a show. While guests are enjoying colorful bao buns and noodles the galactic songstress Gaya begins her performance a mix of pop jazz and rhythm and blues. Chef Piasecki pointed out that the different-colored bao buns reflect the colors in Gaya's outfit.

The second course was served family style at each table and consisted of Bantha Beef Tenderloin Tip Yip Chicken Stewed Shrimp Green Herbed Fluffy Rice and Surabat Spiced Flora. The beef tenderloin was glazed with tamarind and came alongside potatoes the chicken was glazed in bourbon and lightly fried the shrimp was cooked with lemon grass and served with coconut-lime foam the rice was cooked with herbs and the ""flora"" was vegetables roasted with Harissa spice. Dinner on the second night was a ""taste of the galaxy"" featuring dishes based on different planets in the Star Wars universe. It was during this meal that Disney's culinary prowess was on full display.

Matt Belloni: Bill you floated in a column that the recently exited CNN president Jeff Zucker might be a good fit to run Paramount Global (the former ViacomCBS). Not sure I agree with that. Zucker had some stumbles as C.E.O. of NBC Universal from 2007-2011. I remember when he put the erratic Ben Silverman in charge of NBC which everyone knew would be a disaster. (It was.)

“This is an excellent opening” said David A.

The first full-length Batman movie arrived in 1966. “The Batman” starring Robert Pattinson and Zoë Kravitz and directed by Matt Reeves is the 14th installment from the Batman universe including animated entries. It is supposed to spawn multiple sequels and spinoffs including a series for the HBO Max streaming service that focuses on the villainous Penguin now being played by Colin Farrell.

By successfully rolling out “The Batman” which received positive reviews senior executives at Warner Bros. including Toby Emmerich the chairman and Walter Hamada the president of DC Films buttressed their standing at a crucial moment: Warner Bros. is about to be taken over by Discovery Communications.

The Family Feud host’s stepdaughter Lori has been dating Creed star Jordan for over a year.

During an appearance on Today with Hoda & Jenna the TV personality was asked as part of the segment ”Sip or Spill”: whether he is excited by the prospect of the pair getting engaged.

“If he were to ask to marry her would you approve?” the hosts ask Harvey who initially seemed hesitant to answer the question.

“Man this is a hard one” the 65-year-old said. “I’ve given away two daughters. I’ve got four. That’s a really hard one.”

He added: “I would have to say so far – yeah yeah.” He then changed his mind stating: “No no no man.”

The extension includes a monthly rate of $19.65 per household up from $17.07 per household per month. The price is updated annually based on the consumer price index for solid waste and trash collection. The negotiated rate for the 2023 fiscal year is $20.15 per household per month.

Allen Wainwright Calcasieu Parish public works director said the monthly rate was increased because of the rising costs of labor fuel raw materials and other factors. Changes in how residents purchase goods have also led to a 20-40 percent increase in waste he said.

“That’s driven by people ordering more items online that are delivered in boxes” Wainwright said. “Most waste is thrown away each day.”

Despite the rate increase the parish negotiated a good deal for residential garbage collection Wainwright said.

Calcasieu Parish pays for residential garbage collection in unincorporated areas of Wards 2-8 Wainwright said. That service is paid for directly by a parishwide 1.5 cent sales tax.

Because the sales tax is not levied in Ward 1 the Moss Bluff/Gillis area those residents are directly billed the same rate if they choose to go with Waste Management. Ward 1 residents can also choose Progressive Waste Solutions for garbage collection which is authorized by the Police Jury to operate within Ward 1. That company determines its own rates to charge customers.

Other changes that take effect in 2023 include Waste Management only picking up cans that it provides and allowing residents up to three cans per household.

Individuals are improperly using dumpsters across the installation which leads to problems with pick-up excess waste and sometimes hazardous materials entering the landfill. see less | View Image Page

FORT BRAGG N.C. – Individuals are improperly using dumpsters across the installation. The improper use of dumpsters leads to problems with pick-up excess waste and sometimes hazardous materials entering the landfill.



“It’s important that people know how to properly dispose of their unwanted items” said Col. Scott Pence Fort Bragg garrison commander. “Proper disposal reduces waste management costs and is key to being good stewards of the environment. It’s important that we take ownership of our actions and understand how what we do today impacts the future.”



Each dumpster has a label displaying a list of prohibited items including aerosol cans ammunition items blast media electronics furniture mattresses hazardous waste paint pallets scrap metal tires etc. These items should never be disposed of in the dumpster. Instead Fort Bragg and the surrounding communities have several options for proper disposal.



One option is the convenience site at Fort Bragg’s Lamont Landfill. This convenience site has large dumpsters that can be used by units organizations and Soldiers living in the barracks. Per Army Regulation 420-1 Army-owned and Army-operated solid waste management facilities will not be used as a municipal or regional Solid Waste Management facility or for the surrounding communities.



It is located on Coolyconch Road which is located immediately before exiting Long Street gate. It is open from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and federal holidays.



The landfill accepts broken furniture items cardboard non-military passenger tires pallets scrap steel scrap aluminum white goods with Freon removed cables and wires concrete and yard waste.



Families living in on-post housing should use Corvias’ bulk trash household trash and recyclables options and should not use the landfill.



The Department of Defense has implemented a goal to divert 40% of solid waste from incineration and landfilling. In support of this goal the Qualified Recycling Program reclaims and diverts materials from the solid waste stream and increases recovery of recyclable materials.



“Proper recycling and waste disposal help the environment extend the lifespan of waste management facilities and return funds back to the installation through sales of recyclable materials” said James Duncan a supervisory environmental protection specialist with the directorate of public works. “Proceeds from recyclable sales fund pollution abatement energy conservation alternative-fuel infrastructure support occupational safety and health activities and morale and welfare activity programs. On average the Qualified Recycling Program returns over one million dollars annually to the installation. It’s important that the people living on-post and the units and organizations around the installation dispose of their waste properly even if doing so isn’t always the most convenient.”



Residents units and organizations can use the Fort Bragg Recycle and Hazardous Waste Facility for many of the items that should not be thrown in a dumpster or trash can. This facility is located at building 3-1240 at the northwest corner of Butner and Reilly Roads. Hours of operation are 7a.m. to 4p.m. Monday through Friday except federal holidays. The recycling facility accepts aluminum cans cardboard copper wire and tubing glass bottles plastic bottles printer cartridges lead acid batteries magazines newspapers shredded office paper steel cans and scrap steel. All items must be sorted and separated.



In accordance with the DoD regulations Fort Bragg’s recycling program is prohibited from accepting any electronics. These items should not be placed in dumpsters or curb-side containers.



Electronics can be recycled at the Ann Street Landfill in Fayetteville any of the Cumberland County Container Sites the Dunn-Erwin Landfill the Anderson Creek Landfill and the Johnsonville Convenience and Recycling Center. Acceptable items include laptops desktops keyboards cell phones video games hard drives televisions rechargeable batteries printers etc. (See Editor’s note for hours of operation and locations.)



Remember that all government owned items are required to be turned in to the Defense Logistics Agency. Fort Bragg DLA can be reached at 910-748-5625.



The recycling facility also runs the Recycling Incentives Program. Through this program units and organizations can exchange eligible recyclable materials for funds that can be used at Family Morale Welfare and Recreation facilities.



“It’s important that we all do our part to make Fort Bragg the best military community to live and work in” said Pence. “Fort Bragg is our home and we take pride and ownership of sustainable resource management and ensuring we leave the installation in better condition for future generations.”

WE NOW HAVE an agreement amongst 175 countries reached in Nairobi in Kenya last week to develop a legally binding treaty to deal with plastic waste.

This was something I called for last year. At the time I said we needed global limits on plastic waste that would be as important for the battle against plastic rubbish as the 2015 Paris Accords were or the struggle against global warming. I maintain this view.

My views on what the treaty should include

Two years of hard work lie ahead to hit the 2024 target of completing a treaty that I hope will contribute towards completely reshaping petrochemical cost curves.

“The agreement calls for a treaty covering the full lifecycle of plastics from production to disposal” wrote the Guardian. Excellent news.

Equally good news is the agreement’s acknowledgement that lower-income countries “will find it harder to deal with plastic and pollution than high-income ones and so there is a need for some sort of financing model to help curb plastic use and waste” according to the New Scientist in this article.

What must now happen is recognition amongst all the stakeholders working towards this treaty that essential single-use plastics cannot be banned – for example polyethylene (PE) films used to wrap food and polypropylene (PP) injection grades used to make disposable syringes.

And in my view the treaty should also:

Include economic incentives driving greater re-use – for example incentives leading to distribution points where plastic bottles can be re-filled many times with say again shampoo.

Encourage more R&D into reducing the volume of polymers used in packaging without sacrificing essential aspects of performance such as extending the shelf life of food.

Result in further R&D into how to make packaging from single rather multiple types of polymers. So called multi-layer polymer packaging makes recycling harder.

Identify end-use applications that need to be banned because they provide no strong societal value and are hard if not impossible to collect and recycle.

Most of all ensure adequate rubbish collection systems are built for the 3bn people mainly in the developing world who lack such systems. An astonishing 2bn people lack any kind of rubbish collection system at all. As the old NGO example goes a villager in Indonesia used to throw rice leaves into his local river after he had finished his lunch (rice leaves are a traditional way of wrapping food). Now he throws plastic bags into the river. Or plastic waste collects in piles on the ground and ends up being subject to uncontrolled burning to generate energy and get rid of the rubbish. This releases toxins.

Polymer producers should be held responsible by the treaty for the final disposal of the products they make – along with the converters and brand owners.

Using blockchain technology we might be able to track each plastic pellet as it leaves a polymer plant all the way to the point where the plastic bag made from the pellet is either thrown into an Indonesian river or collected stored in a properly managed landfills or recycled.

Companies that have invested in rubbish collection and processing systems in Indonesia should be given plastic waste tax breaks or credits they can trade.

This would as mentioned earlier completely reshape petrochemical cost curves. Companies far to the left of cost curves would be those who have invested in plastic waste and processing systems. Access to cheap feedstock would no longer define success.

Polymer producers should not however sit back and wait for the day to hopefully arrive when the treaty makes them change their behaviour.

A mountain of other legislation is being enacted right now that should be enough to motivate polymer producers to immediately press on with reshaping how they do business. The companies that don’t respond today will be tomorrow’s losers because of the ever-greater weight of legislation.

We must move quickly because of the growing evidence of the damage plastic waste is causing to the environment and human health. One area where evidence is building is the toxicity of plastic waste.

The health “of all the world’s oceans and seas” at risk

This was the warning from an October 2021 United Nations Environment Programme report. Its key findings included:

• Plastics are the largest most harmful and most persistent fraction of marine litter accounting for at least 85% per cent of total marine waste. They cause lethal and sub-lethal effects in whales seals turtles birds and fish as well as invertebrates such as bivalves plankton worms and corals.

• Their effects include entanglement starvation drowning laceration of internal tissues smothering and deprivation of oxygen and light physiological stress and toxicological harm.

• Plastics can also alter global carbon cycling through their effect on plankton and primary production in marine freshwater and terrestrial systems. Marine ecosystems especially mangroves seagrasses corals and salt marshes play a major role in sequestering carbon.

• The more damage we do to oceans and coastal areas the harder it is for these ecosystems to both offset and remain resilient to climate change.

• When plastics break down in the marine environment they transfer microplastics synthetic and cellulosic microfibres toxic chemicals metals and micropollutants into waters and sediments and eventually into marine food chains.

• Microplastics act as vectors for pathogenic organisms harmful to humans fish and aquaculture stocks. When microplastics are ingested they can cause changes in gene and protein expression inflammation disruption of feeding behaviour decreases in growth changes in brain development and reduced filtration and respiration rates.

• They can alter the reproductive success and survival of marine organisms and compromise the ability of keystone species and ecological “engineers” to build reefs or bioturbated sediments.

• Risks to human health and well-being arise from the open burning of plastic waste ingestion of seafood contaminated with plastics exposure to pathogenic bacteria transported on plastics and leaching out of substances of concern to coastal waters.

• The release of chemicals associated with plastics through leaching into the marine environment is receiving increasing attention as some of these chemicals are substances of concern or have endocrine disrupting properties.

• Microplastics can enter the human body through inhalation and absorption via the skin and accumulate in organs including the placenta. Human uptake of microplastics via seafood is likely to pose serious threats to coastal and indigenous communities where marine species are the main source of food.

• The links between exposure to chemicals associated with plastics in the marine environment and human health are unclear. However some of these chemicals are associated with serious health impacts especially in women.

• Marine plastics have a widespread effect on society and human well-being. They may deter people from visiting beaches and shorelines and enjoying the benefits of physical activity social interaction and general improvement of both physical and mental health.

• Mental health may be affected by the knowledge that charismatic marine animals such as sea turtles whales dolphins and many seabirds are at risk. These animals have cultural importance for some communities. Images and descriptions of whales and seabirds with their stomachs full of plastic fragments which are prevalent in mainstream media can provoke strong emotional impacts.

Grim reading eh? I recommend reading the rest of the report and this report released last month by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

“Only 9% of plastic waste is recycled (15% is collected for recycling but 40% of that is disposed of as residues)” said the OECD study.

“Another 19% is incinerated 50% ends up in landfill and 22% evades waste management systems and goes into uncontrolled dumpsites is burned in open pits or ends up in terrestrial or aquatic environments especially in poorer countries” the study added.

New methodologies for forecasting polymers demand are needed

I’ve written before that if polymers demand in the developing world continues to grow very rapidly it would be a sign of progress in the battle against extreme poverty as polymers improve the quality and length of human lives. They are essential for modern-day healthcare and for food supply chains that make sure people don’t go hungry.

But how rapidly? Conventional forecasts assume that as the region’s GDP growth will remain strong so will the expansion in demand for polymers. But what if GDP growth becomes less polymer intensive as some unnecessary single-use plastic applications are banned as more bottles are re-used and as less volumes of polymers are needed to make packaging?

This thinking led to the charts at the beginning of this post. The chart on the left shows the ICIS base case for global linear-low density polyethylene (LLDPE) demand growth in the 20 years from 2022 until 2041 versus actual consumption in 2002-2021.

We assume growth of no less than 192% in 2022-2041 in the developing world plus China (China falls somewhere between being a developed and developing economy) and 35% in the developed world.

Just for argument’s sake – and there no basis for this other than guesswork – my downside scenario reduces 2021-2041 to a quarter of these levels. Developing world demand rises by around 48% and developed world demand increases by 9%.

The result is cumulative global LLDPE demand would be a staggering 514m tonnes lower under my downside than under our base case.

You must built proper forecast methodologies that consider the transition to less polymer intensive GDP growth – or polymers growth that is less linked to GDP than in the past. This is what we are doing at ICIS.

Conclusion: Geopolitics and recycling

Let’s hope that the geopolitical turmoil in Ukraine doesn’t delay more legislation to deal with the plastic waste crisis and the work needed to achieve a global treaty in 2024. But the turmoil as I discussed on Friday could accelerate the adoption of one of the solutions to plastic waste – recycling.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the risks of being heavily dependent on energy and polymer imports from any country. Recycling is a “local-for-local” manufacturing chain because you cannot move plastic waste long distances for sustainability and economic reasons.

Despite all the immediate challenges petrochemical companies face resulting from Ukraine I believe they must press on with reducing carbon emissions and plastic waste – two very separate challenges. I can see absolutely no downsides in doing so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYm9yZ2VucHJvamVjdC5vcmcvcmVkdWNpbmctcGxhc3RpYy1wb2xsdXRpb24taW4tdGhlLXBoaWxpcHBpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reducing Plastic Pollution in the Philippines,"

Although plastic consumption is higher in more developed countries like the United States a 2021 report from Our World in Data states that roughly a third of all plastics in the ocean comes from the Philippines. Plastic floods the Philippines’ beaches and rivers. Although people might associate this level of litter with overconsumption plastic pollution in the Philippines is both the result and cause of poverty.

How Plastic Links to Poverty

Plastic and global poverty interlink in several ways. For one the prevalence of plastic pollution and other waste in less developed countries is a direct consequence of the global waste trade as more developed countries “export” their waste to less developed countries that lack the means to properly recycle or otherwise dispose of it. The lack of sufficient waste management infrastructure in less developed countries hinders proper plastic disposal as mismanaged plastics move from population hubs into rivers and coastal ecosystems.

In the Philippines discarding rather than recycling plastics leads to a loss of revenue of more than $890 million annually which equates to “78% of the material value of the key plastic resins.” Plastic pollution also worsens conditions for the world’s impoverished. Consumption inhalation and any other exposure to additives in most plastic can cause birth defects disturb hormonal functions or lead to cancer among other detrimental impacts.

Plastic pollution in the Philippines also threatens local economies which are reliant on fishing shipping and tourism. This pollution notably decreases overall biodiversity interferes with shipping equipment and mars otherwise beautiful beaches and rivers.

NGOs Tackling Plastic Pollution in the Philippines

Despite the dire situation several organizations are taking a stand against plastic pollution in the Philippines. These include the Plastic Bank The Plastic Flamingo and the Blastik Project.

The Plastic Bank. This international organization promotes ethical recycling systems along coastlines and provides additional sources of revenue for those living in poverty. As of Jan. 26 2022 the Plastic Bank recovered 41.64 kilograms of plastic the equivalent of 91.8 pounds or roughly “2 billion single-use plastic bottles.” The organization allows individuals to collect plastic waste in exchange for money basic family necessities and access to social and training programs. A branch of the Plastic Bank centered in the Philippines has stated on Facebook that people from local communities can collect plastic waste in exchange “for bonuses that help to provide basic family necessities like groceries school supplies for their children digital connectivity and more.” By equipping individuals with these opportunities the Plastic Bank gives them the tools necessary for greater economic mobility. The Plastic Flamingo. This social enterprise spreads awareness of plastic pollution through webinars and educational campaigns and offers public drop-off points for plastic disposal. However it primarily focuses on converting plastic waste into building materials. People throughout Manila can get rid of their plastic waste at collection sites for the organization to collect and recycle into “Eco-lumbers.” Through its creation of Eco-lumbers and its participation in many construction projects The Plastic Flamingo transforms a source of economic concern into a valuable sustainable resource that people could use as humanitarian housing material alternatives. In 2021 the group notably made its first prototype of an “Eco-shelter” made entirely out of recycled products. The Blastik Project. Similar to the Plastic Bank the Blastik Project equips farmers to reduce plastic pollution in the Philippines and create a more circular economy. The project also educates local communities on the potential economic benefits of recycling. The organization also offers to teach Filipinos how to recycle plastic bottles and caps into home decor wallets tiles and more. This supplemental income could make a significant difference especially for those struggling with poverty. People also use plastics as bottle planters in the organization’s farms which provides the project’s contributors with organic food. As of November 2021 the Blastik Project recycled more than 17 tons of plastic waste.

Looking Ahead

Ultimately pollution and poverty intertwine in a self-feeding cycle. It would be impossible to tackle one without tackling the other especially because of the global waste trade which forces less developed countries to bear the consequences of overconsumption in wealthier nations. However a greater shift to recycling and sustainable development could turn the tide on plastic pollution in the Philippines.

VIDEO above from HPD officer on Feb. 23 shooting. Viewer discretion is advised.

Blake Ovard/News-Sun

Around 10:29 p.m. on Feb. 23 Hobbs police officer Jorge Carrillo stopped to help what appeared to be a stranded motorist in a 2003 Dodge Ram dually pickup on Turner Street.

That stop resulted in a shootout between Carrillo and the truck’s owner Daniel Ramirez 27 of Hobbs. Carrillo was shot in the leg and Ramirez later died at Covenant Health Hobbs Hospital from the gunshot wounds.

Carrillo’s body camera as well as those of other responding officers recorded what transpired at the scene. The News-Sun has obtained the footage from those body cameras.

HPD officer Carrillo’s body cam footage

On Carrillo’s body cam footage he is seen radioing to dispatch and stating he is going to attempt to help a stopped motorist on Turner Street in front of the Valero gas station. Two unidentified women can be seen standing in front of the license plate on the Dodge pickup and Carrillo is heard telling dispatch the plate number as he’s approaching the vehicle. He then starts to ask questions about what the problem is.

“Whose truck is this?” he asks.

One of the two unidentified women is heard telling Carrillo “his.”

A woman later identified as Janessa Perez is seen standing in the open rear driver’s side door of the truck and a person later identified as Ramirez is seen sitting in the driver’s seat with what appears to be jumper cables or some other wire.

Carrillo asks both Perez and Ramirez to exit the vehicle and talk to him while they both ignore the order.

“Step out here real quick” Carrillo tells Ramirez and Perez who continue to ignore the officer. “I’m not dumb both of you guys come over here.”

Ramirez continues to concentrate on the wires in his hands.

“Bro listen to me” Carrillo is heard telling Ramirez. “Both of you guys.”

Carrillo then asks dispatch for a return for the “28” he had called in about for the ownership of the truck. A 10-28 check is a code used by police when asking dispatch to run a vehicle registration check so officers in the field can know who a vehicle is owned by.

Perez is seen moving from the rear seat area and blocking Carrillo’s view of the driver while Ramirez appears to be getting out of the vehicle with a backpack. For a split second it appears as though Ramirez is going to engage with Carrillo but instead flees in a sprint going behind Wells Fargo Bank.

Carrillo gives chase while radioing to dispatch that Ramirez has fled on foot and he is giving chase. The HPD officer is seen and heard on the video telling Ramirez to stop pulling out his department issued taser and giving a warning sound with it while telling Ramirez to stop because he doesn’t want to deploy the taser.

“Hold up bro or I’m going to taze you” Carrillo tells Ramirez while running.

Ramirez continues to flee while Carrillo continues to give chase and warn Ramirez he will use the taser.

The chase lasts only a few seconds as Carrillo reaches Ramirez grabs him and they both fall to the ground. Carrillo keeps repeating the warning that he does not want to taze Ramirez and for Ramirez to put his hands behind his back. Ramirez is seen on his stomach holding a backpack while Carrillo keeps instructing him to put his hands behind his back because Carrillo did not want to taze him. Carrillo had his taser against Ramirez’ back.

Ramirez continues struggling to break free of Carrillo.

The footage is shaky as the two struggle with each other but Ramirez eventually turns over and has some separation from Carrillo. Ramirez can be seen with a gun in his hand and fires at the HPD officer who later was found to be shot in the left leg. Carrillo then returns fire on Ramirez who was later found to have been shot in the torso.

The rest of the footage from Carrillo deals with his being taken care of by several fellow officers until paramedics arrived. Carrillo also briefs the other officers about the females who were on the scene and are no longer present.

After officers take Carrillo’s bullet proof vest off he is heard saying “I gave him a chance to give up. I gave him too many chances.”

HPD officer Carreon’s body cam footage

Carreon arrives on scene and exits his vehicle yelling for someone to stop and that he is Hobbs police. He chases who he is calling to while still shouting for the person to stop. That person wearing a gray hoodie is then seen on the video footage and is later identified as Janessa Perez.

Carreon places Perez in handcuffs and she can then be heard calling to Ramirez. Carreon tells her to “shut up” then leads her toward his patrol car.

Two shots can then be heard. Perez screams “no.” Carreon yells “Get down Get down.” A steady burst of at least nine shots are heard in succession. Carreon again tells Perez to get down and starts to run in the direction of where the gunfire emanated from while calling “shots fired” over the radio.

Carreon arrives a few seconds later beside Carrillo who is seen laying on the ground. Carreon is heard shouting “let me see you hands. Let me see your hands” to Ramirez while he has his weapon drawn.

He then asks Carrillo if he is OK and where he is shot.

“In the leg” Carrillo responds. “Be careful with this guy.”

Carreon approaches Ramirez who is on the ground several yards away then goes back to Carrillo and helps him apply a tourniquet to the left leg where Carrillo was shot. Multiple sirens are heard as other law enforcement begins to arrive on the scene.

A generated voice is then heard “Sending body run down in 10 seconds.” Both officers continue to put the tourniquet in place on Carrillo. “Sending body run down in five seconds.” Five seconds later the voice says “Body run down.” That voice is an automatic computer-generated voice that notifies dispatch whenever an officer stops moving or become horizontal. It contains health information similar to what may be on a fitness watch so the officer’s condition can be ascertained.

A few seconds later other officers can be heard in the back ground telling Ramirez “Stay on the ground” “stay down don’t move” “stay right there” “let me see your hands.”

Carrillo calls out to the other officers “Be careful ese he’s got a gun the male subject with a cammo jacket.”

Ramirez can also be heard screaming in pain.

At about the 2:55 mark on his body cam footage Carreon looks up and says “Where’s my unit?”

About a minute later Carreon tells an officer of higher rank that his patrol unit is not where he left it parked.

“My unit is gone” he said.

Another officer who is helping with Carrillo is then seen telling Carreon “Someone moved it. It’s over there.” That officer then points toward the Wells Fargo drive through.

The rest of Carreon’s body cam footage shows him helping with Carrillo until paramedics arrive then helping mark off the crime scene and retrieving his patrol vehicle.

It was later determined Perez while handcuffed had taken Carreon’s police vehicle but had crashed into the bank’s drive through.

HPD officer Carrasco body cam footage

Carrasco arrives on scene and runs to where Carrillo is on the ground and helps Carreon with a tourniquet. He then cuts Carrillo’s pants leg to identify where the bullet entered his leg.

Carrasco is the officer who told Carreon his vehicle is moved over to behind the Wells Fargo Bank.

After about two and a half minutes Carrasco is summoned to the officers who are trying to give aid to Ramirez in order to put a compression bandage over Ramirez’ gunshot wounds.

He is seen getting a medical kit from his car and running back to Ramirez and the officers doing what they can medically until paramedics arrive about two minutes later.

On the News-Sun website this is where the video is cut but officers continued to give Ramirez care keeping him awake and bandaging his gunshot wounds until Hobbs Fire Department paramedics arrived.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3Npb3V4Y2l0eWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC9waG90b3MtaW93YS1naXJscy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLXRvdXJuYW1lbnQtc2F0dXJkYXktYWN0aW9uL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25fNjIyNWNlNWUtYzYyMS01ZDUxLWIwN2MtYWY4YTA5ZmU5M2M4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS: Iowa girls basketball tournament Saturday action,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

And the Toledo Ohio-based real estate investment trust (REIT) has closed on a strategic partnership with Related Cos. and Atria Senior Living to develop two high-end projects to be located in Silicon Valley.

Welltower on Sunday announced it had agreed to purchase three senior living portfolios totaling 33 communities in Michigan Ohio and Tennessee for $548 million representing about $197000 per unit. Approximately three-fourths of the communities’ units are assisted living and memory care.

The communities carry an average age of about six years and 63% current average occupancy.

The transaction expands the REIT’s relationship with Brighton Michigan-based StoryPoint which is slated as the communities’ operating partner under a RIDEA 3.0 contract.

Welltower expects to fund the acquisition through the issuance of operating partnership units debt and cash.

The transactions represent an evolution of Welltower’s relationship with StoryPoint according to Welltower CEO and Chief Investment Officer Shankh Mitra.

“Since our highly accretive portfolio sale in 2019 we have regrown our StoryPoint relationship from two operating communities to 74 following the consummation of the announced transactions” Mitra said in a press release. “We are extremely proud that the transactions are allowing us to further serve these markets with one of our best operating partners.”

Occupancy for Welltower’s senior housing operating (SHO) was relatively flat between the beginning of the quarter through March 4 with an increase of 30 basis points over the past two weeks.

Welltower has invested about $6.8 billion since October 2020 with $1.2 billion occurring since the beginning of the first quarter of 2022.

New projects announced

Welltower also noted that a joint venture between Related Companies and Atria Senior Living has signed a strategic partnership to develop two new communities in Santa Clara and Cupertino California. The deal occurred as part of a larger strategic partnership among the three companies.

The 191-unit community in Santa Clara is planned next to a larger 9.2 million square foot urban development from Related that is set to include office and medical office buildings hotels multifamily housing and retail. Related started entitlement and pre-development work on the plan in 2015.

The 158-unit community in Cupertino is planned next to a senior center park college and a forthcoming outdoor community park. Pre-development of the community started in 2019.

The project partners expect to break ground on both developments this year with projected completion dates in 2024.

Welltower was also a partner on two Coterie projects with Atria and Related: Coterie Cathedral Hill in San Francisco which is officially open now; and Coterie Hudson Yards in New York City which is set to open later in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3dlbGx0b3dlci1hbmQtc3Rvcnlwb2ludC1zZW5pb3ItbGl2aW5nLWFubm91bmNlLWRlZXBlbmluZy1vZi1zdHJhdGVnaWMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtMzAxNDk2MzQyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Welltower and StoryPoint Senior Living Announce Deepening of Strategic Partnership,"TOLEDO Ohio March 6 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Welltower Inc. (NYSE: WELL) or the ""Company"" today announced that it plans to expand its strategic partnership with StoryPoint Senior Living (""StoryPoint"") a preeminent senior living operator based in Brighton Michigan. The Company has agreed to purchase three distinct senior living portfolios subject to customary closing conditions where StoryPoint will be the operating partner under an aligned RIDEA 3.0 contract significantly expanding its pre-existing local footprint in these markets.

The portfolios comprise 2787 units across 33 communities throughout Michigan Ohio and Tennessee. Assisted living and memory care account for approximately three-quarters of the units and independent living represent the remainder. The total investment will be approximately $548 million or $197000 per unit. The transaction is anticipated to be funded through the issuance of operating partnership units assumed debt and cash on hand.

With a median vintage of 2016 the communities were largely in lease-up at the onset of the pandemic and similar to the rest of the industry were significantly impacted by COVID-related operational challenges. With 63% current average occupancy these properties are anticipated to generate significant occupancy margin and cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond under StoryPoint's enhanced operating platform. Existing owners will be able to participate in this expected growth through the ownership of the operating partnership units.

""The past four years have been a journey with the last two being our most challenging to date. We want to have an impact on people's lives; our employees residents and families"" said Dan Hughes StoryPoint's CEO. ""We set goals around this then a pandemic struck – and in times like that you need great partners to achieve success. We navigated the convoluted and demanding times without straying from our mission; that does not happen without Shankh and his team. It began with alignment and is succeeding because of trust. Shankh's position has always been – tell me what you are trying to accomplish; together we can figure it out. Our equation for our successful partnership has been simple: alignment and trust.""

""These transactions represent a further evolution in our relationship with StoryPoint and build on our two companies' success from prior investments"" said Shankh Mitra Welltower's CEO and CIO. ""In fact since our highly accretive portfolio sale in 2019 we have regrown our StoryPoint relationship from two operating communities to 74 following the consummation of the announced transactions demonstrating the ability of great operators to gain market share in the current environment. We pivoted to offense in Fall 2020 starting with Dan and his team; we are extremely proud that the transactions are allowing us to further serve these markets with one of our best operating partners.""

The execution of these transactions which are expected to generate high-single-digit unlevered IRRs will bring the Company's total pro-rata gross investments to $6.8 billion since October 2020 and YTD transactions to $1.2 billion including Welltower's previously announced 1Q22 investments.

This drive should be of interest to anyone at 4TB but is particularly well-suited for small business NAS usage.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

The WD Red SN700 promises up to 3400 MBps of bandwidth and peaks at 550000 IOPS over a PCIe 3.0 interface. This isn't particularly exceptional in any way compared to general-use SSDs but reflects its intended role as a drive for network-attached storage devices or NAS. In addition the drive is backed by a solid warranty including up to 5100 TBW over five years (or 0.7 drive writes per day) and has an affordable 4TB option.

An SSD designed for NAS has different requirements than typical consumer drives because they are commonly used for caching. NAS data caching can encompass read or write data or both depending on the implementation. Naturally some redundancy and preferably power loss protection are ideal if the drive is used for critical write data. WD also targets the Red SN700 at small- and medium-sized businesses or SMBs expanding its usage to application hosting virtualization and databases.

WD has a whole lineup of drives under the SN branding borne from client and OEM drives focusing on consistency and comprehensible market segmentation. We’ve reviewed their Blue and Black NVMe drives for entry-level and higher-end consumer markets respectively while Red is used for NAS drives. We’ve seen this also with their SATA SSD offerings - including Green for OEM and low-cost solutions so this branding reflects WD's segmentation in the HDD market as well.

The WD Red SN700 is very similar to the older WD Black SN750 and its lineage of drives utilizing a proprietary and powerful controller known for its consistency and efficiency. WD updated the flash to 96-Layer as found on the SN850 which while not as new or robust as the 112-Layer BiCS5 on the Black SN770 is quite competitive. In addition the Black SN750 was known for its consistent post-cache performance a desirable attribute for many NAS workloads. That makes the Red SN700’s design a logical choice for use in a NAS.

The Red SN700 is rated for sequential speeds of up to 3.4/3.1 GBps read/write and up to 550000/520000 random read/write IOPS. The drive is available in 256GB 512GB 1TB 2TB and 4TB capacities ranging from $0.12-$0.26 per gigabyte. Being a NAS drive it’s oriented at larger capacities where the price per gigabyte is quite competitive especially at 4TB — a capacity that can be difficult to find with affordable pricing and TLC flash. This makes it even more of a compelling choice for consumer use if someone needs this combination of price performance and endurance.

The five-year warranty comes with 1PBW per TB of capacity up to and including the 1TB SKU with 2.5PBW and 5.1PBW total for the 2TB and 4TB SKUs respectively. This is more endurance than WD's consumer variants but otherwise the drive has normal operating conditions and features (for example a 70C maximum operating temperature). Unfortunately the SN700 lacks power loss protection which while not surprising reduces its effectiveness in scenarios requiring absolute reliability.

Software and Accessories

The Red SN700 supports the Western Digital Dashboard utility that allows for analysis and updates through a user-friendly GUI. The software gives you a full look at the drive’s status lets you test performance and has other tools and settings. For example you can do firmware updates run S.M.A.R.T. tests TRIM optimization and secure erase the drive. While these are standard features many third-party drive manufacturers lack such support.

A Closer Look

The Red SN700 comes in the M.2 2280 form factor and is necessarily double-sided at the 4TB capacity with four flash packages. The front side has a longer label with drive details such as the date of manufacture and the serial number. The labeled side has two of the four flash packages but not a second DRAM module. We can also see what appears to be a power management integrated circuit (PMIC).



PMICs and other integrated circuits are currently in short supply and are used on other items like DDR5 modules to regulate voltage.

The controller appears to be a newer revision of the model used for the Black SN750. This likely reflects the update to 96-Layer BiCS4 flash. In fact the SN730 an OEM variant of the Black with 96-Layer flash for use in WD’s AN1500 has this controller. The single DRAM module on the drive utilized for metadata is 16Gb or 2GB in capacity. This is half the normal ratio but should be more than ample even for heavier workloads.

DRAM is predominately used for metadata and mapping on consumer drives with a maximum requirement of 1GB per 1TB of flash to reflect the nature of 32-bit addressing for 4KB logical pages. It’s possible to compress this addressing for consecutive pages for example and it’s unlikely the drive will face a workload that would exhaust what’s available here.

Each of the four flash packages is 8Tb or 1TB which pushes the limits of 96-Layer TLC. Typically this flash is 512Gb or 64GB per die and a package can be up to 16DP (a sixteen-die package). That is sixteen die on top of one another for a total capacity of 1TB. The 4TB SKU of the Red SN700 stands out as it is very capacious for a TLC-based drive of this generation.

There are various reasons a NAND package is limited in die count. There’s a maximum allowed height in the M.2 specification for one but there are other challenges such as signal integrity and potential issues with bonding. These problems can be prevented to some extent with redrivers and dummy dies used to mitigate warpage etc. In any case the Red SN700 is particularly attractive at its maximum capacity as it’s far more common to find TLC drives topping out at 2TB. This will change in the future especially because 1Tb TLC dies are on the horizon.

BiCS or bit cost scaling is a type of charge trap flash (CTF) that differs from the floating gate and replacement gate or gate-last architectures of other flashes. Intel notably uses floating gate to improve endurance on their QLC while forms of replacement gate are utilized by Samsung’s V-NAND and Micron’s 128-layer and up flash. Differences aside BiCS as its namesake implies is designed to scale for capacity although not much has been seen from it with QLC.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Police are investigating a double shooting that left two men dead in West Philadelphia.

The shooting happened just after 4 p.m. on the 1200 block of N. 58th Street.

Police say a 20-year-old man was shot once in the chest.

The second victim an 18-year-old male was shot 16 times through the body.

Both victims were taken to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center where they died from their injuries.

The 20-year-old victim was reportedly wanted for a shooting at 52nd and Parrish streets last year.

Police believe the incident was drug-related and are looking for four gunmen who used a car stolen in a carjacking last December.

Officials say 35 shell casings were found at the scene.

The incident was also reportedly caught on video.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police at 215-686-TIPS."

SATURDAY FINALS LIVE RECAP

MEN’S 200 BREASTSTROKE – FINALS:

NCAA – 1:47.91 Will Licon Texas (2017)

PAC-12 – 1:48.53 2020 Reecce Whitley CAL (2020)

PAC-12 Champ – 1:48.86 Reece Whitley  CAL (2021)

 CAL (2021) NCAA ‘A’ Cut – 1:52.28

Top 3:

Arizona State freshman Leon Marchand simply cannot be stopped. After winning the 200 and 400 IM earlier in the meet and becoming the fastest freshman in NCAA history in both Marchand did the improbable winning the Pac-12 200 breast title over conference record holder Reece Whitley.

Marchand’s swim marked a massive personal best and he absolutely shattered the Arizona State program record with the performance. Prior to the 1:52.97 Marchand swam in prelims the ASU record stood at 1:53.54 a mark which was set in 2017 by Christian Lorenz.

With the swim Marchand is now the #10 performer all-time and the 3rd-fastest freshman in history behind only Max McHugh and Matthew Fallon. Notably Fallon (Penn) is also a freshman this year. McHugh is the fastest freshman in the history of the NCAA coming in at 1:49.41 and Fallon is right behind at 1:49.71.

Here is the newly-updated list of all-time top 10 performers in the SCY 200 breast:

Looking at this list it’s important to note that 4 of the top 10 swimmers of all-time will be competing in the 200 breast at NCAAs later this month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc3dpbXN3YW0uY29tLzIwMjItbWVucy1wYWMtMTItdGltZS10cmlhbHMtY2FsLXNvcGhvbW9yZS1jb2xieS1tZWZmb3JkLWNsb2Nrcy0xNDAtNTYtMjAwYmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Men's Pac-12 Time Trials: Cal Sophomore Colby Mefford Clocks 1:40.56 200BK,"2022 MEN’S PAC-12 CHAMPIONSHIPS (TIME TRIALS)

The Pac-12 has been running daily time trials sessions throughout the week as the Men’s Pac-12 Championships progress so let’s take a look at some of the most notable swims that have taken place.

On Wednesday night Cal sophomore Colby Mefford swam a time trial in the 200 back clocking a 1:40.56. The swim marks Mefford’s 2nd-fastest performance of his career and a season best. Additionally it was faster than Mefford swam in prelims of the 200 back this morning (Saturday). His personal best stands at 1:40.50 which he swam at last year’s Pac-12 Championships.

Arizona’s Ognjen Maric also time trialed the 200 back swimming a 1:40.88. The swim is a personal best for Maric and puts him in contention to earn an NCAA invite this year. In prelims of the individual 200 back Maric swam a 1:42.62 qualifying for tonight’s B final.

USC freshman Artem Selin swam a time trial in the 50 free posting a 19.26. While the swim was a personal best and faster than he swam in the individual event on Thursday the time is most likely going to be just a few hundredths of a second slower than what it will take to earn an invite to NCAAs but time will tell.

A pair of Cal freshman swam personal bests in 100 breast time trials as well. Jacob Soderlund swam a 53.14 in his time trial while Sean Swift swam a 53.86.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc3dpbXN3YW0uY29tL2NhbC1hbmQtYXN1LXN3aW0tNC1hbmQtNS00MDAtZnJlZS1yZWxheXMtYWxsLXRpbWUtY2FsLWJyZWFrcy1wYWMtMTItcmVjb3JkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cal and Arizona State both Beat Pac-12 Record with 2:45 400 Free Relays,"2022 MEN’S PAC-12 CHAMPIONSHIPS

PAC-12 Champ – 2:46.92 California (M Jensen P Sendyk D Carr R Hoffer) 2020

NCAA ‘A’ Cut – 2:50.99

Top 3:

CAL ‘A’ – 2:45.94 ASU ‘A’ – 2:45.95 STAN ‘A’ – 2:47.17

Cal and Arizona State sent the 2022 Men’s Pac-12 Swimming & Diving Championships out in style both beating the Pac-12 record and giving us an incredible race in the process. Cal’s Bjorn Seeliger who won the 100 free earlier in tonight’s session provided a heroic 40.91 anchor split getting his hand on the wall 0.01 seconds ahead of Arizona State’s Leon Marchand.

Both performances were of course program records. For Cal they down a 3-year-old record of 2:46.41 which was set at the 2019 NCAA Championships. Arizona State beat out their previous of 2:47.24. That record was set in 2020 and included Jack Dolan and Carter Swift both of whom were on tonight’s relay.

In addition to the new Pac-12 conference record for Cal the Golden Bears and Sun Devils are now the 2 fastest teams in the NCAA this season in the event. Additionally their times tonight make them the 4th and 5th fastest programs in history in the SCY 400 free relay.

Here is a split comparison between the newly-updated all-time top 5 programs in the 400 free relays:

Note: To be clear Cal and ASU’s times tonight make them the 4th and 5th fastest programs in NCAA history. Both NC State and Texas have been faster than tonight’s times on multiple occasions.

Notably one thing Cal’s relay tonight has in common with the 3 relays that have previously been faster is that all four teams had a 40-point split on their relay.

Another thing of note: Arizona State’s Grant House broke the ASU program record with his 41.77 lead-off split.",,,,,,

Zverev was disqualified from the ATP 500 tournament in Acapulco and fined $40000 over the incident in which he came perilously close to hitting the umpire Alessandro Germani. The world No 3 repeatedly struck Germani’s chair after losing a first-round doubles match but is yet to receive any further sanction after issuing an apology.

In an interview with CNN reporter Christiane Amanpour Williams insisted she would have faced harsher punishment. “There is absolutely a double standard” Williams said. “I would probably be in jail if I did that – like literally no joke.

“You see that [double standard] when you see other things happening on the tour like wait – if I had done that? Hmm’” the 23-time grand slam champion added. “But it’s OK. At the end of the day I am who I am and I love who I am.”

“I was actually on probation once” Williams added an apparent reference to her punishment for what the Grand Slam committee called “aggravated behavior” during her 2009 US Open semi-final against the eventual champion Kim Clijsters. Williams was placed on probation by the committee for two years – meaning further incidents would lead to suspension –and fined $175000 for aiming a tirade at a line judge.

Williams accused umpire Carlos Ramos of double standards after her 2018 US Open final defeat to Naomi Osaka when she was docked a game for calling Ramos a thief. “For me to say ‘thief’ and for him to take a game it made me feel like it was a sexist remark. He’s never taken a game from a man because they said ‘thief’” Williams said in her post-match press conference.

That loss was one of four in grand slam finals since 2017 with Williams still one behind Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 titles – but she still believes she can win that elusive 24th slam and is planning to take part in the French Open in May.

“I should have been at like 30 or 32 [grand slams]” Williams joked. “I should have had it [the record] really I’ve had many opportunities to have it. But I’m not giving up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMDMvMDUvcmVwYXJhdGlvbnMtYmlsbC1taWNoaWdhbi1sYXdtYWtlcnMtam9obnNvbi10aGFuZWRhci85MzkxODkyMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan lawmakers Johnson Thanedar push for reparations bill,"Democratic State Reps. Cynthia Johnson and Shri Thanedar made an impassioned plea on Saturday in their push for a bill package that would create an African American reparations fund for Michigan.

“Michigan has the opportunity to do the right thing” said Johnson standing in what was once an underground railroad hiding room inside Second Baptist Church on Monroe Street in Detroit.

Johnson said she was moved to submit the bill in January after seeing millions in incentives awarded to large companies.

“We as legislators we see monies that are going places that will never reach the people and we say nothing” she said. “That’s unconscionable.”

The legislation for the proposed Racial Equity and Reparations Fund Act has not yet received a hearing in the Republican-led state House.

The House bills 5672 5673 and 5674 call for $1.5 billion in federal dollars placed in the racial equity and reparations fund within the state’s treasury.

The funds would be issued to various state departments and agencies to provide grants loans and other economic assistance for businesses and economic developments that promote the African American community according to the bill.

Money for the fund would come from 13% in surcharges levied under the Michigan Strategic Fund Act and other sources Johnson said.

“We’re not asking for monies to go into anybody’s individual hands” she said. “We’re not even asking the taxpayers to pay this. This bill would require any business like General Motors Ford Motor Company any of the other businesses that come to the state of Michigan and ask for money. Those businesses would be required to pay a surcharge up front.”

The introduction of the bill comes as a city of Detroit task force begins the process to make short- mid- and long-term recommendations about what kind of reparations should be sought for Detroiters. In November 80% of Detroit voters approved creating a reparations commission.

Johnson said she's received some pushback about presenting the bill at the same time the issue is being discussed in Detroit and during an election year.

“We just have to work together” she said.

Thanedar said Saturday people need to admit that America and Michigan owes a debt to Black citizens.

“Reparations are about making up for the generational wealth that was stolen from the Black community” he said. “They’re about making up for depriving people of home ownership and community investment specifically on the basis of their skin color.""

""More than anything"" Thanedar continued ""they’re about providing equal opportunity. The reparations fund will allow Black Michiganders to invest in homes stock retirement savings and more to help build generational wealth. It will also help build a safety net to protect families from economic recession that always disproportionately impacts communities of color. These bills will not solve everything but they are an important piece of the puzzle.”

Senior Pastor Lawrence Rodgers of Second Baptist Church spoke briefly Saturday showing his support for the reparations effort. He said he’s received questions from those concerned about what people would do with the money.

“If you owe me money if you owe my ancestors money you owe my great grandparents money that money belongs to me” he said. “It doesn’t matter what I’m going to do with it. We’re going to invest it. We’re going to use it wisely. We’re going to build generational wealth.”

Johnson noted the racial disparity when it comes to business ownership in Detroit. While the city has a 78% Black population 10% of businesses with employees are Black-owned according to data from 2020 Census data and Detroit Future City’s Center for Equity Engagement and Research.

“We are actually descendants of slaves” she said. “That’s nothing to just bypass. There’s a lot of things that happened because of that. We have the lack of jobs we have a lack of homes. ... It was our government that did that. It’s our government who is going to have to change this.”

March 05 2022 Jon Sofen Senior Editor U.S.

Dan Smith gave what he dubs a ""hot take"" on Twitter when he proclaimed the $10000 buy-in Wynn Millions Main Event which is currently underway in Las Vegas superior to the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event. He briefly explained his reasoning and it isn't as crazy of an opinion as it might seem on the surface.

The 2nd Annual Wynn Millions event — PokerNews is live reporting the entire tournament — features a $10 million guaranteed prize pool. In some years the WSOP Main Event pays $10 million or more .... to the winner. But there's more to judging the quality of a poker event than just the total prize pool as Smith explained in a tweet.

Potentially hot take: Wynn Millions is >>> WSOP Main event — Dan Smith (@DanSmithHolla)

Wynn Poker

Better Venue?

Smith argues that the Wynn Millions being held in a ""nice venue"" is a benefit to the players. The WSOP has been held at the Rio All-Suites Hotel & Casino since 2005 and many poker players had an unfavorable opinion of the property.

This coming summer the series is moving to Bally's (soon to be the Horseshoe) and Paris on the Las Vegas Strip. So we'll wait and see if the poker community prefers that venue to the Rio.

However the Wynn also on the Strip is one of the most luxurious hotel casinos in the world and poker players consistently rave about the staff and how well they operate tournaments.

Merit to His Take

There are a number of similarities between the Wynn Millions Main Event and the WSOP Main Event starting with the comparable $10000 buy-in. Many of the same players that compete in poker's world championship event also have entered the first two major Wynn events with pros such as Daniel Negreanu and Dan Smith battling it out for big bucks against recreational players chasing life-changing money.

Andrew Moreno/2021 Wynn Millions

Last summer Andrew Moreno a San Diego poker pro attempting to become a tournament star took down the first ever Wynn Millions $10 million guaranteed event for $1460106 and it changed his life much like has happened for those who have won the WSOP Main Event over the years.

There are a few differences between the two huge Las Vegas poker tournaments most notably the WSOP Main Event is a freezeout whereas the Wynn $10k allows for one re-entry per day one reason why a heavily bankrolled pro such as Smith is such a fan.

Additionally the world championship event has been around since 1970 compared to 2021 and the WSOP's top annual event attracts over 6000 players each year these days. Registration remains open in the 2022 Wynn Millions but the tournament last summer had 1328 entrants.

Whichever side you're on both events are historic. One is already a permanent poker tournament staple and the other just might become one in time.

March 05 2022 Chad Holloway PR & Media Manager

The day before attempting to defend his title in the 2022 Wynn Millions Andrew Moreno made an interesting post on social media talking about why he didn’t chip a big tournament he had won just over a week earlier.

The tournament was the Venetian Event #27: $2500 Ultimate Stack which attracted 542 runners and offered up a $1233050 prize pool. Moreno who won the 2021 Wynn Millions for $1460106 went on to win the tournament for $242293.

Moreno explained the situation in his post: “The word ‘chop’ got thrown around a few times. First when we were 4-handed I politely declined. Then again when we were 3-handed. Once again I respectfully declined. When I got heads up the gentlemen proposed a chop and even offered to give me slightly more money despite having me out chipped 12 million to my 8 million. He was puzzled as to why I would decline a deal. I did so for two reasons.”

Moreno then explained the first reason was that he thought he had an edge while the second was because he wanted to “seize the opportunity for invaluable final table experience.” Moreno went on to elaborate on “playing for it all” in the post but PokerNews also took the opportunity to ask him about it during Day 1b of the 2022 Wynn Millions.

“A lot of times in lower stakes buy-ins dailies and those sorts of things people want to chop. A lot of those people tend to take shots in bigger tournaments and I just recognized a lot of the people that get to the end I’ve played with a few of them in these bigger events they just lack the experience because they’re always chopping.""

He continued: ""It can really cost you because the final three or four places that’s where all the money is so if you have no experience between you always chop these dailies I think it can come back to hurt you a lot more later. I don’t think people really think about that when they chop because they’re so focused on securing some cash.”

Wynn Millions Title Defense

Moreno in 2022 Wynn Millions action.

Ironically Moreno did do a three-handed deal at last year’s Wynn Millions final table but to be fair he was the short stack at the time and there were literally millions on the line. As for what it was like to be back where he had his seven-figure life-changing victory just months before welcoming his first child into the world with wife Kristy Moreno (formerly PokerNews hostess Kristy Arnett)?

“It’s really surreal. It feels like a dream” he admitted. “I started my poker career here at the Wynn. They used to have the $3 chips for the $1-$3 no-limit game like 15 or 20 years ago. It’s just kind of nice to have it come full circle all these years later.”

As for his defense strategy Moreno added: “I just take everything hand-by-hand. Anytime my hand goes too far in the future it doesn’t serve me so I just bring it right back to what’s happening right in front of me. As the tournament progresses there’s more noise with those sorts of things like pay jumps or bubbles but I really try to focus on every single hand.”

Cumberbatch was referencing criticism of the film from Sam Elliott who recently referred to the film as a “piece of shit”.

Speaking as part of BAFTA’s Film Sessions on Friday (March 4) Cumberbatch discussed why it’s necessary to portray characters like Phil Burbank who he plays in the movie in order to “look under the hood” of these type of characters and “see what their struggle is and why that’s there in the first place”.

Going on to reference Elliott’s criticism directly he added (via Digital Spy): “I’m trying very hard not to say anything about a very odd reaction that happened the other day on a radio podcast over here.

He added that he didn’t want to “stir over the ashes” of the comment as “I haven’t heard it so it’s unfair for me to comment in detail on it” but that “someone really took offence to the West being portrayed in this way.”

Cumberbatch then went back to his character in the film: “These people still exist in our world. Whether it’s on our doorstep or whether it’s down the road or whether it’s someone we meet in a bar or pub or on the sports field there is aggression and anger and frustration and an inability to control or know who you are in that moment that causes damage to that person and as we know damage to those around them.

Recommended

“There’s no harm in looking at a character to get to the root causes of that. This is a very specific case of repression but also due to an intolerance for that true identity that Phil is that he can’t fully be.”

He concluded: “The more we look under the hood of toxic masculinity and try to discover the root causes of it the bigger chances we have of dealing with it when it arises with our children.”

In his comments of the film Elliott criticised director Jane Campion’s interpretation of the American west.

Describing her as “a brilliant director” before making his point Elliott said: “What the fuck does this women from down there [New Zealand] know about the American west? Why the fuck did she shoot this movie in New Zealand and call it Montana? And say this is the way it was? That fucking rubbed me the wrong way.”

The Power Of The Dog follows charismatic rancher Phil Burbank (Cumberbatch) who torments his younger brother George (Jesse Plemons) when George brings home his new wife Rose Gordon (Kirsten Dunst).

The film has been nominated for 12 Oscars including Best Picture Best Director and Best Actor for Cumberbatch. The 94th Academy Awards will take place on Sunday March 27."
XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9yaWxleS10dWZ0ZXMtZmlyc3QtbmhsLWdvYWwtY29tZXMtYXQtZmFtaWxpYXIteGNlbC1lbmVyZ3ktY2VudGVyLzYwMDE1MzYwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Riley Tufte's first NHL goal comes at familiar Xcel Energy Center,"Riley Tufte has a knack for making memories at Xcel Energy Center.

After skating on the ice in the state tournament with Blaine and later claiming a national championship with Minnesota Duluth in St. Paul the 23-year-old added a new highlight on Sunday with the visiting Stars: his first NHL goal.

""This building's been good to me"" Tufte said.

The forward scored the second of three second-period goals by Dallas in an eventual 6-3 win over the Wild capitalizing during his third stint with the team this season after getting called up from the minors.

After Wild goalie Kaapo Kahkonen made an initial save on a shot from John Klingberg Tufte pounced on the rebound and slid it around Kahkonen's pad before tumbling to the ice and pumping his arms as he slid on his back.

""I started falling down when I scored so I wasn't sure if it went in right away"" said Tufte who was playing in his ninth NHL game. ""But I saw it going back in net and it was an awesome feeling.

""Coming home and being able to play here and getting the first one here tops it off.""

Tufte estimated more than 50 family members and friends were at the game and another familiar face was on the Wild bench: fellow Blaine alum Nick Bjugstad whom Tufte grew up with; not only do the two both wear No. 27 but they also were crowned Minnesota's Mr. Hockey before being drafted to the NHL in the first round.

""I think he's been there for my whole life"" said Tufte who was selected by the Stars 25th overall in 2016. ""He's stuck with me and I train with him every summer. It's cool that he got to see me first NHL goal. It's even better for me that it was against him.""

Memorable message

Tufte said he received a lot of messages after his goal including one from former NHLer Toby Petersen who's from Bloomington.

Like Tufte Petersen has diabetes.

""That's pretty special"" Tufte said. ""He's one of the first guys to reach out to me when I first got diabetes so it just tops it off. He's played for the Dallas Stars so I think that's awesome.""

In the crease

Wild winger Marcus Foligno was whistled for goaltender interference Friday at Buffalo ""for taking a bad route"" coach Dean Evason said and that's also what Evason thought Tyler Seguin did on Dallas' first goal when Kahkonen was bumped out of position.

""That was our interpretation: [Seguin's] skate made the initial contact and his route was to go right through the blue paint"" Evason said.

The Wild challenged for goaltender interference but the team didn't reverse the goal since the NHL ruled it was Wild center Frederick Gaudreau who prevented Kahkonen from standing his ground. Gaudreau collided with Kahkonen after getting tied up with Seguin in the crease.

""We gotta make [a decision] quick and we chose that"" Evason said. ""It didn't work out.""

Crowded Central

The Wild had an 11-point cushion over the Stars at the All-Star break. That buffer is gone.

Dallas is now even with the Wild in the Central Division at 67 points with the Wild currently holding the tiebreaker for third because it's played one fewer game. One point back of them are the Predators and the Blues are only four points ahead — a tight race to fill out the division behind the first-place Avalanche.

""The teams behind us or around us are playing really well"" center Nico Sturm said. ""It's almost like I don't want to say panic or scared to lose but everybody realizes what's going on and we're grasping at something trying to stop it and it's not working out right now. I don't really have the answers right now. I just know that it's not for a lack of effort.""

Injury update

Matt Dumba was back in action after missing 10 games with a lower-body injury.

""It's always tough but it's part of it as well"" the defenseman said about being sidelined. ""I feel good now and I want to help the team in whatever way I can.""

Mats Zuccarello also suited up; the winger missed the previous game with an upper-body injury.

Jordan Greenway however remains out and the winger is now on injured reserve. He has sat out the past six games because of an upper-body injury.

The Wild was also evaluating Gaudreau after the game.

""We don't know if he blocked a shot"" Evason said. ""But it looked like he was in a lot of pain. It was lower-body.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbG9sYW5kLmNvbS90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy94Y2VsLWVuZXJneS1wcmVwYXJpbmctZm9yLXNldmVyZS13ZWF0aGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel Energy preparing for severe weather,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.keloland.com/top-stories/xcel-energy-preparing-for-severe-weather/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbG9sYW5kLmNvbS90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy94Y2VsLWVuZXJneS1wcmVwYXJpbmctZm9yLXNldmVyZS13ZWF0aGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbWlkamlwaW9uZWVyLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcHJlcC93cmVzdGxpbmctYWxsLTMtYmVtaWRqaS1naXJscy1waWNrLXVwLXdpbnMtYXQtaW5hdWd1cmFsLXN0YXRlLXRvdXJuYW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WRESTLING: All 3 Bemidji girls pick up wins at inaugural state tournament,"ST. PAUL -- With one final dose of history the Bemidji High School girls wrestling team capped its inaugural season at Saturday’s girls individual state tournament at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul.

All three BHS state qualifiers -- Kylie Donat Jadyn Kelly and Elizabeth Oster -- walked away with victories adding a few more “firsts” to a winter full of them.

Donat had the highest finish for the Lumberjacks placing second in the state at 132 pounds. Donat won her first matchup with a 6-2 decision over Cashawn Brooks of South St. Paul marking the Bemidji girls program’s first state win. In the finals Donat lost by fall in 1:42 to Hastings’ Skylar Little Soldier.

At 138 pounds Kelly lost by fall (0:51) in the first round. But she pinned Wadena-Deer Creek’s Madelyn Gallant within 1:18 in the third-place match to walk out with bronze.

And at 145 Oster also claimed bronze. She lost a high-scoring 13-11 decision to eventual champion Grace Alagbo of Apple Valley in the first round but Oster then pinned Northfield’s Lainey Houts in 2:27 to claim third.

PAUL — After a dominant first day of the 2022 State Individual Wrestling Tournament on Friday at Xcel Energy Center Sibley East’s Drayden Morton has his eyes set on claiming his fourth state wrestling championship.

Morton coasted during his first-round match with Saint Clair/Mankato Loyola’s Lucas Vaughan on Friday. After quickly securing a takedown Morton got the pin in 44 seconds to move on to a quarterfinals match with Reubens Swanson of West Central Area-Ashby-Brandon-Evansville.

In that match Morton jumped out to a 6-2 lead in the first period before finishing things off with a cradle and pin in 1:30.

“In both matches I just focused on getting to my ties and snapping and faking and then tried getting to that cradle and I ended up getting it both times” Morton said.

Morton took first in 2019 at 106 pounds first in 2020 at 120 pounds and first in 2021 at 132 pounds. He’ll be looking to bring home his fourth state title this time at 145 on Saturday.

“I’ll just keep wrestling the same way I have all year” Morton said about Saturday. “Just keep trying to attack my ties and score as many points as I can.”

Morton will next take on Dover-Eyota’s Brodie Kellen in a semifinals match Saturday.

Morton won’t be the only Wolverine taking the mat Saturday as his heavyweight sophomore teammate Omar Martinez (285) also went 2-0 on Friday to advance to the championship semifinals on Saturday.

Martinez’s first-round match against Ottertail Central’s Kale Rich ended in success as Martinez was able to work for a pin in the second period in 3:07. In a quarterfinals matchup with WEM/JWP freshman Keegan Kuball both wrestlers were tied at 1-1 heading into the third period before Martinez was able to take Kuball’s back for a 3-1 lead with 1:01 left in the match.

Kuball managed an escape after that but Martinez put the match away with another takedown for a 5-2 decision.

Kuball said that his underhooks and conditioning played a big role in his quarterfinals win.

“Earlier in the match I was getting my underhooks and he didn’t really like that so much” Martinez said. “He was getting desperate because he didn’t want to get in that position.”

Martinez said that making it to Saturday meant a lot to him as he’s only been wrestling since the seventh grade.

“It really means a lot because I’ve only been wrestling for four years so I’m really proud of myself in how far I’ve came” Martinez said. “Walking into that room as a little seventh-grader until now it means a lot. Sharing the mat with Drayden and going to [Saturday] with him means a lot to me because I’ve looked up to him as a wrestler the past four years now.”

Martinez will now wrestle Jeremy Mugg of Royalton-Upsala in a semifinals match on Saturday.

Sophomore Benito Diaz (113) also competed for the Wolverines on Friday.

Diaz had a tough time handling Waterville-Elysian-Morristown/Janesville-Waldorf-Pemberton’s Carson Petry in a first-round match. Petry led 8-0 after on period and eventually ended up picking up a 16-0 tech fall in 4:20.

Petry then fell in his next match to Jackson County Central’s unbeaten Nolan Ambrose which meant that Petry was allowed a wrestleback match in place of Diaz. Diaz finished his freshman season with a 38-7 record.

CLASS A AREA ROUNDUP

Junior 160-pound wrestler Ashtin Johnson made his first state wrestling appearance for the Springfield Tigers wrestling team on Friday.

Johnson first took on Ottertail Central senior Jaxon Rich in a first-round match. While Johnson looked good in the first period Rich ended up cradling him for a pin in the second period in 3:10.

“First period went pretty good for me definitely won that period got a takedown rode him out got some back points with a cradle” Johnson said. “Chose down [second period] kind of a weaker spot this whole season for me when I go down. Then kept fighting close to getting out every time but I just couldn’t get out [he] locked up the cradle and there it was.”

Johnson was unfortunately denied a wrestleback and finished his season with a 36-9 record after Rich dropped his quarterfinals match.

Despite the state experience ending sooner than he hoped for Johnson said he hopes his run to state can inspire other kids to become Springfield wrestlers.

“It’s kind of cool to be able to represent Springfield especially at a big stage” Johnson said. “As a team as we’re regrowing it just maybe will give some kids some motivation to come out and that kind of stuff.”

Nicollet junior Justin Slater competing at 220 pounds for the Lake Crystal-Wellcome Memorial Area wrestling team also made his state wrestling debut on Friday taking on Cameron Wieneke of Adrian Area in a first-round match.

Wieneke ended up pinning Slater in the second period in 2:25. Wieneke lost in the quarterfinals round which meant that he earned a wrestleback match in place of Slater who ended his junior year with a 31-15 record.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXB1YmxpY2FuZWFnbGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYWxvdy1jb21lcy1jbG9zZS10by1kcmVhbS1zY2VuYXJpby1jaGVyaXNoZXMtZmFtaWx5LWNvbm5lY3Rpb24vYXJ0aWNsZV82ZjhkMGZmMi05ZGI2LTExZWMtODNlMS0zM2VlYjMwZTM5MTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Balow comes close to dream scenario: Cherishes family connection,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Many large food manufacturers including PepsiCo and Coca-Cola and fast-food chains like McDonald’s and Yum Brands are facing growing pressure on social media platforms and from large investors to halt operations in Russia.

Companies “need to consider whether doing business in Russia is worth the risk during this extraordinarily volatile time” the chief of one big investor New York state’s pension fund said on Thursday.

McDonald’s Coca-Cola PepsiCo and Mondelez International the maker of Oreos and Ritz Crackers did not respond to messages seeking comment about their operations in Russia. Starbucks and Yum Brands whose chains include KFC and Pizza Hut have said in response to the invasion that they were supporting humanitarian relief efforts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29kaG9yc2UuY29tL2hvcnNlLXJhY2luZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNTcxOTAvc2ltcGxpZmljYXRpb24tc3RyZWFrcy10by1mb3VudGFpbi1vZi15b3V0aC1zY29yZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simplification Streaks to Fountain of Youth Score,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vemFib3JvbmEuY29tL2VuL2NvbGFzLWJsYWNrLWxpc3Qtd2hhdC1nbG9iYWwtYnJhbmRzLWNvbnNjaW91c2x5LWtlcHQtdGhlaXItdGllcy10by1ydXNzaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global brands that consciously stay in Russia,"Russia launched a military attack against Ukraine on February 24 2022.

Despite Russian officials denying civilian bombing the occupiers have continued to commit cruel crimes against humanity since the start of hostilities.

Global brands begun to leave the Russian market en masse but not all of them.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on the morning of February 24 2022. The aggressor did not directly declare the war but instead cowardly called it a military operation. The Russian occupiers insidiously did not give the time to Ukrainian authorities to evacuate civilians. Instead the enemy brazenly continues to claim that it does not commit crimes against civilians but rather protects them from nationalists. But the world is not to be fooled. All civilized politicians and celebrities are actively expressing their support for Ukraine. World brands began refusing to do business with Russia. However not all of them.

Zaborona has blacklisted companies that that did not leave the Russian market immediately but waited a long time for public reaction. Moreover most of them claimed that they planned to leave Russia but did not specify terms conditions plans etc. Conventionally we called it the Coca-Cola’s Black List because it was the first global brand to express its official position.

The list is constantly updated.

The list of companies that continue to operate in Russia

It is worth noting that there are many reasons why so many international companies have decided to commit a mass exodus from Russia:

sanctions provided for blocking the operational work of banks and accordingly cards;

threat of complete disconnection from SWIFT;

troubles with logistics due to Europe’s closure of airspace for Russian aircraft;

herd instinct;

Ukrainian origin;

a sense of justice;

hate for war and terrorism;

love and support for Ukraine.

The official operating activity of an international company in any country means the payment of all relevant taxes. And this in turn means that the money of companies paid in taxes is distributed by governments for various state sectors including weapons (in the case of Russia — for sure). Therefore those global brands that decided to continue their operations in a country that has invaded another independent state have to realize that people’s blood is on their hands as well.

If you are deliberately financing terrorism you have to bear all the responsibility. So let’s move on to the list.

Coca-Cola — the first company that officially declare that they are not going to stop doing business in Russia.

“All of Coca-Cola’s operational production and logistics facilities in Russia continue to operate. We are fully responsible to our partners society and thousands of our employees in Russia. Our unconditional priority is the safety of our employees” claimed in the company’s press-release to Russians.

On March 8 the 13th day of the war after considering all the reputational risks and consequences that mass boycotts of Coca-Cola products could lead to the company decided to suspend its business in Russia.

“The Coca-Cola Company announced today that it is suspending its business in Russia. Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve” said in the statement.

However it is not specified what measures will be taken to suspend the business. The Coca-Cola Company has as many as 10 facilities for the production of soft drinks in Russia.

On March 30 it became known that the German Ritter Sport will not leave the Russian market: it accounts for 7% of the company’s turnover.

Nestlé — a large Swiss company which has three factories in Ukraine/ After the beginning of Russian invasion they announced that temporarily shutting down Ukrainian facilities due to the danger to workers. Instead they do not want to sever ties with the enemy.

“Our factories and offices in Russia continue to operate. Our goal is to provide consumers with high quality food and beverages in all regions where we are present. We continue to provide a wide range of food products on the market” said the company representatives to Russian media.

On March 9 the company’s spokesperson told Reuters that Nestle was suspending all capital investments in Russia. On March 11 one of the largest food-producing companies announced restrictions on trade with the aggressor but not completely.

It was reported that Nestle has stopped exporting and importing non-essential food items like coffee (eg Nespresso) and water (eg S. Pellegrino). That is all other Nestle products (baby food confectionery breakfast cereals etc.) will continue to appear on the shelves of Russian stores.

On March 17 the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmygal posted on Twitter that he had contacted the CEO of Nestlé about the side effect of its work in Russia. We have to point out that there is no official confirmation or comment from the company in this regard.

On March 23 Nestlé issued a new statement on its work in Russia. The company will remove several more of its brands from the Russian market including KitKat and Nesquik and will provide to Russians only essential food such as infant food and medical/hospital nutrition.

“While we do not expect to make a profit in the country or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future in Russia any profit will be donated to humanitarian relief organizations” said in a press release.

Danone — despite the fact that this international company has publicly condemned the Russian invasion and declared its readiness to provide any assistance to Ukrainians one of the world’s leading food giants is deliberately refusing to leave the aggressor’s market.

“We do not plan to suspend our activities in Russia and leave the market. For now the company’s key systems infrastructure and logistics in Russia operate in a regular mode” Russian propagandists reported.

On March 6 the company announced that it would stop making new investments in Russia but stays in the Russian market.

METRO is one of the world’s largest cash and carry companies which has a huge number of stores in Ukraine. Like other multinational giants from our blacklist this one also refused to sever trade ties with Russia.

“METRO continues to operate in Russia. We do not plan to close our shopping centers. All METRO stores operate in regular mode. We have provided the necessary stock of goods and are setting up supply chains” claimed in the company statement on March 3.

Auchan — another global chain of hypermarkets and supermarkets that does not want to leave Russia. Moreover the Russian department of Auchan did not make any statements or comments on the withdrawal.

In early March Auchan imposed restrictions for Russians on the purchase of socially important products. So the conditional Russian Ivan is unable to buy more than 10 kg of sugar 10 bottles of sunflower oil five packs of flour of 2 kg three packs of salt 10 packs of pasta rice buckwheat and other cereals.

Leroy Merlin is a French network of supermarkets selling building materials and furniture that has at least 107 stores in Russia.

The company has no plans to leave the Russian market and even wants to take advantage of the fact that many competitors have stopped their cooperation with the aggressor. In a letter to partners on March 11 the management of the Russian department of Leroy Merlin stated that the company is ready for new proposals to increase supplies and expand the product range

Mars and Mondelez International — both American food companies expressed virtually the same position two weeks after Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine.

The management of Mondelez International one of the largest food corporations in the world primarily known for the Oreo and Milka brands has decided to reduce its activities in Russia but not to stop production at Russian facilities. The reduction of activity means the cessation of all investments in Russia as well as the curtailment of all advertising activities.

Mars which owns brands such as Snickers Twix M&M’s Milky Way Whiskas has announced similar approach:

cessation of all activities in social networks;

termination of all advertising activities;

curtailment of all investments in the Russian market.

That is the American confectionery giants are not currently considering the option of a full exodus from Russia.

Pirelli — unlike its concurrents an Italian tire manufacturer does not want to leave Russia.

“Pirelli is constantly monitoring the development and consequences of the situation [in Ukraine] with the help of a specially created crisis committee. At the moment we have no plans to stop production at any of our facilities [in Russia]” ANSA reported.

Probably in the near future they will have to make a choice between Russia and the support of motorsport fans. The fact is that Pirelli is one of the members of the F1 sponsorship team. Formula 1 has already condemned the war and terminated the contract with the Russian GP which was held in Sochi. What is more the Haas F1 team the main sponsor of which was the Russian company Uralkali refused to cooperate with them and said goodbye to the Russian pilot Nikita Mazepin.

On March 17 2022 the company published a press release entitled ‘The Board of Directors approves the results to 31 December 2021’ the last two lines indicate the issues of work in the aggressor country.

“Investments halted in Russia excluding those linked to security. The activities of the factories will be progressively limited to finance salaries and services for employees” the document claims.

Huawei the Chinese telecommunications giant not only stays in the Russian market but is also suspected of helping the Putin regime to fight against cyberattacks on government and propaganda resources.

According to Daily Mail this was even reported by the Chinese media but later all such messages were deleted. It was noted that Huawei intends to use its research centers in Russia (there are five of them) to train 50000 technical experts to protect Russian Internet network in the face of cyber threats.

Obviously Huawei denies all the accusations but few believe the claims of Chinese monopolists. In particular on March 7 one of the best footballers of the XXI century the forward of Bayern Munich Robert Lewandowski terminated a multimillion-dollar sponsorship contract with Huawei amid reports of the Chinese giant’s cooperation with Russia.

Tetra Pak — a Swedish-Swiss company the largest manufacturer of food packaging in Russia. A striking example of a company that tries to sit on two chairs at once.

Initially the management of Tetra Pak was keeping silent about the war and only on March 12 released a statement condemning Russia’s actions. It was said that company are going to refuse to invest in Russian economy and restrict on its activity in the aggressor state to essential food products such as milk and children’s food.

However on March 28 the Russian media reported that Tetra Pak was temporarily suspending the production of packaging for wine and beverages with a capacity of two liters (except juices). Moreover the reason is not that Russian missiles are destroying Ukrainian cities and killing peaceful Ukrainians but simply a lack of raw materials for packaging.

It’s unclear how wine can be considered as a socially important product for Russian children but Kremlin propagandists noted that Tetra Pak has enough raw materials for only one month and has not yet agreed on new supplies from China.

It is worth mentioning the work of catering services in Russia. As of March 7 the following companies continued to operate with the aggressor:

Yum! Brands (the owner of KFC  Pizza Hut  Taco Bell )*;

(the owner of   )*; McDonald’s **;

**; Starbucks ***;

***; Burger King ****;

****; Papa John’s.

*Yum! Brands. On March 8 the company announced the suspension of investments and the development of restaurants in Russia. In fact this means that Russian franchisees have been left without external funding but will continue to operate at their own expense. Yum! Brands has promised to redirect all the profit taken from Russian outlets to humanitarian efforts.

**McDonald’s. On the same day as a direct competitor in the face of KFC the company officially announced the temporary closure of all 850 restaurants in Russia. “McDonald’s has decided to temporarily close all our restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market. We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners” said in the statement.

However the company will continue to pay full salaries to its employees in Russia. And there are about 62000 of them!

***Starbucks. Immediately after McDonald’s the official position of one of the world’s largest coffee chains has appeared. After 13 days of war Starbucks decided not to sponsor the murderers and announced the suspension of business in Russia.

“We condemn the unprovoked unjust and horrific attacks on Ukraine by Russia and our hearts go out to all those affected… We continue to watch the tragic events unfold and today we have decided to suspend all business activity in Russia including shipment of all Starbucks products” said in the letter sent by CEO Kevin Johnson.

****Burger King — Restaurant Brands International which owns the Burger King chain finally made a statement on Ukraine on March 10. It turns out that in Russia the company does not own any Burger King restaurants in Russia because the business is fully franchised and managed by a local master franchisee.

In the end the company made a choice and announced a number of steps to sever operational ties to Russia namely:

refusal of new investments in Russia and expansion of the network;

suspension of all the corporate support for the Russian franchisees including at the level of operations marketing and supply chain;

any profits from franchised operations will be redirected to humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees.

In addition there were large corporations that had been keeping silent for a long time haven’t made any statements about leaving the Russian market and had continued to work with the aggressor as if nothing was happening. These included PepsiCO P&G and Unilever. However after some time weighing all the reputational risks they declared their positions:

PepsiCO — partial suspension of sales of goods in Russia (this applies to soft drinks under the brands Pepsi Sprite Mirinda; sales of goods in the categories of baby food and dairy products will continue);

— partial suspension of sales of goods in Russia (this applies to soft drinks under the brands Pepsi Sprite Mirinda; sales of goods in the categories of baby food and dairy products will continue); P&G — suspension of new investments in Russia cessation of advertising activity and reduction of the range of goods in stores (only health hygiene and personal care products will be left on the shelves);

— suspension of new investments in Russia cessation of advertising activity and reduction of the range of goods in stores (only health hygiene and personal care products will be left on the shelves); Unilever — suspension of exports of its products to Russia cessation of advertising activity refusal of new investments and profits from the Russian Federation (basic foodstuffs and hygiene products manufactured at the company’s Russian enterprises will remain on the market).

Raiffeisen Bank — In early March Reuters reported that one of the largest banks in Central and Eastern Europe Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) was looking into leaving Russia. Subsequently the RBI denied this information and its Russian department still continues to cooperate with the aggressor.

On March 9 they went even further. The Raiffeisen’s press-center reported that the bank has made Visa and Mastercard cards termless for Russian individuals and small businesses.

“Raiffeisen Bank’s Visa and Mastercard cards have become termless. Now individuals entrepreneurs and owners of small and micro businesses can use them in Russia without limitation. It is not necessary to reissue the cards — the validity of current cards has been extended automatically” the bank reports.

Deutsche Bank — Germany’s largest bank also does not want to leave Russia completely.

«We are often asked why we are not withdrawing completely from Russia. The answer is that this would go against our values. We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight. And as far as we can we will continue to also support them too at this difficult time» — Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing wrote on March 10.

However the German bank has declared its readiness to cease some types of businesses in Russia (not specified) and added that over the past few years DB has significantly reduced its presence in the Russian market. In addition the bank’s management assured that it would closely monitor the sanctions policy of the EU and if necessary they would adapt to the new approach to cooperation [or exodus from Russia].

Finally on March 11 the management of Deutsche Bank dared to announce that the largest German financial institution is eager to leave Russia. “We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations. There won’t be any new business in Russia” the bank said in a statement.

Crédit Agricole — French banking group has been keeping silent about its work in Russia for a long time. And only on March 22 almost a month after the beginning of invasion the company decided to sever all ties with the aggressor.

It is noted that one of the largest French banks has already suspended new financing of Russian companies and in a few weeks it will completely suspend all its activities in Russia.

“The group has contacted its international corporate clients to establish the terms of the cessation of services provided locally by Crédit Agricole CIB which will take effect in the coming weeks” noticed in the bank statement.

Hyatt and Hilton — the largest chains of luxury hotels were silent for two weeks waiting for what the public would say about them Finally they made statements about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On March 9 both companies announced that they will stop advertising campaigns in Russian market refuse to open new hotels in Russia but are not going to close existing ones.

They also expressed the full support and the readiness to promote the humanitarian efforts to Ukrainian refugees. “The Hilton network is ready to donate up to 1 million hotel room nights in hotels across Europe to support Ukrainian refugees fleeing horrific violence in their country” said in the statement.

A similar offer was made by Hyatt. Both companies also promised to direct all profits from activities in Russia to humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Nonetheless there are some hotel networks that continue to operate in Russia and do not comment on the situation in Ukraine:

Accor ;

; Intercontinental Hotels ;

; Marriott.

Renault — a French automotive company that stopped production at its facilities in Russia on February 28. As it turned out the reason was not the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the genocide of the Ukrainian people organized by Putin but the problems with logistics and lack of spare parts.

Renault was not going to completely refuse to sponsor Putin’s bloody regime and on March 21 even restore production at its Moscow plant.

However just two days later after heavy criticism of the company on the Internet Renault again announced the closure of its plant in Moscow.

“The Board of Directors of Renault Group met today and approved the following items: Renault Group activities in its manufacturing plant in Moscow are suspended as of today. Regarding its stake in AVTOVAZ Renault Group is assessing the available options taking into account the current environment while acting responsibly towards its 45000 employees in Russia” the company said in an official statement.

New initiative brings entrepreneurs and investors together in a coordinated effort to end degenerative brain conditions and related diseases that affect more than 50 million people globally. StartUp Health · Follow Published in StartUp Health · 5 min read · Mar 6 2022 -- Listen Share

The past five years have seen a revolution in our thinking about Alzheimer’s and related disorders of the brain. For decades we have been told Alzheimer’s is a single disorder of old age with a hallmark symptom of memory loss. Recent research has proven that in fact Alzheimer’s is a disease of the brain that takes root in middle life and when left unchecked develops over decades into a progressive dementia.

“Alzheimer’s is a life course disease meaning that cognitive health starts in the womb and is influenced by what we do throughout our lives.”

–Richard Isaacson MD Founder and Director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic Cornell Medical Center

In response to the Alzheimer’s epidemic that affects more than 50 million people globally and building on healthcare priorities set out by President Biden in his 2022 State of the Union Address StartUp Health today announces the launch of the Alzheimer’s Moonshot. This moonshot represents a new effort to coordinate resources and fund innovations aimed at eradicating the disease.

The StartUp Health Alzheimer’s Moonshot builds on our thesis that “investing in and supporting a diversified global portfolio of health moonshot companies is the key to improving the health and wellbeing of humanity.” Since 2011 StartUp Health has made more than 400 health moonshot investments in companies from 27 countries across an integrated family of now 14 Health Moonshots. This new dedicated Alzheimer’s Moonshot doubles down on the work that has been going on for years within the Brain Health Moonshot — with StartUp Health companies such as Cala Health LifeBio Virtuleap and SyncThink — and complements efforts taking place across the broader portfolio.

“Our life’s work is to solve the world’s most significant health challenges we call health moonshots. We are launching a dedicated mission focused specifically on eradicating Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders because we believe more progress needs to be made more quickly. Too many families around the world are impacted by this devastating disease” says Steven Krein CEO and Co-founder of StartUp Health.

This dedicated mission is necessary because Alzheimer’s is more than a physical disease. People often describe Alzheimer’s as “brutal” because in addition to the physical burden of cognitive decline and memory loss the disease creates a ripple effect of psychological pain and anxiety for family and friends. The disease also has a way of amplifying other existing health challenges. Diabetes COPD stroke and depression are just four of many conditions that have been shown to have worse outcomes when the patient has cognitive decline. When we lose our ability to think reason and remember we lose our ability to make decisions about our health manage our medications and engage in activities that promote health from social interactions to physical exercise. Tackling Alzheimer’s helps us get at the root cause of a range of conditions and ailments.

“In my many years of research around Alzheimer’s and related dementias and my time building companies focused on brain health I’ve never experienced this kind of momentum around collaborative innovation” says Mylea Charvat PhD who will chair the Alzheimer’s Moonshot initiative for StartUp Health. “This isn’t a problem for one university or company or even country to solve. It’s a global challenge and we need to organize our knowledge and finances to tackle it as one army of innovators.”

Driving the Alzheimer’s Moonshot is StartUp Health’s global platform and seasoned investment team which has managed three previous funds and built the largest digital health portfolio in the world. Notable LPs include individuals like Mark Cuban Steve Case Brad Feld and Esther Dyson as well as institutions like Kaiser Permanente Ventures Novartis Ping An and GuideWell. Notable exits include Conversa Health (acquired by AmWell) Doctor.com (acquired by Press Ganey) and RespondWell (acquired by Zimmer Biomet).

“StartUp Health’s Alzheimer’s Moonshot will initially invest in and support 30–50 companies that are focused on eradicating this disease” said Unity Stoakes President and Co-founder of StartUp Health. “We believe the way to speed up progress is to organize a global army of Health Transformers focused on this dedicated mission. This is why each team that receives investment also gets ongoing support from StartUp Health’s global platform a combination of community-driven entrepreneurial coaching and a dedicated media platform that provides unique access to a global network and audience of health innovation customers investors partners and decision-makers.”

In addition to making strategic investments into Alzheimer’s innovations the Alzheimer’s Moonshot will provide regular updates on the progress towards ending Alzheimer’s including portfolio company news unique research insights and events.

Finally the launch of StartUp Health’s Alzheimer’s Moonshot is a call for partnership. Entrepreneurs who are innovating in the Alzheimer’s ecosystem are encouraged to apply to StartUp Health and join the firm’s global army of thousands of Health Transformers working to achieve health moonshots. If you’re an entrepreneur who believes that we need to leverage collaboration and moonshot thinking to deliver quality care to everyone in the world regardless of location or income we want to meet you.

This launch is also an invitation to investors and partners. If you believe in a collaborative global approach to eradicating Alzheimer’s disease and if you believe we are stronger together as an army of innovators and investors with a single health moonshot objective we want to hear from you.

For 2022 Richcreek welcomed back nine returning mentors from Depuy Zimmer-Biomet Paragon Medical and Dalton Foundries. Richcreek also recruited four new mentors to help students understand the design process for modifying vehicles to meet the needs of their client – five children who will benefit from this program to gain more independence.

With 16 middle school students four returning and 12 new Richcreek is excited to offer five vehicles to five toddlers who were nominated by Joe’s Kids; Joanne Dean a local early intervention occupational therapist with First Steps; and Stacey Ousley teacher at Lincoln Elementary School and Presby Preschool.

The toddlers and their families first met the students and mentors on Thursday Feb. 24. At that time Edgewood students and their mentors learned what the physical needs were and what the toddlers loved. The Jeeps will not only provide increased mobility for toddlers but will be customized with stickers fabrics and accessories to delight and individualize each vehicle. The goal is independence but parents will have remote controls while the toddlers learn to maneuver the new 12-volt vehicles. Families will return again at 4:30 p.m. Thursday March 24 for a final fitting and test drive. Further modifications will be made and then they’ll receive their vehicle during First Friday from 5-7 p.m. Friday May 6.

Warsaw Community Schools staff would like to thank all who supported this project with generous donations. For 2022 thanks go to the VFW; and to Nick Stouder a community member and a member of the Rotary Club who sponsored a Jeep.
